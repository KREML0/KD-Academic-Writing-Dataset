1	1	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that the impact of computers on people is highly beneficial in terms of learning and social interaction. They provide us with opportunities to chat with friends and make new acquaintances. Moreover, computers are excellent tools for learning about the world, including astronomy. They also keep us out of trouble by engaging us in productive activities. Just think about it. If your teenager is constantly on the phone with friends, do you have time to chat with your own friends or business partners? Now, with computers, there are numerous online platforms such as @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, Facebook, and MySpace where we can communicate. For instance, while you are setting up a meeting with your boss on the computer, your teenager can have a great time on the phone without the pressure of rushing off. Computers are also a wonderful way to learn about other countries and states. It's a new avenue to stay informed about current events. You might worry that your child spends too much time on the computer, but if you ask them questions about the economy, sea - floor spreading, or events from @DATE1, you'll be amazed at their knowledge. In my opinion, using a computer is far more interesting than sitting in class all day reading from books. It's much safer for your child to be at home on the computer or at a local library rather than being out with friends, potentially getting into trouble or being pressured into doing something wrong. You wouldn't want to find your child in a hospital bed due to a drive - by. Instead, having your child on the computer, learning, chatting, or playing games in the safety of your home or community is a great option. In conclusion, computers have a profound positive impact on us and our children. They offer us time to socialize, help us learn about the world, and keep us out of harm's way. I hope you can understand and agree with my view. Thank you for your attention.
2	2	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am of the opinion that computers bring us a multitude of benefits. Firstly, they enable us to communicate and make friends through platforms like Facebook and MySpace. We can connect with people from all over the world, expanding our social circles. Computers are also a treasure trove of information. They allow us to access coordinates, locations, and an infinite amount of knowledge. In the professional realm, they are invaluable. For example, we can create house plans or type a @NUM1 - page report for work in a fraction of the time it would take to write it by hand. Let's delve into the world of technology. Using a computer enhances our social lives. Many individuals have accounts on MySpace, Facebook, and AIM, which facilitate conversations and friendships. Some people think computers are bad, but how else can we make friends if we can't communicate with them? I am truly grateful to have a computer that supports both my academic work and my social life. Computers are essential for finding locations and coordinates. If we didn't use the internet frequently, we wouldn't know how to access websites like @LOCATION1 that help us with such tasks. When on vacation in @LOCATION2, would you rather rely on a computer or be lost in @LOCATION3? The internet is a vast repository of information. You can find answers to almost any question. When it comes to work, would you prefer to draw a house plan on a computer quickly or spend @NUM1 hours doing it by hand with messy eraser marks? Also, when applying for a job, writing a @NUM3 - word essay can be a daunting task. But with a computer, it can be done much more efficiently. In conclusion, computers are indispensable in today's world. They help us chat with friends, find information, and perform work - related tasks. I hope this essay has influenced your view on computers, as they are truly remarkable machines. The other day, I showed my mom how to use a computer, and she was extremely impressed. So, go ahead and get a computer to enhance your life.
3	3	1	2	Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, the use of computers is on the rise, yet opinions on their impact on society are divided. Some people believe that technological advancements, especially in the form of computers, have a positive influence on people, while others hold different views. In today's world, a large number of people use computers, either for work or for entertainment. Computers are one of humanity's greatest achievements. They are beneficial in numerous ways, such as providing access to @CAPS4, news, and live streams. I understand that some people spend excessive time on computers and should be more involved in face - to - face interactions. However, it's not our place to dictate their behavior. When I grow up, I aspire to be an author or a journalist, and I know for sure that both professions require extensive use of computers. Some experts claim that people are spending too much time on computers and not enough time exercising, enjoying nature, or interacting with family and friends. But we don't know the reasons behind people's computer usage, and it's not really our concern. In fact, computers facilitate a great deal of interaction. They keep many kids off the streets and out of trouble. Additionally, they assist the @ORGANIZATION1 in locating most - wanted criminals. In summary, computers are far more useful to society than we might initially think. They bring significant benefits and play an important role in our lives. I hope more people can recognize their value.
4	4	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1, I am aware that many experts argue that computers do not benefit our society. While this may be true in some cases, studies generally show that computers are extremely helpful. Although nothing can replace in - person communication, technologies like webcams and email come very close. @PERCENT1 of students with good grades refer to reliable websites for research or to find good books. Online catalogs and advertisements also contribute to the global economy of stores. If people were not allowed to use computers, much of the modern world as we know it would not exist. @PERSON1 once said that the computer is the best form of modern communication because it allows us to write, talk, and respond at a much lower cost. Almost every event I attend is planned through computer - based communication like email. If a student is sick and misses homework or needs help studying for a test, email is the best way for them to contact their teacher. Even the post office relies on computers. The president of the post office, @PERSON2, stated that ""it would be impossible to deliver mail to our customers if it weren't for computers that tell us where a zip code is or how heavy a box is."" Media outlets that inform people about global events would not exist without the modern communication capabilities provided by computers. Information and research can be communicated rapidly. When a poll was taken in the country of @LOCATION2, @PERCENT2 of people used computers for any type of research. Among them, @PERCENT3 were students in school, and @PERCENT4 of these students had good grades. A similar survey in @LOCATION1 showed that @PERCENT5 of people used computers for various reasons, and @PERCENT2 were students with good grades. I wouldn't have gotten an A+ on my @CAPS7 assignment if I couldn't access documents in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 online. Imagine if newspaper reporters suddenly couldn't use the internet to work on their reports. The articles would likely be published @NUM1 after the events. Most businesses, including newspapers, use the internet for advertising, shopping, and reading. The association of @ORGANIZATION1 reported that @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 used a website, and @PERCENT5 of them were in good positions. The president of @CAPS8 @NUM2 imports said they use an online catalog because it's cheaper and can also promote environmental protection and customer convenience. Small @ORGANIZATION1 can create websites to promote themselves to potential customers. @PERSON3, the owner of @ORGANIZATION2, said the internet saved her restaurant. If it weren't for the internet, @NUM3 more people would be jobless in @LOCATION3. In conclusion, computers are essential for everyday people. Without them, most of our conveniences would disappear. They facilitate global communication, support research, and contribute to the economy."
5	5	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1, I am convinced that computers have a positive impact on people. They bring families closer together, enhance education, and offer great convenience. Computers are a gateway to the future, and we should make the most of them. In terms of family connection, the internet and email allow us to stay in touch with relatives. My family, who lives @NUM1 hours away by car, loves communicating with me via email. It's also convenient when the family is looking for a board game. Instead of making calls everywhere, they can simply search online. And if a family wants to participate in an activity and needs the contact number, the internet provides the information quickly. This way, more families can engage in activities together. Computers are also a boon for education. With a wealth of information at our fingertips, more people are motivated to learn. They are an alternative way to attend college. If a student is sick and can't go to school, they can access the necessary materials with a click of a button. In @LOCATION2, many classrooms can't afford computers. But if the children had one, it would revolutionize their learning. They could explore different countries and gain a broader perspective. Finally, computers offer unparalleled convenience. In today's busy world, we prefer to avoid going out or talking to people in person when possible. Computers enable video conferencing, which is useful for work communication. This can lighten our workload and make our lives easier. We can also book flights, vacations, and rentals with just a click. In conclusion, computers are an essential part of our lives. They strengthen family bonds, improve education, and provide convenience. We should fully embrace their benefits.
6	6	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1, I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on us. In America, @NUM1 people have access to a computer daily, and @NUM2 people use it for at least an hour. This means that @NUM3 people who could be exercising are instead wasting time and are at risk of physical @CAPS1. Does that seem acceptable to you?  Consider the process of writing a letter. One has to get up, gather all the necessary materials, sit back down to write, then put the materials away, place the letter in the mailbox, and walk back. This is a physical activity. In contrast, writing an email only requires sitting down and moving one's fingers. The difference is clear.  Instead of taking a good walk to a friend's house to have a conversation, people now simply sit in front of the computer. Moreover, one can literally be at risk from using a computer. Computers give away personal information, which can lead to various problems and potentially result in the loss of everything one has. All this just for the sake of going online.  Believe it or not, spending too much time on the computer can cause physical harm. For instance, like what happened to my grandpa, sitting in a wooden chair in front of a computer all day can lead to arthritis in the muscles. In conclusion, the negative effects of computers on our physical and daily lives are evident, and we should be more cautious about our computer usage.
7	7	1	2	In today's society, an increasing number of people rely on computers for safety, natural education, and social interaction. In my view, this growing dependence on computers does not benefit society.  First, using a computer poses a risk to one's safety. When chatting on a computer, people often have no idea who is on the other end. For example, a young girl playing a game on the computer might be approached by a predator. She won't know until it's too late. Additionally, studies show that @PERCENT1 of people's information has been more widely exposed in the last @NUM1 years due to new chat websites like MySpace and Facebook. By sharing personal information on these platforms, people put their safety at risk. Therefore, to ensure safety, people should reduce their computer usage.  Second, in a world filled with beautiful landscapes, waters, forests, and valleys, experiencing nature firsthand is essential. Relying on a computer to learn about the world is not enough. People should go outside to feel, smell, and even taste nature. A recent study found that those who visited the Grand Canyon could write a @NUM1 - page essay about their experiences, while those who only read about it on the computer could not. Society should step away from computers and engage with nature.  Third, excessive computer use can ruin a person's social life. People often spend too much time on the computer instead of with family and friends. Although online chatting is possible, it cannot replace face - to - face communication. Also, if an embarrassing picture is posted on the computer, it can have long - lasting negative effects, potentially leading to the loss of friends.  In conclusion, the increasing use of computers has numerous negative impacts on society. I encourage you to agree that computers can endanger safety, limit natural education, and damage social life.
8	8	1	2	@PERCENT1 of people, including myself, believe that computers simplify life. Using computers offers several important benefits. It helps develop hand - eye coordination, enables people to learn about distant places and cultures, and facilitates online communication.  Hand - eye coordination is a crucial skill. When using a computer, while looking at the screen, one moves the mouse precisely where needed. This activity strengthens hand - eye coordination, which is useful in many aspects of life. For example, in sports like baseball, hand - eye coordination is vital. It is also important for activities like taking notes. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 doctors agree that good hand - eye coordination is essential for a healthy life.  Many people, like @PERSON1, a science teacher at @ORGANIZATION1, want to know about the places they are visiting and have up - to - date information. Computers provide a wealth of information about different parts of the world, which is often more comprehensive and current than what some books offer. They are also great for learning about various cultures and traditions.  Communication is another area where computers shine. I recall when our phone broke at home when I was about @NUM2, and we couldn't get a new one right away. The computer allowed us to communicate with family and friends via email, explaining why we weren't answering the phone. At work, emailing information to colleagues is faster and easier than talking on the phone or in person, according to @NUM4 out of @NUM2 employees.  In conclusion, computers make life easier by teaching hand - eye coordination, enabling communication, and providing information about the world. I urge you to share this view and write to your local newspaper to spread the positive message about computers.
9	9	1	2	Dear reader, @ORGANIZATION1 has significantly influenced human life, with the computer being one of the most notable inventions. The computer has transformed the way we live by facilitating shopping, communication, and entertainment.  In terms of shopping, the computer has made it incredibly convenient. Suppose you open your refrigerator and find it nearly empty, but the car is in use and the grocery store is far away. You can simply go online and find great deals on food, and some companies even offer free delivery. You're not limited to food; you can buy toys for kids, hats for friends, curtains for your room, and much more with just a few clicks.  Regarding communication, the computer has revolutionized the way we connect with others. If someone wants to talk to a friend or relative in another country but doesn't have a phone or can't make a call, the computer provides a solution. By using an email address, one can communicate instantly with anyone around the world. Friends and families can chat easily by typing their messages.  When it comes to entertainment, the computer offers a wide range of options. Whether it's watching a movie from the comfort of your home, listening to music, watching fun videos, or playing games, there's something for everyone. There are thousands of online games, including educational ones that kids love.  In conclusion, the computer is a revolutionary device that has changed the way we shop, communicate, and enjoy entertainment. The ability to accomplish so much with just a few clicks is truly remarkable. It makes one wonder what more we can achieve with technology in the future.
10	10	1	2	In @LOCATION1, we have access to computer technology. While some believe that computers are beneficial to society, I disagree. I think they have a negative impact for several reasons, including obesity, cramps, sexual harassment, and cyberbullying.  Firstly, a sedentary lifestyle due to excessive computer use can lead to obesity. Imagine a child who has never gone to school and weighs @NUM1 pounds. If the only activity the child engages in is playing on the computer, they will surely gain weight.  Secondly, many kids and teens who spend long hours on the computer are prone to cramps. They can get cramps from typing too fast, hard, and for too long. Sitting in one place for an extended period and then trying to get up can also cause painful cramps.  Thirdly, sexual harassment is a significant problem in online chat rooms. Approximately @PERCENT1 of the time, when teens and even parents enter chat rooms, they may encounter someone making fun of them, which makes them angry and upset.  Finally, cyberbullying is another serious issue. It occurs when someone bullies others online. Children may become poor or sick because they are afraid of being cyberbullied. For example, a child attending school online may be bullied for not being smart enough or not having enough money. This kind of bullying can have a severe impact on a child's well - being.  In conclusion, the negative effects of computers, such as obesity, cramps, sexual harassment, and cyberbullying, are not to be taken lightly. It's important for us to consider these impacts and decide whether computers truly benefit society. Now, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this matter.
11	11	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I firmly believe that computers detract from people's lives and are less significant than other aspects of life. Firstly, the world is facing an obesity epidemic due to a lack of exercise, and computers play a substantial role in this. People tend to sit on their couches and use computers instead of engaging in physical activity, which hinders efforts to improve America's physical health. Moreover, computer use can become a habit and then an addiction. If a person uses a computer daily, they may find it difficult to stop. Additionally, when using computers, people often overlook the lack of exercise they are getting.  Secondly, @CAPS3 warming is a serious problem, and computers contribute to it. They consume electricity, which in turn melts the polar ice caps. If this trend continues, the ice caps will completely melt, leading to the loss of shorelines and widespread flooding across half of the world. The high popularity of computers exacerbates the issue.  Finally, computers have a negative impact on family life. There is an increasing number of family break - ups, and scientists state that @PERCENT1 of the time, it is due to technology. When one family member is engrossed in the computer, others may feel neglected, leading to the breakdown of the family unit.  In conclusion, it is evident that computers are detrimental. They are causing obesity in America, contributing to @CAPS3 warming and potential global flooding, and disrupting family life, leading to unhappiness. These reasons clearly show that computers are not as important as other elements of human society.
12	12	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I read your argument about computers and I am of the opinion that they have a positive impact on people. Firstly, computers offer a wide range of possibilities. For example, if you live in Maine and your cousin lives in California, you can have a video chat with them. Secondly, computers enable you to access news from anywhere in the world. Even when you're stuck on a plane and bored, you can use your computer. At work, you can use it to get your tasks done. Regarding the claim that computers reduce exercise, some people actually use computers to track their running speed, distance, and even their diet.  Thirdly, many people's jobs rely on computers. When you wrote this article, you didn't use a typewriter; you used a computer and printed it out. Without computers, your work would be much more difficult.  Thank you for considering my thoughts. I hope you will take these three reasons into account when re - evaluating your stance on computers.
13	13	1	2	My approach for this newspaper article is to state my opinion on the effects of computers and provide detailed reasons to persuade the local newspaper to agree with me. My opinion is that computers are a waste of time. Many people, especially those who are overweight, waste time on computers instead of going out to run or exercise. They should also spend time with their girlfriends, families, or friends for fun. Spending too much time on the computer is bad, especially for kids who may watch inappropriate content meant for adults.  My reasons for this view are that there is a lot of harmful content on the computer, such as porn. Many kids watch this, which ruins their morals and future. They can become addicted to such content. However, there are also people who use computers for good things like educational games.  It's good to use the computer, but not for extended periods. Instead, people should go out, play, and exercise to enjoy life. The computer is used for everything these days, but we should be aware of its negative aspects.  In conclusion, I've stated my opinion on the effects of computers, provided detailed reasons, and organized my ideas clearly. I hope the newspaper will understand the negative effects of computers and agree with my stance.
14	14	1	2	In today's world, everyone should use computers as they have a positive impact on people. Computers help develop hand - eye coordination. They also allow people to learn about distant places and individuals. Moreover, they provide a platform for online communication.  Computers are like an enormous global knowledge base. You can look up information about far - off locations, and all the details you need will be right in front of you. They are fast and user - friendly, making them accessible to everyone.  Nowadays, kids are highly addicted to computers. There are numerous websites that kids and teens frequent, such as @CAPS1 and Facebook. Even ten - year - olds are chatting with friends and posting pictures on these platforms. There are also web - chat websites that let you use a webcam to talk to people anywhere in the world.  In conclusion, computers are an excellent means of connecting with others. Therefore, every household should have a computer.
15	15	1	2	"Dear @LOCATION1, while many @CAPS1 people recognize the significant advancements that computers bring, they also expose us to several disadvantages. Computers have been linked to various health issues. As individuals become more immersed in the online world, they tend to interact less with their families. We must not overlook the threat of online predators, who can be extremely dangerous.  Just as those who only watch television are often called ""couch potatoes,"" those glued to their computer screens are no better. Numerous top doctors in @LOCATION2 have stated that excessive computer use can damage your health. Doctors worldwide emphasize the importance of exercise, but a computer addict may only be typing vigorously. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to obesity, which often causes depression. Addiction itself is a serious health concern, and it wouldn't be surprising if rehab centers add a computer - related wing in the near future.  These problems are gradually spreading, and we need to unite to eliminate them. Family time is a cherished value among @CAPS2 people, but computers are currently ruining this tradition. With so many @CAPS1 people preoccupied with online drama, friends, and video games, family interaction is on the decline. People are detaching from reality and entering the virtual world of cyberspace. They may only leave their rooms to use the bathroom or eat, with little rest in between. This can cause significant tension or sadness within @CAPS1 families.  Online predators are not only highly dangerous but also very cunning. Your children could be chatting with someone they think is a fellow teenager seeking a friend, when in fact, it could be a forty - year - old serial killer waiting for the right moment to strike. Studies indicate that one - fourth of online users have encountered a dangerous person.  In conclusion, we must be aware of the negative impacts of computers on health, family life, and personal safety. By taking collective action, we can mitigate these problems and ensure a healthier and more balanced lifestyle."
16	16	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, the computer powered on, and the screen displayed an image of a blonde - haired girl. Thanks to this actual @CAPS1 girl's explanations, it was easy to learn about life in @LOCATION2. One couldn't obtain such valuable information and human interaction by simply going to the library. If society wishes to grow and expand, computers are a necessity. They should be supported as they teach hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about distant places, and allow online communication.  First, computers aid in teaching hand - eye coordination. Hand - eye coordination is a useful skill for excelling in sports. In a recent survey, @PERCENT1 of kids reported an improvement in their hand - eye coordination after using computers. Even simple actions like typing can enhance this skill. Famous neurologist @CAPS2 @PERSON1 stated in an article last week that “@CAPS3 and computer strengthen the @CAPS2. When using a computer, one automatically translates what the eyes see into commands for the hands.” Improved hand - eye coordination can benefit people in sports such as baseball and basketball. To become better at these sports, one only needs to turn on the computer. As people improve in sports, they are more likely to play and become healthier. In fact, computers can assist with exercise rather than hinder it.  Secondly, computers allow people to access information about far - off places and people. To research @LOCATION1, one simply needs to type in a search query, and a vast amount of information will be presented, with endless links to explore. Moreover, the ability to learn about different cultures can increase people's tolerance. Computers are a valuable tool that can assist people in various aspects of life.  Lastly, computers and technology enable people to chat. Computer chat and video chat can help people from different nations understand each other. When a story emerges about an event in @LOCATION3, people can go online and ask an actual @LOCATION3 citizen for their perspective. Additionally, video chat and online conversations can reduce expensive phone bills. In this economy, no one wants to pay more than necessary. Another advantage is that one can connect with family members they rarely visit, strengthening family bonds.  Clearly, computers are a useful aid in today's era. Their advancements drive the world forward. Computers are beneficial as they teach hand - eye coordination, enable learning about distant places and people, and facilitate online communication. Imagine a world without computers or technological advancements. The world would be fragmented, contact between people scarce, and information limited. The internet is like thousands of libraries combined. People would know little about other nations, and news would spread slowly. Is this the kind of world we want to live in?
17	17	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on people's lives. This is because those who spend excessive time on computers do not go out as often as they should, do not spend enough time with their families, and computers are not capable of doing everything.  My first reason is that people need to be more active outdoors. When they stay indoors using computers, they do not exercise, which is extremely unhealthy. Instead of watching sports games or checking scores online, they should participate in physical activities. I also believe that they should appreciate nature; otherwise, they are squandering the beauty that surrounds them. We should not waste our capabilities and privileges, right?  Another reason is the lack of family time. If family members are nearby, one should make the most of this and interact with them. Playing games or simply hanging out with family can be enjoyable and can enhance social skills, which computers cannot always achieve.  Computers are not all - encompassing. While some computer use is acceptable, becoming addicted to them can be dangerous. Although computers may contain a large amount of information, there is little that cannot be found in books. A computer cannot love a dog, for example. There are numerous activities such as sports, taking care of family, and pursuing hobbies that cannot be done on a computer.  It's important to remember that while computers can be useful at times, they cannot replace real - life experiences. Therefore, I believe we should reduce our computer time, spend more time outdoors, and have fun with our families.
18	18	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I have to say that the experts are right. I know people who spend all day on their computers, and in my opinion, it's not a good thing. Instead of using computers to learn about far - off places and talk to others, people should exercise, relax, and interact with their family and friends.  Exercising is far better than sitting in front of a computer. When you're sitting at a computer, playing online games or browsing, you get bored and hungry, and there are usually snacks nearby. Instead of spending @NUM1 or @NUM2 hours or even the whole day on a computer and gaining weight, there are many ways to exercise. You can take walks, go jogging, or play a sport. I know some people who work all day and still come home to their computers.  Rest is also important. You don't have to immediately turn on your computer. You can relax by watching a movie, eating popcorn, or even taking a short nap. You don't need to use your computer if it's not necessary.  In my view, family and computers will always be there, but family is more important. Friends may not always be reliable, and you only need a few true ones. Both family and true friends have feelings, and if you neglect them for the sake of a computer, something is wrong. Tomorrow is not guaranteed, so we should live for today.  We should enjoy life while we can, spend time being active with family and friends, and if we're really into computers, we should try to balance our time.
19	19	1	2	I agree with the advancement of technology. The progress of technology is helping to find a cure for diseases. Without technology, we would not have been able to reach the moon. Technology evolves as we make progress. People embrace technology for the betterment of life. Famous inventors, like Leonardo da Vinci with his flying machine, have used technology to make advancements. Technology is truly great. In conclusion, the continuous development of technology is crucial for human progress and the exploration of new frontiers. It has the potential to solve many of our problems and improve our quality of life.
20	20	1	2	Well, computers can be either good or bad. I really don't see how computers can be a bad thing for me. I also know that computers can and will help people all over the world. I believe that computers have positive effects on people like me.  Computers teach hand - eye coordination. They are also useful when you need to conduct research for a school project. You can create many things on computers, such as music, designer @CAPS1 - shirts, logos, banners, and other creative works. With a computer, you can search for available homes and apartments. You can even fill out job applications online, saving trips to stores. How cool is that!  I'm just an ordinary person, not rich or famous, but computers provide a wealth of information that people use every day. That's why I think computers have a positive impact on people, and you don't have to be extremely smart to use them. In summary, computers offer numerous benefits and are accessible to a wide range of people, making them a valuable asset in our lives.
21	21	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 daily, I am writing to discuss the issue of computers in today's society. While new discoveries are made daily by computer users, many believe computers are harmful to the community. I aim to convince you and society that computers are not as problematic as some claim.  Discoveries in our nation have advanced rapidly, benefiting society. These advancements are only possible with the help of computers. Without them, some diseases might have remained undiscovered, resulting in more deaths. Additionally, computers have improved medical care, often being the difference between life and death. They also enhance production rates of cars, household necessities, and other items.  On a dull, rainy night, new social - networking technologies can entertain the most bored and lonely individuals. Whether you want to talk to someone or find a special person, the internet makes it easy. Social networks like Twitter, MySpace, Facebook, and YouTube offer endless activities.  During the economic recession, finding a job is difficult, but the internet can expedite the process, sometimes two or three times faster. Many also use computers to streamline their work, especially with Microsoft tools.  I hope you and the community can recognize that computers help more than they harm. Thank you for your time and attention.
22	22	1	2	Dear local Newspaper @CAPS1, I propose taking all available computers and distributing them to people around the world. This way, they can stay at home and chat with their family and friends. Computers enable global connections, assist kids with their homework, and allow them to learn about events happening worldwide. In conclusion, the widespread use of computers can bring people closer and enhance learning opportunities.
23	23	1	2	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, have you ever seen a child glued to the computer for hours? I firmly believe this is extremely harmful to the child. It prevents them from exercising, having face - to - face interactions, and fully utilizing their mental capabilities. As society progresses, we become lazier and neglect these essential aspects.  Taking a step back from computer use could benefit society more. In the @LOCATION2, obesity rates among kids are at an all - time high. @PERCENT1 of kids in the @LOCATION3 admit to exercising only once a week and preferring computer time. This percentage represents more than @NUM2 of @CAPS2 children. Comparing with @CAPS3 children without access to this technology, the same @PERCENT1 exercise only once a week.   In @LOCATION3, @PERCENT2 of children are overweight, and @PERCENT3 develop heart or blood problems as adults. Exercise, such as playing with friends, biking, or jogging, is not difficult. If we spend more time on physical activities rather than on computers, we can reduce obesity rates and improve @CAPS2 as a whole.  Popular computer websites like @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS7 allow interaction with people, but they also pose risks. More than @NUM3 out of @NUM4 students in my school have accounts on these sites and post personal information. The crime rate has increased by @PERCENT4 due to these websites. Moreover, they erode social skills, as @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 students admit to saying things online they wouldn't say in person, leading to more problems in schools.  I've heard about suicides related to computers. I believe reducing computer use would lead to more family time, making our nation closer and safer. Computers limit our exploration of nature and real - life problem - solving. In conclusion, we need to balance our computer use to avoid these negative impacts.
24	24	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, I disagree with the view that computers don't benefit society. Computers offer several advantages, including improving hand - eye coordination, providing access to knowledge about foreign places, and facilitating online communication.  Some people are naturally gifted with hand - eye coordination, but for many, like me, computers have been a great help. According to @PERSON2, ""On average, computers can increase a person's hand - eye coordination by up to @PERCENT1."" Just by learning to type, one's hand - eye coordination can improve significantly. Good hand - eye coordination is beneficial in various aspects of life, from playing instruments and doing household chores to participating in sports. If more people use computers, the overall hand - eye coordination of the population will increase.  Consider @LOCATION1, a country in @LOCATION2 that most people know little about. By using the computer, one can become an expert on this country. The computer gives us access to a vast amount of knowledge, making us more aware of the world. This knowledge can enhance our travel experiences, allowing us to visit new and exciting places. It also helps us gain respect for other countries and their cultures. As @PERSON1 says, ""The internet gives us access to the world, and we can learn so many new things."" We can also learn about environmental preservation, which is crucial given the problem of global warming.  A recent study shows that @PERCENT2 of people don't have time to meet old friends. The internet has made it easy to stay in touch through websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4. These sites can maintain our social lives and even reunite us with old friends. For example, @CAPS2 can connect family members. Teens can also make new friends on sites like @CAPS7 and @CAPS8. It also boosts confidence as people can say things online they wouldn't say in person.  In conclusion, computers are not just ""mind - numbing"" devices. They improve hand - eye coordination, help us learn about the world, and enhance our social lives, benefiting society in numerous ways."
25	25	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, right off the bat, I believe computers are very helpful. They allow people to look up information and communicate with friends. While kids should spend time outdoors, the computer can be a great place for learning and interaction. Children should have the right to use the computer as long as they also make time to enjoy nature.  One reason students shouldn't be on the computer all the time is health. Computer addiction can affect a child's social interactions and may cause serious damage to their brain. However, children should still have access to computers because of the valuable information they can learn. Many kids go on to have careers in computer - related fields or use online education. The computer is a continuous source of intelligence, enabling people to learn, play, and discover.  Some people dream of building computers or creating new programs. All students should have the right to computer time, but they must also balance it with outdoor activities and time with friends. Everyone has different views on spending all day on the computer. I don't think kids should do this as it can harm their health and how others perceive them. In conclusion, a balanced approach to computer use is essential.
26	26	1	2	"Do you ponder whether computers are useless or believe they can be useful in numerous ways? I recall that when my older sister had to conduct research on a certain topic, the computer provided her with all the necessary information. The matter at hand is that while an increasing number of people use computers, not everyone concurs that this is beneficial to society. I firmly believe that computers do benefit society in many respects. Here's why: computers enable you to connect with friends, research people, places, or things, and unwind by enjoying a fun and entertaining website. Firstly, computers allow you to communicate with family or friends. If a friend has moved to a different state, you can easily reconnect directly from the computer. As one of my neighbors, @PERSON1, said, ""It's nice to send emails or pictures to friends, but doing it from the computer makes the task much faster!"" Secondly, you can research anything you desire, such as people, places, or things, and all relevant references will appear. Computers are excellent for researching projects or school assignments. I remember when my brother was working on his project; he found solutions to all his difficulties directly on the computer. Lastly, there are many exciting websites where you can relax and play. These websites can keep you occupied and prevent boredom. My younger cousin, @PERSON2, said, ""When I'm bored, I go on the computer and play games I find on @CAPS5.com."" It's true that some people may become addicted to computers, but you'll also learn interesting things about how the internet functions. Although not everyone agrees that the increasing use of computers benefits society, I strongly believe they do, as they facilitate communication, research, and entertainment. Now is the time to decide what you think. Call me, and we can discuss this further."
27	27	1	2	Computers are advantageous as they allow you to obtain information, play games, and access pictures. However, when using a computer, you might encounter something or someone malicious or a virus. If there is a virus, it's advisable to shut off the computer to prevent the situation from worsening. There are websites tailored for kids, including games, as well as those for teenagers and adults. Additionally, pictures can be inappropriate for kids as they often lead to improper content. You should only search for the information you need and avoid looking up things like weapons or knives. There are also different computer - related companies, such as @CAPS1&t and @CAPS2. @CAPS2 is a good place to purchase computers, and so is @CAPS1&t. In conclusion, while computers offer many benefits, users need to be cautious about the content they access and take appropriate measures to protect their devices.
28	28	1	2	"Dear Newspaper, computers have evolved from high - tech novelties to an everyday necessity and play a significant role in society. They have been enhanced to perform a multitude of tasks, and without them, we would struggle to accomplish much. Although it's true that kids should spend more time outdoors, computers are valuable as they teach kids new things. Currently, due to the prevalence of computers, kids rarely go outside. A large portion of the population in @LOCATION1, including kids, is obese, which may be related to their tendency to stay indoors and use computers. Kids need to go outside occasionally to get fresh air and exercise. Limiting their computer time and engaging in active games would be beneficial for their well - being. With the rapid development and adaptation of computers, kids often spend half of their day staring at the screen, playing flash games like RuneScape. Instead of wasting time on such games, they should go outside and do something active. However, computers also teach kids new things. For example, if you search for ""trees"" on Google, you'll find numerous websites with information about trees. Some games kids play also have educational value. My little sister goes on a site called Nickelodeon.com, and it teaches her things she didn't know before, which prepared her for kindergarten. Moreover, computers are very useful. If you want to know what's happening at work, you can simply click on Internet Explorer and check your email. You can also use social networking sites like Facebook to connect with friends or instant - messaging sites to chat with them. You can even play games for entertainment. But remember not to spend too much time on the computer. In summary, computers are a crucial part of our community, and life would be difficult without them. However, we should ensure that kids balance their computer use with outdoor activities."
29	29	1	2	Dear local newspaper, a large number of people around the world use or own computers. While some believe that computers are beneficial, others may hold a different view. Computers offer numerous advantages. One of the benefits is that they enable you to be more social by communicating with friends and family. Additionally, while using a computer, your hand - eye coordination can improve, and you can easily search for information without the need to go through numerous books. Chatting or talking online with friends and family is a significant advantage of computers. You may have a distant friend you haven't spoken to in a long time, and a computer allows you to reconnect. If you have a safe chat account, you can even make new friends, which is beneficial socially. It's always good to maintain relationships with friends and family. Some people find it challenging to play the piano because they can't coordinate looking at the music and moving their hands simultaneously. On a computer, your hand - eye coordination improves over time as you search for a topic while typing. This is also a great memory exercise for your fingers, as you eventually memorize the location of all the keys. People without computers have to search through many books to find information on a topic, while those with computers only need to type in the topic, and all the necessary information, including pictures and videos, will be right in front of them. Many people debate whether computers are good for you. In my opinion, computers are excellent for people. They allow people to be social, improve hand - eye coordination, and provide easy access to information. So, the question remains for you to decide: Are computers good for people?
30	30	1	2	Dear Newspaper People, I am of the opinion that computers bring benefits to society for several reasons. Firstly, computers simplify work. Typing on a computer is often faster than writing by hand and the text is always easier to read. Studies have shown that individuals who use computers for work complete their tasks more quickly and have up to @PERCENT1 more free time to pursue their interests. Moreover, with email, you can send your work to your boss without printing it, thus saving paper. Secondly, computers can solve difficult problems that people either can't handle or don't want to spend time on. For instance, when you need to solve math problems, you can use a calculator or a computer. I have a lot of math homework, and I find it much easier to use a calculator. Lastly, kids enjoy playing games on computers. Although some people think kids shouldn't play computer games, many of them are educational. Even non - educational games allow kids to have fun and look forward to something after finishing their work. @PERCENT2 of kids claim that they are happier when they have something enjoyable to anticipate, and happier kids tend to perform better in their studies. I sincerely hope that after reading this, you will recognize the significant contributions that computers make to society.
31	31	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are an undeniable advantage to our society. They facilitate communication through online video chats with family and friends, serve as an excellent tool for schoolwork and professional tasks, and offer entertainment for children. Computer games, such as Webkinz, even teach kids real - life skills like pet care.  One day, I was chatting on @CAPS2. Someone asked “@CAPS1 you have a @CAPS2?” and @CAPS3 @CAPS4, my @CAPS5, was part of the conversation. I asked them to friend - request me. That night, when I got home and checked @CAPS2, I had a new notification and was now friends with my @CAPS5 @CAPS4. My whole family uses @CAPS2, which is extremely useful for planning parties. Instead of writing invitations, I can type them in less than five minutes for my birthday party. I can also send invitations via email or @CAPS2 messages. Just yesterday, I got invited to a party on @CAPS2; creating an event and tagging friends is a breeze.  Webcamming with friends is another great benefit. “@CAPS14, @PERSON1! I love what you've done to your room, the pink wallpaper is so cute!” I said during a webcam session. @PERSON1 replied, “@CAPS15 you! I love your hair today. It's so pretty.” Webcamming is much easier than traveling to a friend's place, saving time, money, and my mom's time.  Computers also assist with schoolwork. Teachers often prefer typed reports because many students have messy handwriting. I type faster than I write, so I'm all for using computers for school. Moreover, they can help find jobs online and create impressive resumes. If I were applying for a professional position, I'd definitely type my resume.  In conclusion, computers are helpful, beneficial, important, and fun for our society.
32	32	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, my name is @PERSON1, and I'm a @ORGANIZATION1 citizen. I firmly believe that computers do not benefit society; in fact, they make our town worse.  Firstly, people spend an excessive amount of time on computers. Teens are on social networking sites, adults are in chatrooms, and kids are engrossed in computer games. This lack of physical activity is contributing to the high @PERCENT1 of overweight adults. If people reduced their indoor computer time and went outside, like playing in the park or taking a walk, this number could decrease significantly. Also, the internet has its risks, especially for children. We don't know who they're interacting with in chatrooms, and they need to be cautious about what they say and show online. Teens should be outside exercising instead of chatting with their partners or playing games.  Secondly, we're so preoccupied with checking our emails that we fail to appreciate the beautiful nature around us. On a nice @DATE1 or @DATE2 day, people should take their kids to a local park or pond. Last @DATE2, I went to my cousin's house. My aunt limited our screen time, including the computer, to one hour a day. We spent every day outside, even just looking at the clouds. This kept us active and allowed us to enjoy the environment.  Lastly, computers take away time from face - to - face interactions with family and friends. Although we can communicate with them online, it's not the same as a real conversation. For example, my sister is often on @CAPS2 when I get home. Instead of coming to talk to me, she texts me. We should call or invite our loved ones for in - person conversations.  In conclusion, computers are having a negative impact on @ORGANIZATION1 and everywhere else. People are spending too much time on them, neglecting nature, and losing real - life communication. If we don't address this issue, our society will face problems. So, what are we going to do about it?
33	33	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am of the strong opinion that the effects of computers on people are highly positive. Computers have a wide range of uses. They can be used to explore historical information, learn about influential people who have changed the world, and access a vast amount of knowledge.  For children, computers are a powerful learning tool. There are numerous websites that offer online tutoring and effective study methods to help students succeed in school. Online dating sites are also a positive aspect. They provide an opportunity to meet new people and enhance one's social life. Popular platforms like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 allow us to stay in touch with old friends and make new ones.  In my view, the best use of computers is online education. For instance, after graduating from college and becoming a nurse, one can pursue a higher degree, such as becoming a registered nurse instead of just an @ORGANIZATION2, through online courses.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people, offering learning opportunities, social connections, and educational advancement.
34	34	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1, there's a rumor going around that computers have a negative impact on children's lives, but I strongly disagree. Computers can assist kids in multiple ways, including helping with homework, enabling communication with friends, and facilitating school projects.  Homework is a significant part of school. If a child doesn't understand a problem or a social - studies question, there are websites on the computer that can provide guidance. The school web page has links to math games and science websites, which help students avoid getting stressed over homework.  A computer also plays a crucial role in a student's social life. Platforms like AIM, Facebook, and MySpace allow kids to interact with friends. If a child has a fight at school, they can come home and resolve the issue online. Moreover, teens can make new friends from other towns through the computer, which is beneficial for their personal growth.  When it comes to school projects, computers are a game - changer. Instead of rushing to the store to buy supplies, students can stay home, save money, and type their essays. They can print pictures and find information for social - studies or science projects. Looking up unfamiliar words is also easy. Computers save time and avoid the mess of drawing.  Everyone uses computers, and they help parents as much as children. They are invaluable for homework, socializing, and project - work. In conclusion, computers are one of the best technologies we have @DATE1.
35	35	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I wholeheartedly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Without them, our lives would be very different.  Computers teach hand - eye coordination. Although some say that computer use reduces exercise time, they actually improve throwing skills. This coordination is also essential for careers like surgery; surgeons need steady hands. So, computers clearly have a positive impact in this regard.  They also give people the ability to learn about any subject they're interested in. If someone wants to be an engineer, they can research everything they need to know for a successful career. Similarly, those aspiring to be doctors can find out about the years of college and med school required for a medical degree. With a computer, the learning possibilities are endless.  Another great advantage is communication. While traditional mail eventually gets to its destination, @CAPS3 - mail is free and arrives in minutes, unlike mail that can take weeks for long - distance delivery. For example, if someone comes from another country, they can use Skype to stay in touch with their childhood friends and see how they've changed. This is far better than just talking on the phone or sending letters.  In conclusion, computers teach hand - eye coordination, offer vast learning opportunities, and enable seamless communication, regardless of distance. There are no negative aspects that can outweigh these benefits. So, what's your take on it? Do you think computers are good for us, or should we use them less?
36	36	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, have you ever contemplated the impact of computers on individuals? It is, in fact, a highly negative one. Computers are among the primary factors contributing to children's lack of exercise and subsequent obesity. They can also have a detrimental effect on students' academic performance, and excessive use of the @CAPS6 isolates individuals from their loved ones.  Firstly, an increasing number of children are using computers far more frequently than is advisable. The consequence? Given the daily use of computers, particularly by young adolescents, there is a high likelihood of these children becoming obese. Research from renowned institutions such as @ORGANIZATION2 and @LOCATION2 has revealed that @PERCENT1 of children who spend over two hours on the @CAPS6 are either already obese or will gain weight as they grow older. After speaking with @PERSON1, a graduate from @LOCATION1, he mentioned that when children spend excessive time on the @CAPS6, they are merely fixating on a bright screen that can damage their eyes, rather than enjoying the outdoors. As a result, kids start accumulating body fat from sitting on the couch and staring at the @CAPS6 all day instead of engaging in physical activity.  Secondly, computers can have a negative impact on children's academic performance. After conversing with a current student at @ORGANIZATION1, she revealed that her grades have declined because she is overly preoccupied with @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc. She fails to focus on her @ORGANIZATION1 coursework as she should, and as a result, her grades have dropped from @NUM1's to low @NUM2's. This indicates that even high - achieving students are experiencing a decline in their academic performance due to excessive @CAPS6 use. Moreover, excessive @CAPS6 use and inattention to @ORGANIZATION1 work can also affect performance on @ORGANIZATION3's exams, demonstrating that constant @CAPS6 use impairs academic skills.  Finally, computers can harm children's social skills. Every time one logs into the computer, self - esteem tends to decrease as there is limited interaction with friends. One simply sits on a hard chair, staring at an electronic device that offers little in terms of real - life fulfillment. Additionally, excessive @CAPS6 use pushes loved ones away. If one continues to spend excessive time on the @CAPS6, they will end up not spending time with family and friends, and may even become cranky and rude when asked to step away from the device.  In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on many young individuals. They reduce the time available for exercise, harm academic performance, and impede social interaction. The question remains: do you believe computers have a negative or positive effect on people?
37	37	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I've become aware that some people think computers are bad for us, claiming they're a distraction to our physical and mental health. While I understand this perspective, I firmly believe that computers offer significant benefits to society.  Computers are a valuable learning tool. Sometimes, people learn on the computer without even realizing it. By simply visiting the @ORGANIZATION2 homepage, one can access global news feeds. People also deliberately go online to learn. For instance, if someone is considering a trip to @LOCATION1, a simple search will yield information on climate, seasonal weather, hotel options, and more. Moreover, many college students now have the option to take online courses, as some prefer the quiet of their own homes to the distractions of a traditional classroom.  Computers also facilitate communication. I recall in second grade when my best friend, @LOCATION2, moved away. I was heartbroken as we rarely spoke. However, our parents set up a video chat, and it felt like we were together again. This shows how useful technology can be for staying in touch with relatives and friends. Email is another excellent way to communicate. Sending a message is easy and can be done worldwide.  In addition, computers help with organization. I dislike clutter, and having numerous typed papers can be a hassle. However, using a computer ensures that work is saved and can be easily retrieved. File - saving is a foolproof way to keep files safe, and printing a hard copy is just a click away.  In summary, there are numerous reasons why using a computer is beneficial for society. It enables learning, helps us stay connected with friends and family, and keeps us organized. I'm sure many people would agree. What's your opinion?
38	38	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, in today's society, more and more people, including myself, are using computers. In my opinion, the computer is one of the greatest inventions. However, some so - called ""experts"" fail to recognize its benefits and believe that spending time on the computer is a bad idea.  Computers offer a wealth of information. This is extremely useful for school - going children who need to find information for projects. It can also be used for studying when textbooks are insufficient. Students looking for local jobs can search for employment opportunities online.  Communication is another area where computers shine. If you have a long - lost relative, you can easily find them on the internet. Online communication is also great for chatting with schoolmates about homework. Even online dating is an option for those who are too lazy to go out.  One of my favorite features of the computer is its navigation function. If you forget the location of a relative's house, you can simply enter your address and theirs to get directions. This method can be used for almost any destination.  If this doesn't convince you that the computer is an amazing piece of technology, then you're missing out. The computer is like a magical box with endless possibilities. I strongly recommend getting one."
39	39	1	2	Dear local newspaper, while many people use computers daily, not everyone believes that they benefit society. Those who support technological advancements think computers have a positive impact, and in some cases, I understand this view. However, upon closer examination, I believe that spending too much time on computers is not a good idea.  Firstly, exercise is a much better use of time. Taking a walk around the neighborhood or going on a hike with friends is a great way to spend an evening. Going to the gym is also an excellent option. It helps keep you fit, healthy, and strong. In contrast, sitting in front of a computer all day, eating without exercise, can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and health problems. No one wants to become lazy and unfit.  Secondly, we should enjoy nature. God's creation of nature is the most beautiful thing in the world. We should not let it go to waste. We can jump off a waterfall, go to the park, or simply feel the wind on our faces. We should make our imaginations come alive and appreciate the beauty of nature.  Finally, we should interact with our family and friends. Spend time with them by watching movies, going for ice - cream, or going to the mall. Water parks like Six Flags, or places like Nomads or Chuck E. Cheese are great for spending quality time with loved ones. These activities can strengthen our relationships.  In conclusion, sitting in front of a computer screen all day is a waste of time. We could be exercising, enjoying nature, or interacting with our family and friends. Technology can hold us back from experiencing the real joys of life. Thank you for reading my letter, and I hope you consider my perspective.
40	40	1	2	Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1. I'm @NUM1 years old and I attend Naylor School. I'm writing to convince you that computers have a positive impact on people.  Computers allow us to communicate with people all over the world. My brother uses the computer to talk to our family in @LOCATION1. I like using Skype because we can use a webcam to stay in touch with family in @CAPS1.R.  They also help develop hand - eye coordination. This has been beneficial for me in ping - pong, as the skills I use to watch the ball on the computer translate to the real game.  In addition, computers provide access to a vast amount of information. My mom found a job through the computer. Everyone can access weather and news updates.  It's true that some people argue that computers lead to a lack of exercise, addiction, obesity, and can affect personal relationships. However, despite these drawbacks, I believe the benefits outweigh the negatives.  In conclusion, computers are a valuable asset to society. They enhance communication, aid in skill development, and provide access to information. I hope more people recognize the positive impact of technological advancements as technology continues to evolve.
41	41	1	2	I believe computers are beneficial as they enable us to communicate with friends and family. Moreover, people rely on computers when searching for jobs. However, some individuals spend excessive time on computers instead of focusing on their homework. It is essential that people address this issue and find a balance.
42	42	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, I am of the opinion that computers have a negative impact on people's ability to connect with others. This is because they are often glued to their computers and rarely venture outside. Firstly, prolonged computer use can damage eyesight. I know people who have complained of eye pain after using the computer for an extended period. Studies indicate that @PERCENT1 of long - term computer users are more likely to lose their eyesight compared to those who spend all day outdoors. Secondly, individuals who stay indoors using electronics all day are less likely to develop good people skills. Poor people skills may result in having few friends, and in times of need, communication with friends is likely to be over the computer, where one cannot truly know the other person. Additionally, staying indoors all day means not getting proper exercise, which can be harmful to oneself and others. Thirdly, those who sit inside on the computer all day and never come out may be ridiculed by others. They are also more likely to fail in school as they neglect their homework and projects in favor of computer games. Moreover, they are more likely to have conflicts with parents or guardians as they are constantly on the computer, and their family rarely sees or hears from them. This can also prevent family members from paying bills online, which can have negative consequences for everyone. In conclusion, these are some of the reasons why I believe computers can be detrimental. Thank you.
43	43	1	2	In my view, the impact of people using computers is not negative at all. Computers are a great source of learning. Typing on a computer exercises your fingers, builds finger muscles, and helps you type without looking at the keyboard. When writing letters, you can simply type and print instead of using a pencil, saving you hours of writing. Moreover, computers are extremely helpful for research. For instance, if you want to research @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1, you can find almost all the information with just a click. Computers save time and do a great deal of work. They are truly one of the most useful pieces of technology.
44	44	1	2	Nowadays, people, especially kids, are spending an excessive amount of time on computers. This over - indulgence has several negative consequences. First, it reduces the time available for interaction with family and friends. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of kids spend @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours on the computer. I once spent @NUM3 hours on my computer on @CAPS1, and I know many kids who frequent @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and iTunes. My friend spent @NUM4 hours on these websites. Second, kids who spend a lot of time on the computer often get bad grades. @PERCENT2 of such kids forget to study for tests. I once failed a test after spending all night on the computer, and my friend forgot to do his homework because he was having too much fun on it. Third, being on the computer for long periods makes kids tired. @PERCENT3 of kids are so exhausted after using the computer that they can't do anything. I took a nap after a long computer session, and @PERCENT4 of kids forget their after - school plans. One kid even blew off his plans with friends due to tiredness. In conclusion, the excessive use of computers by kids leads to bad grades, exhaustion, and a lack of social interaction. Immediate action is needed to address this problem.
45	45	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, you might think computers aren't helpful for research, but if you really consider it, they are extremely useful. You don't necessarily gain weight just by using a computer, and you can definitely communicate with kids, friends, and family members through it. You can't be certain that books contain all the information you need for a school project or your family history. While books may cover the history of wars and heroes, try finding your first family ancestor in a book. Computers are the reason we know about our history, actors, slaves, sergeants, and much more. Have you ever gained weight just from spending too much time on the computer? I haven't gained a single pound since I started using the computer. You can't assume that a person on the computer isn't looking for diet foods or eating healthily. Also, think about those large phone bills for long - distance calls. Why do we have internet websites like MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, and MSN? Most of my family members live in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4, and @LOCATION2, and a one - minute long - distance call costs about ten dollars. In contrast, you can be on the internet all day and pay the same price. So, the choice is yours: pay over thirty dollars for a long - distance call or stay on the computer. You can also choose between getting bad grades from poor research or using the computer effectively. Decide whether to talk to family and friends on the phone and pay high bills or chat on the web for as long as you want at the same cost.
46	46	1	2	The time spent on computers is necessary as it provides valuable information, enhances intelligence, and improves hand - eye coordination. Firstly, computers offer a vast amount of information about places, people, and cultures. Learning this useful information takes time, so the time invested on computers is well - spent. Secondly, computers help us become smarter. For instance, if one needs help with fractions, math websites on the computer can offer assistance. In the long run, it's about intellectual growth rather than just physical exercise. Finally, using a computer teaches good hand - eye coordination. It aids in typing, making us faster at writing essays and reducing typing errors. In conclusion, a significant amount of computer time is needed due to these benefits, and perhaps even more time could be dedicated to it as it not only makes individuals smarter but also benefits society.
47	47	1	2	I believe that the internet and computers are more of an advantage to society than a problem. They are beneficial for school - related tasks such as projects and email communication. Nowadays, one can even pursue a college degree online. People also use the internet for media consumption and to stay in touch with friends. One of the most crucial reasons for having a computer is for educational purposes. For example, when working on a project, a computer can be used to gather notes or create a PowerPoint presentation. Teachers also benefit from computers as they can use them to teach classes in an engaging and understandable way. The increasing use of computers has revolutionized the way of obtaining a college degree. One can simply lie in bed, turn on a laptop, and take college classes. In my opinion, it's far more comfortable to study at home than to commute to a campus regularly. Email has made our lives easier. It can inform us about school events like early dismissals and is a great way to reconnect with high - school friends. Additionally, about @PERCENT1 of computer users use them for media and entertainment, such as gaming or watching YouTube. I hope this article can be included in your newspaper to show that computers are helpful tools, not something that will make the world obese. Obesity is a result of people's lifestyle choices, not the computers themselves.
48	48	1	2	Have you ever lost track of time while on the computer? You start at @TIME1 pm and suddenly it's 7 pm. People should spend less time on the computer. Firstly, they should be outside enjoying the fresh air and playing sports instead of being glued to a screen all day. Research shows that 72% of kids who spend excessive time on the computer are overweight. On a beautiful day, being on the computer is like ignoring the beauty of nature. Secondly, computer time takes away from family and friends. Time passes quickly when on the computer, and a whole day can be wasted. Your family members won't be around forever. As my grandma once said to my mom, “They grow up so fast. They're adults in a blink of an eye.” Nearly @PERCENT1 of parents share this sentiment. You might soon be off to college or move away for work. So, cherish time with your loved ones. Thirdly, there are other ways to look up information. There are countless books on every imaginable topic. Using books to find information helps develop skills like using an index. Also, instead of relying on the internet, one can visit a place to learn about it. For example, if doing a report on @LOCATION2, a family trip there would be a great learning experience. In conclusion, people should reduce computer time and spend more time outdoors, with family, and in interesting places. Why stare at a screen all day when there's so much fun to be had?
49	49	1	2	I'm writing this letter to discuss how computers impact people. Computers have numerous advantages and positively affect people worldwide. They teach many skills, including hand - eye coordination. When typing, one learns to see and react better, improving visual perception. Computers also provide access to information about people across the globe. Celebrities are highly popular on computers and other technologies, but computers are often better at helping us learn. Whatever information is available on other technologies, there's a high chance it can be found on a computer. In some aspects, computers outperform other technologies. Computers are essential for communication. Without them, we would struggle to interact with each other. For example, if we don't have a phone, we can communicate via email on the computer. We can reconnect with old friends, view long - unseen images and videos, and get up - to - date news. In conclusion, the world would be very different without computers. Many technologies that are not as good as computers might not be as popular without the foundation that computers have laid. It makes one wonder what the world would be like without them.
50	50	1	2	Computers are the most remarkable tool humanity has ever had. They provide access to more information than any other source in the world. With just a click of a button, we can connect to far - off places. Without computers, modern planes and cars would not exist. This very text probably wouldn't have been created either. Given the vast amount of knowledge and opportunities that computers offer, it's impossible to spend too much time on them because there's so much to learn and do in a lifetime. In conclusion, computers are indispensable, and the time spent on them is well - justified by the endless possibilities they present.
51	51	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, have you ever found yourself needing to get somewhere without a map or a GPS nearby, and the only available tool was a computer? In such a situation, I recommend using the computer to search for your destination. Computers are extremely useful in everyone's daily lives. They contain a vast amount of facts and interesting information. For instance, if you're trying to figure out someone's address, simply go on Google and type it in.  Computers also offer great communication capabilities. Have you ever thought about a friend or a special person you haven't seen in a long time and missed them? Most computers are equipped with cameras, allowing you to have video chats or regular chats online. This is far better than just making a phone call. If you want to see a picture of the person, they can easily send it to you via a chat page or email. It's much more efficient than sending a picture by mail, which can take days.  Moreover, computers are helpful for checking the weather. Instead of relying on the TV, where weather information may pass by quickly and be difficult to follow, you can type in the weather forecast for a week on a computer. The information will stay on the screen, enabling you to view the entire week's forecast at your own pace, regardless of the lighting conditions.  While some people advocate getting off the computer and going for a walk in nature, I agree with this view. However, people and children can still get exercise by walking around the house or going out shopping.  Computers also offer convenient shopping options. If you see clothes or shoes online that you want to buy but don't want to travel to the mall, which may be half an hour away from your home, you can simply make the purchase online, and the items will be shipped to your doorstep without you having to lift a finger.  In addition, computers have built - in dictionaries. If you're unsure about how to spell a word, you can type it in as best you can, and the computer will correct your spelling and provide the correct word. They also have pictures of almost everything. If you want to see what something looks like, just type it in, and you'll get a visual representation.  With all these facts, I hope you'll agree with me that computers are very helpful, nice, and safe.
52	52	1	2	Dear leaders of society, I am writing this letter to elaborate on the numerous benefits of computers. I firmly believe that the use of computers is highly advantageous, and here are my reasons.  Firstly, computers enhance focus and attention. When using a computer, one must concentrate, which in turn improves eyesight and hand - eye coordination. These are essential skills in today's world.  Secondly, computers can educate users about distant places. Depending on one's location, they can learn about various regions through online resources. People often visit these virtual places for vacation planning, as they can gather information about different destinations from the comfort of their homes.  Thirdly, computers offer excellent communication opportunities. There are numerous websites, such as IM, Skype, and Facebook, that allow users to communicate with friends as long as they are online. Additionally, a well - configured email system on a computer can be used for business purposes, informing users about machinery sales or other business - related matters.  In conclusion, computers are a great way to improve hand - eye coordination, learn about other states, communicate with friends, and conduct business. I hope you find my points convincing and join me in recognizing the value of computers.
53	53	1	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that some people oppose the excessive use of computers. However, in my opinion, the benefits of computers far outweigh the drawbacks.  Computers provide a wealth of information that may not be available in books. Search engines on the internet allow users to find relevant topics easily. The information retrieved can offer a different perspective on a subject, filling in the gaps that traditional books may leave. For example, many people spend a significant portion (@PERCENT1) of their online time on research, and they can now complete projects from home instead of going to the library.  Communication is another area where computers shine. People can interact with friends by chatting, sharing pictures, or playing games. I often play Xbox and communicate with my friends through it. Even in the business world, important figures like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 use computers for work, as quoted: ""I have a computer not for friends, but for work."" Moreover, computers can play a role in personal relationships. My mother met my father because he fixed her computer at work, which shows the potential of computers in bringing people together.  Computers are still in their early stages of development and will continue to improve. The advancement of technology is inevitable, and people will rely on computers more and more. The claim that ""computers eat your brain"" is baseless.  In conclusion, I urge you not to try to change people's habits. I firmly believe that if people want to use computers, they should be allowed to do so, considering the information they provide, the social connections they enable, and the continuous technological progress."
54	54	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper, I'm an @NUM1 grade student at @PERSON1. I read your article stating that people are spending too much time on computers, not getting enough exercise, and that it doesn't benefit society. I completely disagree with these views.  Computers are highly beneficial for students. Sometimes, kids forget their textbooks at school, but with a computer, they can search for the necessary information on Google and complete their homework, avoiding a zero grade. Additionally, the ""Study Island"" website offers online courses in math, reading, and science for students in @LOCATION1. These courses are time - consuming but contribute significantly to students' grades.  On a personal level, I love the piano. Since there are no piano instructors in my area, I use a computer program called ""Synewnisia"" to learn various songs on my keyboard or piano. This program helps improve hand - eye coordination and teaches discipline and dedication. There are also many other free instrument - learning programs available, which are beneficial for people who can't afford lessons. Learning an instrument can have long - term benefits in life.  Regarding the claim that people aren't getting enough exercise due to computer use, it's not entirely true. Many people use the computer to research diet plans or local gyms. For example, one day, the top search on Google was ""weight watchers diet plan."" My mother also uses an online video workout website for her back problems. So, computers can assist with both diet planning and physical therapy.  In conclusion, while we shouldn't spend excessive time on computers, they do benefit our society. Online learning can be time - consuming, but it helps people find the right diet and workouts to stay happy and healthy."
55	55	1	2	Are you skeptical about the benefits of computers? Let me tell you, computers are truly great, and here are @NUM1 reasons to prove it.  First, computers are a boon for students. Kids can do their homework on computers. If they forget their textbooks at school, they can easily find the answers online. Businessmen also rely on computers to store and manage all their important files.  Second, computers enable seamless communication. You can video chat with friends and family. If a friend or relative travels out of town, they can simply bring their laptop or use a webcam, and you can have a conversation whenever you want. This is also useful for companies. If a buyer is in a different country, they can use video chat to exchange all the necessary information.  Finally, computers are incredibly resourceful. There are hundreds of websites where you just need to type in what you want to know, and you'll get thousands of links to explore and find your answer. They are also great for finding pictures or creating PowerPoint presentations.  In conclusion, computers are wonderful because they help kids complete their homework, facilitate video chatting with loved ones, and provide a vast amount of resources. They are an indispensable part of our lives.
56	56	1	2	Over the past decade, the proportion of computer users has risen by approximately @PERCENT1. Suddenly, the world and its inhabitants have become reliant on the information computers offer. The diverse databases and resources, enhanced communication, and the skills computers enable one to demonstrate all prove that they are indispensable for this generation. Computer - based communication is beneficial as society can now interact with one another. Personally, I've been able to talk to and see my overseas family through advanced computer technology. Different communication programs include @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and e - mail, the most commonly used platform. Without access to a computer and its contents, residents find it difficult to integrate into the rest of society, whether it's for school events, sport schedules, or keeping in touch with distant family and friends. Computers make all these aspects part of society and the way this generation starts their lives.  These days, parents and teenagers have become rather lazy compared to the past. They're not interested in going to the library to research information on people, places, and family heritage. Computers have brought great convenience to people's lives by making all the information once found in books available on the internet. For instance, when doing a school project, the internet can provide any necessary information. It's truly amazing how much one electronic device can impact and influence a life. As a student, I'm often curious about the references teachers make and additional information not provided. The internet allows anyone with a computer to research their questions and get an answer almost immediately. The benefits of computers can largely outweigh the few negative effects as it's a way for a person to discover various information on any desired subject. Besides information - searching, computers can be used to document one's own data. Microsoft has developed several applications that allow you to graph information, design presentations, and neatly record writing drafts. No one is perfect and makes mistakes. Microsoft helps minimize these flaws, like making a neater copy of your essay or presenting data lists in graph form for better visual appeal. Society has become dependent on the sources in computer databases. By acknowledging the negative effects of computers and setting restrictions on this information source, society can better enjoy the positive contributions computers make to our way of life.
57	57	1	2	In @DATE1, technology has advanced significantly. Computers are among the most futuristic objects. They are useful for connecting with people globally. However, computers also have adverse effects on people's lives. Children are sacrificing their homework time to use the computer. Citizens are gaining weight, and children are at risk of being kidnapped.  School is crucial for success in life. Yet, computers have made it challenging for students to focus on their homework. This is a terrible habit that negatively impacts students everywhere. If this issue isn't addressed, students' grades will decline, and they won't earn class credits.  Obesity is a major problem in @LOCATION1. Five out of every ten @CAPS1 are either overweight or obese, which can be life - threatening. The problem is that people spend hours on the computer each day, time that could be used for exercise. Exercise is an important part of a healthy life. If this problem isn't solved, millions of Americans will be overweight. @CAPS2 is a very serious and dangerous issue.  Every month, dozens of kids are kidnapped. Since the invention of the internet, there has been a 20% increase in the rate of missing children. Children use popular networking websites like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and Twitter and share their personal information. Pedophiles use the internet to trick children into revealing their addresses. The police need to address this problem.  Every day, more people use computers. Computers have both positive and negative effects on people's lives. The negative effects are very serious and dangerous. How would you feel if your child fails school, gains weight, or gets kidnapped because of the computer? It's essential that we take action to mitigate these risks.
58	58	1	2	"Dear Newspaper, I'm writing regarding the debate you're having about whether people should use computers. The article stated that ""more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society."" I firmly believe that people should not use computers as much, and technology needs to slow down as it's becoming overly advanced.  My first reason for people to reduce computer use is that you don't want to be on your honeymoon and say, ""We could visit @LOCATION1 from our computer."" Life passes by quickly, and before you know it, you're overweight and old. Additionally, @PERCENT1 of computer users are overweight because they don't exercise.  Secondly, as technology advances, we may have less in other aspects. It's more fulfilling to work rather than just sitting in front of a computer to get a monthly paycheck.  In conclusion, you'll lead a happier life by exploring the real world. @PERCENT2 of computer users commit suicide. If it were up to me, I'd limit the use of computers. Once you consider all the drawbacks of computers, you'll likely think the same way I do. I used to be a computer enthusiast, but now I've changed my view."
59	59	1	2	You might find this hard to believe, but many people think computers have a negative impact on people's attitudes. You might be saying that's not true since everyone seems to have a computer, but the fact is not everyone does, and they believe computers create a negative attitude.  People have various reasons for owning a computer, and one is to stay in touch with friends. Did you know that some people own computers to keep in contact with friends from different states who live far away? For example, many use @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 to connect with friends. I can relate as I have both @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 accounts to stay in touch with family and friends from all over. Some of us even have friends from different countries! I believe that many people want to learn about people from different countries, and this is one way to do it. Right now, I'm learning new things about the @LOCATION1 because I'm friends with someone from @LOCATION2.  During this wonderful learning journey, you might even embark on a vacation adventure. A recent test showed that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people like to travel but don't know where. Some people claim that people spend too much time on the computer and not enough enjoying nature. They're wrong because if someone is chatting with someone from a different state or country on the computer, that person might persuade them to visit. For example, they can go online, type in the place they want to visit, and get photos and information about it. As a result, people can still enjoy nature.  Sometimes, using the computer can be educational. Many might disagree with this statement, but it's true. For example, high - school seniors often use the computer to take online college courses to earn their degrees as going to a regular college might affect their work schedules. It can also help students of any grade learn more about the subjects they're studying and improve their reports. For instance, they can get pictures and other information whenever they need it. As a result, students' grades can increase.  I hope many of you agree with my view and help spread the word that computers can have a positive impact on the mind. For those who previously thought computers were negative, I hope you'll reconsider your opinion.
60	60	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I concur that computers bring benefits to society. They have a positive impact on people, such as improving hand - eye coordination. Through computers, one can learn about the religions and other aspects of different countries. You can communicate, meet new people, and chat with them. Another positive aspect of computers is that you can quickly find all the information you need. In other words, computers are of great help to a large number of people. In conclusion, the positive effects of computers are significant and contribute to the betterment of society, making them an important part of our lives.
61	61	1	2	In contemporary society, the excessive use of computers has become a significant concern. Many individuals spend the majority, if not all, of their free time seated in front of a computer screen. This trend is having detrimental effects on various aspects of people's lives.  Obesity is on the rise, and a major contributing factor is the sedentary lifestyle associated with prolonged computer use. There is no physical activity involved when one is glued to a computer, and this lack of exercise is taking a toll on people's health. To combat this, individuals should make an effort to get outside, engage in activities such as jogging, playing games, or riding a bike. By reducing computer time, the obesity problem in society can be alleviated.  Furthermore, face - to - face interaction is crucial for personal development. Top scientists and researchers emphasize the importance of socializing in person. Throughout our lives, we need to interact and socialize with others, and if we do not develop these skills, it can have a negative impact on our well - being. Communicating via computer is no substitute for real - life conversations.  Fresh air and nature also play a vital role in our lives. Spending time outdoors, whether it's at the beach, hiking in the woods, or simply sitting on a swing in the backyard, can clear our minds. Research has shown that kids who spend time outside tend to receive better grades than those who are constantly on the computer. It is also an effective way to relieve stress.  In conclusion, people are wasting too much time on computers, which is having a negative impact on society. We should all take the initiative to turn off our computers, get out of our chairs, and engage in physical activities, social interactions, and outdoor experiences.
62	62	1	2	I firmly believe that using computers is a great thing. People can learn a wealth of new knowledge and make new friends through computers. For those with jobs that require working on computers all day, it's a necessary and practical tool.  Sure, computers can sometimes be a distraction, but their benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. When you're on the computer, you can discover all sorts of interesting facts. I remember one time when I was bored, I went on the computer to look up who @PERSON1 was. I was thrilled to find out that she was a famous singer, someone I had only heard about before.  Chantrail, a @NUM2 grade student, once said that only those who want to learn or make new friends will use computers. And I couldn't agree more. If you're eager to learn something new or meet new people, you should stop being lazy, put down the chips, and get off the couch to use the computer.  In conclusion, computers are an amazing invention that offers countless opportunities for learning and socializing. We should embrace them and make the most of their potential.
63	63	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I am of the opinion that computers have a positive impact on people. They are highly beneficial as they provide a platform for educational learning. One can access a vast amount of educational content and stay updated on the latest news and stories. Additionally, computers allow individuals to store and organize their personal information efficiently.  When one has a question or is unsure about the meaning of something, the internet on the computer can be a valuable resource. There are numerous reliable internet sources that can provide accurate answers. In contrast, without computers, if one had a question, they would have to search through books, which is a much more time - consuming and laborious process.  Another advantage of computers is the ability to keep up with recent events. One can learn about what is happening in different parts of the world, get the latest news on celebrities, and check the weather. While some of this information can be found on television, it is not always available when one wants it. With computers, users can search for the latest stories at their convenience.  Computers also offer the functionality of storing and organizing information. Tools like @ORGANIZATION1 can be used to keep all necessary information in an orderly manner. One can also create graphs on the computer, which will be more accurate and presentable compared to traditional methods.  In conclusion, computers are a valuable asset. They enable us to stay informed about the latest stories and keep our personal information well - organized. They have a positive influence on people's lives and are an essential part of modern society.
64	64	1	2	Dear newspaper, I truly think that computers are great for us. You can do so many things on them, like using the internet, accessing MySpace, watching videos, and even doing schoolwork such as math and writing essays.  Computers are extremely helpful for school. They can assist with math, writing, spelling, science, and literature. I specifically chose these areas because you can easily look up information on the computer to get the right answers for math and spelling. For example, Read @NUM3 is a great resource that helps with writing and spelling. I love using Read @NUM3 on the computer and enjoy the Read @NUM3 class as well.  Computers also played a significant role in my learning to read. I forced myself to read on the computer, and that's how I first learned this important skill. They are also useful for looking up words when you don't know their meanings.  In conclusion, computers are of great importance to me. They offer a wide range of educational and entertainment opportunities, and I believe they are an essential tool for learning and personal development.
65	65	1	2	Dear Newspaper, it's concerning to see that people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers, and this trend is having a negative impact on multiple aspects of their lives.  One of the major issues is the lack of physical exercise. In @LOCATION1, which has a high number of overweight people, many teenagers sit in front of the computer all @DATE1, waiting for their friends' screen names to appear. Instead of being sedentary, they could be engaging in physical activities. For instance, they could put on some fun music and dance, do push - ups and curl - ups, or go for a jog. This would help them stay fit and healthy.  Another problem is the lack of face - to - face interaction. Computers prevent people from having meaningful conversations with friends and family in person. Instead of chatting online, one can call a friend over to their house or plan a visit from cousins in another state. Real - life interactions, such as playing board games or hide - and - seek, are much more enjoyable and fulfilling than online conversations.  Finally, computers can be a major distraction from schoolwork. Once people start chatting with friends on the computer, it's difficult to stop. Many end up not doing their homework or studying for important tests, which leads to poor academic performance. Some kids try to do homework while using the computer, but this often results in inaccurate work due to lack of concentration.  In conclusion, while computers do have some positive aspects, their negative effects on exercise, social interaction, and schoolwork cannot be ignored. We should all be more mindful of our computer use and make efforts to balance it with physical activities, real - life socializing, and focused study.
66	66	1	2	"Using computers in daily life is truly remarkable. In our country, computers offer a multitude of benefits. They enable us to reconnect with people we never thought we'd see again. We can explore distant places and even use them to assist with homework essays. Through a computer, one can conduct research, virtually visit different countries and continents, purchase plane tickets, reserve hotel rooms, and book restaurant tables with just a few clicks. Additionally, instead of going out to get books, we can use Google to research countries, towns, and cities. We can read about and communicate with people from different parts of the world. The ability to interact, read, and ""travel"" with a simple click is truly astonishing.  Computers also serve as a means of communication when other methods are unavailable. They allow us to talk to and see individuals we might have otherwise lost touch with. For instance, my father hadn't seen his father since he was two. Thanks to web - chatting websites like ooVoo, Facebook, MySpace, and Skype, he was able to reconnect with his father, and we could have conversations with him. These platforms are helping friendships and relationships endure.  In terms of education, computers are extremely useful. Students can type and print their essays instead of writing them by hand. This not only makes the work neater but also allows for quicker and easier changes. Moreover, they can obtain information about their studies more rapidly and efficiently. Instead of searching through a large dictionary, they can use an online dictionary, which also offers pronunciation assistance and supports different languages. This saves time, enabling students to exercise, enjoy nature, or spend time with family and friends.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that using computers for daily needs is far from bad. It offers numerous advantages that enhance our lives in various ways, and I hope others will share this view."
67	67	1	2	Have you ever pondered how computers impact people's society? In my opinion, computers bring a wealth of positive effects. Firstly, they are an excellent tool for staying in touch with friends and family. You can chat with old friends you haven't spoken to in ages and make new ones, maintaining long - term connections. With advanced computer technologies, video chatting with family members across the state or through social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter has become a breeze.  Secondly, computers are a great resource for learning history. You can find historical information on almost everything, from past events to present - day phenomena. You can learn about famous people, places, and historical occurrences. Just imagine what our knowledge would be like if we didn't have computers today!  Finally, computers are a great way to keep occupied. You can spend time looking up information for school projects. In your free time, you can play educational games or book flight tickets for vacations. The technology exists for a reason, and we should utilize it for various purposes, whether it's catching up with friends or researching information.  In conclusion, I've explained why computer technology is a valuable asset. It helps us connect with others, learn about history, and keep ourselves busy. I sincerely hope you'll agree with my perspective.
68	68	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, I'm writing to share my thoughts on the effects of computers on people. I believe computers have both positive and negative aspects.  On the positive side, computers simplify many aspects of our lives. For example, if you want to watch a movie but don't want to wait in line, you can visit movie - tickets.com to buy tickets. Then, at the theater, you just need to go to the kiosk to redeem them. Another significant benefit is that computers allow people to pay their taxes. Special software can be downloaded onto your computer. Once installed, it usually guides you through the bill - paying process step by step, which is much faster and easier than the traditional ""manual"" method.  However, computers also have their drawbacks. Over time, they have made many people lazy. A large number of individuals have become overly dependent on computers. Business owners and professionals are constantly glued to their laptops or Blackberries. Wherever you look, there are adults on the internet or checking their emails. It's not just adults; students are also increasingly reliant on the internet. For almost every assignment, students turn to Google, Bing, or Wikipedia. They should take the time to use their textbooks instead. Students often prefer to watch @CAPS3, play video games, or text rather than do homework. While homework can be boring, it is ultimately beneficial. Spending an extra @NUM1 minutes using a textbook won't cause any harm. No one has died from using a book instead of Google.  In conclusion, computers clearly have both good and bad effects. While it's convenient to use the internet for homework, it may not be the most effective way to learn. On the other hand, making purchases through computers saves time and money. I hope you and the readers of this paper will understand my point of view."
69	69	1	2	There's a debate about whether people should spend a lot of time on computers, and I firmly believe it's a good thing for several reasons.  Firstly, adults can accomplish a great deal of work on computers. They can handle tasks such as doing taxes, dealing with paperwork, booking airline tickets, and managing bank transactions. Using a computer for these tasks is much more convenient as it eliminates the need to travel.  Secondly, students can benefit from computers by learning how to type. This skill is essential for emailing and writing. It also helps build their learning ability and allows them to understand how to use @ORGANIZATION1's features. Computers are not only educational but also fun for people of all ages.  Finally, computers are a valuable tool for communication. They provide a safe space to practice speaking. If you make a mistake while typing what you want to say, you can simply erase it, which is not possible in face - to - face conversations. You can also make plans with friends who live far away.  In my opinion, as long as people have access to a computer at home, they should be able to use it for work, play games, visit various websites, and engage in many other activities. It offers so many advantages that enhance our daily lives.
70	70	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, imagine a life without computers. There would be no quick access to information, no easy way to socialize, and no secure means to store health records or other personal information. It's hard to fathom where we'd be without this technology. I firmly believe that the world is greatly benefiting from today's technological advances.  As a student, computers are indispensable for me to complete my work. Without the guidance of @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS7, @CAPS4 @CAPS5, or other applications, it would be impossible for me to reach my full potential in assignments. For example, how can a student be sure their grammar is perfect in their homework without constantly asking a teacher? The answer is @ORGANIZATION2 tools. Accessed through a computer or @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS7, these tools let you check spelling, grammar, and punctuation with just a click. Clearly, computers are an essential learning tool in today's school systems.  In the real world, computers are equally important. Many businesses rely entirely on computer - based work. According to @PERSON1 @CAPS9 @ORGANIZATION1, a local business ""@LOCATION1"" in our area depends on the efforts of typists on computers. Without computers, our work would be impossible. With so many businesses and companies around the nation relying on technological advances, there's no reason to change. In fact, @PERCENT1 of businesses in @LOCATION1 say they'd have to close down without computers. If this were to happen, our economy would decline, which is clearly not beneficial.  We all know that computers and other technologies are great sources of entertainment. What's often overlooked is that they also provide a vast amount of knowledge. For instance, if you watch a special on the Discovery Channel about @LOCATION2 and want to learn more, you can use your iPod touch to search for information on the internet. In just @CAPS12 seconds, you can get the details you need.  In conclusion, it's evident that computers and other technologies are not only sources of entertainment but also offer a wealth of knowledge. They are essential for education, business, and overall economic stability. Reasonable people should recognize that the continuous advancement of technology is extremely beneficial to the public, and we should support its further development."
71	71	1	2	I firmly believe that computers have a profoundly positive impact on people. They enable individuals to maintain contact with friends and family who are far away. For instance, if a family member lives at a great distance, emails can be used for communication, ensuring that the bond is not lost. Similarly, when friends move away, e - mails also facilitate staying in touch, and photos can be easily shared through this medium, as sending them via traditional mail is time - consuming.  Computers also offer educational games for kids. These games are not only fun but also enhance learning. Unlike watching TV, which may not be as educational, actively playing these games allows kids to gain knowledge and become smarter. This is clearly beneficial for their development.  In addition, computers are excellent tools for learning new things. People can access information about global events, discover new words, and use pictures to aid in understanding. For example, when planning a trip, one can quickly check prices on the computer.  In conclusion, computers are highly useful. They help people stay connected, assist kids in learning through games, and enable individuals to learn about the world. We should definitely keep using computers as they are not a waste of time. Trust me!
72	72	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, over the past decade, technological advancements have revolutionized the world. Technology simplifies people's lives and fosters greater global connectivity. It creates numerous jobs and streamlines common tasks such as tax - filing, messaging, news dissemination, and teaching.  However, it has been well - documented that excessive use of technology can lead to internet addiction among teens and adults. This addiction can cause individuals to lose quality time with their families, time for exercise, and opportunities to enjoy nature.  As a member of the generation that has grown up in this new technological era, I have directly experienced the benefits of these advancements. I am convinced that technology is a great boon to society today.  The development of new technologies creates a plethora of job opportunities. For example, the creation of a new computer system would require the efforts of thousands of people, including founders, managers, innovators, and retail employees.  Running a business or corporation is a challenging task, but technology has made it more manageable and less time - consuming. With modern technology, emails can be sent in seconds, eliminating the need to distribute memos manually around the office. Moreover, company stocks can be updated every minute, enhancing business efficiency.  Ordinary people can also stay informed about global news in real - time. Tax - filing can be done online, and there is a wealth of entertainment available to everyone.  In summary, technology has made people's lives easier in many ways. It allows for faster work, more accomplished errands, increased learning, better global connections, and up - to - date news. Technology is positively impacting society, and we should hope that it continues to simplify our lives.
73	73	1	2	Computers have been an incredible boon to humanity over the past few years. Scientists, thanks to computers, have been able to discover cures for diseases, and jobs have become significantly easier. In my opinion, computers have a fundamental positive effect on people. They educate individuals in the context of their jobs and provide an opportunity to communicate with others without incurring any costs.  For example, if someone travels to a new country, they can use the computer to learn about its culture. They can also visit websites to find affordable options. When a child is working on a report about a country in @LOCATION1, the computer serves as a valuable resource to gather facts.  Computers also educate people about the world. There are websites with videos and written materials that offer insights into global events. My grandmother used to tell me stories about @CAPS3 @CAPS4 before the advent of computers. Now, my dad works in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and shares his daily experiences. Comparing these two different eras, it is evident that computers have been extremely helpful in @CAPS3 @CAPS4.  Previously, stores had to perform manual calculations when giving change. Now, with computers, they simply punch in the numbers. This shows how computers have improved work processes.  When it comes to communication, phone calls can be costly. However, with computers, one can chat or instant - message without any charges. If you want to see a friend in @CAPS9 but lack the funds to travel, video - chatting is a great alternative.  In conclusion, computers have been extremely useful since their invention. They help people learn about the world, simplify jobs, and save money on communication. Over the years, computers have improved dramatically. From small - screened devices that required multiple button presses to turn on, they have evolved into large, flat - screen models that can be activated with a single push. Who knows what the future of computers holds @NUM1 years from now?
74	74	1	2	Hello, I am writing to the paper to discuss the benefits of computers to society. Computers are powerful machines that can handle otherwise mundane and boring tasks. They offer numerous advantages in business, education, and social connection.  In the business world, computers are an indispensable tool. They can store far more data than paper, conduct jobs and processes rapidly, and facilitate the quick and hassle - free transmission of important information. For example, the ability to store large amounts of data is crucial for businesses to manage their operations effectively. The speed at which computers can perform tasks helps businesses meet deadlines and stay competitive.  In education, computers are also of great significance. @PERCENT1 of surveyed students stated that they prefer typing school papers on a computer rather than writing them by hand, as reported by @PERSON2, a professor at @ORGANIZATION1. This indicates that students value computers in their educational pursuits. Teachers and school systems also use computers for grading, attendance records, etc. At my school, teachers are using @CAPS1 @CAPS2, which are connected to computers and can replace white @CAPS2. This technology has increased student engagement and focus in class.  In terms of social connection, computers and related applications have made it easier for people to communicate with friends and family. @PERCENT2 of teens regularly visit at least one social networking site, according to @PERSON1, a psychologist specializing in teens. Families separated by distance can use instant - messaging systems to stay in touch. This form of communication brings happiness to people and benefits society as a whole.  In conclusion, computers contribute significantly to society. They enhance business efficiency, support students' learning, and strengthen social bonds. The positive impact of computers far outweighs any potential drawbacks, and they will continue to play a vital role in our lives.
75	75	1	2	Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, there is a concerning trend among an increasing number of teenagers in @LOCATION1. People are often heard saying things like “@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1” as they notice someone like Pete spending excessive time on the computer. Comments such as “Is he getting fat? All he does is play on the computer all day long” are not uncommon.  @PERSON1 from the International Health Committee has stated that “Playing on computers is one of the worst things teenagers can do with their time.” Over the past @NUM1 years, the number of obese teenagers in @LOCATION2 has doubled in @LOCATION3. Statistics show that over @PERCENT1 of the American population is obese. If this trend continues, the future of America may be filled with lazy, obese teenagers who spend all day in front of a screen.  Moreover, @PERCENT2 of teenagers who do not experience nature at a young age never fully appreciate it. Since they are constantly on the computer, they do not interact with nature, which may lead to more littering and pollution. This shows that excessive computer use is not only harmful to teenagers themselves but also to the environment.  It also has a negative impact on family and friendships. Teenagers who are glued to the computer do not spend enough time with their loved ones. Just a few weeks ago, @PERSON2 Rayfield was grounded because he spent so much time on the computer that he didn't talk to his mom for two weeks. @PERSON3 from the Yale Marriage Research Center has said that @PERCENT3 of divorces occur due to arguments over computer - use time.  In conclusion, teenagers should not spend so much time on the computer because of the negative impacts on their health, the environment, and their families. It is up to us to decide whether we want a nation of physically fit and close - knit families or a country filled with obese individuals and broken relationships.
76	76	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1's best friend from @LOCATION2 was once a nerdy individual with poor hand - eye coordination. However, after starting to use a computer, he now has better hand - eye coordination than I do. Computers not only teach hand - eye coordination but also enable people to learn about distant places and individuals and allow millions of people to communicate online. @CAPS1's friend is not the only one who has learned hand - eye coordination through computer use. Approximately @PERCENT1 of people acquire this skill by using a computer. It might take a few months to learn, but once a child masters it, they can engage in activities outdoors for hours. Who wouldn't want to learn hand - eye coordination? Moreover, computers provide people with the opportunity to learn about far - off places and people. Computer engineer @PERSON1 states that ""@NUM1 in every @NUM2 people learn about places and people through the internet."" It may take a few hours, but the learning is worthwhile. Why would someone claim that we are spending too much time on the internet when we are gaining knowledge? Additionally, if you have a friend who lives more than @NUM3 miles away, a computer can solve your communication problem. @CAPS1's friend from @LOCATION1 lives @NUM4 miles away from me, and we communicate via Hotmail, Yahoo, and Facebook. The best part is that it's free, unlike making phone calls. Furthermore, computer specialist @PERSON2 says, ""I learned hand - eye coordination using a computer. Most importantly, I was able to submit @CAPS1's essay on time because of the information a computer provides, and I was able to communicate with @CAPS1's family."" I, too, was once a nerd with no hand - eye coordination and learned just like @LOCATION2 did. We aren't spending too much time; we are simply being educated."
77	77	1	2	Dear Newspaper, in @DATE1's era, we are highly dependent on computers. They have become the most useful technological resource. We require computers for numerous purposes, and they bring significant benefits to society. They facilitate online communication, are educational, and enhance hand - eye coordination. It's astonishing how much computers assist us. We need them as much as we need water. Without computers, it would be difficult to survive. Computers have become the bond in friendships. They help maintain friendships when we don't see our friends regularly. I have a friend who moved to @LOCATION1 last year. Making calls or sending texts was too expensive. So, I keep in touch with her through the computer. Every day, we @CAPS1 and use Skype, which costs @MONEY1 per year. If I were to call her, each call would cost @MONEY2. Without the internet, I'm certain our friendship would have ended. Many people with the same issue have found computers to be very helpful. Computers have become the primary source for finding information. They are more popular than libraries and textbooks combined. There are numerous essential resources on computers, including textbooks, calculators, and even homework. Some people claim that computers are not educational, but scientists say they can raise a student's grade from a @CAPS2 - to an A+. Teachers hold the same view. One of my classmates said that computers changed his life. He used to forget to write down his homework, but now, by looking online, he has all the details. He now knows which pages to read from the science book. If you think computers haven't changed students' lives, you should reconsider. There are also games that improve hand - eye coordination. Many sports teams, like the @CAPS3, use these games. Their hand - eye coordination has increased by @PERCENT1. The team says that without the hand - eye coordination game, they would never have won the @CAPS4 @CAPS5. This game is free online for anyone to use, and everyone who has used it says it has improved their reaction time. The games are fun and non - violent, such as baseball, hockey, and hurdle games. In conclusion, computers have had a profound impact on @DATE1's society. They are educational, allow us to communicate with friends, and improve hand - eye coordination. They have greatly enhanced our way of life. Without computers, friendships would break, grades would decline, and hand - eye coordination would deteriorate. We need computers as they have benefited billions of people globally. Many people rely on them, and taking them away would disappoint many. No rational person would want to do so as computers have benefited society in countless ways.
78	78	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper, I find the opinion of spending ""too much"" computer time outrageous. I believe there are many other activities people can engage in, such as exercising, socializing with family and friends, and having ""me time"" without using a computer. For exercise, one can go outside and play sports like basketball, soccer, or baseball. You can also play games like hide - and - seek or tag with friends. Any activity that gets you moving outside the house is better than using a computer. If you exercise regularly, like working out to get fit, you'll definitely achieve your fitness goals instead of wasting time on the computer. Exercising is a great alternative to computer time. Socializing with family and friends is also a good use of time. You can have a family reunion at their place or simply hang out with friends. You can talk to them, play games, and have dinner together. This is what ""socializing"" is all about. Your family and friends will enjoy spending time with you over a nice dinner and a good conversation. You can also play board games like Monopoly. With friends, you can go to the movies, have a sleepover, or play outside. There are many great ideas for spending time with loved ones instead of using the computer. For ""me time,"" you can draw or read a book. There are plenty of options other than computer time. It's not healthy to sit around the computer all day. Instead, you should exercise, socialize with family and friends, and have some ""me time"" without the computer. If you want to achieve your goals, you can manage your time better and avoid excessive computer use."
79	79	1	2	Computers have caused many people to lose time, money, and friends. Since computers became widely available this year, they have had a significant influence on a large number of people. Spending excessive time on computers can lead to the loss of both time and money. For example, my oldest brother was quite overweight at the age of @NUM1 or @NUM2 when our computer started working. However, this had a positive impact on him. He began participating in sports like basketball and lacrosse, excelled at them, and continued with lacrosse throughout high school. While doing so, he also saved my parents money. This is one way computers can have a negative effect on people in some cases, but in my brother's situation, it turned out well. New technology has made people waste a lot of time that could be spent on activities beneficial to their lives. Many people in @LOCATION1 spend half of their day on computers, often playing video games. This lack of exercise due to computer use is a problem. Another negative effect of computers is the impact on friendships. For instance, I used to be friends with someone, but he hardly talked to me for almost the entire @DATE1 because he was always on the computer. I thought he didn't want to be friends, but in fact, he had dedicated most of his time to the computer. Since then, I've only been to his house about @NUM3 times this year, compared to more frequently before. It's time to decide whether to use computers or not. In my opinion, it would be better for everyone if we limited our computer use. If we do use computers, we should set a specific time limit to avoid losing time, exercise time, or friendships. Overall, having a time limit on computer use would be beneficial for all.
80	80	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1, and I firmly believe that computers are not very beneficial to our society. They prevent many people, especially the younger generation, from leading a healthy and active lifestyle, participating in sports, and enjoying the outdoors. Computers are causing people to neglect exercise. Nowadays, instead of going to the gym, many people stay at home and use the computer to talk to friends or play games. As a result, they are not as healthy as they should be. It's also been reported that excessive computer use harms people's eyes, leading to an increase in the number of people wearing glasses. If people engage in activities other than using the computer, they will lead happier, healthier, and better lives. Unfortunately, many young people are not interested in playing sports. In this decade, numerous sports - themed computer games have been released. Instead of working hard in real - life sports, kids either play without enthusiasm or don't play at all. They can focus on customizing @CAPS4 or @ORGANIZATION1 teams in @PERSON2 or @NUM1. Moreover, computers are not the only electronics distracting kids from sports. Xbox, PlayStation, Xbox @NUM2, PSP, @NUM3, GameCube, and GameBoy are among the console systems that offer games that divert kids' attention. I've even caught myself thinking more about an Xbox game than my own hacky game. Parents are also partly to blame as they allow their kids to play video games or use the computer for hours on end. Many of us don't know what it's like to go camping outdoors. Families are not spending enough time together. I've noticed that many families used to be very close, and it's natural to do things with fathers, brothers, or cousins. However, due to computer use, many families are not as close and don't engage in activities together. If fathers took their sons fishing or camping, it would keep them away from computers and strengthen the father - son bond. These are my reasons, sir, and they should be carefully considered. Remember, many people need to exercise, play sports, and experience the outdoors.
81	81	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that using computers is beneficial and does not interfere with physical exercise, appreciation of nature, or interaction with family and friends. There are three reasons to support this view. Firstly, the internet allows people to learn more. As the saying goes, one learns something new every day. When one has questions or thoughts, the internet can help find the answers. @ORGANIZATION1 is an excellent website where one can search for information and it also provides relevant images for projects. Secondly, for students (@CAPS1), the internet is useful for checking homework. If a student is sick and misses school, they can visit the school's website, click on their teachers' names, and find out the homework assignments. This way, they still have time for outdoor activities, playing with friends, and spending time with family. Thirdly, the internet has a positive impact on daily life. For example, if one doesn't have a TV and wants to know the weather, they can check online to see if it will be snowy or rainy, and then decide whether to wear a jacket or carry an umbrella. In conclusion, I am convinced that using the internet is highly advantageous and does not impede exercise or family interaction. As supported by the reasons stated, the internet enables people to learn more, helps students access homework when they miss school, and positively influences daily life.
82	82	1	2	Do you recall the last time you stored something on the computer? While many people use computers, there is a debate about whether they benefit society. Supporters of technological progress believe that computers have a positive impact on people. I am one of those supporters, as computers assist with writing, information retrieval, and communication. Regarding writing, my handwriting is not the best, so I type most of my papers. Moreover, computers can help with spelling and grammar, and there are even speech - to - text systems available. This is one reason I am in favor of computers. In terms of information, before the advent of computers, one had to visit the library and search through numerous books that might not even contain the desired information. Now, hundreds of articles on any topic can be found within minutes. The vast amount of information accessible via computers makes them a remarkable technological advancement. Finally, computers are beneficial for communication. A recent form of communication is @CAPS2. @CAPS1 is a website that allows users to send messages to friends, share pictures and videos. Email enables instant letter - sending over the internet. The forms of internet communication are numerous. In conclusion, computers are a great asset to society. They aid in writing, communication, and everyone can gain benefits from using them.
83	83	1	2	Dear Newspaper, computers have been an outstanding learning resource, and I believe it's time we recognize their value instead of being overly concerned about them. I'd like to share why I think computers are great. Firstly, books do not always contain all the information one needs. When seeking a fact or additional information for a project, the computer can provide it all. As a result, one can acquire more knowledge than before. Secondly, computers offer access to communication almost anywhere. Even if someone doesn't have a phone, they can still talk or send messages using a computer. Since not everyone has a phone, computers serve as an alternative means of conversation. Thirdly, on rainy days when it's not suitable to be outside, the computer provides a fun way to play and learn. It does not replace outdoor activities or exercise; rather, it is a pastime when outdoor opportunities are limited. I hope you understand and consider my reasons when discussing this topic.
84	84	1	2	I truly believe that computers are extremely helpful to people. You can learn about almost anything on the computer. For instance, if you're looking for a job, you can search for it on the computer. When you encounter a problem, the computer can offer solutions. If you want to visit a place, you can check out what it's like on the computer. If you like it, you can go there; if not, you can look for other places. It's also great to search for people on the computer. You can talk to them and even see them, which is really cool. Moreover, you can explore different cultures on the computer according to your interests. If you have a favorite person you want to know more about, you can look up information and watch videos about them on various websites. There are also plenty of online games, including learning games such as math and science games. You can even play with other people online. In conclusion, I firmly think that computers are not bad for people; instead, they offer a great deal of assistance.
85	85	1	2	Dear local newspaper, the question of whether computers are a good or bad benefit for society is a significant one. I, for one, believe that computers have a negative impact on society. Firstly, computer addiction is a serious issue. People can become so addicted to being on the computer that they spend less time exercising. This lack of physical activity can lead to various health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and other diseases. Although one can avoid these issues by simply turning off the computer and going for a walk, the allure of what computers offer often prevents people from doing so. Secondly, excessive computer use reduces the time spent with friends and family. When one spends more time on the computer than with loved ones, it can cause emotional distress to them. They may feel disappointed, worried, or concerned. Imagine having a best friend with whom you did everything, and then suddenly they stop hanging out with you because of the computer. It would be heartbreaking. Finally, safety is a major concern. Nowadays, there are many websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and Twitter. Many kids chat with strangers and post pictures of themselves without considering the potential dangers. Once a picture is posted, it can never truly be removed. There are also cases where people think they are chatting with friends but are actually talking to strangers, which can lead to dangerous situations. In my opinion, computers do more harm than good. I am certain that there are others who share this view, and I firmly believe that computers are a bad benefit for society as they cause more harm than good to those who use them.
86	86	1	2	Dear Newspaper, as computers increasingly become an integral part of daily life, people start to question whether they have a positive impact on individuals. Computers are a technological marvel that positively affects people. The World Wide Web, unlimited socialization opportunities, and simulations are among the numerous benefits of computers.  The internet provides access to the World Wide Web, where an infinite amount of information can be found on a computer. As the education secretary, @PERSON1, stated, “In almost every school, students rely on the internet to gain information.” Search engines also offer access to thousands of information - rich pages. Moreover, the web hosts thousands of different web - pages, allowing people to learn about others' opinions or engage in games. The web is just one of the many great features of computers.  Socialization is a significant aspect of modern life. Online games on computers enable people to communicate with friends living miles away. People no longer need to take a flight to talk to friends on the other side of the world. Instant messaging and email are the primary communication methods for thousands. It is the most efficient way to interact with friends. In fact, I re - connected with many people I hadn't spoken to in a long time through email. Everyone enjoys chatting with friends and family, and computers make this easier.  Simulations are a major advantage of computers. Many simulation programs are used to assist people in their lives. Numerous professions utilize computer simulations to learn how to perform their jobs. Nine out of ten medical schools incorporate surgery simulations as part of their training courses. Additionally, computer simulations and games pique the interest of many. After playing numerous history - themed computer games, I have developed a greater interest in history. There are countless learning games and simulations accessible via computers, adding substantial benefits to owning a computer.  As technology advances, people are presented with many possibilities, such as accessing information via the web, unlimited socialization, and simulations. The benefits of computers far outweigh the problems. So, in a world where computer users have an advantage, how can one keep up if they deny the benefits of computers? Computers have a positive impact on people.
87	87	1	2	Computers are a widely - enjoyed piece of technology, yet they are also a significant source of distraction. Many people, including me, wonder if computers are truly beneficial. In my opinion, computers do not always benefit society as they come with numerous distractions like Facebook, online games, and inappropriate images and videos.  Take my friend, @PERSON2, for example. When she first joined Facebook, it seemed like a minor thing. She would just log on to check her status and inbox messages. However, she soon became completely addicted. She joined numerous clubs and groups on the platform and started falling behind in school. Since she spent almost six hours a day on Facebook instead of studying, she started getting poor grades on most of her tests. She would come home and immediately go online without even bothering to do her homework. After a month of being a member, she was failing most of her classes, and her mom had to take away her computer privileges. One small distraction almost ruined her life.  @PERSON1 is another case. He loves online games and wins almost @PERCENT1 of the time. But he plays games all the time. His gaming habit has disrupted his family interactions. He hasn't played with his four - year - old sister, @PERSON3, since she was two. His mother often eats dinner alone. Sometimes, when his mom is out shopping, he views inappropriate pictures. Once, while playing a game, a girl sent him a message saying, “Check out my pics. They're hot!” and he looked at them, thinking they were harmless, but his mother didn't agree. His gaming has severely affected his family and social life.  Most people think computers are beneficial because they can provide useful information. However, the same information can be obtained from books. Instead of typing '@ORGANIZATION1' on a computer, one could simply search for it in a library. It takes less time and reduces the risk of carpal tunnel. Clearly, computers are not as beneficial as most people think. There are various distractions, and the examples mentioned are just a few.
88	88	1	2	Dear Newspaper, “Oh no!” I often find myself in situations where I forget the definition for a homework problem and don't have my notes. In such cases, a computer is extremely helpful. One can simply type in a word and get a wealth of results. This is why I believe having constant access to a computer is truly beneficial.  With a computer, you can access information you need. Whether it's details about a sports player or facts about a famous event, I often rely on my computer for such information. Since our technology is so advanced, the computer is a treasure trove of useful facts.  Friends are an important part of my life, and I enjoy staying in touch with them. Thanks to modern technology, there are numerous websites where we can communicate. This is especially useful for talking to friends and family who are far away. On a computer, you can chat with people not only from all over the U.S.A but also from other countries.  I also find a computer most helpful when I'm bored. I can visit educational websites to learn about things I may not have studied in school. The internet offers various forms of entertainment, such as games and movies. If you have a computer at home, you'll never be bored as there are countless things to do and learn.  Having a computer at home is extremely beneficial. You can have fun while also learning to use technology effectively. Computers represent the future, and it's a bright one. I suggest you get a computer and enjoy all the benefits it offers. You won't regret it.
89	89	1	2	Computers bring significant benefits to our society and have transformed the world. The internet offers a wide range of activities. On a computer, you can chat with people from all over the world.  The internet provides various opportunities. You can play games with others, communicate on specific websites, and search for vacation spots. If you're tired of staying at home, the internet is a great option.  Among the many features of a computer, chatting is particularly outstanding. You can chat while playing a game and can also have multiple conversations simultaneously. You can connect with people from across the globe, which is why chatting is the best feature.  Computers help the world in multiple ways. They assist kids in conducting research, aid the police in catching criminals, and help parents find vacation deals for their families.  In conclusion, computers clearly benefit our society. They have changed the world, allowing us to do many things and chat with people from anywhere. Computers play a positive role in our daily lives, and their contributions to society are undeniable.
90	90	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3, I firmly believe that computers are a valuable tool. I understand that some people use computers instead of engaging in physical activities or enjoying the outdoors, but this is not the case for everyone.  Computers are a great resource to invest time in. For the most part, the effects of computers on people are positive. It is true that computer users can communicate with others online and access information more quickly than they could in a library.  When people use a computer, they can obtain information for research and work. One can relax while getting a substantial amount of work done. A computer is highly versatile; you can hold your pet, eat, drink, text, or make a call while using it.  However, there are some drawbacks. Computers can be expensive, and not everyone can afford one. But if you can, it can be very useful. For example, @CAPS4 became successful with Microsoft because the computer was an essential tool for him.  In conclusion, despite some limitations, computers are useful, and the impact they have on people is largely positive. They offer numerous opportunities for communication, information - gathering, and work, making them an important part of modern life.
91	91	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are highly beneficial. They are truly useful as they can educate us on various subjects. Moreover, they offer engaging games and interesting websites, which is an added advantage. Computers are helpful in numerous aspects. For instance, when you need to look up information for school, you can easily access it on the computer. Some teachers now have websites, allowing you to use online books instead of carrying heavy social - studies books home. Remarkably, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 students prefer using the internet book over taking the actual one home. If you forget to write down your homework, there are websites where you can find all the assignments. Computers are also great educational tools. There are websites with math games and school - related content. You can quickly search on Google and obtain a vast amount of information. Additionally, the internet is a great source of entertainment, with millions of games and popular websites like Facebook. It's worth noting that @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 students use the computer for games and online chatting. This provides kids with plenty to do on rainy days. Whether you use the internet for its helpful features, resources, or just for fun games and websites, computers are truly invaluable.
92	92	1	2	Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1, have you ever considered how much computers can teach us? I'm sure you have. You might be interested in my view on whether computers have a positive or negative impact on people. In my opinion, the impact is positive. Computers teach us how to type and familiarize us with the keyboard keys. They also assist us in looking up information about people, states, and more. Moreover, they enable us to interact with other students when we're not at school. I encourage you to keep reading to learn my well - thought - out ideas.  First, computers have a positive effect because they help us develop typing skills. I recall last year in @NUM1 grade, our tech - ed teacher, ma @LOCATION4, directed us to a website dedicated to learning how to type. It taught us that the main keys are A, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and colon (;). This was extremely helpful, and I've typed that way ever since. I believe learning to type is an excellent skill. It's beneficial if you aspire to be a secretary or a newspaper editor. My mother is a secretary at @ORGANIZATION1 downtown. Since she works for multiple clients, she learned to type very quickly. Typing is an essential part of our lives. We can use it for class projects, essays for scholarships or college applications. It's even used in math class when our teacher types up materials and puts them on the @CAPS8 @CAPS9.  Second, computers are positive as they help us look up information about famous people, states, countries, etc. I remember in @NUM2 grade, I did a project on @CAPS10, and in @NUM3 grade, I created a PowerPoint on it. In @NUM1 grade, I did a project on @LOCATION1, and this year for music, I did one on @PERSON1. I'm currently starting a project on @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3. Clearly, I've used computers throughout my life, except when I was a baby (though I did have a little fake computer back then). Computers are indeed useful and have a positive impact. When was the last time you needed a computer to look something up? It probably wasn't long ago. Computers are truly amazing and can assist us in many ways.  Finally, computers have a positive effect as they help us interact with others, including students and family members, when we're not in direct contact. I remember when my cousin moved away. I was heart - broken, thinking I'd never talk to her again. But then she gave me her email, and we've been able to stay in touch. There are many websites for interaction, such as @CAPS12, @CAPS14, @CAPS13, AOL, MSN, Yahoo, Gmail, Twitter, etc. I enjoy chatting with people from all over the country, whether it's my friends or family. My favorite site is @CAPS14. It's so much fun. Do you have a favorite interaction website? You should try one.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. They help us develop typing skills, look up information, and interact with others. They've been a great help to me throughout my life.
93	93	1	2	"Readers of ""@LOCATION2 @CAPS1"" should be well - aware of the numerous benefits that computers bring to society. Computers not only enhance hand - eye coordination but also enable people to learn about distant places and facilitate easy online communication.  In today's society, good hand - eye coordination is crucial for success. Using computers provides a convenient way to develop and improve this skill from home or the workplace. Dr. @DR1 of @ORGANIZATION1 medical center states that a recent study shows @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 computer users have better hand - eye coordination than those who don't use computers regularly. In a local primary school, students have started the ""@CAPS2 to learn"" program, which promotes fast typing. Since the program was launched in @DATE1, school officials have noticed a significant increase in students' typing speed. Thus, computers offer a reliable way to improve hand - eye coordination. Moreover, the hand - eye coordination gained from using computers can increase the chances of getting jobs such as secretary or graphic designer in the future.  Even more importantly, the ability to learn about far - off places with just a few keyboard strokes is highly beneficial. Websites like Google and Yahoo can generate millions of search results in seconds when you enter the name of a city or country. This is extremely useful for school projects. Instead of carrying numerous books home to write an essay on @LOCATION1, you can simply search for information on your home computer. During summer vacation, you can use the computer to research potential vacation spots instead of doing homework. All travel - related information, from plane tickets to currency exchange, is readily available on a computer. If ""@LOCATION2 @CAPS1"" readers were aware of this, they could save a lot of time and avoid unnecessary trouble.  Online communication is another aspect where computers shine. State officials, governors, and even the president can post messages on websites for citizens to view while checking the weather or their emails. This is a much more convenient way to access government statements than waiting through commercials to watch speeches on the @CAPS4. Social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter are also very popular. You can reconnect with people you rarely see on these platforms.  In conclusion, computers have a profound and positive impact on society. They enhance hand - eye coordination, help us learn about distant places, and facilitate online communication. ""@LOCATION2 @CAPS1"" readers should recognize these benefits and make full use of computers."
94	94	1	2	Dear Newspaper people, I'm here to share my view that computers have a negative impact on people. While computers can store a vast amount of information, there's no guarantee that the information is accurate. There are many other productive activities one can engage in instead of spending time on the computer.  Computers can be very distracting. They may provide incorrect information. Searching for information on a computer, which involves turning it on, conducting a search, and then turning it off, can take more time compared to looking up information in a book. Books are generally more reliable. Moreover, computers often present an overwhelming amount of information, unlike books.  There are plenty of alternative activities. One can read a book, draw, play outside like shooting hoops or riding a bike. You can also call your friends and play together. If you're bored, you can even create your own game.  Computers can be a major distraction. When you're trying to do homework or work, having a computer around can easily divert your attention. Even seeing others using computers can be distracting. For example, when you're supposed to search for information about @ORGANIZATION1, it's easy to get sidetracked and search for something like @ORGANIZATION1 company instead.  In conclusion, computers have a negative impact. They don't always provide accurate information, there are better things to do in life, and they are highly distracting. They can turn hard - working people into procrastinators and active people into lazy ones. Computers have entered our lives and changed them, but not always for the better. I hope you can agree with me.
95	95	1	2	"Although some people think that computers turn children into zombies, I firmly believe that they have a positive impact on us. Computers can help us explore distant places we may never visit, connect with old friends, and assist with homework.  One reason I think computers are beneficial is that they allow us to explore other places. Every child dreams of visiting a special place, but not all families can afford to travel. However, most families have computers. With parental permission, kids can use the internet to learn fascinating facts about their dream destinations. @PERSON1 from @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 @CAPS3 school @CAPS4 said, ""I've always wanted to go to @LOCATION1, but my parents don't have enough income. I used my @CAPS6 and the internet to discover hundreds of amazing facts about it."" As you can see, computers can help people fulfill their dreams.  Another reason is that computers help us connect with friends. Like me, you probably enjoy chatting with your friends. But sometimes, they're too far away to call without incurring high costs. The @CAPS6 offers a solution. You can chat with friends over long distances for free. This was very helpful for me when my best friend moved to @LOCATION2. I thought I'd never talk to him again, but then I learned about @CAPS7 @CAPS8. Now, we can stay in touch anytime.  Finally, computers can assist with homework. Whether you're stuck on a tricky math problem or can't remember the capital of a state, the @CAPS6 can provide solutions. @PERCENT1 of today's computers come with built - in calculators. For the other @PERCENT1, you can download and install software at a low cost. All computers have internet access. You just need to turn it on and start exploring.  In conclusion, don't worry about excessive computer use because computers only help us, not harm us. They allow us to live our dreams to the fullest, keep in touch with friends, and excel in school. So, remember, computers are a great asset. Have you used your @CAPS6 today?"
96	96	1	2	The utilization of computers is undoubtedly correct. They are highly beneficial, enabling users to discover new things and more. Computers have significantly simplified people's lives. They can assist individuals in remarkable ways by helping them find urgently needed information. For instance, if a student has to write a paper on @PERSON1, the computer's internet provides billions of facts about @PERSON1 and extensive information on various topics. It is also useful for checking the weather, the news, global events, and answering questions. Discovering new things on the computer is a daily occurrence. For example, I read an article about the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and the next day, my teacher gave us a pop - quiz on that topic, and I scored @NUM1. If a computer can help someone achieve a @NUM1 on a test, one can only imagine what else it can do for the world. It might even save lives. Of course, computers are helpful. They can be used to check the scores of yesterday's games, stay informed about community events, watch videos, listen to music, communicate with friends and relatives, and obtain information on places and medical matters. In essence, a computer can perform a wide range of tasks, from looking up game scores to saving a life. Clearly, the use of computers is the best decision.
97	97	1	2	Dear Local @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers bring substantial benefits to society. In contemporary times, most of our daily activities would be impossible without computers. The most significant application of computers is communication. Suppose you are on a business trip in @LOCATION1 and need to send a letter to your company. You can send an email, which is far more cost - effective than using traditional @CAPS1. While experts are concerned that people are not spending enough time with their family and friends, it should be noted that many individuals communicate with their loved ones through computers. I rarely get to talk to my cousin if I can't access Facebook. I would have had to wait another month to learn about my other cousin's engagement if I hadn't followed her on @CAPS2. If the concern is about face - to - face interaction, the computer offers a solution in the form of a video - messaging site called ooVoo. Another way computers facilitate communication is through information sharing. School - related facts are often scattered across hundreds of books. During the @CAPS3, I conducted research for a project and was able to obtain crime - statistics from @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2. Often, researching an animal leads us online as modern books recommend good websites for further information. Without the @CAPS3, a simple research project could take months. Some scientists argue that people are spending too much time on the computer, and this view is both correct and incorrect. Spending hours watching YouTube is not necessarily the best use of time. However, the @CAPS4 has also developed computer - based games that allow people to have fun while exercising. Computers are like chocolate: they can be beneficial, but excessive use can be harmful.
98	98	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, in this digital era, computers have become increasingly advanced. They offer a wide range of functions, from enabling communication with others to providing access to knowledge about distant places. However, it is not all positive. The internet has also had a negative impact on people's lives, leading me to conclude that computers are a detriment to society. Computers allow us to learn, shop, and connect with friends, but this convenience has led many to stay indoors, reducing physical activity and potentially causing obesity. It can also lead to a decrease in in - person interactions with family and friends. Moreover, the internet can create a second life that some people become overly attached to. Social media platforms like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 enable users to have an online life that may seem more appealing. For example, @CAPS4 of @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 of @CAPS7 are extremely popular and addictive games. Some players become so obsessed that they neglect their real lives. This obsession goes against the original purpose of the internet. In addition, computers have ruined people's lives and reputations. Cyberbullying is widespread and can have a devastating impact on victims. Internet videos of people acting foolishly can spread quickly and have long - lasting consequences. Take the @CAPS9 kid video, for example. A college student was ridiculed for years after a video of him playing with a golf ball retriever like a sword was viewed over @NUM1 million times. He sued the uploaders and suffered from depression. Identity and credit card theft are also on the rise. My dad had his credit card account stolen last year. Although computers have some useful applications, their negative effects far outweigh the benefits. In conclusion, computers are a detriment to society as they can cause harm, addiction, and social isolation, and thus are not a positive force for society.
99	99	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, have you ever received a photo of a @NUM1 - year - old child without clothes? This is known as sexting, which can be shared via computers or other devices. We should limit the use of computers because they can lead to several serious problems, such as sexting among teens, negative impacts on younger children, and the risk of teens interacting with strangers. Lexi @NUM1 said that she has received inappropriate Facebook texts from other teenage kids on her cell phone. @PERCENT1 of the teenage population in @LOCATION1 use @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 chat platforms, which can send photos to mobile devices. This situation is out of control, and once something is on the computer, it stays there forever. More children under the age of @NUM3 are using computers, and there are chat rooms where they can interact with others. For example, in the children's game @PERSON1, which has a chatting feature, when creating an account, a child must provide a parent's email address, and the parent has to read the terms. However, @PERCENT2 of parents simply agree to the terms without reading them. @PERSON2 was followed home from soccer practice by a man around @NUM4"" tall and about @NUM5 years old. The man said, ""@PERSON2 come get some candy."" When @PERSON2 asked how he knew her name, the man replied, ""I play with you all the time on @CAPS5."" @PERSON2 ran home and told her parents. @PERSON2 plays on @CAPS6, an interactive game, and shared personal information such as where she lives and goes to school. Strangers can use this information to track down children. We must protect our children by reducing their computer use to prevent sexting, keep young children away from potential dangers, and stop kidnappings. Let's work together to make @LOCATION1, @CAPS8 a safe place for our children."
100	100	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I think people spend too much time on the computer. One reason is that it's a beautiful sunny day, and people should go outside instead of wasting time indoors. All day long, kids just sit in front of the computer without getting any exercise. @PERSON1 told me that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids who sit on the computer all day gain at least @NUM3 pounds. I believe him because it's true that kids don't get up and move. Who wants to miss a nice sunny day? Another reason is that kids' eyesight can deteriorate. Staring at a screen all day is really bad for the eyes. @PERSON1 said that if you're on the computer for @NUM4 hours straight, your eyesight will get worse. I remember once when I was on the computer for @NUM4 1/@NUM4 hours, my eyes hurt every time I blinked. I know the computer is fun for playing games and talking to friends, but you should take a break and do something else. In conclusion, just go outside and have fun! Do you really want to waste a nice sunny day indoors and damage your eyes? I definitely don't!
101	101	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, the prevalence of computer use has sparked a debate about its impact on people. Some argue that computers have negative effects, such as causing people to miss out on real - world experiences, leading to obesity, and reducing social interaction with family and friends. However, I firmly believe that computers bring more positive than negative.  Obesity is often wrongly associated with computer use. In fact, only a small portion of people who use computers become obese. Children are not inherently prone to obesity just because they use computers. Instead of blaming computers, we should encourage a balanced lifestyle. And it's important to note that a significant percentage (@PERCENT1) of people use computers to chat with family and friends. Online chatting is not only a way to stay connected but can also be crucial in emergencies. One can quickly inform others and call for help, which shows the practical value of computer - based communication.  Computers are also a vast source of information. When students need to search for school - related content, the computer provides a wealth of knowledge. It can positively influence people, helping them become better - informed and more capable individuals. The ability to search for any information is an excellent way to utilize a computer.  Moreover, using the computer can enhance hand - eye coordination. It also allows people to learn about distant places and cultures that they might never have the opportunity to experience otherwise. Almost every famous person and place in the world is accessible on the internet, offering a unique learning experience.  In conclusion, computers have many positive aspects. They facilitate communication, provide valuable information, and offer learning opportunities. We should focus on the benefits and promote a healthy way of using computers rather than simply criticizing their use.
102	102	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, experts' concerns about people spending time on the computer may be unfounded. People who use computers for extended periods often have valid reasons. They may be learning new things or engaging in necessary tasks. And most individuals are conscious of maintaining a healthy weight and do not become overweight due to computer use.  One of the significant advantages of using a computer is the ability to chat. Approximately @PERCENT1 of people chat online with their families or friends. This form of communication is not only convenient but can also be a lifesaver in emergencies. It allows people to quickly share information and seek help.  The computer is also an excellent research tool. Whether it's for schoolwork or personal knowledge, one can search for any information needed. This access to knowledge can have a positive impact on personal growth and development, making people more informed and capable.  In addition, using the computer can improve hand - eye coordination and expose people to different cultures and places around the world. There is a vast amount of information on the internet about people and places that most of us have yet to discover. All these are compelling reasons to support the positive use of computers. Spending time on the computer is not a waste; instead, it can be a productive and enriching experience. Therefore, experts should not try to limit people's computer use.
103	103	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, in our daily lives, we often encounter situations where computers prove to be extremely useful. Whether it's obtaining information or having fun, computers have numerous positive effects.  When it comes to getting information, computers are quick and reliable. For instance, if you're running late for a party and don't have the directions, you can simply type the address into the computer and get the directions in seconds. This is much faster and more efficient than trying to call the host, who may not answer because they're busy enjoying the party. My mother always advises me to use the computer when I'm having trouble finding information. The internet contains all the information that can be found in books and even more, and it's just one click away. Clearly, computers offer quick and reliable information, which is a significant positive effect.  Computers also play a crucial role in having fun. Take @CAPS5 as an example. It is widely used by both teens and adults for socializing with friends. A study by @ORGANIZATION1 shows that in a family of five, four members use the internet to communicate and socialize. This indicates that computers are an effective way to stay connected with others and have a good time.  In conclusion, whether you're at home on a rainy day or have a last - minute research paper to write, a computer will come to your aid. The positive effects of computers, including providing quick and reliable information and offering a means of entertainment, make them an indispensable part of our lives.
104	104	1	2	Dear The @CAPS1, there has been an ongoing debate about whether computers have a positive or negative impact on people. Some claim that computers have negative effects, such as causing people to spend too much time sedentary, reducing physical activity, and minimizing face - to - face interaction with family and friends. However, I firmly believe that computers have a positive influence on people.  Firstly, computers can teach hand - eye coordination. This skill is beneficial in various situations. For example, in an emergency when the phone is broken and there's no cellphone, one can use their hand - eye coordination to quickly type an emergency email. In college, it helps students take notes efficiently during important lectures. And in the military, it enables soldiers to react quickly to threats. Clearly, the hand - eye coordination learned from using computers is valuable.  Secondly, computers allow people to learn about foreign places. With just a few clicks, one can explore different countries, learn about their cultures, and even pick up a foreign language. If you're interested in foreign cuisine, you can easily find recipes and cooking methods. This broadens people's horizons and enriches their knowledge.  Finally, computers facilitate online communication. When you have the urge to talk to someone, you can simply send an email. It saves money on paper and envelopes, and having an email account is free. This makes it easy to stay in touch with others.  In summary, computers have a positive impact on people. They enhance hand - eye coordination, provide knowledge about new places, and enable seamless communication. We should embrace the benefits that computers bring.
105	105	1	2	"Computers are widely used around the world every day, and most of the time, their use is justified by valid reasons.  Computers are extremely helpful for traveling. When planning a trip, such as going to a nearby fancy restaurant, you can use a computer to find out the distance. When traveling globally, the computer can provide a close - to - exact price for various expenses, which is very useful. For sightseeing, if you type in a query like ""the most romantic spot in somers"", the computer can list a number of spots, saving you the trouble of driving miles to get a map or brochure.  They also play a significant role in communication. If you have a friend you haven't seen in years, the computer can help you connect. It can even tell you where that person lives, allowing you to pay a surprise visit. Moreover, the computer is a great platform to meet new friends. You can have conversations with them online and may even become best friends if you get along well.  In addition, computers are a lifesaver when it comes to work or school. If you're stressed, forget your homework book or paperwork, the computer can provide the necessary materials. For example, if you forget your homework book, using the computer can prevent you from getting a low grade. And if you forget work - related paperwork and not finishing it could lead to being fired, the computer can help you complete the project.  In conclusion, computers are essential in our lives. They assist with travel, communication, and work or school. A large percentage (@PERCENT1) of the population uses computers daily, and without them, our society would face difficulties. We should make full use of computers and recognize their positive contributions."
106	106	1	2	"### Rewrite for the first item Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am firmly convinced that computers are highly beneficial to contemporary society. Computers not only facilitate our connection with others but also exhibit remarkable efficiency. Moreover, one cannot overlook the vast array of entertainment options they offer. Before claiming that ""Computers are ruining our society,"" I urge you to consider my reasons for why computers are indispensable.  When the word 'computers' is mentioned, many people immediately think of chatrooms and @CAPS2's. These are prime examples of how computers can bring people closer together. Suppose you are working on a report about life in @LOCATION1. If all you can find are generic articles in old books, a simple solution is to engage in an online conversation with someone who actually resides in @LOCATION1. Additionally, computers can help connect family members living far apart. I would be overjoyed if an aunt or uncle were to contact me via '@CAPS3' or email.  Apart from connecting people, computers are extremely efficient. As students progress in their studies, homework becomes more important. For instance, one of my friends submitted an essay, but the teacher rejected it due to illegible penmanship. Typing homework is a convenient alternative to submitting messy and unrefined work. The efficiency of computers is also evident when performing seemingly simple tasks. Imagine how often you would get lost without digital directions or how many mistakes you would make when cooking without printing out a recipe.  Most importantly, computers serve as a virtual gateway to a wide range of entertainment. Whether you enjoy playing computer games or searching for the best deals online, a computer can meet your needs. There are thousands of websites to explore and countless games waiting to be played. A computer is truly a passport to leisure and enjoyment.  In conclusion, the choice lies with you: will computers benefit society, or will they lead to catastrophic consequences? I encourage you to remember that computers enable us to connect with others, are highly efficient, and offer numerous opportunities for achievement."
107	107	1	2	### Rewrite for the second item Dear @LOCATION1, have you ever experienced a situation where your computer crashed right before you had to give a presentation? If so, you probably had to resort to the old - fashioned method of presenting on paper. Recently, experts have been engaged in a debate about computers. Some believe that computers enhance the efficiency of our lives, while others argue that they cause us to spend excessive time indoors instead of outdoors. In my opinion, computers make our lives easier, and technological advancements have a positive impact on people. This is because computers teach us valuable skills, keep us updated on global information, are efficient for work, and help the environment, as well as enable people to stay in touch.  Computers have a positive effect on people by allowing family members to stay connected. Emails, for example, are a great way to communicate. Instead of sending a traditional letter, which takes time to reach the recipient, an email is delivered instantly, allowing for a more timely response. Social networking sites like Facebook also play a crucial role in family communication. You can see what your relatives are up to and chat with them using the chat feature. I can relate to this personally. My cousin lives in @LOCATION2, and I don't get to see him often. Thanks to Facebook, we can talk and share updates about our lives. Additionally, photo - sharing sites enable families to view pictures of recent vacations or sporting events, comment on them, and witness the changes in each family member throughout the year.  Another reason why computers are beneficial is that they teach us skills and keep us informed. They help improve hand - eye coordination. When typing on a keyboard, you need to know the position of each letter while looking at the screen to identify errors. This is a valuable skill for everyone. Moreover, many internet homepages are equipped with news engines that keep us updated on major global events, such as the war in @LOCATION5, the @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION4 earthquakes. Without the internet, we would lag far behind in terms of important news.  Finally, computers are efficient for work and environmentally friendly. By using computers, we consume less paper. Annually, @CAPS2 use billions of sheets of paper for letter - writing, but with computers, this number is significantly reduced. Emails, being electronic, do not require paper, and the decline of traditional newspaper companies due to online news is also an environmentally positive trend. In terms of work, creating presentations on computers is incredibly easy, thanks to a wide range of available programs. It can take only minutes to prepare a large - scale presentation.  In conclusion, computers have numerous positive effects on people. They help family members stay in touch, teach us skills, and are both efficient for work and beneficial to the environment. This is why I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. Let me ask you again: have you ever had your computer crash when you needed to complete a big project? Now you understand that computers make life more efficient. Just imagine how difficult it would be without them. So, I encourage you to go out and buy a computer; you'll be glad you did.
108	108	1	2	### Rewrite for the third item I noticed in one of the newspapers I received in the mail that there was an opportunity for people to share their opinions on kids' computer usage. This inspired me to write this letter. Many people rely on computers for various purposes, such as completing homework assignments like essays, communicating with family members who are away at war and unable to use cell phones, and applying for jobs online.  To begin with, kids often have homework assignments, especially essays. I frequently ask my mom if I can write an essay for school at home. Her usual response is to suggest staying after school to do it. However, kids have busy lives and can't always stay after. Moreover, school computers often restrict access to many websites, unlike home computers. This is one of the main reasons why kids use computers so frequently.  Secondly, some family members go off to war. For safety and privacy reasons, soldiers are not allowed to carry cell phones, but they can use computers. Family members know that their loved ones have computers and want to contact them to ensure they are okay. At the military base, they can communicate via video mail. I have an @CAPS2 who went to @ORGANIZATION1 and is now in @LOCATION2. When he was in @LOCATION1, we sometimes chatted with him online.  Lastly, job applications are another important use of computers. Many people are home - bound but still need to find employment. Numerous @CAPS3 commercials advertise online job opportunities. This is beneficial for all kinds of people, including the home - bound and the elderly. It's especially great because some online jobs allow you to run your own business and still earn a good income.  In conclusion, some people don't use the internet just for the sake of being online. They are actually using it to communicate with loved ones they won't see for a long time or to complete school assignments. Additionally, it's difficult to determine whether someone is active or not just by appearance. Both kids and adults should have the freedom to use computers whenever they want.
109	109	1	2	"### Rewrite for the fourth item Dear editor, my name is @PERSON1, and I firmly believe that computers are a great asset to the world and to people. They enable long - distance communication with family and friends, teach us a wealth of knowledge, and enhance our social skills. In my strong opinion, computers are a positive force in the world.  Firstly, computers facilitate long - distance communication. With webcams, we can chat with and see the people we are talking to. @CAPS2 is another popular platform where we can interact with friends, share pictures and videos. Although phone calls can also achieve these functions, they often incur costs for phone plans. In contrast, using a computer for communication is completely free.  Secondly, computers are excellent teachers. Programmers have developed various programs that are both educational and entertaining. For example, programs like ""Type to Learn"" or ""Type for Fun"" teach us how to type, and there are also programs designed to improve reading skills. These programs are particularly beneficial for kids as these are essential skills for their development.  Finally, computers make us more social. Platforms like @CAPS2 keep us informed about school and out - of - school events. We can engage in conversations with others on @CAPS2 or via email. Moreover, we can meet new people from different places and build good relationships with them. We get to know our friends better and don't have to spend time trying to figure out who they are.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that having a computer is a great idea. It allows us to communicate with people over long distances, imparts valuable life skills, and enhances our social interactions. Therefore, in my strong opinion, it is highly advisable to own a computer."
110	110	1	2	### Rewrite for the fifth item Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I firmly believe that computers are extremely beneficial to society. They allow us to read online newspapers, communicate with friends and family via email, and offer a plethora of entertainment options such as playing games, watching videos, and movies.  Staying informed about the latest news is of utmost importance. While traditional newspapers are an option, they come with a cost. Online newspapers, on the other hand, provide free access to the latest news, which not only saves money but also helps preserve trees. Additionally, email is an excellent way to communicate with people at a distance. It is much faster than traditional mail and can be used to share links to interesting websites, funny pictures, videos, or important notices. Thus, computers serve as both a news source and an efficient means of communication.  Computers are also a popular source of entertainment. They allow us to access game websites, watch videos and movies, or play online games. Whenever I'm bored, I turn to my computer and always find something interesting to do or a movie to watch.  In many aspects, computers are highly useful. They contribute to news dissemination, facilitate communication, and provide entertainment. People should focus on the positive aspects of computers to truly appreciate their greatness. In conclusion, computers are a valuable addition to our lives, and their benefits far outweigh any potential drawbacks.
111	111	1	2	Judgment, as my uncle's father once said, comes from experience, and experience comes from poor judgment. Since computers have only recently become accessible to the public, the public has limited experience with them. Consequently, the public lacks sound judgment when using computers, and the negative consequences are becoming evident.  Computers have had a detrimental impact on individuals. Firstly, they pose a significant concern for people's well - being. In studies conducted in @LOCATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS3 who spend @NUM3 or more hours in front of the computer wear glasses. This is due to the harmful effects of the screen on the eyes. Moreover, computer games are deliberately designed to be addictive, causing @CAPS3 to remain seated in front of the computer instead of engaging in physical activity. This may be one of the leading causes of obesity in @LOCATION2. My younger brother was addicted to a flying game. He sat in front of the computer for hours daily and started to gain weight. As soon as he stopped playing and began going outside more, he quickly lost the excess fat. Therefore, people should increase their physical movement instead of sitting in front of the computer.  Secondly, computers have a negative impact on the environment. Computers require electricity to operate, which is primarily generated by power plants. Over @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's power plants rely on coal, petroleum, or natural gas. When people turn on their computers out of boredom, they waste electricity that is not necessary. Scientists believe that human activities are a major contributor to global warming. Since power plants burn fuels to generate electricity, there is a clear link between computer use and global warming. Additionally, power plants release pollutants into the air, which can lead to acid rain.  Finally, excessive computer use affects people's skills. A school survey revealed that @CAPS3 who use computers for more than @NUM4 hours per day lack basic skills such as cooking or lighting a match. Most people prefer to use the microwave so they can quickly return to their computers. In a natural disaster, such as those in @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION4, @CAPS3 would struggle to fend for themselves. Without the ability to light a fire, they would have no means of cooking. Clearly, excessive computer use can have severe consequences during a natural disaster, even for adults.  Do we want @LOCATION2 to be associated with @CAPS5 and @CAPS6? Should our environment, our only home, suffer because of a few bored individuals? How will we cope with a major natural disaster? In conclusion, people are spending too much time on computers. This excessive use is making people @CAPS6, harming the environment, and causing the loss of important life skills. We must come together and take action to ensure people's health, preserve our life skills, and protect our beautiful @LOCATION5.
112	112	1	2	"Dear @PERSON1, currently, good sense dictates that kids should go outside rather than idly sitting in front of a computer. Computers often foster bad habits. I make a conscious effort to limit my computer use to school - related tasks and homework.  Consider the negative impacts of excessive computer use. It reduces physical activity and lessens face - to - face interaction with friends and family. Although the internet can provide diet and exercise plans, going to the gym to burn calories is a much better option. The internet and computers are designed to captivate users, luring them into countless websites and digital distractions. It is far more effective to join a local @ORGANIZATION2 or @ORGANIZATION1 for a workout.  I am part of a swim team at a @ORGANIZATION2. I prefer swimming to using the computer as it meets my exercise needs. I lost @NUM1 pounds in just one month of swimming. I also use the treadmill to relieve stress or anger. Gyms are clearly superior to computers.  We've all come across inappropriate content on the computer. While computers do create jobs, there is no excuse for posting hurtful pictures or messages. The other day, I saw a very mean comment that made me feel sorry for the victim. Kudos to YouTube for trying to eliminate inappropriate content. Once you share something online, it can never truly be retrieved.  Computers do offer a way to stay in touch with friends, but in - person meetings or phone calls are better. As my @CAPS2 always said, ""Interact more; it builds character!"" Whenever possible, I choose to meet my friends in person rather than relying on the computer.  Kids today can be unkind without even realizing it. Excessive computer use can lead to social isolation from family. Since computers are so engaging, users often ignore those around them. @PERCENT1 of kids fail to complete their homework because of computer distractions.  Thank you for your time. I firmly believe that computers are more of a hindrance than a help. Without them, everyone would be happier. They contribute to the nation's obesity problem, allow cyberbullying and inappropriate content to spread, and isolate us from the real world. (One day, computers might take over the world, and you'll regret not listening to me.)"
113	113	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 paper, my name is @PERSON1, and I am writing this letter to discuss the issue of computer use. My perspective on this subject differs from the common view.  It is true that people often spend more time on the computer than exercising, but this does not mean they are not social. They can interact in chat rooms. Additionally, laptops can be used outdoors. Computers can also stimulate imagination through the games we play.  Let's first address the aspect of social interaction. Some experts claim that people are spending less time with friends and family because of computers. While it is true that physical interaction may be reduced, people can still be socially active. Platforms like Facebook, @CAPS3, and chat rooms provide opportunities for verbal communication.  Regarding the claim that people are not enjoying the outdoors, this view overlooks certain facts. If people were not enjoying the outdoors, a large portion of America would have very pale complexions. Moreover, laptops enable users to take their digital experience outside. One can go outside on a sunny day, bring some fruit, and use the laptop until the battery runs out. Then, simply plug it in and continue to relax.  Computers also enhance imagination. Many computer games encourage players to think creatively, as they strive to improve the game. Simulators allow users to design or control virtual objects. Some games even let players create and play as their own characters, which can be related to potential career interests. For me, computer games have improved my drawing skills.  However, it is important to note that human beings have the ability to break free from computer addiction. We can choose to go outside or engage in face - to - face social interactions. In conclusion, most activities that can be done physically can also be replicated in a digital form on the computer, but we should maintain a balance.
114	114	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, computers have a positive impact on people and are essential in our lives. They play a crucial role in our learning, communication, and information - gathering processes.  Firstly, computers provide us with information about the world. They keep us informed about international affairs, such as the progress of wars and the actions of the president. They also offer local news, including weather forecasts, traffic reports, and crime updates. Moreover, the stock market information available on computers is of great importance to many.  Secondly, computers facilitate communication with friends and family. There are various platforms like AIM, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 that allow us to interact. If a student forgets to submit an assignment at school, they can email the necessary information to their teachers. Students can also ask about homework on the computer. Additionally, many people use computers to reconnect with old friends, which can bring great joy.  Lastly, computers are invaluable for students' academic work. When working on projects or homework, students can find a wealth of information on the computer. It provides details about people, places, and things, as well as answers to various questions. It also offers pictures and information about the events, locations, and dates related to the topics being researched.  In conclusion, computers are an indispensable part of everyone's life. They help us learn about the world, communicate with others, and complete schoolwork. Even if people are not engaging in physical exercise, they are still expanding their knowledge. We can still enjoy nature and spend time with loved ones through computer - mediated communication. Computers are one of the greatest inventions, and their positive impact on people is undeniable.
115	115	1	2	Dear Newspaper people, hello! Computers are truly amazing. They offer a wealth of opportunities, including learning, gaming, and socializing.  Let me start with how computers can enhance our knowledge. Have you ever had trouble finding information in a library? With the computer's @CAPS2, you can find anything you need. I once had to do a project on my favorite rocker, @ORGANIZATION1. My mom suggested I check the library for a book, but I couldn't find one. So, I turned to the @CAPS2 on my computer, and I found all the information I needed, which helped me get a great grade on my project. The computer can teach us about the world around us, from global events to the smallest insects and largest plants.  Now, let's talk about games. One of my favorite games is Left @NUM1 Dead @NUM2. It might seem difficult and scary at first, but it's actually a lot of fun. Another game I enjoy is an online game called '@PERSON1'. It can be time - consuming, but it's still an enjoyable experience. For example, as a level @NUM3 mage, I can take on level @NUM4 @CAPS7 because of my high - level spells. There are countless things to do on a computer, whether it's killing zombies or going on quests.  Finally, computers are a great way to stay in touch with friends and family. I moved away from my friends, but I got their @CAPS9 - mail, so I can talk to them and see them on a webcam. It's also useful for communicating with family members in the @ORGANIZATION2. My uncle is in the @ORGANIZATION2 and will be leaving soon. I can use the computer or @CAPS10 to see him on a webcam or chat with him.  In conclusion, computers are wonderful tools. They allow us to learn, play exciting games, and communicate with those we care about. Whether you're seeking knowledge, looking for entertainment, or wanting to stay connected, the computer has something for everyone. So, embrace the computer and have fun!
116	116	1	2	I concur with the newspaper's view that people are spending excessive time on computers and neglecting exercise. It is well - known that computers are addictive. However, people need to engage more with the outside world. The creation of never - ending games and similar features is making computers even more addictive, which is distracting people from their lives, families, work, and exercise. In conclusion, it is crucial that people limit their computer usage and make time for more physical activity and real - life interactions.
117	117	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, you might wonder if computers are great for everyone. In my opinion, computers are among the greatest inventions of all time. Their greatest advantage is the vast amount of knowledge they offer. You can develop hand - eye coordination, learn about distant places, and communicate with people online. Read on to understand why computers are extremely important to all of us.  Many believe that computers are harmful to our minds, but this is not true. When using a computer, you can improve hand - eye coordination. With practice, you will be able to type quickly and accurately, and reading your own writing can enhance your eyesight. Moreover, you can have fun, relax, and complete your reports and papers.  There are numerous far - off places with unique attractions. The internet provides a list of vacation spots, giving details and reasonable prices. For instance, it would be exciting to visit a place like @LOCATION1.  Have you ever wanted to play outside but couldn't due to rain or the absence of friends? On the computer, you can chat with your friends, find out what they're up to, and still enjoy yourself. You can even make new friends. Many kids and teens use the internet for this purpose.  In conclusion, computers are truly remarkable and important. That's why people of all ages use them to develop skills, learn about the world, and socialize. Thank you for reading my thoughts on this matter.
118	118	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, as technology advances, so does our way of life. Computers are an excellent means to improve our lives, benefiting both us and future generations. The use of computers and the internet allows us to learn about different ways of life in other places on @LOCATION4, communicate with people far away, and express ourselves, thus promising a bright future.  A significant percentage (@PERCENT1) of the world's population lives in local town or city environments and has limited mobility. Computers are extremely helpful in this regard as they enable people to research other parts of the globe. This exposure can spark an interest in other cultures, shape our opinions, and help us connect with different ways of life. As the philosopher and poet @PERSON1 said, ""We learn about ourselves through the discovery of others.""  Another useful function of the internet via computers is the ability to communicate with those living far away, which would otherwise be difficult. A @LOCATION2 study showed that @PERCENT2 of computer use is for communication on platforms like Facebook or @CAPS9. A scientist in @LOCATION3, @PERSON3, explains that humans enjoy communication as it gives a sense of unity, which is why social media sites like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS6, and @ORGANIZATION1 are becoming increasingly popular.  Finally, computers offer unprecedented opportunities for self - expression. One can gain fame on platforms like @CAPS8 or @CAPS9, as @PERSON2 did. Additionally, people can express their ideas through blogging, with about half of computer use being dedicated to stating one's opinions via blogs and videos.  In conclusion, it is evident that computers have a positive impact on people and society. They facilitate learning about distant places, communication with others, and the expression of ideas. Welcome to the digital future."
119	119	1	2	"Dear People of @LOCATION2, I want to ask you how many hours a day you spend being active and how much time you spend on your computer. Currently, too many people are sitting in front of computers, laptops, etc., while not enough are going out for a jog. Computers are having a negative impact on our society.  Firstly, millions of people sign up for @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and similar websites to reconnect with others. This has led to a situation where people no longer feel the need to visit others in person. For example, a woman sitting on her couch, thinking about her friend @PERSON1, is tempted to choose an online chat over a real - life visit due to laziness. This is already a common occurrence in our society.  Secondly, let's consider our health. Fresh air is beneficial for us. The experience of walking in the woods, breathing in the crisp air, and feeling energized is far better than sitting in a hot, stuffy room in front of a computer, suffering from back pain, colds, and migraines.  Exercise is also a major concern. Many people are too busy on the computer to engage in physical activities like bike rides. It's clear that a large portion of @LOCATION1 would rather update their @CAPS4 than get up and move.  In conclusion, many of us are debating whether to spend more time on the computer. The answer is a clear ""no"". People are currently not interacting enough, spending too much time indoors, and getting out of shape. Computers are taking over our lives, and it's time to make a change for a healthier and more fulfilling lifestyle. Please, turn off the computer."
120	120	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, computers have had a profound impact on me. They have taught me hand - eye coordination. I also learn a great deal from them and find using them to be a lot of fun.  One of the benefits of computers is the improvement of hand - eye coordination. It helps you see better and teaches your hands to react quickly. For example, when I was learning to use the computer and type fast, it also improved my ability to catch grounders and pop - flys while playing baseball.  Computers are also excellent for research. You can discover important facts and learn more about various topics. I use them to find details about the person I'm doing a project on.  In addition to learning, computers are a source of entertainment. I visit websites like myspace.com, youtube.com, and funnyjunk.com. On myspace, I talk to friends and meet new people. On youtube, I listen to music, watch music videos, and skate - board videos. On funnyjunk.com, I play games, and my favorite is @CAPS2 the hedgehog.  In conclusion, these are my opinions and the reasons to support the positive effects of computers. I encourage you to think about the effects of computers and compare your opinions with mine. However, the decision to do so is entirely up to you.
121	121	1	2	Are computers helpful? Absolutely. They are the most useful objects on the market. If family members live far away, you can instant - message them, connect via Facebook, or even send emails. For teenagers or children, the enjoyment is obvious. With a click of the mouse, you can watch your favorite shows or play free and fun games.  If you have bad handwriting and a report is due, typing it up on your computer can make your teacher think you spent all night on it, and you'll likely get a better grade. When a big family trip is coming up, you can go online to make the trip easier and at a lower cost. You can also shop online. For example, when it's someone's birthday, you can get gifts at a very low price, even up to a certain percentage off.  If your family lives far and you don't see them often, the internet is the ideal place to connect. You can instant - message, use Facebook, make video calls. It'll be like they're in the house with you. When you're on vacation, you can send them photos and maps of where you're going, along with information about the places.  Entertainment is a teen's favorite. If you miss your favorite show, you can go to certain platforms and watch it for free. YouTube offers a variety of content, from funny and exciting to plain gross. If someone like a well - known person did an amazing trick and you missed it, you can look it up. There are two types of games: you can play games on websites like addictinggames.com or play certain games online with friends.  Now you know why the internet is great. It has games, helps you stay close to your family, and can even offer assistance. Whether you think the internet is good is your decision.
122	122	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, a significant percentage of people in town use the computer for at least five hours each day. This excessive usage is unproductive and detrimental. Computers have a negative impact on people. They cause addiction and distraction, preventing individuals from completing their work.  Many inappropriate materials are available on computers, which neither children nor adults should be exposed to. Moreover, prolonged staring at a computer screen can lead to brain damage. In educational and professional settings, there is usually a substantial amount of work to be accomplished, yet computers often hinder rather than facilitate task - completion.  The other day in class, the teacher was collecting homework. Out of a certain number of kids in the class, a few didn't have their homework. When asked, they said they were on the computer and forgot about the assignment. When children and adults fail to complete their work, grades may drop, and employees may get fired. This harm is a direct result of computer addiction and distraction.  Since some internet sources are highly social and not all users are kind, mean and inappropriate articles and language can be encountered. Children should not be exposed to bad words, and adults should not be influenced to use such language. If both adults and children avoid these negative language exposures, our society could be more harmonious.  Studies indicate that staring at a computer screen for at least three hours a day can cause brain damage within about two weeks. The interaction between the computer screen and the human brain, when prolonged, can cause permanent damage. A student from an organization who studies computer mechanics stated that limiting computer use to essential tasks can help prevent brain damage.  In conclusion, computers are not beneficial. Their negative effects, such as addiction, distraction, exposure to inappropriate language, and potential brain damage, are significant. People should limit their computer use to avoid these harmful consequences. It is a personal choice whether to take this preventive measure.
123	123	1	2	Computers are ubiquitous, and almost everyone owns one. While some claim that computers are harmful, they actually bring substantial benefits to society. They are used for research, socializing, and the majority of our official work is carried out on them.  One of the primary functions of computers is providing research information. The internet is a vast repository of knowledge. If you need to find out anything, you can do so efficiently. Before the advent of the internet and computers, gathering sufficient information for a paper or business work could take weeks as all the information was sourced from books. Books had limited content, and you were restricted to what was written. With search engines and websites, you can type in any query, and it's much easier than searching through an entire book for an answer. Thus, computers are the optimal tool for researching a topic.  Computers also play a crucial role in socializing. You can communicate with almost anyone on the internet. Social interaction is essential for a fulfilling life. Scientific research has shown that social individuals tend to live longer than those who are isolated. While phone calls only provide audio, video chat on computers allows you to share pictures and expressions. For instance, if you have a distant relative, you can see them through video, making it one of the best ways to communicate.  In the official and economic sectors, computers are indispensable. Without them, it would be extremely difficult to detect incoming attacks or threats. The official institutions use computers to store legal files, court cases, and laws. Digital file transfer is much more convenient than sending paper copies. The business market also relies on computers to monitor financial performance.  In conclusion, despite the views of some experts, computers are highly beneficial to society. They support research, social interaction, and contribute to the official and economic development. They are an essential part of our modern way of life.
124	124	1	2	In my opinion, computers are excellent tools. They can be used by anyone at any time. One of the main advantages is the ability to stay in touch with people. You can contact your acquaintances and have conversations whenever you wish.  Computers also offer a wide range of entertainment and educational opportunities. You can play games, search for information on topics you're curious about, or conduct research. For work and school, they are invaluable. Employees can use them for their job - related tasks, and students can type reports or projects and store their important data securely.  Computers can be a real help to those who truly need them. And when you have nothing to do, using a computer can be a fun activity. What's more, anyone can create their own website and build something unique. Many people open accounts on various websites, such as a specific type of social media platform, an e - commerce site, or a particular forum.  These examples show that a large number of people use computers in a positive way, for purposes that the computer is well - suited for. Therefore, I firmly believe that computers are extremely helpful for those who like to search for information they're curious about or for those with legitimate needs.
125	125	1	2	Computers have no negative impact on kids. We love using them because they offer us assistance. This should convince the readers of the local newspaper that we need access to computers. We use them for communication, writing essays, and completing social studies or science homework.  Our stance is simple: let us use computers. We're not causing any trouble, so you can just leave us alone and let us do what we need to do. Computers provide us with the information we require and guide us on what to do and where to do it.  Computers aren't addictive to me or anyone else. Even if they were, does it really matter? A computer is just a device. You shouldn't punish us because of it. It's not the computer's fault that it can be engaging. It gives us what we need and the information we seek. It even does favors for us.  In conclusion, the computer is an amazing thing. It is a valuable tool for us kids, and we should be allowed to use it freely for our growth and development.
126	126	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am deeply concerned about the issue of people spending excessive time on computers and neglecting physical exercise. This trend poses significant risks, and it is crucial to raise awareness about the potential consequences of a sedentary lifestyle. One of the primary reasons I oppose the over - reliance on computers is the detrimental impact on health. Prolonged computer use often leads to weight gain, heart problems, and can even result in life - threatening conditions. Computers also have a far - reaching negative impact on the economy. They consume large amounts of electricity, affecting power supply across states. Moreover, computer addiction can cause people to lose interest in seeking employment. Instead of looking for jobs, individuals may spend hours gambling or making online purchases on their computers. Another serious concern is the illegal activities associated with computer use. There are numerous cyber predators targeting children, who may end up being kidnapped. Additionally, there are illegal websites and pop - ups that can lead to legal trouble. Children, in particular, may click on these without understanding the implications, which can have a long - lasting traumatic effect. I sincerely hope that you will take this letter into consideration and take appropriate action. The overuse of computers can affect not only my health but also yours and that of your children. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
127	127	1	2	Computers can significantly influence people's behavior and social interactions. Why waste your valuable life sitting in front of a computer all day when you could be getting exercise, such as going to the local gym? Computers often become a distraction from social life. They should be used mainly for emergencies, allowing you to spend more quality time with your family and friends. You can also enjoy your surroundings and appreciate life and nature. Computers are designed for business purposes, not for people to engage in useless activities. Exercise is vital for the human body as it promotes growth and helps maintain fitness. Sitting in front of a computer all day can cause your body to deteriorate due to lack of proper exercise. Sports are both enjoyable and beneficial for the body. They build hand - eye coordination, just like using a computer on the couch, but they also provide the necessary physical activity. Exercising offers many of the same benefits as using a computer, but it has more positive impacts on citizens. Family is precious, and their time with us is limited. We should cherish every moment with them. Computers can take away your social life, preventing you from going out and meeting new people. Computers can also be harmful to nature. Printing from a computer requires paper, which leads to deforestation and the destruction of animal habitats. We should use paper sparingly and only in emergencies. In conclusion, computers can cause chaos and destruction. Instead of relying on them, we should get the right amount of exercise, spend time with family, and enjoy nature. I strongly urge you to consider these points and hopefully agree with me.
128	128	1	2	@ORGANIZATION1, in my view, while computers can be both entertaining and educational, they should not replace real - life experiences. I firmly believe that computers harm people in ways they may not realize, and there are three main reasons to support this view. Firstly, many children and young adults are prone to believing that everything on the computer is real. The addictive games and electronic features can mislead them into thinking that the virtual situations are real - life scenarios. This can affect their schoolwork and behavior, as they need to return to the right state of mind and face reality. Secondly, family and friends have always been a source of support. Unfortunately, computer addiction has distanced people from their loved ones. Family and friends are unhappy with the changed behavior and want a return to a more fulfilling life. Interacting with real people is far more valuable than engaging with computer - generated images. Finally, one's health is of utmost importance. Although a computer may suggest exercise, people are likely to ignore it and continue to sit in front of the screen, which is bad for their eyes and overall well - being. Moving fingers to press buttons is not exercise. One should go outside, breathe fresh air, and engage in physical activities like running or playing a ball game rather than being glued to the computer. In conclusion, it is clear that computers can have a negative impact on a person. They blur the line between fantasy and reality, reduce social interaction with friends and family, and pose a risk to health. I hope you will consider these risks and acknowledge the facts, as we are losing the opportunity to truly live and enjoy the world.
129	129	1	2	Hi! My name is @PERSON1, and I believe that computers are not bad. Although some people spend too much time on computers, they can also be a great source of learning. For one thing, computers can help people gain knowledge. For example, if your computer breaks or has a virus, you can figure out the problem on your own. You can also keep up with the news and ask questions that you don't understand. Many kids, teens, and adults use computers to look up the meaning of words they encounter while reading. Computers can also be a great outlet for certain people. Bullies and street people with access to computers can play games like hitting, shooting, and board games. They can even watch fights if they want. This is beneficial as it can prevent conflicts and keep everyone happy. Bullies can use the computer to relax and avoid the people they dislike. Moreover, computers provide a convenient way to communicate. With a webcam, kids, teens, and adults don't have to leave home to talk to friends. For instance, my dad is getting a computer with a webcam so he can stay in touch with our family as he lives in @LOCATION2. Also, if a friend moves far away, you can still talk to them via webcam or send messages. In conclusion, computers are a good thing as they allow us to learn, stay out of trouble, and communicate effectively.
130	130	1	2	Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, the use of computers is a controversial topic, but I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on those who use and operate them. Computers play a significant role in people's social lives. Through various websites and programs, people of all ages can interact with friends and family. Social networking sites allow users to create accounts and share pictures and information with their friends. Taking away computers would mean taking away the social lives of many people. The social aspect of computers has a positive effect on people's well - being. Online news is another major benefit of computers. In today's world, people want to stay updated on the latest events, whether they are exciting or involve disasters. Most people prefer to check online news rather than wait for the newspaper. Online news was crucial during the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Its speed and accessibility enabled people to start donating and helping just a day after the earthquake, which is essential for the region's reconstruction. Computers also revolutionize the way people conduct research. Before computers, people used books and had to sift through piles of pages and articles, which was inefficient and disorganized. Now, with computers, users can access endless information on various topics. Online databases make it easy to find information by simply typing in a keyword or phrase. This saves time and makes research more efficient. In conclusion, despite not being in use for a long time, computers have already contributed to the growth and expansion of society. They offer social interaction, access to the latest news, and efficient research capabilities. There is no doubt that computers have a positive impact on society and our lives. The experts may have different opinions, but computers will always be a valuable asset to society.
131	131	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, computers are becoming a problem in numerous households. I firmly believe that an excessive number of individuals are developing an addiction to computers. Such people are more prone to weight gain, have limited social interaction, and spend an inordinate amount of time indoors.  In an article by @CAPS6 that I recently read in @ORGANIZATION1, it detailed @CAPS6's experiment on computer use. Dr. @PERSON1, a @CAPS3 professor, stated that his findings indicated that computer - addicted individuals only leave their homes to run errands. This not only disrupts their lives but also affects their physical well - being, as our bodies require sunlight. Moreover, his study revealed that those who spend more time outdoors and less time on the computer tend to be happier. @PERCENT1 of the study's patients became more joyful after reducing their computer usage.  I prefer to be surrounded by happy people rather than grumpy ones, and I'm sure you feel the same. I've noticed some kids in my school gaining weight. These are the ones who have recently started spending a couple of hours on the computer every day. This is extremely detrimental to their health. When someone sits at the computer all day, the food they consume isn't burned off, and it all turns to fat. Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of all obese people in a weight - loss class gained their extra weight from sitting at the computer all day. Treating one's body in this way could lead to various health conditions.  Last week, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and @NUM1 interviewed a @NUM2 - year - old named @PERSON2. @PERSON2's best friend has been ignoring @PERSON2 because he got an @ORGANIZATION1 computer. Now, @PERSON2's friend doesn't want to hang out with @PERSON2 or any of his other friends. Additionally, computer addiction makes people less social with friends, parents, teachers, and others. When people sacrifice their social time for computer games, chat rooms, or movie websites, they miss out on a significant part of their lives.  This issue can be resolved if parents set limits and encourage kids to spend more time outside. Clearly, while computers have some benefits, they also have numerous disadvantages. Addicted computer users become less social, avoid going outside, and start to gain weight. The consequence of this is a world filled with people who sit at the computer all day, eat, and gain weight.
132	132	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, the idea that technological advances, particularly in computers, benefit society is a controversial topic. However, I wholeheartedly support these advances and believe that computers have a positive impact on people.  Computers enable long - distance communication between friends and family. They also provide easy access to news and online textbooks, which offer substantial benefits to modern society. In the long term, relying more on computers instead of paper will save billions of trees. Additionally, computers enhance hand - eye coordination, a crucial skill.  The technological progress has revolutionized communication within my family. When I receive a video call from @CAPS3 cousin, @PERSON4, the computer emits a characteristic sound. Despite rarely seeing each other, @CAPS3 cousins and I can stay connected thanks to computers. Four out of five teenagers would agree that without computers, maintaining long - distance relationships with family and friends would be challenging. For example, I video - chat with @CAPS3 cousin on oovoo once a week, and I only see this cousin during holidays.  Teen @CAPS4, @PERSON2, believes that while computers and cell phones are great for teens, their use should be monitored. Computers are indeed excellent for staying in touch with distant family and friends.  Moreover, computers offer easy access to news and online textbooks. If more people utilized this, millions of trees could be saved, and the environment would be healthier. Environmentalist @PERSON3 suggests that if more schools switched to online textbooks, they could save thousands of dollars for other purposes. @CAPS3 friend @PERSON1 also agrees, stating that if they didn't have to carry so many textbooks, they might avoid developing scoliosis. Computers also allow for quick access to news, enabling us to learn about accidents immediately rather than waiting for the newspaper.  Finally, computers help children develop hand - eye coordination. Computer activities stimulate the brain and can even improve performance in sports. Three out of five kids at @ORGANIZATION2 claim that without computers during their childhood, they wouldn't be as good at their sports. Computers are an incredibly useful resource that society should fully utilize.
133	133	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 of the Newspaper, it is evident that computers do not always bring positive effects to society.  Firstly, time is a precious and limited resource. When people become overly engrossed in computer - related activities, it becomes difficult for them to disengage, similar to the addictive nature of smoking. Many individuals tend to procrastinate, wasting time that could be spent on homework or work. In @LOCATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people exhibit this behavior daily. Clearly, many @CAPS3 do not value time as they should.  Secondly, social interaction is essential. When people do not interact with their friends, friends may stop trying to communicate with them. Pets also need attention and love; when they are lonely, they often just sleep around the house. Parents play a crucial role in their children's lives. Just as we needed help when we were young, parents should interact closely with their kids. In general, the more time one spends with friends and less with the computer, the better their social life will be.  Lastly, health is a major concern. Staying healthy is not a trivial matter. Exercise is necessary to prevent diseases and maintain a good physique. @NUM3 out of @NUM1 people are overweight. Sitting in front of a computer screen to play games or send emails is as sedentary as watching video games on a @CAPS6.V. Most video games are not beneficial for health.  In conclusion, computers are not always a good thing. People should be more conscious of time management, strengthen social interactions, and pay attention to their health. By reducing computer use and focusing on these aspects, people can lead better lives.
134	134	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are the future and bring significant benefits to society.  One of the main advantages of computers is that they facilitate online socialization. After school, I can easily talk to my friends online. Opponents of computers claim that it reduces face - to - face interaction with family, but this is not the case. I communicate with my aunts via Facebook and other social platforms. My parents can also message me on the computer when they are at work, without having to use a phone to call home. If a friend is coming over but gets sick, they can simply send me an internet message instead of looking up my number and calling.  Secondly, computers are invaluable for education. When I'm stuck on a problem at home, I can quickly search for the answer on the computer. When working on projects, the computer provides a wealth of information. Since I can't obtain all the necessary information from a single book, I use the computer to gather more details about the subject. This access to additional resources improves students' grades.  Finally, using a computer enhances hand - eye coordination. There are many interactive websites that offer real - life benefits. For example, I know of a website that helped me improve my baseball fielding through interactive games. Similar websites exist for other sports like basketball and football.  In summary, computers offer numerous benefits to society. They enable seamless communication with friends and family, support education by providing vast amounts of information, and improve hand - eye coordination. Therefore, computers are an essential and valuable part of our lives.
135	135	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, I'm writing to share the positive effects of computers on people.  Computers are excellent for developing hand - eye coordination. They help users become better spellers and type faster, even without looking at the keys. I've personally benefited from this, and I'm confident others will too.  They also serve as a great platform for social interaction. Through platforms like MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, Gmail, and AOL, we can talk to friends, make new ones, and communicate with family. Teachers can also use these tools to communicate with parents, allowing for more efficient communication without the need for everyone to be on a phone call.  In addition, computers are a powerful search tool. We can search for new and old places such as landmarks, businesses like salons, nail parlors, gyms, and restaurants. We can even find out when a movie is going to be released.  In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial. They inform, educate, and teach us. I love my computer as it helps me with homework and studying. If we can't talk to someone on the phone, we can email or chat with them. It's fun and interesting to learn new things, upload pictures, music, and videos, and type essays. The computer is truly an educational and useful device.
136	136	1	2	"Computers present a complex issue, yet in my view, they are ruining our lives. Consider how often you see your child glued to the computer. It has a detrimental impact on kids' grades. It also stops people from taking car rides to visit friends at @ORGANIZATION1 and reduces the frequency of bike - riding.  The problem starts with grades. Parents tell their kids to start writing a paper, and the kids say okay but then end up on Facebook. More often than not, both kids and parents abuse computer use. In fact, @PERCENT2 of Americans use computers, which is more than half the country. I don't abuse the computer because I need to maintain good grades. Most students have a @CAPS2 - average, and studies show it's due to computer use. If your son has a laptop, don't assume he's doing work.  Computers have led to many dangers. There have been numerous cases of young teenagers being tricked by older users, either into showing body parts or being convinced that the older user can relate to their problems. Sometimes, teens are persuaded to leave home to meet the other user. Cyberbullying is another significant danger. Cyberbullies lower self - esteem, call names, and can even make a person feel suicidal.  People have also lost their sense of priorities. Some computer users forget about important aspects of life like family, schoolwork, and health. They'd rather stay on the computer than hang out with family and friends, skip homework for online socializing, and ignore their health by not exercising or eating well.  In addition, fewer people are outside these days. Everyone seems to be holed up in their basements in the dark. People are also losing interest in bike - riding. Many with Facebook think, ""@CAPS4 it's easier to talk online, so why ride to talk in person?"" A test of kids with Facebook confirmed this view. A mother once said her son was gaining weight because all he did was eat and go on Facebook, even at night.  I often ride my bike. Once, my mom said we'd ride for @NUM1 miles, and I got up and did it. I hope this has made you change your mind about the negative impacts of computers. Remember, it affects your grades, your ability to enjoy cars, and your weight. Please reconsider."
137	137	1	2	Dear newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial. They allow us to learn about distant places without the expense of traveling there. We can stay updated with the latest news and communicate with others.  In school, research projects on global locations become more accessible with computers. We can read articles about a place, gather pictures, and use them in slideshows or photo stories. There are also educational websites for kids to learn math facts and multiplication tables.  Computers keep us informed about world news. News websites post real - time updates on global events and disasters. Moreover, they are a great tool for family communication. With the help of chat rooms, families spread across the world can easily catch up on each other's lives.  The computer offers a wide range of benefits. It caters to different needs, from learning about far - off countries to staying in touch with a cousin in California and being aware of local happenings. In conclusion, computers are an invaluable asset that many people around the world can utilize for various purposes.
138	138	1	2	At @ORGANIZATION1, there has been extensive discussion about whether computers impact people positively or negatively. In my opinion, computers have a predominantly negative impact on most people.  One reason is that people lose their interpersonal skills when communicating through computers. Instead of hanging out with friends in person, many choose to communicate online. As a result, they miss out on facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language, which are essential components of in - person communication. These non - verbal cues can only be fully experienced face - to - face, unless one is using a webcam.  Computers also pose significant dangers. There have been numerous cases of young teenagers being exploited by older users. Some are tricked into showing body parts or leaving home to meet the other user. Cyberbullying is another serious issue. Cyberbullies can lower a person's self - esteem, call names, and in extreme cases, make the victim feel suicidal. Without computers, these problems would not exist.  Furthermore, computers have made people lose their sense of priorities. Some users neglect important aspects of life such as family, schoolwork, and their own health. They prefer to stay on the computer rather than spend time with loved ones, skip homework for online socializing, and ignore their physical well - being by not exercising or eating healthily.  In conclusion, I believe that life without computers would be better for everyone. People would retain their interpersonal skills, avoid the associated dangers, and focus more on the important things in life rather than their online social lives.
139	139	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers have a positive impact on people, and I don't believe they are the reason people don't exercise or enjoy nature. People make their own life choices, and the computer is just a tool.  For example, I love working and playing on the computer, but I still manage to talk to my family, play basketball, and hang out with my friends. I could easily stay in my room on the computer all the time, but that's a choice I don't make.  Everyone should have the freedom to decide how they use the computer. If someone chooses to be on the computer instead of spending time with family, it's their personal decision and problem, not the computer's fault. Only an individual knows what is best for them. In conclusion, we should respect people's choices regarding computer use as long as they take responsibility for their actions.
140	140	1	2	Dear editor, I've heard that some experts claim @CAPS1 spend too much time online, but I firmly believe they are wrong. The internet offers numerous benefits.  Firstly, it allows people to learn about faraway places without the cost of travel. The military uses it to communicate with family and friends back home. It also helps in developing excellent hand - eye coordination.  When planning a trip to @LOCATION1, the internet is indispensable. One can research tourist sites, compare hotels, check the weather, and look into airport flights. Without it, vacation planning would be extremely difficult.  The internet is not only for pleasure but also for communication. Webcams provide a fast, free, and convenient way to talk to people in distant locations. The military uses webcams to enable soldiers to communicate with their families. It would be cruel and unjust to deny soldiers this means of communication.  Moreover, the internet helps build hand - eye coordination, which is crucial in many activities. In basketball, one needs to dribble while looking up, and while driving, one must steer while observing the road. Without good hand - eye coordination, there would be more accidents.  While it's true that we should go out and enjoy nature, the internet also plays a vital role in our lives. Whether for pleasure, communication, or skill - building, it is an essential part of modern life. Everyone, regardless of their occupation or lifestyle, benefits from the internet.
141	141	1	2	"Dear @PERSON3 of the @LOCATION1, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on us. As computers are evolving, so are their applications. They are remarkable tools, not a replacement for our thought processes or outdoor activities like sports.  Computers facilitate communication with relatives and friends and enable us to learn about distant places. They are also excellent for research. Primarily, computers positively affect us, especially when it comes to connecting with family and friends. My mother, who was adopted, desired to find her birth family @NUM1 years ago. A year later, her birth father found her on a family - locating website. Thanks to this, she found her family, and I now have two more @CAPS1, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, and a cousin @PERSON4. I cherish them deeply. Without computers, I wouldn't have had the chance to get to know them.  Regarding communication, I was swamped with a large science project. We couldn't work on it in person, and it was impossible for one person to coordinate four others. So, we exchanged ideas via email and completed the project. The saying ""@CAPS2 are never enough hours in the day!"" is commonly heard. Over @PERCENT1 of adults, as per a statistic from @ORGANIZATION1, complain about the lack of time in a day. Computers allow multitasking; for example, you can be on a business call while emailing your mother to remind her you haven't forgotten her birthday.  Moreover, computers help us understand other countries, their cultures, and their current situations. Many people without TVs get their news from the internet. For instance, in @NUM2 grade, I had to research @CAPS4, a country in @LOCATION2. Searching for information in books would have been time - consuming and filled with irrelevant data, but on the computer, it was quick and easy. In today's economy, time is precious, and we can't afford to waste it.  Furthermore, computers are great for various types of research and getting directions. Those who claim people spend too much time on computers and not enough on exercise aren't always correct. I'm constantly looking up different exercises for a flat stomach, and so are most of my friends. Also, finding routes on paper maps is frustrating and time - consuming, but on the computer, maps are updated, and directions are easily accessible.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on us and are a great asset to society, from helping us locate people to facilitating communication and providing valuable information. I hope you share my view on this matter. Advancing computers are our allies, not our foes."
142	142	1	2	"I firmly believe that the increasing use of computers is having a negative impact on society. As more people become accustomed to using computers, they are neglecting crucial aspects of life such as exercise, appreciation of nature, and face - to - face communication.  When people use computers, whether for business, homework, chatting, or entertainment, they often become occupied for long periods. This leads to a lack of physical activity. Exercise is essential for our health and well - being, yet with all the distractions on the computer, people find it difficult to make time for a walk, jog, or bike ride. In today's world, where environmental issues are escalating, we need to be more in touch with nature. Rainforests are being destroyed, and the environment is becoming more polluted. However, many people are so engrossed in their computer screens that they fail to appreciate the natural world.  Communication is also being negatively affected. While the internet provides a means of connecting with others, it lacks the authenticity of in - person interaction. The phrase ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" doesn't fully exist online. You might find online ""friends,"" but you can't truly know who they are until you meet them in person, which can be dangerous. Additionally, the emotional connection and human need for interaction in relationships can never be fully simulated by technology, no matter how advanced it is.  In conclusion, the over - reliance on computers is having a detrimental effect on society. We are sacrificing our physical health, our connection with nature, and the quality of our relationships. In a world where it's crucial to be healthy, grateful, and socially connected, we are gradually losing these important aspects. Therefore, computers are having a negative impact on society."
143	143	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, my name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and I'm a student at @ORGANIZATION1 middle school. I'd like to share my opinion on how computers affect people.  Computers offer a wide range of benefits. They are useful for games, chat rooms, social activities, and for gathering information for homework or work. In my view, using computers is a great idea. Only those who are foolish would avoid them.  For example, if I forget how to do something, I can quickly find the answer on the computer. I've used computers my whole life, and I believe it has made me smarter. I even help my mom use the computer sometimes.  Chat rooms are fantastic. You can make new friends and talk to family members who live far away. I often talk to my cousin in Colombia. I also use Facebook to ask my friends about homework.  Games are not only fun but also beneficial. When you're bored, you can play all kinds of games, like action games or challenging ones such as chess or Sudoku. These games exercise your brain. They also help you become more familiar with the computer. Many people can't type without looking at the keyboard, and I'm one of them, but playing games can improve this.  Some people think that computers take time away from exercise and interacting with others, but I don't agree. When you use a computer, you're exercising your brain, and you can still interact with people.  In conclusion, these are my thoughts on computers. They are a valuable tool that offers many advantages, and I believe they enhance our lives.
144	144	1	2	Dear local Newspaper, in my opinion, computers are a boon to our planet. The new technology simplifies life.  Computers contribute to hand - eye coordination. Typing on the computer is a great exercise for the hands. Whether you're aware of it or not, typing quickly helps your hands move more freely. Typing accurately without making mistakes also improves hand mobility as your hands are constantly in motion, getting a good workout. The more you type, the more exercise your hands get, and computers can significantly enhance hand - eye coordination.  Computers also revolutionize communication. They allow you to talk to people from different parts of the world. With a webcam, you can have face - to - face conversations with distant friends and family. In business, computers are indispensable for meetings between companies in different locations. For instance, if a part of a business is working on a project in Hong Kong, the boss can hold a meeting to check on its progress. Moreover, if someone is in the hospital and you can't visit, you can still talk to them and see each other via the computer.  In terms of entertainment, computers offer a plethora of options. There are games pre - installed on computers and countless others available on the internet. Instead of being bored, you can click a mouse and play thousands of games. You can also watch videos on platforms like YouTube, listen to music, or watch comedy shows. Videos are a means of expressing emotions, whether they are comical, horror, or sad. For teenagers, social networking sites like Facebook provide a way to connect with friends.  In conclusion, computers are beneficial for kids, adults, and teenagers alike. With just a click of the mouse, you can access a powerful technology that improves hand - eye coordination, facilitates communication, and provides entertainment. So, go ahead and get yourself a computer and be amazed by its capabilities.
145	145	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe you're using a computer to run your newspaper. If the government, businesses, schools, students, and local newspapers all use computers for various tasks, how can they not be helpful?  Computers are essential for typing, editing, and presenting information. Local newspapers rely on computers to present their work, and as a member of society, I prefer reading typed content. The government uses typed documents to announce laws and communicate with other countries and states. Without computers, creating signs, flyers, and running businesses and newspapers would be impossible.  For example, if you're running late to work due to traffic, you can easily email your boss about the situation and arrive at work stress - free. In fact, almost the entire world uses computers for communication. Whether it's through email, social networking sites like Facebook and AOL, or video chat, computers make communication easier. This form of communication is also widely used in schools. Teachers and administrators use computers to exchange important messages. If computers are so important to them, how can they be harmful to society?  As a student at Western Middle School, I'm well - aware of the numerous projects and research we have to do for each class. Without the internet, this would be nearly impossible. After conducting research, we need to type and print our assignments. Without the assistance of computers, it would be difficult to have neatly - written and well - researched work.  In conclusion, I believe that computers are an excellent technological advancement and should be used as often as possible. Without them, newspapers couldn't be printed, teachers couldn't communicate effectively, and students couldn't complete their school tasks. As a student, I know firsthand how much they help me with schoolwork and staying in touch with friends and relatives. If computers are such a valuable asset to society, why do some people view them with concern?
146	146	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that using computers is beneficial to people. Without computers, we would know nothing about anyone or anything. For instance, I would have no knowledge of all the @CAPS1. However, with computers, I know a great deal about them and their lives. For example, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 were shot in the back of the head, and @CAPS4 was also shot. I also know a lot about the @ORGANIZATION1, which consists of white people instilling fear in black people. Similarly, regarding wars like World @NUM1, World @NUM2, the @CAPS5, the conflict involving @PERSON1, and the @CAPS6 war, there was a spy plane flying across @LOCATION1, and it was shot down as we were trying to determine if they had any nuclear bombs there. Moreover, search engines like Google and Yahoo are extremely useful. With Google, you can type in anything and obtain an answer, most likely a correct one. Yahoo and Google are excellent for work, product research, and studying. In conclusion, I am convinced that computers are a valuable asset.
147	147	1	2	Nowadays, it's common to see people spending hour after hour gaming online and posting blogs on social networking sites. Many individuals become so engrossed in their computer screens that they're unaware of their surroundings and only break away when absolutely necessary. This is not the world we should strive for, yet it's what our society is creating.  Computers do not bring positive benefits to society. The excessive time spent on computers has negative effects on people's bodies. There's also a decline in face - to - face interactions with family and friends. Cyberbullying is another major issue.  Prolonged computer use in a stuffy, dark room hampers proper body maintenance. Exercise is crucial for a healthy life. Just as bread needs flour to rise to its full potential, our bodies need exercise to burn fat and calories and to build and maintain muscles. It's recommended to get at least one hour of exercise or outdoor play a day, but many fail to achieve this goal. Additionally, @CAPS2 @CAPS1 helps maintain strong bones. One only needs to absorb @NUM1 minutes of sunlight a day to get the recommended dose, yet @PERCENT1 of our population is indoors on their computers and misses out.  Socializing during parties, lunch breaks, or family dinners is important. But if one skips lunch with friends to post a blog, it's a loss of social time. This habit can lead to drifting away from friends. Even for children chatting with friends on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6, they may not learn to think on their feet in real - time language, which can affect them during college or job interviews later. Social skills are vital for success.  Spending too much time on a computer is like being a caterpillar. Cyberbullying, which can be extremely cruel, is a significant problem. A recent study showed that @PERCENT2 of kids would rather be bullied in person than online because it takes less courage to type cruel words. Cyberbullying has even led to suicides, like the case of a girl who committed suicide just @NUM2 weeks ago.  In conclusion, computers have more negative effects on society than positive ones. They cause a lack of exercise and proper body maintenance, reduce social interaction and skills, and lead to the serious issue of cyberbullying. To prevent society from becoming a digital wasteland, we should turn off the monitors and embrace the outdoors.
148	148	1	2	I firmly believe that computers bring numerous benefits to our society. Computers have been around for many years, and they are ubiquitous. This indicates that people love them. There are countless uses and enjoyable experiences associated with computers.  Computers make people happy, which in turn contributes to a better society. They offer a wide range of games such as Tetris, @CAPS1, and card games. When people are bored, they can simply hop on the computer and play a game.   Moreover, computers allow us to pay bills and make purchases online. This not only saves money on gas but also reduces pollution as fewer cars are on the road.   In addition, computers can make us smarter and help us perform better in school. For example, I used the computer for my last social studies research project and received an A. This made me happy and, in a way, contributed to the well - being of society.  In conclusion, computers bring us happiness, enhance our knowledge, and make our society better. I wholeheartedly love computers and believe that everyone else should too.
149	149	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I'd like to share my opinion that as people spend more time on computers, they spend less time with their families. There are three reasons to consider when evaluating whether computers are good or bad.  First, computers have positive effects on people. They teach hand - eye coordination and enable people to learn about distant places and people.   Second, computers allow us to talk to people online. Kids use websites like MySpace and Facebook to chat with friends. They also visit YouTube and engage in blogging. However, these websites can be dangerous as someone might hack into your files and pretend to be your friend.  Third, we should spend more time with our families than on the computer. Instead of being glued to the screen, we can play games like Monopoly, Candy Land, or video games with our families. We can also have conversations with our family members.  In conclusion, while computers have their merits such as positive effects on people and facilitating online communication, we should prioritize spending time with our families. The key is to strike a balance between computer use and family time.
150	150	1	2	Dear newspaper, although @CAPS1 computers have some drawbacks, they have far more advantages. Computers can display magnificent pictures of nature, and you can keep these pictures until you're ready to send them via email. You can also order tickets for movies, planes, trains, and even book hotel rooms for vacations online.   On the internet, you can find pictures of almost anything, whether it's nature or celebrities. Approximately @PERCENT1 of all pictures on the internet are genuine. A computer can store pictures from a digital camera, take a project from a flash drive and download it, and then email the pictures to any existing email address.  When it comes to entertainment and travel, you can purchase movie tickets at any ticket - selling website. For vacations, you can get hotel, plane, train, or boat tickets online. Shopping on the internet is also a breeze. You can order @CAPS2, @CAPS2 @NUM1, @CAPS2 @NUM2, game consoles like GameCube, Xbox, Xbox @NUM3, Wii, and computer games. You can even buy household appliances, clothes, and other store products.  Watching videos is also possible on almost any website. Some videos may be about grass, some may be funny, and others may be strange. Around @PERCENT2 of all teenagers enjoy watching music videos, which can range from artists singing and dancing to parodies of other artists.  In conclusion, despite having both pros and cons, computers clearly have more advantages, as demonstrated by the many useful functions and opportunities they provide.
151	151	1	2	To the local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. There are three primary reasons for this view. Firstly, computers enable people to learn about diverse cultures worldwide. Understanding different cultures is crucial as it helps people respect one another when traveling. Secondly, they facilitate learning about various places across the globe. This knowledge is essential to avoid getting lost and to identify famous tourist destinations. Thirdly, some individuals find jobs online, and others work remotely, which brings positive benefits to people. In conclusion, computers positively affect people by allowing them to learn about cultures, places, and job opportunities around them.
152	152	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, there are many people in the world who think constantly using the computer is beneficial as they can interact with others online and gain more knowledge about the world. However, there are also those who disagree, and I am one of them. Spending excessive time on the computer can significantly impact one's life. People stop exercising, fail to appreciate the beauty of nature and life, and don't spend enough time with their family and friends. I hope that while reading this letter, you will take this information into account. When people spend a great deal of time on the computer, they don't get the necessary exercise. They become lazy and unmotivated. This is detrimental to their health and overall well - being. People may become overweight and, due to their computer - induced laziness, won't go out for exercise. People should enjoy their lives! There are numerous fun and healthy activities one can do, such as playing sports, which provide both enjoyment and exercise. Some people try to encourage their loved ones to join them, but some are too lazy because they are always on the computer. Instead, they stay indoors, deprived of fresh air, which is harmful to their bodies. Finally, people often lose touch with family and friends because they are preoccupied with computer games. I've experienced losing friends due to excessive computer use, and I believe no one wants to have such an experience. In summary, constantly being on the computer is not good. It can make people lazy, prevent them from fully enjoying life, and cause them to lose contact with loved ones. I hope you realize that computer overuse is not beneficial after reading this.
153	153	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I am of the opinion that computers are an extremely valuable tool in society. They help people learn about different cultures, communicate with friends and family globally, and serve as a reliable research resource for educational purposes. Regarding learning about cultures, it is vital for world peace. Without computers, we might be unaware of the lifestyles of people just @NUM1 miles away. For instance, we wouldn't know about the earthquake in @LOCATION1 and whether we could offer assistance. This knowledge brings us closer to a world without war and conflicts. The computer also plays a crucial role in communication. I recall when a family friend was in @LOCATION2, risking his life. I couldn't have managed without emailing and video - chatting with him. The internet is also useful for simply chatting with friends on various sites. Lastly, computers are indispensable for education. They are used for research projects, study tools, and essays. Although some websites may be fake, it's still easy to find great research materials. Many teachers in my school have blogs or pages with study resources. For example, my @CAPS2 teacher, @CAPS5, provides study links before tests. There are also websites that help with vocabulary learning through games. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on our daily lives, from education to cultural awareness and socializing, and I'm sure you'll recognize their significance as a successful newspaper.
154	154	1	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, there has been much debate about the impact of computers on society. Some ""experts"" claim that computers are beneficial, while others, like me, believe they are harmful. They contribute to child obesity, reduce social skills, and lower educational levels. Recent studies show that children who use computers frequently are less likely to be active. A study by @ORGANIZATION1 indicates that children using computers for @NUM1 hours a day are more likely to be obese than those using it for one hour or less. The main reason is that it's easier for children to sit in front of a computer than to engage in physical activity. Computers are a direct cause of child obesity and pose a threat to society. Contrary to the belief that computers enhance social skills, they actually do the opposite. Online communication lacks face - to - face interaction. People who use computers often feel awkward in social gatherings. My cousin, who spends all his time on the computer, was glued to the screen during Christmas. Computers are ruining the social lives of millions. Moreover, people who use computers often are generally less intelligent. Just because knowledge is accessible on the computer doesn't mean children will use it. Many students simply copy and print articles for assignments without learning. In conclusion, computers, once seen as a promise for society, are now destroying it by causing obesity, social awkwardness, and lower educational levels. How can people still think they are good?"
155	155	1	2	To the local newspaper, I disagree with those who claim that people spend too much time on computers. People can learn almost anything they desire on a computer. There are numerous reasons to use advanced technology. For example, it can teach kids to quickly find answers to their homework, eliminating the need to read a book or take a class while still achieving a full understanding. Those who say others spend too much time on computers are partly right. However, people can interact with friends and family through computers, play games, communicate, and even learn new things together. It's true that one should go out and enjoy nature, which can't be done on a computer. But computers can also help nature; for instance, one can create a blog to spread the word about issues like stopping deforestation for stores or animal hunting for fur. In conclusion, computers offer a wide range of possibilities and learning opportunities. I encourage everyone to get a computer and discover what they can do, learn, or simply have fun with it.
156	156	1	2	Dear Local newspaper, I recently read your article about computer usage. In my view, computers are a remarkable technological achievement, yet they can also have a negative impact. Computers are among mankind's greatest technological advancements. They enable us to type, learn about historical events, different places, and diverse cultures. We can communicate with people from afar through chat or webcam. I use these features to talk to my @CAPS1 who live in @LOCATION2. Computers have significantly enhanced my life.  However, despite their many benefits, computers can also be detrimental. Many people overuse them. I know a very kind person who is addicted to @CAPS2. Whenever she visits and I'm using my laptop, she asks to check her @CAPS2 status. It's evident that @CAPS2 has taken over her life.  I recently read an article on computer usage in @LOCATION1, written by Dr. @PERSON1. She stated that the average American spends four or more hours on the computer each day. While some people make the effort to spend time outdoors, I commend them for doing so.  In conclusion, computers can have both positive and negative influences. It all depends on how we use them and the amount of time we spend on them. I urge the people of @LOCATION1 to use their computers wisely and not to let them consume all their time. Life is too short to be spent solely in front of a screen. Instead, we should spend time with our family and friends and enjoy the outdoors.
157	157	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, I'm curious about how much time you spend on the computer daily. Is it @NUM1 hour or @NUM2 hours? While computers represent amazing technological advancements, they can also be quite harmful. People often spend hours on the computer, which leads to less time for exercise, poor communication skills, and potentially dangerous online searches.  From @DATE2 to @DATE3, the percentage of obese people in @LOCATION2 increased from @PERCENT2 to @PERCENT1. A recent study showed that the number of families with computers has risen to @NUM3 out of @DATE1, compared to @NUM4 out of @DATE1 in @DATE4. Scientists suspect a connection between these two trends, and they've found evidence to support this hypothesis.  People who spend excessive time on the computer tend to lead sedentary lifestyles. They're more likely to stay on the computer than go for a workout. This lack of physical activity can result in obesity and cardiovascular problems. A surgeon I spoke to at the hospital mentioned a significant increase in heart surgeries in @DATE1. The computer manual recommends limiting usage to @NUM1 hour at a time.  Social networking has become extremely popular these days, whether it's @CAPS6's Twitter or Facebook. While these platforms allow teens to interact with their friends, the quality of communication has suffered. For example, teens might write things like ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 going @NUM2 dance,"" with incorrect spelling and grammar. This informal language has spilled over into real - life conversations. @PERSON1, the grandmother of a social media user, said she can't have proper conversations with her granddaughter because of this.  @PERSON2, an English teacher for @NUM7 @DATE1, has noticed a decline in teens' ability to write grammatically correct essays. When she corrects essays, they're often written in a social networking style. It's disheartening to see literacy skills deteriorate due to excessive computer use.  In @LOCATION1 @CAPS7, children typically go home and spend hours on the computer until their parents return. As a parent, you might wonder if it's safe for your child to be surfing the internet alone for long periods. Parental controls can only do so much, as children can easily find ways around them. There's a lot of good information on the internet, but there's also a lot of bad. You never know who your child is talking to or what they're searching for, and this can put them at risk.  In conclusion, while computers have their advantages, we need to be aware of the potential negative impacts. We should encourage children and adults alike to limit their computer use, get more exercise, and improve their communication skills."
158	158	1	2	Dear newspaper, while some believe that computers do not benefit society, I firmly hold the opposite view. Computers play a crucial role in helping businesses thrive, keeping people informed about global events, and facilitating communication among individuals.  Computers are indispensable for businesses of all sizes around the world. Just imagine a business without computer assistance. Without instant communication, it would take a long time to assemble and ship products, making the business unreliable. When surveyed, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 business owners and workers expressed a preference for using computers at work. Almost every modern business relies on at least one computer. For instance, companies that mass - produce products often use computers to perform tasks more precisely than human workers. Sometimes, computer - operated robots handle dangerous jobs, protecting workers from harm. Additionally, businesses need computers to quickly send and receive information from other businesses and individuals.  However, businesses are not the only ones that benefit from computers. People like you and me use computers as much, if not more, than businesses. Thanks to platforms like @CAPS2 and email, we can easily stay in touch with friends and family. Families use computers to plan get - togethers, and friends use them to maintain contact after school or when they live far apart. With computers, people can communicate with each other regardless of their location.  People also rely on computers to stay informed about the latest news. Without computers, it would be much more difficult to learn about events happening around the world in a timely manner. Consider a natural disaster occurring without immediate news coverage; we wouldn't be able to send aid to the affected area quickly. After the recent earthquakes in @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2, the importance of global information has become even more evident. While newspapers do provide news and information, they often rely on computers to gather it, and their reports are usually a day or two late. Eighty - seven percent of scientists agree that receiving information would be much more challenging without computers.  In conclusion, computers have become an essential part of our lives, both in business and personal settings. They have revolutionized the way we work, communicate, and stay informed. Their benefits far outweigh any potential drawbacks, and we should continue to embrace and make the most of this remarkable technology.
159	159	1	2	"Imagine standing outside, feeling the warm sun on your back, and then diving into a pool, with the cool water enveloping you. Unfortunately, this idyllic scene is becoming less common because children and their parents are spending excessive amounts of time on the computer.  Computers are having a detrimental impact on our lives in several ways. First, they are contributing to a lack of exercise. Humans, especially children, need physical activity to stay healthy. But with the allure of the computer, many children are becoming increasingly sedentary. Each year, more and more children are becoming obese, and the computer is a major contributing factor. Instead of spending hours in front of the screen, munching on potato chips, children should be outside riding their bikes, swimming, or playing sports with friends. Even in winter, they could go sledding. Experiencing nature is far more beneficial than staring at a computer screen.  Second, the computer can be extremely dangerous, especially for young people. @NUM1 - year - olds are creating Facebook accounts, and @NUM2 - year - olds are all over the internet. Naive teenagers often seek ""friends"" in chatrooms or on @CAPS2. These so - called ""friends"" may lie about their age and identity. Many teenagers have met people they've met online and ended up being raped or killed. There are many predators in the world who use the internet to target unsuspecting individuals. Teenagers often give out personal information such as their last name, cellphone number, or address, making it easy for predators to find them. This puts not only the teenagers but also their families in danger.  Finally, computers are causing a rift in families and friendships. Social media platforms like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, farm - related games, and @CAPS4 are turning people against each other. Some families even eat dinner in front of the computer. When friends visit each other's houses, they just sit on the computer. It's puzzling why people find it so enjoyable to simply stare at a screen. Families should engage in activities together, such as having dinner as a group, going out for ice cream, or going shopping.  I'll admit that I'm a bit addicted to the computer myself, but I don't spend @NUM3 hours on it like some people do. We should make an effort to cut back on computer time. Instead of eating dinner at the computer, go out as a family. Instead of online shopping, go shopping with friends.  I know I'm not the only one who thinks this way. We need to take control of our lives and reduce our dependence on computers. We're not getting enough exercise, we're putting ourselves in danger, and we're neglecting our relationships with family and friends. It's time to turn off the computer and start living a more balanced life."
160	160	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I concur that people are spending an increasing amount of time on computers, which is causing them to neglect other important aspects of life. Specifically, they're spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and being with their families.  First, excessive computer use leads to a lack of exercise. Exercise is essential for maintaining good health. If people don't exercise regularly, as they age, their bones may become weaker, and they're more likely to become overweight, which can have a negative impact on their heart. By spending so much time on the computer, people are paying little attention to their physical well - being.  Second, people are forgetting about the beauty of nature. It's truly wonderful to hear the birds singing and see the plants outside. However, people are so focused on their computers that they're not taking the time to appreciate nature. Moreover, they're not recycling, which is crucial for keeping our planet clean. The air we breathe is becoming polluted because people don't care about environmental protection. Instead of being glued to the computer, they should contribute to making the world a better place.  Finally, people are neglecting their loved ones. Spending time with family is one of the most important things in life. Yet, people are so engrossed in their computers that they're missing out on quality time with their family members. Instead of being on the computer all the time, it would be much more fun to go to the beach with the family or do other activities together.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a significant impact on people's lives. Due to excessive computer use, people are not exercising, not enjoying nature, and not spending time with their families. I hope that after reading my thoughts, you'll take a moment to reflect on your own computer usage and make some positive changes.
161	161	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, computers have a highly positive impact on people, and I whole - heartedly concur with this view. Firstly, computers teach hand - eye coordination. When learning to type, one can memorize the keys, eliminating the need to look at the keyboard. Using a mouse also enhances this skill; when clicking on an icon, one must look at the screen and move the mouse accordingly. Once familiar with the icons, there's no need to search the screen, and one can simply move the mouse to the right spot. Secondly, computers make people smarter. For a history project on China, a computer can quickly provide information that might rarely be found in newspapers. It can also uncover details about famous people, like which college a well - known actor attended, in mere seconds. Additionally, search engines can find famous pictures for projects. Lastly, computers enable online communication with friends. It's as fast as texting and allows one to catch up with friends not seen often during school, continue interrupted conversations, and make plans or discuss upcoming events. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people as they facilitate hand - eye coordination, offer access to information about foreign countries and people, and enable communication with friends.
162	162	1	2	"Since the invention of computers, there has been a massive transformation in the way society operates. People can use computers to communicate with peers, gather information for school papers, or watch videos and stories on the internet. Today's computers offer access to magazine and newspaper articles, books, movies, and shows. This technological advancement has made the @NUM1 century the most modern era the world has ever witnessed, and it is beneficial to society. The ""computer age"" has given people the opportunity to expand their imaginations through technology. In less than a minute, one can go online, type in the desired movie or book on @ORGANIZATION1, and start watching immediately. Just as books can transport one anywhere, computers can do so more efficiently and offer more options. Instead of buying a book, one can quickly read about the faraway city of @LOCATION1 or the eruption of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Some argue that using computers wastes time that could be spent studying or with family. However, the internet can provide any information needed to enhance knowledge. Moreover, one can connect a computer to a TV and watch a free movie with the family. The computer age is what society needs. For instance, when doing a school project on a topic one knows nothing about, it's more reasonable to spend five minutes finding the required website on the internet rather than driving and spending time looking for information. The computer simplifies research for school or work and allows for easy creation of presentations. As an eighth - grade student, I rely on the internet for almost all my research and even create some of my best projects on the computer. Computers have not only made research easier but also improved communication with friends and family through email, video chat, and instant messaging. Without computers, we'd have to resort to slow methods of communication like snail mail. It's clear that computers have enhanced communication so significantly that it's unwise to claim they're not beneficial to society. A machine with so many capabilities can only be a valuable asset."
163	163	1	2	Computers are overused and have an adverse influence on some people's minds. They are partly responsible for America's high obesity rate. American teens are neglecting their homework and not investing time in school because of computers. These high - tech machines should be restricted and only given to those who truly need them. People spend excessive time on computers, which is time that should be used for exercise. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of obese Americans admit to being addicted to computers, which is a clear indication of their negative impact. The internet on computers is also unsafe. Experts state that popular chatting sites like MySpace have contributed to the increase in murders and rapes. The number of convicted criminals and sex offenders using these platforms is substantial, yet parents allow their children to use them. Moreover, computers impede teens' learning. Although computers are supposed to be helpful learning tools, they are often used for other purposes. They encourage kids not to study or do their homework, and the useful learning sites and tools are not utilized frequently. America should have a computer - free week to counter the negative influence on children. I sincerely hope that one day we can all turn off our computers for good.
164	164	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I'd like to discuss whether you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Personally, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact. With computers, many people can conduct research on the past. I disagree that computers have a negative effect on anyone. They help people develop hand - eye coordination, allow them to learn about distant people and places, and enable communication with old friends and family members. Computers can also be used to gather information about nature, such as different trees, plants, and animals. In addition, computers are useful for contacting people who live far away. There are various ways to do this, including using emails, instant messaging, and social media platforms like Facebook and MySpace. I understand that not everyone shares my view, as opinions can vary. However, computers are extremely useful. They can provide information on history and past events that may no longer occur in the present. Scientists, business workers, adults, and children all benefit from computers. Children can use them to type school assignments or find information for projects. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people due to their multiple benefits in research, learning, and communication.
165	165	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, technology is advancing every day, and one of the most prominent and popular machines in today's technological society is the computer. Some people dislike computers, believing they are ruining social skills and physical health. I'm writing to convince these people of the many advantages of computers. First, computers facilitate the exchange of information. Email is one of the great features they offer. For example, if there's a snow day at your child's school, you'll receive an email from the superintendent, and without it, you'd be unaware of the cancellation. Another instance is when you lose your voice due to a cold and need to inform your boss about being sick. With a computer, you can simply send an email. Second, computers make communication easier. Thanks to social networking platforms like @CAPS4, Twitter, @CAPS3, and Yahoo Messenger, it's almost impossible not to stay in touch with friends and family. On @CAPS4, you can search for old friends and family, send friend requests, and become online friends. Then you can instant message, video chat, check their status, and view their photos. Finally, computers simplify shopping. If you've used Amazon, eBay, or Overstock, you know that you can buy almost anything online, from electronics to @CAPS5 animals. You can even order household groceries online. For example, if you're at home with diarrhea but need to go grocery shopping on @DATE1, you can use your computer to do so. In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial as they help with information exchange, communication, and shopping.
166	166	1	2	"To the editor, it's a beautiful day. The sun shines brightly, the birds chirp cheerfully, and a gentle breeze rustles through the trees. However, you're oblivious to all this as you're sitting in front of your computer, typing away at work or on email. In the era of modern technology, this is a common sight. Experts are worried that excessive computer use can be detrimental to your health, impede your social skills, and lead to a disconnection from nature. While computers are useful in our lives, an over - reliance on them is never a good thing.  As previously mentioned, computers can have a negative impact on your health. They make people lazy. Instead of going outside to exercise in the fresh air, they prefer to sit in front of the computer. In fact, statistics recently released by the @ORGANIZATION1 show that computers are the @NUM1 leading cause of obesity. Weight problems aren't the only concern. Spending too much time in front of the computer also takes a toll on your eyes. Local doctors have pointed this out. ""@CAPS4 Since computers became a common household item, the number of children with eye problems has increased by about @NUM2 or @NUM3 more kids each year than the previous year,"" says @ORGANIZATION3 of the @ORGANIZATION2. Moreover, typing numerous emails and messages day after day can lead to repetitive strain syndrome, also known as carpal tunnel. Carpal tunnel was more prevalent when typewriters were popular but decreased with the advent of computers with easier - to - type keyboards. However, excessive daily computer use is causing doctors to see more cases of carpal tunnel. It's clear that if you want to stay healthy, you should limit your computer usage.  Secondly, spending too much time on the computer affects your ability to communicate with others. While computers are useful for communication, people have become so accustomed to them that they sometimes find it awkward to talk face - to - face. Their eyes dart everywhere except at the person they're speaking to, they shift their weight, and struggle to find the right words for what should be simple conversations. This awkwardness can also ruin close friendships. Friends may chat endlessly online but have nothing to say when they meet in person. I remember on @DATE1, I didn't see one of my friends at all; we just @CAPS8 each other daily. When we saw each other at school, we found it hard to have a conversation, and it took some time to get used to talking face - to - face again. And this isn't the only way computers put friendships at risk. Personal and meaningful conversations can be disrupted. You might be on the phone with a friend, telling them something important and seeking advice, but a few seconds into the conversation, you're interrupted by a loud @CAPS7! followed by ""hold on, so - and - so just @CAPS8 me."" Clearly, computers seriously impact social skills and personal relationships. Another reason to monitor your computer time is that it can cause you to become disconnected from the real world. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, we must be vigilant about our usage to avoid these negative consequences."
167	167	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, there's a debate about whether computers are good for our society. In my opinion, they have both pros and cons, and it's hard to take a definite side.  Computers are beneficial because children and teens can obtain the information they need for school. They also allow people to chat with others in different locations and help with hand - eye coordination. But there are also negative aspects. People spend too much time on computers instead of exercising, they miss out on enjoying nature, and they stop interacting with friends and family.  I can relate to both sides. For example, one of the advantages of computers is the ability to chat with people around the world. I can relate to this because I live in @CAPS2 @CAPS3, while my mom and step - dad live in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. Thanks to computers, I can chat with them whenever I want. Honestly, I can't imagine my life without a computer and the ability to @CAPS4 now.  However, I can also relate to the negative side, which is that people spend too much time on computers. I'm like many others in this regard. When I was around @NUM1, after school, I'd go straight to my laptop and stay on it until around @NUM2. My grandma always comes in at @NUM3 pm and scolds me, saying, ""You're on that thing too much! It'll hurt your hands!""  In my view, computers can be both good and bad for our society. There's no clear - cut side for me to take. Others may feel the same way, while some may not. It's up to each individual to make a choice. So, ask yourself, ""Do you believe that computers are good or bad for our society?"" In summary, computers are a complex technology with a mix of positive and negative impacts on society."
168	168	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper, do you really think computers aren't that great? Computers are extremely helpful these days, and almost everyone owns one. They are wonderful as they help people find information, connect individuals from all over the world, and offer numerous @ORGANIZATION1 opportunities. I hope that by the end of this letter, you'll agree with me.  First, computers assist people in finding information. With search engines like Google and similar programs, the entire world's knowledge is accessible at your fingertips. School surveys show that @PERCENT1 of all students use computers to research for school projects and assignments. With computers, you can access various websites from around the world on a particular topic and even find online books. This is one significant way computers are valuable, and there are two other excellent reasons.  Second, computers shrink the world as people get to know more individuals through them. More than @PERCENT2 of people email, @CAPS2, or video - chat on a daily basis. Isn't it great when you make a great friend in college, but then discover they live halfway around the world, yet you can still stay in touch via computer? Many military personnel use video - chat to keep in touch with their loved ones back home. Computers are remarkable as they connect people and allow them to maintain relationships even when physically apart. However, there's an even better reason why computers are beneficial.  Finally, computers offer many opportunities in education and employment. According to @ORGANIZATION1, there are more single parents today than ever before, and the number is increasing rapidly due to the economy. Some of these parents could benefit from a better education to earn more money for their families, but finding time to attend school with work and children is difficult. Now, there are numerous online college courses available to get the education you've always desired. Through Craigslist and other online ads, people can post job offers, while others can email their resumes to apply. People can apply for jobs more easily from farther away by seeing online ads. Computers open up many great opportunities for people.  Computers are amazing machines that many people take for granted. They provide information, connect people globally, and offer various @ORGANIZATION1 opportunities. So, @LOCATION1 Newspaper, I hope you can understand my perspective on why computers are so great. In conclusion, computers have transformed our lives in many positive ways and deserve our appreciation.
169	169	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, after reading your article about technological advances, I'd like to share my views on this controversial topic. Around the world, people use computers for all sorts of purposes, whether it's playing games, buying and selling items, or chatting with people in different countries. The possibilities are endless. However, this isn't necessarily a good thing.  Many people, especially adolescents who are attracted to computer games, become addicted to computers. From personal experience of being computer - addicted, I can say that I was almost completely under the computer's control. My grades started to decline, I stopped interacting with my friends and family, and I got into trouble. Many parents watch their children go through this and often feel helpless to stop it. This poses a major problem for parents.  My advice is simple: don't let your children become addicted to computers. In conclusion, while computers offer many benefits, the issue of addiction is a serious concern that parents need to address to protect their children's well - being.
170	170	1	2	There are aspects of the effects computers have on people that I both agree and disagree with. Many people around the world use computers daily, while some use them occasionally. Every time you use a computer, it can provide information. I believe that, overall, computers have a positive effect on people, but they also have their drawbacks.  Not every time you need information will the computer provide what you want. Some websites offer useful information, while others don't fill your mind with positive content. This is one thing I don't like about computers. However, don't think it's all bad because computers have many more advantages.  One of the most widely used features globally is instant @CAPS7. Instant @CAPS7 allows you to communicate with others over the internet. Many people use it to stay in touch with close family members and friends. There are various names for instant @CAPS7, such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 - mail, and more.  Yes, computers can be very addictive. Once in a while, you should take a break and get some fresh air. I agree that some people spend too much time on computers and become lazy. This is a disadvantage as it can prevent you from exercising and spending time with friends and family. It's okay to use the computer for an hour or more a day, but excessive use is not good.  There are so many things you can do on a computer that I can't list them all, including @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS7, and even online shopping. I enjoy using the computer from time to time for all these activities. If you don't have a computer, reading this might persuade you to get one. In my opinion, computers have a very positive effect on people. In conclusion, despite their flaws, computers bring a great deal of value to our lives.
171	171	1	2	To the Local Newspaper, my view on the impacts of computers is that some individuals are spending excessive time on them. While computers are useful for a certain period, spending the whole day on them is not advisable. Firstly, it is better to be outdoors, engaging in activities with others. One could hang out with friends, play sports, or do other things. Spending all day on the computer may lead to losing friends. Secondly, lack of exercise due to sitting in front of the computer all day can cause weight gain. It is beneficial to go for a walk outside or visit the gym. Exercise is crucial for maintaining good health. I know someone who spends all day on the computer and rarely goes outside. Although computers can be educational, it is not healthy to be on them constantly. Lastly, some people may use computers for inappropriate purposes, such as accessing bad websites. This can lead to longer computer usage and even addiction. Some individuals also misuse computer cameras. Therefore, it is better not to spend the entire day on the computer. These are the reasons why computers can have negative effects on people if they do not go outside to engage in activities or socialize with friends.
172	172	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, I concur that people should reduce the time they spend on the computer each day and instead engage in more exercise or spend time with friends and family. While the computer allows us to learn about distant places, it is better to go outside and experience them firsthand rather than sitting at a desk. Our country has one of the highest rates of obesity, and I believe the computer is partly to blame. In our school, most kids have a Facebook account, and about @PERCENT1 of them spend at least an hour on it. This is why people should limit their internet usage, as they are not getting the necessary exercise. This lack of exercise is contributing to our country's high obesity rate. Although the internet enables us to chat with family and friends, we still need to meet them outside. We can exercise by playing sports or going for a walk. Otherwise, our relationships may not be healthy, as sometimes they may not be online for us to chat with. Moreover, if we do not go outside, enjoy nature, and play with friends, we will become lazy and lose the motivation to do anything. In conclusion, it is essential to balance computer use with outdoor activities and social interactions for a healthy lifestyle.
173	173	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I wish to share my thoughts on computers. Without them, the world would face significant challenges. Many people's jobs involve fixing, manufacturing, and selling computers. Some individuals work from home and rely on computers for their livelihoods. Without computers, countless people would lose their jobs and income. Additionally, computers are essential for education. For instance, if someone has a broken finger and cannot hold a pencil, they can type instead. A student can also search for answers online when they have no one to assist them. Computers offer numerous benefits, such as providing directions, phone numbers, and answers to various questions. They also enable online shopping, which is convenient for those living far from their favorite stores. However, I believe that kids should limit their computer use and go outside to exercise. Nowadays, there are too many overweight people. If people went for a walk instead of sitting in front of the computer all day, the obesity rate would decrease. Exercise is vital for maintaining good health. Without it, people may become fat, lazy, sleepy, sick, angry, and depressed. In conclusion, while computers are indispensable, people should exercise more to lead a balanced and healthy lifestyle.
174	174	1	2	Computers are truly remarkable in what they can achieve. They can have a significant impact on a person's financial situation, either positively or negatively. They can produce amazing graphics that even artists may struggle to create. Moreover, computers are widely used for recreational activities. However, they can also consume a large portion of our lives. I'm not referring to real - life experiences but rather the time we spend away from outdoor activities. In terms of handling money, we've come a long way. We used to keep money in chests, but now all it takes is a click and typing in a security number. People can also invest through computers, though investing is risky as there's no guarantee of winning. Modern computers have high - definition screens made of a liquid - crystal formula that hardens. The back - lit pixels work hard to bring stunning graphics to life. People can make money by selling the graphics they create on computers, which is another advantage. I went to school to learn how to produce great graphics. Teens, kids, and adults all use computers for entertainment. On today's computers, we can play games, watch videos, and listen to music. It's a way for people to enjoy themselves. However, some people can get into trouble on the web. But there's nothing wrong with relaxing and playing games for a while. Personally, I like to go on YouTube to find funny videos after school. I once had a YouTube account with many views. The downside of computers is that they can ruin someone's global plans or social life. Some people get addicted and can't stop using the computer until it's taken away. For example, some people get addicted to games like World of Warcraft. I used to have a problem with constantly checking YouTube. In conclusion, despite the problems, I believe that computers offer more benefits than drawbacks.
175	175	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, computers are highly sought - after in today's world, and technology is advancing every day. Social networking sites like @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 are ubiquitous on the internet. Computers have their advantages, but some kids consider them essential to their lives. Excessive computer use can have a negative impact on society. Snacks like Oreos, commonly found in @LOCATION1 and @CAPS6, are often consumed while people are on the computer. When people sit at the computer for hours every day, eating these snacks, they are likely to become overweight. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS7 kids are overweight, which is an unhealthy situation. A large portion of these overweight kids use the computer daily. There's no doubt that obesity is a problem, and computers are exacerbating it. Those who love using the computer usually have a social network account, whether it's @CAPS5 or @CAPS4. Kids often think they won't get in trouble when posting messages or pictures of themselves online. However, there have been cases where a girl was killed due to malicious messages posted about her, and girls have sent nude pictures that were then circulated. Their lives are forever changed because of excessive computer use. If we focus too much on the virtual world and don't learn to be social offline, we may face difficulties in the future. Instead of constantly typing away, we should explore the real world and learn important things. As @CAPS10, we should aim to be less dependent on computers. We can address this issue by spending less time on them. Computers are great, but they should not replace going outside with friends and engaging in activities like playing baseball. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, we need to find a balance to avoid the negative impacts they can bring.
176	176	1	2	Computers and the internet were a technological breakthrough, exposing the average person to things once deemed impossible. However, as these technologies advanced over the years, they've become an addiction so severe that it's begun to threaten people's lives. I've been faced with a choice: to side with these addicting computers or oppose them. The only clear choice is to oppose. First, computers have led to a decrease in exercise worldwide. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 computer users do not exercise. With less exercise globally, nations are becoming more overweight. This is a significant problem in the United States, where computers are a major cause of the population's overweight and unhealthy state. By reducing computer use, we can restore the world to good health and bring back exercise and well - being. Second, online predators are a serious concern. As computer technology has advanced, the number of online predators has increased. I recall a few years ago, while watching the news, a story about a normal teenage girl being killed by someone she met on MySpace. Such incidents continue to occur, and their frequency is rising. Putting people on computers exposes them to the risk of death, which is an extreme problem caused by computers. Finally, time spent on the computer is time taken away from family and friends. This can ruin relationships both within and outside the family. Many people have become extremely addicted to online games. The more they play, the more they isolate themselves from those they know and love. Computers are a leading cause of dysfunctional families as they draw users away from the outside world. These people need to reconnect with their families and friends. You must act now before it's too late and computers take over the world. If you know anyone addicted to computers, do what you can to help them. We need to reduce computer use quickly. Hurry, it's now or never.
177	177	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers are of great benefit to society today. There is a vast amount of knowledge to be gained from a computer, and learning on a computer is far more engaging than from a book. For instance, if a student needs to do a report but has no access to books, all they need to do is type a few words on the internet, and hundreds of websites related to any topic they want to learn about will appear. Another advantage of computers is that they facilitate communication with family and friends who live far away. I, for example, live far from my friends. The only way I can talk to them outside of school is through a computer. We can chat in a chat room or while playing a game. The same applies to family. If your children go on vacation and want to stay in touch, you can type as much as you like and click send, and the message will reach their computer instantly. In contrast, sending a letter by mail can take a week or two to reach the recipient. Moreover, there are numerous exciting things to do on a computer. There are countless games to play and videos to watch. You can create music and even earn money from it. My favorite aspect is the computer programs, especially Flash Macromedia. You can create your own animation clips or even a movie. Computers are truly enjoyable to use and offer numerous advantages in today's society. I am extremely grateful for computers and all the wonderful things they enable us to do. That is why I believe computers are beneficial to society.
178	178	1	2	"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 play a significant role in our world today. People use computers to obtain information, chat in chat rooms, mainly to communicate with and find friends. However, I believe that this over - reliance on computers is causing problems. One reason is the misinformation on websites. People often post and blog lies about others online, which leads to rumors and gossip. These falsehoods can ruin many people's lives and interfere with their well - being. Another issue is the dangerous chat rooms. When chatting in these rooms, you are often unfamiliar with the person you're talking to. They could pose as someone else and be hypocritical. The consequences can be very unpleasant, such as giving out your phone number, address, or other personal information, which could result in death, kidnapping, or cyberbullying. Lastly, there is a lot of false information online. Ads like ""@CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Your @CAPS4 love"" and ""@CAPS2""@CAPS6 Your @CAPS7 @CAPS8 On You?"" are placed on the screen to attract readers and get money from them. For example, they may try to copy your phone number or get your account number to steal your money. These ads are only there for financial gain and do not benefit people. In conclusion, from my perspective, I do not think that computers are an ideal way for people to spend their time."
179	179	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, you may have heard that there are both advantages and disadvantages to using a computer. However, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. Computers are essential for communication. In today's busy world, phone communication is not as convenient as it used to be, as people are often on their computers. Computers allow us to connect with people from different countries, enabling us to learn about their lives. Through social networks like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, we can make plans with friends. They are an important communication technology. In the business world, most transactions are now conducted over the internet or on computers. The @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is fully computerized, which is a major trading method today. Many business transactions and presentations are done on computers for maximum efficiency. Computers also allow us to do business with foreign countries without having to travel there, which is a huge advancement in business. Computers are also powerful learning tools. Search engines enable us to type in keywords and find multiple websites on any topic. We can conduct research with just a click and obtain accurate information. This research can be used for writing essays in school. Computers help us learn both in and out of school. Although computers may have a few drawbacks, their numerous benefits make them a significant technological advancement. They allow us to communicate, conduct business, and learn. Life would be much slower without computers to speed things up.
180	180	1	2	In my opinion, having computers is extremely beneficial to our society, and I have three main reasons for this view. Firstly, computers allow people to relax after a long day of work. Secondly, they facilitate communication with friends and family. Most importantly, they are very useful for schoolwork. After a long and tiring day at work, all you want to do is unwind. Television can get boring, but a computer offers many ways to relax. You can go on @CAPS2 to watch funny videos or visit @CAPS3 to view your friends' new photo albums. There are also numerous games, such as @CAPS4 come or @CAPS5 cam, that can be a lot of fun. Clearly, computers are an excellent way to calm down on a rough day. Computers also enable us to communicate with friends and family. AIM is a great platform for chatting with friends and planning get - togethers. @CAPS3 and @CAPS7 are wonderful websites for keeping in touch with old friends and even making new ones. Many teenagers and adults are on @CAPS3 because it's so engaging. As we get older, we tend to lose touch with our friends, but @CAPS3 helps us maintain those relationships. Most importantly, computers are indispensable for schoolwork. Without a computer, it's difficult to obtain pictures from @ORGANIZATION1 or type an essay. Some teachers require students to type their essays, and a computer is necessary in such cases. You can also use the computer to search for information on @LOCATION1. Teachers often post extra - credit assignments online, and a computer helps us stay on top of our schoolwork. In conclusion, computers are beneficial to society. They help us relax, keep us connected with friends and family, and are very useful for schoolwork. I hope you now understand how important and useful computers are in our society.
181	181	1	2	"Dear Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, computers have been in existence for @MONTH1 years. Through the internet, one can engage in various activities such as playing games, conducting research, and communicating with friends and family via a computer. The advancements in computer technology bring numerous benefits to @CAPS1 society. Firstly, using computers can enhance hand - eye coordination and reflexes. For instance, my brother, Patrick, had trouble with eye - focusing. His doctor advised him to play computer games to improve his hand - eye coordination. In fact, @PERCENT1 of people recognize the significant positive impact of computers on reflexes and hand - eye coordination. Given these benefits, it is unjust to label computer use as bad when it clearly contributes positively to @CAPS1 society.  Secondly, computers are an enormous source of information. The internet offers a vast amount of knowledge for people of all ages who are eager to learn. For example, @PERCENT2 of schools assign students to conduct research using computers. The principal of New City @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON2, stated that ""@CAPS1 students use computers at least weekly, if not more. They are a fantastic resource with endless information."" Computers are a gateway to boundless knowledge that everyone should have access to.  Lastly, computers facilitate communication. In today's world, many people have friends or family living far away. I have a friend in @LOCATION1 whom I miss dearly. Since long - distance phone calls are often expensive, I rely on computers to stay in touch. A local teenage boy, @PERSON1, said, ""I use my computer to stay connected with friends and family in another county. I don't know what I would do without it."" This shows that thousands of people depend on computers for communication.  In conclusion, computers are essential for @MONTH1 reasons. They assist people, educate, and connect individuals. In my opinion, having access to a computer is crucial for a fulfilling life."
182	182	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that people should spend less time on their computers. There are three main reasons for this view.  Firstly, people with computers often stay in their rooms all day, depriving themselves of fresh air. Those who love and study animals should go outside to observe and study them in their natural habitat. While it is possible to study animals through a computer, it is far better to experience nature firsthand rather than being glued to a computer screen.  Secondly, computer use leads to a lack of exercise. People are becoming overweight and lazy because they spend too much time sitting in front of a computer without any physical movement. If one enjoys using the computer for study, they should also take time to go for a walk, run, jog, or ride a bike.  Lastly, excessive computer use reduces the time people spend interacting with their friends and family. People should get off the computer, make plans with their family, and have get - togethers. Those who are constantly on the computer may become depressed due to a lack of family interaction and may be unaware of what is happening around them.  These are my reasons for believing that we should limit our computer time. We should spend more time with friends and family or go outside and enjoy nature.
183	183	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, I overheard a conversation about the amount of time families spend on computers. In my opinion, people should not stare at a computer screen for extended periods. This is because it takes time away from important tasks, there are healthier alternatives like going outside or being active, and it allows for more quality time with family and friends.  Spending too much time on the computer means neglecting other tasks. For teens, it could be doing homework, and for adults, it could be work. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teens are easily distracted by social networking sites such as ""@CAPS1"", ""Twitter"", and ""AOL"". Workers in the workplace are also distracted. Instead of getting things done, they turn to the computer when the job gets boring. Children could be doing chores or helping around the house, but they choose to be on the computer. Teens often fall into a routine of waking up, getting ready, going on the computer, going to school, coming home, having a snack, and then going back to the computer. This habit needs to be broken.  Staring at a computer screen for long periods is unhealthy. According to a doctor at @ORGANIZATION1, ""As technology advances, seizure rates have also gone up."" Engaging in sports or simply going outside to play is a healthier and more enjoyable alternative. Moreover, being on the computer means no exercise, while being active helps maintain a good shape and is fun.  The most important reason to limit computer time is to spend more time with family and friends. Many people barely see their family at home because they are absorbed in the computer. Laptops make it easier to isolate oneself. Hanging out with friends in person is much better than just talking to them online.  In conclusion, we should limit our computer time to complete other tasks, stay active, and spend quality time with friends and family."
184	184	1	2	Dear newspaper readers with @CAPS1, I am writing this article to discuss the issue of @CAPS1 using the computer for more than an hour a day.  The first problem is that excessive computer use makes @CAPS1 inattentive in school. When they play on the computer a lot, they can only think about it and cannot focus on their studies. This over - indulgence can disrupt their academic performance and prevent them from concentrating in class.  The second issue is that it can lead to an addiction. Just like drugs, spending more than an hour on the computer can make @CAPS1 addicted. If you don't want your @CAPS1 to be addicted to drugs, you surely don't want them to be addicted to the computer. Constantly talking about the computer can make @CAPS1 seem like they have no other life, which is not a desirable situation.  Most importantly, allowing @CAPS1 to play the computer for more than an hour a day can cause them to become overweight. They only get up to go to the bathroom or eat and do not engage in any outdoor activities or exercise. I know this from personal experience. My brother is in the hospital because of excessive computer use, and the doctor is not sure if he will recover. I sincerely hope that you will not let your @CAPS1 go through the same thing, as it can ruin their lives.  Thank you for taking the time to read this article. I hope you will remember these points and limit your @CAPS1's computer time.
185	185	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, in today's world, many people use computers, and while some oppose excessive computer use, arguing that it takes time away from enjoying nature, exercising, and interacting with family and friends, I believe computers have many positive effects on people.  One significant effect is that computers enable communication with people we don't see often. Not all our friends attend the same school, so we can use platforms like email, MySpace, and Facebook to stay in touch. Instead of driving long distances to meet them, we can easily communicate online.  Another effect is the ability to look up information. When doing a project, we may lack sufficient information, but a computer can provide endless resources. It can also help when planning a trip, as we can find out the cost, travel time, and other details. There is no other place as convenient as a computer to get such information.  Finally, computers give us something to do when we are bored. We can play games, watch videos on YouTube, or download music. For example, watching funny videos on the computer can keep us entertained.  In conclusion, computers have many positive effects on people. They allow us to communicate with others, access information, and have entertainment. Despite the concerns of some, I firmly believe that the benefits of computers outweigh the drawbacks, and I hope you will agree with me.
186	186	1	2	I am writing to the newspaper to advocate for publishing an article about the negative impacts of computers on people. Computers lead to poor health, facilitate cyberbullying, and have a detrimental effect on academic performance.  Firstly, computers contribute to poor health. Most individuals do not engage in sufficient physical activity while using computers, which can result in obesity. Obesity, in turn, often leads to diabetes.  Secondly, cyberbullying is a significant issue associated with computers. When children are bullied online, they experience low self - esteem and depression. For instance, a man visited our school to share the tragic story of his son, who committed suicide due to being bullied both online and at school.  Finally, computers have a negative impact on school performance. Children spend excessive time on computers, neglecting their homework and test preparation. They become distracted in school, thinking only about getting home to use the computer. Eventually, some may consider school a waste of time and drop out. It is a proven fact that @PERCENT1 of school dropouts are those who are constantly on the computer and view school as unimportant.  In conclusion, computers have clear negative effects on people in terms of health, social well - being, and academic achievement.
187	187	1	2	I'm writing to the newspaper to express my belief that people should have computers. Computers offer numerous benefits. For kids, there are educational games like math games and reading programs that aid in learning. Adults can utilize computers to watch workout videos, pay bills, and kids can complete their homework on them.  However, computers also have their drawbacks. Kids may claim to be doing homework but instead end up on platforms like YouTube, MySpace, or Facebook.  Overall, the advantages of computers outweigh the disadvantages. That's why I believe we should have computers in our lives.
188	188	1	2	Dear local newspaper, there is a debate about whether computers have a negative impact on family and friends or are an important part of society. I side with the view that computers are important.  Computers are a valuable tool for students to research information for school. They also enable people to communicate with friends through platforms like Facebook or @CAPS1. Additionally, writing on a computer allows for easy drafting, saving, and making final revisions.  Firstly, computers provide a quick and efficient way to conduct research for school projects or papers. While some argue that computers reduce family time, the same can be said for books, which may take up more time and yield less information. For example, a book about multiple people might only offer a few sentences of relevant information after a long read. Online research is faster as one can click from one page to another to gather more data. Without computers, people would have to spend time at the library searching for information.  Secondly, social media platforms like Facebook and @CAPS1 help people stay connected with friends. Contrary to the belief that computers distract from friends, they actually enhance communication. For instance, when on vacation and missing friends, one can easily connect with them via computer. Chat rooms also offer the opportunity to meet new people.  Finally, writing on a computer simplifies the writing process. Instead of rewriting a paper multiple times, one can write a draft, review it, and make necessary changes. Computers also assist with spelling.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in education, social interaction, and writing, making them an important part of society.
189	189	1	2	Dear newspaper, technology is everywhere, and this trend is not going to change. To manage technology use, scheduling, encouragement, and engaging in activities are effective strategies.  Scheduling is essential. Limit computer time and ensure that for every half - hour of computer use, spend at least @NUM1 minutes outside or with friends. Try to commit the schedule to memory.  Encouragement is also powerful. It helps me and many others. We should encourage our family and friends, and it's heartening to know that the government is also taking steps to address technology - related issues.  Activities can divert people's attention from the computer. Participate in neighborhood activities or after - school activities. They can be a lot of fun.  To sum up, if you believe that scheduling helps, appreciate the power of encouragement, and find activities a good distraction, then these strategies are definitely beneficial in managing technology use.
190	190	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, it's not hard to imagine a world where technology dominates human interaction. While some see this as progress, I firmly believe that computers have negative effects on people. They detach people from reality, create false personas, and offer no physical benefits.  Computers detach people from real - world interactions. It's easier for someone to sit in front of a computer, aimlessly scrolling through social networking sites, rather than going out to meet new people. Online friend requests can't compare to the first - hand experience of meeting someone in person. Moreover, computer use can reduce the time spent with family members.  The computer also allows for the creation of false personas. On platforms like Facebook or @CAPS3, it's easy to make false claims about oneself or others. This can lead to ""friendships"" based on false impressions, which may result in unstable relationships.  In a nation facing a severe health crisis, computers offer no physical gain. With the easy availability of fast food and drugs, excessive computer use by those lacking discipline can exacerbate the problem.  In conclusion, I believe that computers are gradually eroding the human element. Their effects, such as detaching from reality, creating false personas, and lacking physical benefits, are severe. I hope this perspective will make you reconsider the role of computers in our lives."
191	191	1	2	Dear The @CAPS1, I recognize that you have concerns regarding computers. However, I believe these concerns are unfounded as computers offer numerous positive aspects. They enhance hand - eye coordination, facilitate learning about distant places and people, and enable online communication with family and friends.  Computers are excellent tools for improving hand - eye coordination. There are countless engaging online games that can enhance reflexes and eyesight. For some individuals, this can improve their physical responsiveness by making their eyes more perceptive.  Another significant advantage of computers is the ability to learn about far - off locations and people. If you desire to visit a distant place but are unable to do so, you can simply search for it on your computer and feel as if you are actually there. It also aids in studying people from remote areas whom you may never meet in person.  Finally, computers allow you to communicate with family and friends online. There are various websites where you can interact and socialize with your loved ones. This keeps your social circle connected and happy.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are a remarkable, enjoyable, and useful invention. Please keep these positive features in mind and refrain from removing computers, as we truly need them.
192	192	1	2	How many times do you use the computer in a day? A great deal, right? I am convinced that computers are extremely beneficial to society. The internet is a boon to many people because it is highly convenient. It provides people with the ability to communicate online and makes many aspects of life easier.  For students, the internet is a valuable study resource. From personal experience, when I lack sufficient study materials, the internet comes to my rescue. In the job market, @PERCENT1 of people aged @NUM1 have internet - based jobs, and it also helps others find employment. Moreover, the internet is a great shopping tool. I recall needing a special school book that was unavailable in bookstores, but my mom was able to order it online.  Computers also offer people the opportunity to learn about far - off places. Many Americans cannot afford to travel extensively abroad. With computers, they can explore these places, sometimes even getting a virtual experience of being there. For instance, when my family went to a wedding in @LOCATION1, we used the internet to learn about local food and weather. People can also discover their ancestral roots, finding recipes, religious practices, and holidays associated with those places.  Another advantage of computers is that they enable people to stay in touch. Friends may lose contact over time, but the internet helps them reconnect. There are platforms like Facebook and websites that can track down high - school classmates. Additionally, online dating sites connect people, and @PERCENT2 of people on these sites set up meetings. Long - distance communication is made easier through online chat platforms when phone calls are not feasible.  Without a doubt, computers are extremely helpful. They assist a large number of people in our society. People rely on the internet for learning, exploring, and socializing. @CAPS1, don't have negative thoughts about computers as they have had a profound impact on our society.
193	193	1	2	Dear @PERSON1 weekly, the new millennium has ushered in a new wave of technology, with computers being the most widely used invention. Computers offer numerous benefits, such as teaching us about vacation spots or far - off countries, enabling communication with friends and family, and improving hand - eye coordination.  Computers are excellent resources for learning about overseas vacation destinations. Their influence can be substantial. For example, someone planning a trip to the Bahamas might discover new places like @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION3 through computer research.  Computers are also invaluable for students. When working on projects about different parts of the world, students often turn to computers as their primary source of information. I always use the computer first when I have an essay to write.  In terms of communication, computers help us stay connected with loved ones. My grandmother recently moved to @LOCATION2, and while I can only talk to her on the phone, the webcam on my computer allows me to see her. Social media platforms like @CAPS1 or Twitter keep us in touch with high - school friends, and we can also send emails to say hello.  Computers enhance hand - eye coordination, which is crucial in sports like @CAPS2. Typing on the computer while looking at the screen trains you to do two things simultaneously, improving your hand - eye coordination.  In conclusion, computers are a great source of knowledge. They help us stay in touch with friends and family, and they teach us important physical skills. Undoubtedly, computers are an essential piece of technology.
194	194	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, do you want our society to become a group of obese, lazy individuals with no appreciation for family, friends, or nature? If our society becomes overly dependent on computers, this is the likely outcome.  Have you read @CAPS3 @NUM1? In the book, the government uses technology to brainwash and manipulate people. If our society follows a similar path of over - dependence on computers and technology, we will decline from a respected world power to a third - world country.  Recent research from @ORGANIZATION1 indicates that @PERCENT1 of people who spend more than an hour and a half on their computers daily weigh over @NUM2 pounds. Excessive computer use can lead to a decline in social skills. Babies may learn to type before they learn to talk or walk.  Psychologist @PERSON1 states that people with more friends have a @PERCENT2 reduced risk of depression. However, those who use the computer too much tend to lose friends and become isolated from their families, which can have a negative impact on mental health.  Moreover, excessive computer use leads to a lack of respect for nature. Nature affects our daily lives, and everything we have has a basis in it. We depend on nature, and if we don't respect it, it can harm us.  Everything, including computer use, should be in moderation. When we don't limit our computer time, it has severe consequences. Our society will lose respect, our relationships will suffer, and our health will be at risk. Therefore, it is essential to limit computer usage now to avoid these problems.
195	195	1	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1's idea about ""Computers"" is truly innovative. In today's world, we definitely need computers to access information. Research shows that over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 consider computers indispensable.  Computers offer several benefits. They allow us to look up information about different places, and they enable us to chat with family and friends. While @CAPS1 believes that local internet use is only suitable for those who understand it well, it's important to note that computers also play a role in maintaining a balanced lifestyle. For instance, it's advisable for young people to go to bed by @NUM1 pm and not forget to enjoy the fresh air and nature.  In conclusion, the internet and computers have become very useful for people. They provide a wealth of information and facilitate communication, but we should also use them in a balanced way, considering other aspects of life."
196	196	1	2	In today's world, I firmly believe that the use of computers is an extremely positive development. People utilize computers for various essential purposes, including conducting research, staying connected with friends and family, and engaging with music. These activities are equally important for both adults and kids.  Computers serve as an excellent source for research on specific topics. Kids across the @LOCATION1 rely on the internet to complete class projects, while adults can use them to look up recipes. Whenever one needs assistance, the computer is always available. Some individuals even depend on computers for their jobs, as they can help with a multitude of tasks.  Another significant advantage of computers is the ability to stay in touch with friends and family. Webcams are a great feature on computers, enabling users to see and talk to people, regardless of the distance. Social media platforms like MySpace and Facebook are also popular for sharing pictures and communicating with selected friends. Instant messaging is another convenient way to interact with friends online.  Lastly, computers offer a wide range of possibilities for music. Users can listen to music, transfer it to an iPod or @NUM1 player, and even create music using specific programs. Music is loved by people of all age groups, making this aspect of computer use highly appealing.  In conclusion, having a computer is a very positive thing. It allows for research, connection with loved ones, and engagement with music. There are numerous other benefits that computers offer, and I truly believe that the world would be vastly different without them.
197	197	1	2	"Dear newspaper, although computers can be captivating, they are one of the most essential tools in our lives. They are used for various purposes, such as schoolwork, trip planning, and staying updated with the latest news.  When faced with a science project on protoplasms, the computer provides an abundance of information that can significantly enhance the quality of the report. Similarly, when writing a biography, the computer allows for in - depth research beyond the provided material.  In terms of trip planning, when a ""five - nights and four - days"" trip to @ORGANIZATION1 is on offer, the computer helps in finding the best deal. A research among my friends showed that six out of seven parents had found deals on trips to @ORGANIZATION1 using their computers. Road - trip enthusiasts can also find the best deals through the computer.  For those living in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4 planning a trip to @LOCATION1, or in @LOCATION2 anticipating the hottest day on @DATE1, the computer provides crucial information. It not only keeps us informed about local events but also about global disasters like the earthquake in @LOCATION5 and how we can contribute to the relief efforts.  In conclusion, computers are invaluable. They can help students achieve better grades, assist in finding the best travel deals, and keep us informed about the world. If we can make good use of them, we will realize how indispensable they are."
198	198	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, statistics show that @PERCENT1 of humans in the @LOCATION2 alone spend most of their time on a computer or laptop. In my opinion, the widespread use of computers has a negative impact on humans, as it leads to a lack of exercise and limits physical interaction.  The number of people with insufficient exercise has increased over the past decade. Doctor @PERSON1, an expert in the relationship between health and computers, surveyed @NUM1 people. @PERCENT2 of them stated that they rarely go outside because they are immersed in the digital world. This indicates that only one in twenty people get any form of exercise. @PERSON2 pointed out that this statistic implies that most people are physically unhealthy, a problem that needs to be addressed. Prolonged computer use and lack of exercise contribute to poor health.  In addition to the exercise issue, many humans are losing the physical interaction they should have. As technology has advanced, people have become more reliant on computers, and as a result, they miss out on face - to - face interactions. @PERSON3, a college graduate, shared his experience. When he was young, he was addicted to the computer and rarely talked to his family. He regretted this and changed his ways in high school. Physical interaction is essential for a fulfilling life.  In conclusion, the overuse of computers has led to a growing problem in the @LOCATION1. The main negative effects are the lack of exercise and the reduction of physical interaction between humans. We must be aware that computers can have a detrimental impact on many people's lives.
199	199	1	2	@ORGANIZATION1, listen to the click - clack of @ORGANIZATION2 computer keys. Computers are now everywhere, even in the poorest places like @LOCATION3. However, excessive use of computers is taking away the meaning and enjoyment of life.  Computers are our main source of information and leisure, but we are forgetting that there is a real life outside the digital world, such as spending time with family and enjoying nature. Too much computer use is also leading to poor health. It can cause vision problems and obesity, as people sit all day without exercising.  I have personal experience of this problem. When I was @NUM1, I was addicted to the computer. I gained a lot of weight, and to this day, I haven't lost it. Obesity is not just caused by overeating; it is also a result of lack of physical activity, which the computer prevents us from doing. According to @PERCENT1 of people from @LOCATION1, the computer is a major contributor to obesity.  Computers are also taking away family time. @PERCENT2 of families are not spending as much time together as they would like because of computers. In my family, we used to have a lot of quality time together, but now, due to the computer, I rarely get to do anything with my family.  Moreover, in @LOCATION1, which has beautiful nature, people are too busy with computers to appreciate it. I once witnessed a camping trip where a boy brought his computer, and everyone ended up ignoring nature and playing with the computer.  In conclusion, the computer is time - consuming and unhealthy. We should put down the computer, spend more time with family, and enjoy nature. Otherwise, we will surely regret it in the future.
200	200	1	2	Dear Readers of @LOCATION1, I've noticed a debate about the effects of computers on people. I firmly believe that having computers around is beneficial for several reasons.  Firstly, computers are extremely helpful for students' schoolwork. When students write essays on a computer, their work often looks neater and more professional, which can lead to higher grades. A college university poll found that @PERCENT1 of students would be at a loss without their computers or laptops. One student even said that they would probably fail most of their classes without their laptop.  Secondly, computers allow us to learn about far - away places and other countries. In a poll I conducted, @PERCENT2 of people said they use the computer to find out what's going on in other countries. It's a very handy tool for staying informed about global events.  Lastly, computers with webcams are a great way to connect with loved ones. For example, if one's spouse is in @LOCATION2 and they can't be physically together, they can use a webcam to communicate.  In conclusion, computers are clearly advantageous. They assist students in their studies, enable us to learn about the world, and help us stay connected with others. I hope you can now see why I believe having computers around is a good thing.
201	201	1	2	In the era of rapid advancement of computers and modern technology, an increasing number of individuals are embracing these tools. While some contend that computers have a negative impact on @LOCATION1, I firmly believe they represent an extraordinary breakthrough in modern science. When used in moderation, computers are highly suitable for schoolwork and communication. Computers simplify school projects to such an extent that it's hard to imagine how we could manage without them. Our social studies teacher, @PERSON1, states that @PERCENT1 of his projects involve computer - related tasks. The internet is an excellent resource for researching large papers and projects. With over thirty - million educational and informational websites, it's easy to quickly and effortlessly find the required information. After research, typing a report is straightforward. For non - written reports, there are numerous programs for creating elaborate presentations. For example, Microsoft @CAPS1 enables users to design exotic backgrounds, texts, and unique animations that make the content stand out. Computers also offer an ideal means of communicating with friends and family. Email is a fast and convenient way to convey messages. For chatting, @CAPS2 or instant messaging can be used, allowing for rapid typing and sending of messages. These programs are innovative ways to stay in touch with family members who are away. For instance, if my dad travels to @LOCATION2 on business, we can exchange emails daily. With @ORGANIZATION1 (video chat), it's as if the person is right at home. However, computers have their drawbacks. Although they are beneficial for communication and schoolwork, excessive use can be unhealthy. My older brother, @PERSON2, a high - school senior, is a case in point. He attends school from @NUM1 to @NUM2:pm. Upon returning home, he heads straight to his computer and spends at least five hours on it every night, leaving little time for anything else, including sleep and dinner. In conclusion, computers are a remarkable invention in modern technology, provided that people exercise self - restraint. With new features emerging daily, the future of computers is full of possibilities.
202	202	1	2	I wholeheartedly concur with those who believe that computers have a negative impact on us today. Despite their many advantages, computers bring numerous negative effects to their users. New technologies like webcams for video chatting and cellphones for taking pictures, though amazing, have their downsides. Cyberbullying has led to many suicides. It involves people harassing kids over the internet. Some individuals send explicit pictures online or during webcam sessions, which is not only illegal but also absurd. Moreover, there are websites where personal pictures can be posted, significantly affecting one's life. Many people have computer games or download them from websites. Most often, they become addicted. They would play all day if possible and constantly yearn to play when they're not. This addiction causes them to miss out on many things. They may not exercise enough, neglect their homework, resulting in lower grades, and spend less time with family. It can also change a person's character. Safety is of utmost importance when using computers. There are predators all over the internet who may pose as classmates and ask for one's address. One should never disclose personal information such as home address or full name online, as it could put one's life and the lives of family members at risk. Computers can be a source of fun and a vast amount of information, but users must be smart. Avoid sharing personal information or sending private pictures, as they could spread across the internet quickly. Prioritize family, grades, and health over computer games. In conclusion, while computers have their allure, it's crucial to use them responsibly to avoid the numerous negative consequences they can bring.
203	203	1	2	I believe that computers are essential tools for people. They can help those who are unable to travel physically or mentally to see the world. Computers can also be used to send crucial messages, and they assist in maintaining relationships between loved ones who are far apart. Some people are physically or mentally unable to travel, perhaps due to illness or fear. For such individuals, the internet provides a window to the world. They can look up pictures and information about places they've never visited, which helps them gain a better understanding of the world. Additionally, the internet can offer resources to help people overcome their fears, enabling them to embark on real - life travels. For those who can't afford to travel, the internet can help them find well - paying jobs, which in turn can finance their trips. Computers can also play a vital role in preventing disasters and resolving conflicts. Consider a situation where a misunderstanding leads to a war. If the government discovers the truth and can send a message to the attackers, clarifying the situation, the war could end. Similarly, if someone discovers a bomb in the White House and sends a warning message, it could save the lives of everyone in the building. In terms of relationships, computers are invaluable. For example, military personnel can use webcams on computers to see and talk to their children, keeping the family bond intact. On social media platforms like Facebook, people can reconnect with old friends. In conclusion, computers are capable of performing many helpful functions. They can mend relationships, save lives, help people overcome fears, and allow them to experience the world. Their benefits far outweigh the minor inconveniences they may cause.
204	204	1	2	You asked for my opinion on the effects of computers on people, and I firmly believe that computers have positive impacts. They are educational tools and reliable resources that many people depend on. When you have a question that no one at home can answer, you can @ORGANIZATION2 it on the computer. When working on a school project and the library is closed, the computer becomes an indispensable research tool. I recall entering a @CAPS1 contest and losing the @CAPS2, but I was able to retrieve it from my computer. Computers are also crucial in the workplace. Approximately @PERCENT1 of jobs worldwide rely on computer technology. For example, waste management jobs would be extremely difficult without computers to track the amount of trash. Banks use computers to manage customers' accounts, and lawyers use them to transcribe and record conversations accurately. Without computers, many jobs would face significant challenges. Some online games are also educational. @CAPS4 teaches new words, @CAPS5 improves number - counting skills, and @CAPS6 @CAPS7 sharpens strategic thinking and exercises the brain. In conclusion, the positive effects of computers on people are undeniable. They are helpful, reliable, and educational. It's time to recognize these benefits and agree that computers have a positive influence on our lives.
205	205	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1. I've recently learned about people's views on computers and their effects. In my opinion, computers have a highly negative influence on young kids, teens, and adults, bringing along many harmful consequences. One major issue is that people who are overly engrossed in computers have less time for exercise and self - care. They only experience nature through online pictures, missing out on the full beauty of the real world. Moreover, they become increasingly distant from their loved ones. Our society seems to have lost the ability to think independently. I sincerely hope that my words can change some people's minds. Exercise is a crucial part of life, especially for growing kids and teens. On the computer, there are few exercise benefits. According to @PERSON2 of the ""@CAPS3 feel right with @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"" in Huntington Beach, @LOCATION1, ""@CAPS2 @PERCENT1 of kids with @CAPS7 problems like obesity have access to the internet."" When people are consumed by computers, they have no thoughts of staying fit and may instead snack while typing. With global warming affecting the environment, the natural world is constantly changing. Breathing fresh air and enjoying the outdoors can calm a stressed child. In the past, kids used to play games like sidewalk chalk, tag, or just run around. Now, instead of climbing trees, people are using their mouse to navigate to the next website. We often take the simple joys of life for granted, and one day we'll look back and miss those days. Family time is also essential. In today's society, just because computers are a common household item doesn't mean family and friends should be neglected. Game nights and family gatherings seem to have disappeared. If you want to hang out with a friend, go to their house in person instead of relying on the computer. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computers far outweigh their positive aspects. Although computers can be used to send quick messages, there's nothing wrong with traditional methods like phone calls or letters. We should think carefully about our computer use and prioritize our health, family, and the real world."
206	206	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have had a profound impact on human society and are indeed one of the greatest inventions. There are numerous help programs and websites that computers provide, which greatly assist people in their daily lives. Students, in particular, can study from educational web - pages. Moreover, people can communicate online and type stories instead of handwriting them. The ability to study online is extremely beneficial. Different websites are filled with vast amounts of information and accurate facts, which significantly influence the grades of most students. It has been found that @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 visit educational websites for writing - related information, whether it's for an essay or a non - fiction story. Thanks to computers, students have a high probability of getting a passing grade. Online communication has had a global impact. Whether using Facebook, @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, etc., communicating with family and friends is wonderful. For example, I use Facebook to talk to my family in @LOCATION2, whom I see only once every couple of years. Online communication offers an easy way to talk to others instantly with just a click of a button. Finally, people can type letters or stories on programs like Microsoft Word. This is a faster and easier way of writing. Finishing the task earlier gives people extra leisure time or more time to complete other work. I, myself, type very fast after practice. In conclusion, the invention of computers has and still does help society in many ways. The three aspects I've mentioned in this letter are, in my opinion, the most impactful. I hope this helps you understand how computers have affected people. Thank you for reading my letter. Have a good day.
207	207	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 believes that computers are not harmful at all. They enable people to learn about new things and interact with others globally. They also help people stay in touch with family and friends around the world. Computers serve as a valuable learning tool. In schools like mine, there are over a hundred computers, all dedicated to educational purposes. Even if students attempt to access other websites, they are redirected to blocked pages. Computers were used to create the blueprints for cars and other machines. Their primary use is for learning. If one is planning a vacation but is unsure about the local situation, a computer can offer assistance. It allows users to take virtual tours to see the place and its people, and provides guidance on local traditions and beliefs. Computers are also an excellent means of communication. Family members living abroad can use them to keep in touch and check on each other. The same goes for old friends who have moved away. In summary, computers are not harmful. They provide a good education, help people learn about different cultures, and facilitate communication with friends and family. This clearly shows that computers help rather than harm people.
208	208	1	2	Dear newspaper editor, I've recently learned that some people think computers have a negative impact on people. However, I firmly believe that computers have a positive influence. Computers make it easier to learn about other countries. They also help people communicate with those from different countries and learn about various cultures, religions, and traditions. The reasons some people believe computers have a negative impact are that individuals are spending more time on the computer than with their families, and they use the computer more than exercise machines, bicycles, or scooters. Now that you're aware of both the positive and negative effects of computers, which side will you choose? The one opposing computers or the one in favor? In my view, I'd choose the side that supports the use of computers as their benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.
209	209	1	2	Dear local newspaper editor, @CAPS1's opinion is that using a computer is not bad and it doesn't rot your brain like video games. There are several good reasons why computers are beneficial. Computers can help improve hand - eye coordination. They can be used for doing homework or searching for stores. Although some old computers are slow, new ones as of @DATE1 are much better. Computers can also enhance reading skills. You can play games, talk to friends, and listen to music on them. Many people use computers to find jobs, learn about healthy eating and exercise, and pay bills online, which is much easier than traditional methods. In conclusion, the computer is an easy and useful way for various activities, and you should agree with @CAPS1's opinion.
210	210	1	2	Dear Newspaper, The question is whether people are spending too much time on the computer. In my opinion, they aren't, as there are numerous benefits. Using a computer helps develop hand - eye coordination. Typing, playing online games, or surfing the web on the computer all contribute to this important skill. Hand - eye coordination is used in daily activities such as sports, taking notes, and playing video games. It's crucial as most teachers today expect students to type and print neat papers. If kids can learn hand - eye coordination on the computer, they can type faster and submit neater work. Computers are also a great learning tool. My world cultures teacher allows us to use an online textbook if we don't finish our homework in class, which is much more convenient than carrying a heavy textbook. Taking college courses online is also much easier, especially for working parents. Everything can be done on a portable laptop without the need to commute to college. Learning about different places on a computer is easy and fun. There are websites with pictures of beautiful foreign locations, deserts, and tropical rainforests with monkeys and tigers. With the prevalence of cell phones, many people have ditched their home phones to save money. However, cell phones can lose signal. Computers offer a reliable way to communicate through forums, chats, websites, and email. It's easy, free, and allows for intelligent conversations. In conclusion, while people should also spend time outside or with family, using the computer in moderation is beneficial. It helps develop hand - eye coordination and facilitates easy communication and learning.
211	211	1	2	While not everyone believes that computers are beneficial, they are indeed an excellent resource for gathering information. However, it's not advisable to be on the computer for extended periods, such as seven hours a day. Occasional use is acceptable, but spending the entire day on it without engaging in other activities is extremely unhealthy. People should limit their computer time and avoid overusing it. As mentioned earlier, computers are great for obtaining information. If you own a computer or laptop and need to look up something, the internet is readily available. For kids working on homework or projects, the computer can be a valuable tool to find facts and information, which is much more convenient than searching through books. In conclusion, computers possess many positive qualities and resources, and they are not inherently bad or unhealthy, as long as they do not become the sole focus of one's life.
212	212	1	2	In my opinion, people are spending an excessive amount of time on their computers and are failing to appreciate nature and other aspects of life. There are three main reasons for this. First, people tend to spend a lot of time surfing the web. There are millions of websites, and people often spend hours browsing or making purchases instead of using the computer for more productive purposes like homework or business. Additionally, they play too many video games. Second, individuals spend hours on platforms like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or using webcams to talk to others. For some, this becomes their entire life, and they may have online friends but no real - life ones. I know someone who, after school, only talks to people on @CAPS1 and has no friends in the real world. Third, while on the computer, people often consume junk food like potato chips, cookies, and soda and get no exercise. Doing this for a week can make them tired, sleepy, and can lead to weight gain and an unhealthy body. In conclusion, these reasons show that people should reduce their computer time and engage in more real - life activities.
213	213	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I agree that some people spend too much time on the computer. There are several reasons why people should limit their computer use. First, exercise is crucial. People don't need to be on the computer all day. They can run, jog, or go for bike rides. While it's okay to use the computer occasionally for learning, there are also books and schools for that purpose. Second, going outside is important. People need fresh air, and being locked inside all day is not good. They can explore, go on hikes, and have a great time. They can also visit the zoo to learn about nature. Third, there are many other ways to have fun and interact with others. People can talk to their friends, go to the mall, have sleep - overs, and watch movies. They should have direct conversations with friends instead of just talking online. In conclusion, people don't need to be on the computer all day. They can engage in other activities and still learn while having fun. Thank you for your time, and I hope to communicate with you again soon.
214	214	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, imagine you're at home, glued to your computer. It might have been hours or even days since you last took a breath of fresh air outside. This may seem crazy, but it's a reality for over <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of the population in @LOCATION1. Computers are everywhere - in movies, chain restaurants, at home, in the office, and in schools. Many experts are worried that people are spending too much time on computers, resulting in less exercise, less enjoyment of nature, and less interaction with family and friends. I believe that people everywhere should limit their computer use to a certain amount each day. We're wasting our days on virtual games and downloads. For one, people are spending too much time on computers and not enough time exercising. In the past two years, obesity has become a major problem in @LOCATION1, with over @PERCENT1 of the population affected. Obesity significantly increases the risk of diseases like diabetes, heart failure, and depression. My cousin recently passed away from cancer caused by obesity. We can't just sit around; we need to get up and move away from the computer. Also, people should start enjoying nature. <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of people in @LOCATION1 don't spend enough time outdoors. With global warming harming our environment, people should care enough to spend some time outside. The environment is disappearing day by day. In conclusion, people need to reduce their computer use and engage in more physical and outdoor activities.
215	215	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION2, I'm concerned about the negative side - effects that new technologies, especially computers, have on humans. Computers are harming people as they spend too much time on them, which leads to less exercise, less time outdoors enjoying nature, and less interaction with family and friends. First, people are spending excessive time surfing the net. Studies show that the average @CAPS1 spends @NUM1 hours a day on the computer, almost double the recommended time. Dr. @DR1 from the @CAPS1 technology society warns that if this trend continues, most @CAPS3 will lose contact with family and friends outside the social computer network. The average weight of a @NUM2 - year - old has increased from @NUM3 pounds in @DATE1 to @NUM4 pounds today. Statistics indicate that the main cause is the excessive time spent on computers and the lack of exercise. Teenagers should exercise three times a week for thirty minutes each, but the average adolescent only spends ten minutes a week exercising (excluding gym). All these numbers need to change, and reducing computer use is a good start. Second, computers are preventing people from going outside and enjoying nature. From my personal experience, nature is wonderful, but I spend too much time on social networks. A study by @PERSON2 shows that the average person in @LOCATION1 has only spent @NUM5 days outside in the past two years after getting a new computer. People need to enjoy what the world has to offer. Third, computers are affecting the interaction between family and friends. As @ORGANIZATION1 says, people only interact with family at mandatory times like school meetings. Family and friends are very important in our lives. I love chatting with my mom over hot chocolate, but @PERCENT1 of people today don't spend time with family, and @PERCENT2 use computers to interact with friends. As @PERSON1 from I.U.M says, people will lose all communication with family and friends if they don't stop using computers. In conclusion, I urge you to make the right decision by reducing computer use. You'll become a happier and stronger individual as a result. Computers have a terrible impact on humans, causing a lack of exercise, reduced time outdoors, and less interaction with family and friends.
216	216	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, I am writing to explain why advanced technology has a positive impact on people. The reasons are that computers enable people to communicate online, learn about distant places, and develop hand - eye coordination. As you read this letter, I hope you share my view.  First, computers allow online communication. Suppose you can't find your phone at home. You can check if the person you want to talk to is online. It's similar to texting but with a larger keyboard and screen. I once was texting someone and then went online to find them. We ended up chatting via instant messages. This shows how useful computers are for communication.  Second, not many people go to the library to gather information for school papers. A computer with Google makes finding information much easier. Moreover, going to the library can be costly as it requires filling up the gas tank. Every time my family goes to the library, we have to refuel the car afterward. This is another reason why computers are beneficial.  Finally, computers can teach hand - eye coordination. When writing an email, you need to know which keys your fingers are touching. Also, if a child takes karate, they might have learned to move their hands quickly from using a computer. I recall in first grade, a man tried to grab me. I was able to pull my hand away in time, which might be related to the hand - eye skills developed from using a computer.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my essay. My reasons for writing are that computers allow online communication, help learn about faraway places, and teach hand - eye coordination. I hope you will reconsider having computers in schools.
217	217	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a positive influence on people. They help develop hand - eye coordination, eliminate the need to visit the library, and improve social skills.  Computers are an integral part of our daily lives, and they unconsciously teach us hand - eye coordination. When we type, we use our eyes to watch the screen and our hands to operate the keyboard. If we make a mistake, our hands automatically correct it. The same principle applies when playing online games. Hand - eye coordination is a crucial skill in sports, and since we spend a lot of time on computers, they offer a quick way to acquire this skill.  Many students' parents are working, which makes it difficult for them to go to the library, especially if they don't live within walking distance. A computer comes in handy in such situations. For example, if you have a school project but your parents are at work, you can research it online and may even obtain more information than you could from the library. Suppose you need to do a project on @CAPS2. You go to the library, but there are only @NUM1 books on the topic, and @NUM2 of them are already checked out. On a survey, @PERCENT1 of students said this has happened to them, but the computer saved them.  A computer also enhances social skills. When I first moved here, I was very shy. After creating a @CAPS3 account, I started talking to people from my school and even became friends with them. I'm not suggesting that you should only communicate online. However, starting conversations online can help you get to know people better, and later, when you meet in person, you'll find common interests. Also, I have friends in @LOCATION1 and cousins in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. It's not always possible to travel to see them, but social networks allow us to stay in touch without wasting phone minutes.  In conclusion, computers have a highly positive effect on people. They improve hand - eye coordination, facilitate research, and enhance social skills. Thank you for reading this.
218	218	1	2	@CAPS1, do you want your kids and citizens to become fat and lazy, or do you want them to be active, learn daily skills, and be more friendly to the people around them? @PERCENT1 of parents would choose the latter option, and I believe after reading this, the remaining @PERCENT2 will be convinced.  Currently, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are overweight or obese, which is often due to lack of exercise and inactivity. Our children need to learn to go outside and exercise for an hour a day, which can divert their attention from the computer screen. Encouraging them to join a sports team or a club is a great way to keep them away from screens and the @ORGANIZATION2 course. Getting people out of the office can also lead them to explore nature. There are many fun activities at the local park, such as riding a bike, playing games, or just having fun with friends.  Learning can also be promoted by getting people away from their computer chairs. Instead of relying on the computer to look up information, encourage the use of dictionaries, thesauruses, or books. While the computer can be a source of knowledge, it can also expose kids to inappropriate content. However, it can also help kids explore career options and life. Sitting in front of a screen can be harmful to health.  There are better things to do than sitting in front of a computer. You can still have fun even if you're not good at sports. For example, boys can go to a park, play career - based games, or even wrestle.  In conclusion, getting up and going outside can help people socialize, learn, and even lose weight. I leave it to you to decide whether to take on this challenge. Staying in front of the computer can lead to the need for glasses and obesity.
219	219	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I've recently noticed that some people claim computers aren't important. I strongly disagree with this statement.  Computers teach excellent hand - eye coordination. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of all football players have good hand - eye coordination. After a game, football players might log into @CAPS2 to share their victory and play games like ping - pong, which helps improve this skill. Do you have good hand - eye coordination?  Another reason I disagree is that computers allow people to learn about far - away places without leaving home. It's much faster than going to the library. At the library, you have to travel there, select a book, and check it out. With a computer, you can complete an entire project in the time it takes to go through these library steps.  Finally, computers are important because they keep people in touch. I have family members who live far away. I can't always call them on the phone when I want to talk, so I log on to @CAPS2. If they're online, I can have a conversation with them. I'm very close to my grandma, but she lives more than @NUM1 hours away. It takes one and a half days by car and three hours by plane to reach her. It's much easier to log on to @CAPS2 and have a private conversation with her.  In conclusion, computers are amazing. They help develop hand - eye coordination, enable quick research, and keep us connected with distant friends and family. I'm sure you'll agree with me.
220	220	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, imagine being at home with nothing to do. You can't play basketball with your friends because you lack hand - eye coordination. You want to learn about @LOCATION1, but there are no relevant books. And you want to talk to your friends. This is what life would be like without technological advancements.  Computers benefit our lives in multiple ways. First, hand - eye coordination is crucial. A study on @DATE1 by @CAPS2, led by @PERSON2, the head of human reactions, showed that @PERCENT1 of people's hand - eye coordination improved when using a computer. @PERSON1 said in a @DATE2 interview with a science magazine, “Your hands are the largest part of your body, and the computer helps refine the movements to improve hand - eye coordination.” When you're clumsy, you might break important things. For example, @PERSON3 in @LOCATION2 broke her mother's glass vase. Using a computer could have helped improve her hand - eye coordination.  Second, computers give us the ability to learn about faraway places. @PERCENT2 of people prefer searching for information on a computer rather than in books. Without the websites that broadcast updates, some people wouldn't have known about the earthquake in @LOCATION3. Campers, for instance, might have been unaware. @ORGANIZATION2 even had a front - page spread promoting the use of computers over books because books can be outdated, while computers always provide up - to - date answers.  Finally, online communication is essential. Whether it's for business meetings, government plans, or chatting with friends, people need to stay in touch. If the president couldn't have video conferences, he would have to travel everywhere. @PERSON5 from @CAPS4 communicates with her coworkers via email because it's more convenient. @CAPS6 seems to be the primary way kids communicate these days, and it makes them feel part of something bigger.  Computers allow us to talk online, research faraway places, and practice hand - eye coordination. They make people happy, healthy, and educated. I believe computer technology is only beneficial, and I hope you'll agree with me, @ORGANIZATION1.
221	221	1	2	Some individuals in @MONTH1 believe that computers consume too much time that could be dedicated to important matters. However, in reality, all the information one desires is readily available. One can learn about nature, discover interesting websites, and even explore history. Here are the reasons regarding the impact of computers. Firstly, a wealth of knowledge about nature can be acquired online. One can view various types of animals and conduct in - depth studies on them. Additionally, one can learn about plants and their influence on life. Moreover, information about @LOCATION1 and its changes can be obtained. Secondly, there are numerous engaging websites to join. There are games to play to keep oneself occupied during the day. One can also chat online with friends or even find long - lost friends. School - related sites are available for students for study or assistance. Lastly, computers offer extensive insights into history. They allow for comparisons between past events, world - famous figures from then and those of today. Most importantly, there are life - changing stories and how they continue to shape people's lives today. I hope I have provided sufficient reasons for you to agree with me. As is evident, computers possess numerous resources from which one can learn, and learning websites and history are just a fraction of them. Consider this! Thank you for listening.
222	222	1	2	"Computers and the @CAPS1 have transformed the way the world functions today. From stock trading to instant messaging (@CAPS2), people base crucial life decisions on what they read. While some think that computers are distancing people from the beauty of nature, relatives, or exercise, I firmly believe that @CAPS11 is beneficial on a daily basis. For instance, in terms of communication, many people have close relatives living overseas, across the country, or even in the neighboring town. The @CAPS1 enables them to converse with those they otherwise couldn't. On several occasions, my family, despite living across the continent, has planned trips together. What would have taken months through postal letters was accomplished in as little as an hour via the @CAPS1. Another means to communicate with friends or family is the website @CAPS3. @CAPS3 allows users to talk, @CAPS6, or send pictures. Other similar websites are @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. @PERCENT1 of people in @LOCATION1 have an account on one of these platforms. For business communication, @CAPS6 is a viable option. Multiple servers, such as @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, or @CAPS8, provide @CAPS6 services. ""@ORGANIZATION3 is my personal favorite,"" says @PERSON2, @CAPS9 of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS10 newspaper. ""@CAPS11 has been extremely helpful when I need to contact someone urgently."" This is one reason I support computer use. Another reason is that <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of all students rely on the @CAPS1 for research papers and assignments. ""Although I still use books,"" college student @PERSON1 said, ""the @CAPS1 is much faster, and the articles are more up - to - date."" Search engines like @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS14.com are very popular. @NUM2 of all computer users with @CAPS1 access have used @ORGANIZATION1 at some point. Another useful program provided by all computer companies is @CAPS15 @CAPS16. It is used for everything from research papers. It also has spell - check, punctuation - check, and error - check features. Experts have complained that people spend too much time on the computer, and @CAPS11 distracts them from important aspects of life like friends, family, and nature. However, as demonstrated, the @CAPS1 enhances communication and curiosity about the world. Regarding exercise, it is common sense to spend at least an hour on personal fitness."
223	223	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1, I am of the opinion that the increasing use of computers has negative impacts. Firstly, it is detrimental to people's health. Secondly, frequent computer users often decline to spend time with family and friends. Thirdly, one can gain more in - depth knowledge about a subject by personally studying it rather than relying on a computer. The health issue is a significant concern. Health is of utmost importance, yet sitting in front of a computer for extended periods exacerbates problems. Hunching one's back to view small details on the computer screen or holding the mouse for a long time waiting to click can lead to arthritis. Another negative aspect is that computer users sometimes avoid spending time with family or friends. For example, suppose you promised to have a family gathering a week ago, and everyone was counting on you. But once you start using the computer and discover interesting websites, you may forget about the gathering. Before you know it, it's the day of the event, and you make excuses not to attend, which hurts your family. In my view, computers are also a poor substitute for real - life experiences. Instead of sitting in front of a computer, it is more enjoyable to travel, meet people, and taste the food of a particular culture. In conclusion, computers have adverse effects on people's health, potentially causing back and neck problems. People who use computers excessively often neglect their family and friends. And one can obtain more knowledge by direct study rather than relying on hours of computer use. I hope my opinion can convince others of the negative impacts of computers and prompt them to take appropriate action.
224	224	1	2	"@ORGANIZATION1, computers have numerous positive effects on people. They teach hand - eye coordination, help people learn about distant places, and enable communication with people far away. Computers are beneficial for everyone. They enhance hand - eye coordination. When typing, a person uses their hands while looking at the monitor. Computer games also play a role in teaching this skill. In games, events occur rapidly, so the player must observe what's happening and click the correct key quickly, thereby significantly improving hand - eye coordination. Studies show that computer users have a @PERCENT1 better hand - eye coordination than non - users. In addition to hand - eye coordination, computers can teach about far - off places. One can search for information about a place online and obtain a wealth of facts. Sheral from @LOCATION4 said, ""I heard someone at school mention @LOCATION2 and knew nothing about it, so I searched it and got a lot of facts."" This indicates that computers can help people learn about foreign countries. Moreover, computers allow people to communicate with others who are hundreds or thousands of miles away through email or video chat. A @CAPS2 revealed that seven out of ten people prefer video chat because it is faster and allows both parties to see each other. Jack from @LOCATION1 said, ""Thanks to video chat, I was able to talk to and see my cousin from @LOCATION3, whom I rarely see."" This clearly shows the positive aspects of computers. In conclusion, computers are extremely helpful as they teach hand - eye coordination, enable learning about distant places, and facilitate communication. They are truly a great asset for everyone."
225	225	1	2	Computers have brought about remarkable changes, but they also come with serious drawbacks. They offer many opportunities, yet many of us fail to use them in a healthy way. Computers have led to a lack of exercise among many. They are highly fascinating and can be addictive if not used in moderation. They also tend to monopolize our attention and reduce interaction with family. Imagine spending seven years sitting in front of a computer, rarely getting up except when necessary and even giving up sports. This can have a severe impact on your body. I recall being at my cousin @PERSON2's house when she suggested playing the game @CAPS2 fit. When you sign in, it assesses your body's age. My body was @NUM1 years old, while I was only @NUM2. All those years in front of the computer had taken a toll. I don't want others to experience this. I have a friend, @PERSON1, who is a computer addict. She would spend days on the computer, sometimes missing school or only going to school to use the computer. She could get violent when someone tried to pull her away. It was disheartening to watch. It all started innocently; she liked a particular website. It was scary when she talked about it, clearly having played all night. If you think this could never happen to you, you're wrong. I thought the same when I first saw that website. Fortunately, I stopped my addiction in time, but many others like @PERSON1 may be consumed by computers. Computers are so attention - grabbing that family members often struggle to get our attention. My mom has to call my cell phone or message me to get through. This leads to a detachment from family, which is never good. The more you ignore your family for the computer, the weaker your bond and the less fulfilling your life becomes. While computers are amazing, the lack of exercise is extremely unhealthy. They can also be dangerous, causing addiction. The more you chat with strangers in chat rooms, the less you communicate with your family. Computers can be like the devil's tools. They can destroy you if you're not careful. Always be vigilant, as computers are not as they seem.
226	226	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, eight out of ten people spend their time on computers. In my opinion, people should not spend so much time on their computers as it can harm their eyes. They may also watch inappropriate videos or pictures. Moreover, their electricity bills will increase. Many people spend a great deal of time on computers, but I think they shouldn't sit in front of the screen for too long as it can damage their eyes. When you sit and stare at the computer, your eyes start to hurt. Then, when you go for an eye check - up, the doctor will probably prescribe glasses. Another issue is that people visit inappropriate websites and watch improper videos. Once, my friend was sitting at the computer and started watching inappropriate videos. When her father found out, he canceled their internet connection. Can you imagine the high bills from spending so much time on the computer? Instead of paying a large amount of money, you can turn off the computer and spend time with friends. For example, rather than sitting at the computer for hours, go outside and play soccer, kick - ball, etc. In conclusion, people should stop spending excessive time on computers. Computers can harm your eyes if you sit in front of them for too long. People may watch inappropriate content, and your bills will go up. It seems to me that people need to engage in different activities to reduce their computer use. I hope you agree with my ideas.
227	227	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial for three main reasons. Firstly, they facilitate learning by enabling people to access information from various sources. Secondly, they allow people to communicate with friends and family through @CAPS2. Lastly, they help reduce stress through computer games. Learning is crucial, and computers enable faster learning. They help us explore distant places like @LOCATION1. It is far more convenient to learn on a computer than to visit a library and borrow a book. If you are working on a project and need last - minute information, you can simply search for your topic on the computer. Learning on a computer is much more convenient than going to the @CAPS1. Another advantage of computers is the ability to communicate with distant friends and family using @CAPS2. @CAPS2 enables real - time communication via the computer, regardless of whether the other person lives nearby or on the other side of the world. My cousin is studying in Spain for a semester, and I have had many video calls with her using @CAPS2. The best part is that you can actually see the person you are talking to on the screen. @CAPS2 is an excellent way to stay in touch with loved ones who are far away. Finally, computers help lower stress levels through gaming. Computer games are highly entertaining, with a wide range of options from @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the word to @CAPS5 @CAPS6 beauty barn. They are not only fun but also a great way to relieve stress instead of overworking. There are also educational games, such as ""Which country is which,"" which teaches geography while having fun. In conclusion, computers are a valuable asset. They assist in learning about far - off places, keeping in touch with distant people, and providing enjoyable gaming experiences. Computers will always be in use and never go to waste as there is always something to do on them."
228	228	1	2	Dear people from the newspaper, I am deeply concerned that excessive computer use can lead to trouble, violence, and illegal crimes. Regarding trouble, in @DATE2, @PERCENT1 @DATE1 people in @LOCATION1 engaged in negative activities such as spreading rumors and speaking ill of those they dislike. In @DATE1, @PERCENT2 @DATE1 teens aged @NUM1 were involved in rumor - spreading, which is harmful to all children. This situation may lead to the issues mentioned below. As for violence, due to the reasons stated earlier, if the current situation persists, it may escalate to violence. In @DATE1, @NUM4 people died from online - related crimes. @NUM5 threats were discovered on major websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. Finally, excessive computer use can lead to illegal crimes. In @DATE3, a girl was talking to a boy online. When they met, he shot and killed her. It turned out that he had lied about his identity online. On a website, a group of men expressed their hatred for kids and planned to shoot them at bus stops. Fortunately, the police arrested them before they could commit the crime. In conclusion, I am extremely worried that excessive computer use is causing trouble, violence, and illegal crimes. This trend must stop before everyone becomes addicted to spreading rumors. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.
229	229	1	2	Dear Readers, nowadays, almost everyone has a computer. While this has some positive aspects, overall, I find it unnatural. Computers have enabled us to do things we couldn't do before. For example, when people move, they no longer need to send letters and wait days for a reply. Instead, they can log into platforms like AIM, Facebook, or MySpace and communicate in real - time. However, there are many negative aspects. People spend less time outdoors and no longer appreciate the beauty of nature. We also spend less time with friends. I can hardly remember the last time I had a face - to - face conversation without it being necessary. On the internet, people can do whatever they want, which is not always a good thing. People can hack into various systems, cyberbully others anonymously, and pretend to be someone else. For instance, if I were @NUM1 and wanted to stalk a @NUM2 - year - old, I could pretend to be ten and befriend them. Once I gather enough information, I could locate them. In the past, this was not possible. If people realize the negative impact of excessive computer use, they will reduce their time on computers and start living a more balanced life. We need to take action, be aware of the situation, and spread the word about the importance of reducing computer use.
230	230	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, what would you like to do in your free time? Would you go outside and play soccer with your kids or sit down with a bag of chips and log onto Facebook or check your email? The question is whether computers have a positive or negative impact on people. I firmly believe that computers have a negative effect. Communicating with friends on the computer does not help develop social skills. Computers are also highly addictive, and they take away time that could be spent on exercise. Social media platforms like Facebook, iChat, and email are convenient ways to communicate with friends and family, but they do not contribute to social skill development. When meeting someone in person, you often need to know what to say and how to act. Typing on a keyboard does not allow for real - life interaction. Why not invite someone over or go out for lunch with your family instead? Computers are extremely addictive. I know from personal experience that once I log on, I may stay on for hours, and this is true for many others. The majority of people use computers daily. When I'm on Facebook and see a large number of people online, the number keeps increasing as time passes. This addiction to computers leads to a lack of exercise. Doctors recommend that adults and kids get at least an hour of exercise per day. Sitting in front of the computer takes away from this time. Instead of sitting at the computer, you could be getting your daily exercise. Often, when people sit at the computer, they also eat snacks, which further emphasizes the importance of exercise for maintaining health. I believe that I would feel better if I went for a run instead of using the computer. Some people may claim they can manage both, but there are those who prefer exercise. When they see others constantly on the computer, it sets a bad example. If everyone limited their computer time, we would all be more social and feel better. I trust that you will agree with me that computers have a negative impact on people.
231	231	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, some people find the clicking and clacking sounds of computers annoying. However, they fail to recognize that computers are improving and simplifying the lives of the youth, and they could also benefit from them. This clearly demonstrates the positive impact of computers on people. First, computers are not a negative influence when they facilitate better communication among people. You often come across advertisements for dating websites and similar platforms. It's worth noting that @PERCENT1 of couples meet online. This is a significant number, and it's likely that many of these relationships would not have formed without the help of computers. Second, computers offer a vast amount of entertainment. There are over @NUM1 computer games available online, and @CAPS2 of them are free. I'm sure that almost every child has played an online game at some point. Consider this: your child could either be out getting into trouble or safely at home playing on the computer. You might think that computers are just for children and lack sophistication. But computers are not just about fun and games. They are a valuable source of information. They are extremely useful for students in school for their projects, and they also benefit adults in numerous ways. They provide information on vacations, hotels, and more. Additionally, there are countless videos on computers that offer useful instructions on various tasks. In conclusion, computers are far from being a nuisance. They bring people together, offer entertainment, and provide valuable information. It's possible that a computer could even save your life one day. Computers enhance people's daily lives, and they could do the same for you.
232	232	1	2	"Recently, there has been a global technology craze. Wherever you look, whether at home, school, work, or on the streets, you see people texting, talking on the phone, blogging, and engaging in other computer - related activities. This trend concerns some individuals who believe that the current generations are overly reliant on computers and not spending enough time exercising outdoors or socializing. However, these concerns are misplaced. These so - called experts are being overly critical of computers. It's not the case that everyone is lost in front of a screen, disconnected from the real world. In fact, most ""computer enthusiasts"" are using computers for useful purposes. While computers are used for entertainment, they also help society reconnect with long - lost friends and even provide directions to well - known restaurants. Clearly, computers are not turning us into mindless zombies. Computers are sometimes regarded as a nuisance. Parents often complain about having to drag their children away from the screen for dinner or a soccer game that started @NUM1 minutes ago. But this doesn't necessarily mean that computers are bad. Everyone uses computers. ""@PERSON1"" from @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""Even though my father complains that I'm on @CAPS1 too much, @CAPS2 forgets that @CAPS2 has one of his own."" This is a common situation among many students' parents. Approximately @PERCENT1 of adults admit that they have also embraced new fads such as @CAPS1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. So, why are these things so important to us? The answer is that they make us feel connected, although the concept is perhaps more complex than it seems. People have different reasons for considering computers important, but most agree that maintaining friendships is a major factor. ""@PERSON2"", a computer technician, says, ""Everyone is already online. If all your friends are involved in something, wouldn't you want to be too?"" Some might recall the saying, ""If your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?"" But being connected and taking extreme actions are two different concepts. When you reconnect with high - school or school friends, you're glad to be able to communicate with them again, whether face - to - face or via computer screens. Finally, the computer is an excellent resource. While some people complain, others are making the most of what it has to offer, such as looking up event directions or gathering facts for reports. This is how websites like @ORGANIZATION2 generate billions of dollars from online searches. In conclusion, it's easy to understand why computers and their resources are so popular. Everyone uses them for different purposes, whether for entertainment, information, or reconnection. My personal favorite is discovering hidden and amazing bands that few people know about. Undoubtedly, computers have a positive impact on the world."
233	233	1	2	To the newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are both beneficial and significant. Computers offer multiple benefits. They are a source of entertainment, a vast repository of information, and highly useful. I enjoy watching cool videos on YouTube, while older people might prefer to watch the news. Computers also simplify communication. Sending an email is much easier than sending a regular envelope. When sending a letter, you may have to wait days or even weeks depending on the destination, but an email can reach its recipient in seconds. Computers are crucial for various groups. People who rely on them can upload important information. The military and police use the internet on their computers to control specialized equipment like @CAPS1.A.V. for the army or daily monitoring systems for police officers. I personally use a computer to research school subjects like math and history. However, computers are not without their drawbacks. Some people misuse them. Hackers can break into other computers and steal important information, causing great distress. Online gamers may spend countless hours playing, which can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, less time with friends and family, and even the need for glasses. There is also a possibility that computers may completely replace newspapers in the future. In conclusion, while computers have their negative aspects, their benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. They have revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate, and their importance in our lives is undeniable.
234	234	1	2	Many people hold the view that computers are not a good thing. They claim that people spend too much time on computers, resulting in less exercise, and that staring at the screen can be harmful to the eyes. While these concerns may have some validity, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial. One of the advantages of computers is the ability to communicate with people from different places. Whether through a webcam or social networks, you can chat with others without incurring phone bills. For instance, I have family in another country, and we often communicate via webcam on the computer. Making international phone calls can be extremely expensive. Without a computer, my connection with my family abroad would be severely limited. In addition, computers allow us to explore foreign countries. Many people, including my parents, use computers to learn about other countries. My mother, when planning a vacation, always looks up the destination country to gather more information. For example, when we planned to visit a hot and exotic place on @DATE1, my mom used the computer to find out what to pack. Without this information, we might have packed inappropriate items. Lastly, computers are an excellent research tool. I've lost count of the number of times I've used the computer for research. While books and encyclopedias are valuable resources, the computer offers a wealth of information. There are numerous links and websites to explore, and you can find pictures, videos, and maps. In school, using the computer for research is often a requirement for projects. Having a computer at home also helps improve your computer skills. In conclusion, the positive aspects of computers far outweigh the negative ones. You can communicate with others without high phone bills, learn about different places and cultures, and conduct in - depth research. Computers are truly a valuable asset.
235	235	1	2	To whom it may concern, I am of the opinion that computers are highly beneficial in most people's lives. Firstly, computers can be used for almost everything. There are hundreds of websites on the computer, allowing you to play various games, chat with people, listen to music, watch videos, and find information about different places. Secondly, computers are good for you in many ways. They help improve eye coordination. You can also use the internet to practice math, social studies, and other subjects. There are many educational games available online that are helpful for those who need extra support. Moreover, using a computer improves hand coordination as you need to learn how to type. With practice, you can type without looking at the keyboard. Some may worry that computers will disrupt your daily schedule or interfere with family time. However, this is not the case. A computer is just a tool that you use when you need something or for entertainment. For example, in my family, someone uses the computer every day, but it has never affected our daily routine. We kids still go to school, my parents go to work, and we have dinner together. The computer never gets in the way. In conclusion, it is evident that having a computer at home is a good idea. They are multi - functional, beneficial for personal development, and do not disrupt daily life. Computers are a valuable addition to people's lives.
236	236	1	2	I firmly believe that computers bring numerous benefits. For instance, when a family member travels out of town and I lack a phone, I can use a chatting website to stay in touch with them. During my leisure time, I often visit Google to search for pictures and play games. Sometimes, while looking for one thing, I stumble upon something else that catches my eye.  Computers are incredibly useful wherever you are. They can assist with school projects, help with spelling, and quickly provide answers to questions like which country has the largest population.  With each passing year, computers are advancing. Initially, they were just a screen and a mouse, but now we have laptops that are portable. People can take laptops with them while exercising or enjoying nature. And when exercising, one can go on YouTube to listen to music and watch funny videos. In conclusion, I am convinced that computers are a valuable asset.
237	237	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am writing to express my view on the negative impacts of computers on people. There are three main issues: @CAPS4 theft, cyberbullying, and addiction.  Identity theft is a significant problem. In the @CAPS5.S.A, many people have their identities stolen due to sharing private information online. This can lead to substantial debt for the victims. Encouraging people to use computers when they face the risk of identity theft is unwise. If this continues to happen to innocent individuals, it must be stopped, and we should not tolerate such online behavior. Thus, I advocate against excessive computer use.  Cyberbullying is another serious concern. When people talk online to strangers, these strangers may pose as famous figures and bully them for fun. It has been well - documented that cyberbullying can drive both children and adults into depression and even lead to suicide. Giving up one's life because of a computer is, in my opinion, extremely foolish. So, once again, I say no to over - reliance on computers.  Lastly, computer addiction is a major drawback. People become so engrossed in the excitement of the computer world that they become detached from friends and family. They also neglect personal hygiene and even forget to eat. The computer, in my view, is like a drug that makes people forget about reality.  In summary, I have presented my opinion and three supporting reasons – @CAPS4 theft, cyberbullying, and addiction – for my stance against excessive computer use. We should say no @NUM1 computers.
238	238	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I concur with experts who support technological advancements and believe that computers have positive effects on people. They can improve hand - eye coordination, enable learning from distant places, and facilitate online communication.  However, there are also numerous negative impacts that are often overlooked. Prolonged computer use can harm people's vision as they sit too close to the screen. Moreover, computers are highly addictive, leading many people to exercise less and contributing to the growing problem of obesity. Additionally, computers consume a great deal of people's time.  Although computers have some positive aspects, there are better alternatives. For example, one can improve hand - eye coordination by playing tennis with a friend, which also provides exercise. Instead of chatting with friends online, one can call them on the phone or meet them in person. If one wants to learn about a far - away place, visiting it is a much more fulfilling experience.  It is important to note that I do not claim that computers are entirely bad. Like most things in the world, they have both pros and cons. In my opinion, though, the negative effects of computers outweigh the positive ones.
239	239	1	2	I personally hold the view that people should not spend excessive time on computers. There are three main reasons for this.  Firstly, spending too much time on computers means less time for exercise. People who sit around on their computers all day are likely to gain weight. Instead of being glued to the screen, they should go for a run or visit the gym. Even if one has home exercise equipment, using it is far better than being inactive in front of a computer. If people spent as much time exercising as they do on computers, the average weight of humans would decrease significantly.  Secondly, computer use reduces the time people spend enjoying nature. People should be outside breathing fresh air instead of being cooped up indoors all day. For me, playing baseball outside and getting fit is far more appealing than sitting inside getting fat in front of a computer. Even looking at nature through a computer screen is no substitute for the real experience. If people spent as much time outdoors as they do on computers, we would live in a healthier and cleaner world.  Lastly, excessive computer use leads to less interaction with family and friends. People can isolate themselves in a dark room all day just because they are on the computer. This is wrong because they miss out on quality time with loved ones. If a person spends all their time on the computer, those they care about will gradually drift away, even if they are unaware of it.  In conclusion, it is much better for people to spend more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends rather than being overly focused on computers. Even if someone doesn't currently spend a lot of time on the computer, there is a risk of gradually increasing that time until it becomes all - consuming.
240	240	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to share my opinion about computers. People spend a significant amount of time on computers because they are extremely helpful in various aspects.  In the academic field, computers are invaluable. I am in @NUM1 grade, and my teacher @PERSON1 assigns homework every @DATE1. We are required to write @NUM2 facts about any topic of our choice. Many students search for information about bears on @ORGANIZATION2 to complete their assignments.  In the workplace, computers are essential. Secretaries and teachers in our school use computers for tasks such as taking attendance, grading, and checking student information like attendance records, grades, phone numbers, and schedules.  Computers also play a crucial role in communication. My dad uses the computer to stay in touch with our family in @LOCATION1. We can catch up and learn about what's new. For example, a week ago, I was chatting with my cousin, and she told me her dog had @NUM3 puppies.  In addition, computers are used for online shopping. My uncle ordered two tickets for a WWE event on ticketmaster.com and also books his flight tickets to @LOCATION1 on his computer.  However, it's important to note that while computers are very useful, it's not good to be constantly glued to them. People should go outside, enjoy nature, live an active life, and exercise for both physical fitness and overall health.  @CAPS1, I hope you understand and appreciate my perspective on computers. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter.
241	241	1	2	Dear local representatives of @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1, recently, I've noticed that some citizens of @ORGANIZATION1 are spending a significant amount of time on computers and laptops. Some people claim that @CAPS2 is a waste of time that could be spent with family and friends, especially those who live far away. However, @CAPS2 is useful for research, learning about @ORGANIZATION1 - related things, and helping people relax. In modern times, many family and friends live far apart, making in - person conversations impossible. While options like calling, writing letters, or using email, Facebook, and @ORGANIZATION2 are available, the latter are easier to use. When calling, you may not know if the person's phone is busy or if they're in a bad situation. @CAPS2 can take time, but it's better in some cases as you can be sure your message is sent. @CAPS2 also aids in advertising and sales. Although the internet can be unreliable as anyone can change content on a site, not all online information is like that. One should stay away from scams. Some people find @CAPS2 a way to unwind after work. There are fun games and a platform to communicate. Research shows that @PERCENT1 of people can relax and calm down after a long @CAPS5 when using a computer or laptop, which helps relieve stress. Computers have numerous benefits, and the internet is widely accessible wherever you go.
242	242	1	2	"Dear Newspaper, in our town, the number of computer users is increasing daily. Some people believe that the computer allows for a wide range of activities and communication. However, I firmly believe that our town should not support technological advancements. By reducing computer usage, people will have more time for exercise, in - person conversations with family and friends, and participation in local activities. Do you want to be overweight and out of shape? Spending all day, every day in front of the computer will lead to such a situation. As @CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 stated, ""I think exercise should be a part of everybody's day."" Excessive computer use can make people so attached that they neglect physical activity. In @LOCATION1, it has been proven that @PERCENT1 of residents are overweight due to lack of exercise, while @PERCENT2 are overweight because of improper eating. This indicates that more people in @LOCATION1 lack exercise than have poor eating habits. No one wants to be overweight, and this situation can be changed. Each year, more people create Facebook and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 accounts. Some school - going kids are on the internet all day chatting with friends who live nearby, preferring online communication over phone calls. As @PERSON3 said, ""It's hard to understand the tone of an online message, and it can be interpreted in different ways."" Phone calls are a quicker and easier way to communicate without waiting for a typed response. If you're a heavy computer user, plan real - life get - togethers with friends. Towns offer various activities such as sidewalk sales, clubs, sports teams, and holiday strolls. Instead of just dreaming about being part of a team, go out and participate. Towns care about their residents' well - being and offer these activities for their enjoyment. As @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @PERSON2 says, ""@CAPS5 wants to make the town interesting and for everyone to know each other."" Participating in these activities will help you meet other kids in the town. If your town offers such activities, it's helping you. Being actively involved in the town is far better than sitting at home on the computer. Whether technology advances or not, there's no point in staying indoors just to talk to people. Go out and have real - life conversations, stay in shape, and engage in local activities. Thank you for your concern."
243	243	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, have you ever considered how your life would be without a computer? I firmly believe that computers have a profound impact on people worldwide. They are beneficial both in the workplace and at school. Additionally, computers facilitate communication for students and adults. Many people want to visit new places but are unsure about what the place looks like or its location. With a computer, all this information can be easily obtained. Let's explore the viewpoints of students on this topic. Computers make work and school tasks much easier. Imagine having to write every paper by hand; it would take hours. When typing a school paper, spell - check ensures the accuracy of the content. Hand - written papers are more likely to contain spelling mistakes. Work is completed much faster on a computer, leaving more time for social activities. Typed work is always neater, and it can be easily emailed to friends or saved on the computer. If changes are needed, it's quicker than rewriting the entire paper. For me, computers have a positive impact as they help me complete my work faster. Computers also play a crucial role in communication. They enable people to interact with others. In schools, students often ask friends about homework. Without a computer, it would be difficult to seek help, which could lead to mistakes. I enjoy spending time with friends, and making plans is easier with a computer. Using Facebook, I can quickly talk to friends about our plans for the night instead of looking up their numbers and making a call. Moreover, people can stay in touch with old school friends. Another advantage of computers is the ability to research travel destinations. People who love to travel can use the computer to find maps and the shortest routes to their desired places. They can also decide if a place is visually appealing before visiting. I rely on computers for most of my tasks. In conclusion, computers help us work more efficiently, communicate with others, and gather information about travel destinations. They are a reliable tool, and those who disagree are missing out.
244	244	1	2	Dear @CITY1, I'm writing to discuss the issue of people spending excessive time on computers, which reduces their time with family, friends, and in real - life activities. However, computers also offer useful information for important papers or college essays. Regarding the negative impact on social life, consider this scenario: Your friends are planning to go to a huge beach party. You tell them to pick you up, but before they arrive, you start chatting on the computer. When your friends come to pick you up, you're so engrossed that you miss the party. The next day at school, they talk about the great time they had, and you regret missing out. As for the positive aspect of using computers for information, suppose you're working on a paper. You search the computer, find good sources, write your paper, and get a good grade, which makes you happy. This is the only real positive reason for using computers. Some people prefer to stay inside on the computer, while others go outside on a nice day. Whether it's MySpace, Facebook, or other platforms, it's good to communicate with others. But if you're only concerned about how your pictures look, you're missing the point. What matters is your own happiness. In conclusion, computers have both good and bad aspects. They're bad because they can lead to a lack of exercise and less time with friends, but they're good for obtaining information when needed.
245	245	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are a valuable asset to society. They contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination, especially when typing. With practice, one can type without looking at the keyboard. Moreover, computers are a vast source of information. You can search for anything on the internet. For instance, if you're interested in a particular country, you can learn new and unknown facts about it. If you're planning a vacation but can't decide on a destination, you can use the computer to look up tourist attractions in different countries and choose the one that suits you best. Computers also enhance communication. If you're on vacation or living far away from your loved ones, you can use video - chat to see and talk to them. In conclusion, due to their role in developing skills, providing information, and facilitating communication, computers are an undeniable benefit to our society.
246	246	1	2	"Dear editor, have you ever had an intense desire to know something, to the point where you can't focus on anything else? And have you experienced that ""ah - hah!"" moment when you finally find the information? Chances are, you used a computer to search for that knowledge. All it takes is typing in your query and hitting ""enter"", and your screen is filled with numerous information - site options.  Computers are incredibly helpful in answering people's everyday questions. Thanks to computers, our country has become more knowledgeable. You can communicate with friends who have moved across the state, country, or even to another part of the world. With each click of the mouse, there are new things to learn. Moreover, computers can also be used for personal enjoyment.  When I was four, my best friends at the time moved to Florida. I was heart - broken. Initially, we tried corresponding through letters. But as we grew older and busier, our connection faded. However, with the advancement of technology and computers, my friend and I now text, email, and instant - message each other regularly. This has made our long - distance friendship stronger and more convenient. Thanks to computers, you can reach out to friends you thought you'd lost touch with, and you can also meet new people through various online platforms.  World communication facilitated by computers has also opened up numerous business opportunities. In the current economic downturn, computers can create job openings, assist college students in preparing for their future careers, and hopefully improve the lives of many.  Rather than going to a noisy arcade, you can play exciting games in the comfort of your own home. Virtually any game you can think of can be found on the internet. From simple solitaire to advanced - level shift games, there are options for all ages and difficulty levels.  Now, some people might think that all kids will do is sit in front of the computer and play games. There will indeed be those who refuse to go outside, spend time with friends, or even read outdoors. But we can encourage them to go out. Many people manage their time well and still have a great time. We can also motivate kids to use exercise programs on their computers and video games to enhance their health. There are many fun games that help you stay fit while having a good time.  The computers in our homes are filled with an overwhelming amount of information. A popular search engine like @ORGANIZATION1 gives you the ability to look up anything, from the vice - president's birthday to the price of eggs in @LOCATION4, or the width of @LOCATION1, all with just a click of a button. This up - to - date information is extremely useful for homework. Unlike most reference books, which are often outdated and inaccurate, computers are frequently updated.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that our country has become much smarter because of computers. Whether you want to talk to a long - lost friend in @LOCATION2 or consult an expert on ospreys in @LOCATION3, you can find your answers on the computer. While you're at it, you can play some exciting games and learn about the best movies released in @DATE1. So, have fun and keep learning!"
247	247	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, a large number of people are now using computers. However, opinions about computers vary. Some people dislike them, while I, along with many others, appreciate their benefits.  Computers offer excellent communication capabilities. They enable faster communication compared to traditional methods. Instant messaging, for example, is a much quicker and more cost - effective way to talk to others. Sending and receiving letters can take days or weeks, but instant messaging only takes a few seconds, and it's free. Video chat is another great communication option. It's similar to a phone call, but you can also see the person you're talking to. You can have a video chat with someone from another country at no cost, unlike long - distance phone calls, which can be quite expensive.  Computers are also a great source of entertainment. Everyone, regardless of age, enjoys playing games. There are numerous websites on the internet, including many game sites. Most game sites offer virtual games that you can play online for free. There are single - player, two - player, and party games, allowing you to play alone, with a friend, or with the whole family.  In addition to entertainment, computers are useful for work. They provide a vast amount of information, like having a personal library at your fingertips. Whether you're doing research for a project or just want to stay informed, the internet can help. All you need to do is search for the topic, and the information will be available, and it's free.  In conclusion, computers are useful in many ways, and the examples mentioned above are just a few of their benefits. I hope that you will view computers in the same positive light as I and millions of others do. Clearly, computers have improved the lives of many people.
248	248	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, computers are a rapidly advancing technology that offers a wide range of benefits. They can help you learn new things and connect with old and new friends. Some people even pursue online education using computers. Additionally, the games available on computers are very popular.  Computers are a valuable asset as they can teach us many exciting things. There is a wealth of knowledge to be gained, including information about places, people, animals, plants, and food. For instance, I once used the computer to find a recipe for caramel apples.  Some individuals use computers for educational purposes. There are online colleges and high schools, providing a new form of homeschooling. Not everyone can attend large @CAPS1, so online education is a convenient alternative. When working on a project, instead of rushing to the library, you can use the computer to find the necessary information.  Computers also allow us to stay in touch with friends. Everyone has friends, be it new or old. In the past, if you wanted to talk to a friend, you had to send a letter. Now, with computers, you can send an email in an instant. There's also instant messaging, such as AIM or Meebo. I moved from @LOCATION1, and I don't get to see my friends often. But with the computer, I can communicate with them easily. Moreover, platforms like @ORGANIZATION2 let you see your friends while chatting, making it a fun and easy way to stay connected with friends and family.  Another great feature of computers is the ability to play video games. People of all ages enjoy playing games. There are countless websites on the internet, and many of them offer game sites. You can play a variety of virtual games online for free. There are single - player, two - player, and multi - player games, so you can play alone, with a friend, or with the whole family.  Computers can also be used for work. They provide a vast amount of information, similar to having a personal library at home. You can access information with just a touch of a finger.  In conclusion, computers are incredibly useful. I hope I've convinced you of their benefits and how they can improve our lives.
249	249	1	2	"According to @PERSON1, an economic expert, for every hour spent on the computer, your electricity bill increases by @MONEY2. The average @CAPS2 spends @NUM1 hours on the computer daily. I firmly believe that spending excessive time on the computer can have negative consequences, including economic loss, health issues, and a decline in community interaction.  Financial loss is a major concern for many people. If everyone spent @NUM2 fewer hours on the computer, they could save @MONEY1 on their electric bill. In a survey, @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people stated that they would do anything to save money. By reducing computer usage, they could achieve significant savings.  In addition to financial loss, there are also health implications. There is growing concern about the increasing obesity rate in America. Part of this problem is due to excessive computer use. Professor @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1 has stated that ""the obesity issue in @LOCATION1 could be resolved if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising."" Currently, @NUM5 out of @NUM6 people in @LOCATION1 are obese. If everyone spent @NUM2 fewer hours on the computer, the obesity rate could drop to @NUM1 out of @NUM6.  However, the impact on the community is an even more significant problem. People rarely communicate face - to - face these days. They rely on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 for communication. Communities are spending less time together in real - life situations compared to online interactions. @PERSON1, an expert on human behavior, has noted that when people reduce their computer usage, they spend more time together. And it's a well - known fact that spending more time together leads to more enjoyment.  In conclusion, reducing computer usage would bring financial, health, and community benefits. These are all crucial aspects of our lives that are compromised when we spend too much time on the computer. Therefore, it's important to be more mindful of our computer usage."
250	250	1	2	I strongly believe that computers do not benefit society. Many people are choosing to spend their time on computers instead of engaging in exercise, meeting friends in person, or spending quality time with their families. A significant number of people admit to spending at least @NUM2 hours a day on their computers, which is unnecessary.  The current high obesity rate in the world can be partly attributed to excessive computer use. Exercise is essential for maintaining good health. With more exercise, many painful disorders could be avoided, as agreed by a large percentage of people. Too many individuals are prioritizing their computers over exercise, resulting in numerous health problems that could have been easily prevented.  Friends are an integral part of life. However, people are now communicating with their friends online or in computer games rather than meeting them in person. Online communication often leads to misunderstandings, which can break up friendships. Moreover, it's more difficult to meet new people and make friends online compared to going out in the real world. Meeting people in person allows you to expand your social circle and have a more fulfilling life.  Family is also at stake due to computer use. Family members are spending less time together, which weakens family bonds. Husbands and wives may not communicate frequently, often leading to separation or divorce. This can be extremely difficult for children.  In conclusion, exercise, friends, and family are essential in life, and computers put these important aspects at risk. We need to take a stand and limit our computer use before it's too late. Let's prioritize our health, social relationships, and family bonds over the allure of computers.
251	251	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, I've learned that some experts claim people spend excessive time on computers instead of exercising or being with friends and family. However, I hold a different view. Computers are an excellent means of learning and communicating, and here's why.  First, computers are highly beneficial in school. Most students use them daily. We can study for tests by accessing websites rich in information and research topics we don't understand. For instance, if you want to know how planets form, simply type it into a search engine, and numerous websites will appear. Additionally, when working on projects, we can use various tools to create slide - shows while also looking up information online. Moreover, the internet enables teachers to communicate with students. If a teacher sets up a blog, students can stay informed about class activities, homework, and find useful links to enhance their understanding of certain topics.  Second, contrary to what experts say, computers actually elevate communication. For example, you can log on to MSN or AIM to chat with old friends and catch up on their lives. @ORGANIZATION1 is another cost - effective and easy way to contact friends abroad. You can also write an email; although it may take longer to get a reply, it's worth the wait. For parents with children living far away, video chat is an excellent option as it allows them to see and hear their kids.  Finally, computers offer vast learning opportunities. You can search for any topic in the world on a search engine and get hundreds of results. Regardless of your interests, you'll find great information. The internet also keeps you updated on recent news like the weather. There are websites where you can ask questions and get quick answers, though you need to verify the reliability of the sources. When planning a trip, you can easily check flight information and weather forecasts with just a click. You can also learn about your destination.  Next time you hear negative things about computers, think twice. While it's sometimes better to go outside and play, computers are valuable for learning and communication.
252	252	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. This is because computers are powerful teaching tools. They allow people to communicate with one another and express or create their ideas freely.  Computers can teach a great deal. They can present information visually, which is beneficial for both children and adults. When I was young, I played math and science games on the computer to prepare for tests. For adults, computers are indispensable in their jobs. I can't imagine what many adults would do without them. Consider all the modern jobs that rely on computers, such as email. How would many businesses function without it? Adults also use computers to check the news and follow sports.  We can learn a vast amount from computers, and many people perform their jobs using them. Every day, we gain new knowledge, and computers make the learning process more efficient. Moreover, computers facilitate online chats, email, and now, with webcams, face - to - face conversations with people worldwide. Email is a great help for those in long - distance relationships as it's quick. Thanks to the built - in webcams and microphones, I can talk to and see my friends and family without traveling, just by clicking a button. There are also websites that allow people to interact online, which is extremely useful.  Computers also serve as a platform for people to express their imaginations. Many people type their thoughts and feelings on the computer, something they might not do in person. Imagine a world without computers. In my opinion, everything has some positive aspects, and computers definitely bring a positive influence to the world.
253	253	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, I wonder if you think computers are good to use. Although more and more people are using computers, not everyone believes it benefits society, and I strongly disagree.  I have several reasons for my stance. First, computers are not safe. Someone could trace your location, and that's a serious concern. Second, computers can get you into a lot of trouble. For example, posting inappropriate things online or saying mean things to others can have negative consequences. Also, if someone has a crush on you and you reject them, they might post hurtful things, which could make you angry if your friends see it.  Finally, you never know what might happen on a computer. There are websites that could start a virus on your device. In conclusion, these are the reasons why I think computers are not good. You should keep your children away from computers as they can lead to no good. Also, be careful about your online activities.
254	254	1	2	I walked into my living room and saw my brother on the computer, chatting with his friends on Facebook. I thought to myself that he's always on the computer, never for school - related reasons. I personally agree with the statement that we don't need computers.  In our town, @ORGANIZATION1, most people have computers. But without a computer to look up information, you can still go to the library. Just the other @DATE1, my friend @PERSON1 went to the library and checked out a book about the @CAPS1 culture. He loved the book and read it thoroughly for a book report on different cultures. When he handed it in, the teacher was very happy, and he got an @NUM1 on his test. He didn't use the internet.  Computers are not as mobile as books. If you're traveling in a car, you can't use a computer like you can read a book. Also, books are often more interesting to read.  Not having a computer can lead to a more active lifestyle. While my brother is inside on the computer all @DATE1, my friends and I are outside playing football, basketball, baseball, soccer, kirkball, and dodgeball. We're very thin because of our daily activities. My brother, on the other hand, has become obese. Before he had a computer, he was as thin as us.  It's also unhealthy to be on the computer all @DATE1. It can lead to staying up late, missing the bus, and getting bad grades. After our games, we watch a little TV and then go to sleep, usually getting at least @NUM2 hours of sleep each @DATE1, which helps us through school. We also make healthy food choices like fruits and vegetables, while my brother eats junk food, contributing to his obesity.  Not having a computer also helps you spend more time with your family. When we go out to eat, my brother is always in a hurry to get back on the computer, not allowing us to enjoy our food. He's so rushed that he might even pick at other people's plates to finish faster. When we want to go to the movies, he stays home on the computer. It really upsets our family.  In my opinion, computers can cause many problems, such as obesity and bad grades. If you want your kids to be healthier, get better grades, and spend more time with the family, either sell your computer. This is a problem that exists all over the world.
255	255	1	2	Dear Newspaper editor, computers are a remarkable technological advancement, yet some people have reservations. While some view them as a great asset, others consider them a health hazard. I firmly believe that computers are an excellent addition to our lives, and I have @NUM1 reasons to support this view.  Computers are great for staying in touch with distant friends and family. There are websites like AOL, Facebook, and MySpace that allow you to connect with them. Most of these platforms are free to create an account, so you don't have to worry about monthly fees. This is far more convenient and cost - effective than traveling to visit them. Additionally, with webcams, you can have video chats, enabling you to see and talk to each other simultaneously.  They are also invaluable for research. When working on a project and needing more information than books can provide, you can use search engines like Google or Ask.com. You can quickly find the details you need, saving a lot of time compared to hours of reading.  Lastly, online shopping is made easy with computers. For example, if you can't find a cool toy for your child in stores, you can buy it online. Items are usually shipped quickly. I have personal experience with this; when I really wanted a bike, my mom bought it for me online for my birthday.  In conclusion, computers are extremely useful. Whether you need information, want to talk to someone, or make a purchase, they have you covered. I use computers frequently and think they are a great addition to our lives.
256	256	1	2	"Some individuals in @MONTH1 acknowledge that computers do not contribute to physical fitness and that excessive time is spent on them. However, computers facilitate staying in touch with friends and family, meeting new people, and storing information. Without these essential technological devices, these tasks would be unfeasible. In @MONTH1, many families are dispersed across the country or even reside in different countries. Due to high travel costs, in - person meetings are infrequent. Nevertheless, computers enable easy and rapid communication, faster than one can say ""@LOCATION1."" Moreover, numerous people create websites that help us maintain contact with distant relatives. Platforms like Facebook, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 of fish, and singles net offer opportunities to find friends or a suitable partner. These sites allow us to discover individuals with shared interests. Half of my mom's boyfriends were found through such platforms. Without them, there might be fewer divorces and more happy - ending stories. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people work from home, which has its advantages and allows tasks to be completed. Many people possess important papers and information that could be lost in an instant. With computer technology, saving this information is as simple as a mouse click. More businesses are now operated from home thanks to this convenient technology. Although exercise remains crucial, with just a button press, one can chat with an aunt, find a partner, and safeguard important data. New computer technology can transform the world and expedite various tasks."
257	257	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers can have a negative impact on the citizens of @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. I am of the opinion that some people are not getting enough exercise and that excessive computer use can lead to laziness. There are three main reasons for this view. Firstly, people are not getting sufficient exercise. I base this on the fact that I know individuals who have gained a significant amount of weight. They do nothing but sit at the computer and eat, which is quite disheartening. Additionally, staring at the computer screen can damage eyesight. I once experienced a strange feeling in my eyes after using the computer for a long time. Moreover, people become fragile and weak as their bones lose strength when they do not exercise regularly. Secondly, people become lazy and undergo changes. For example, they may keep asking others to do things for them. Also, a person's behavior can change; they may become reluctant to participate in fun events with friends, and over time, friendships may fade. It is extremely hurtful when someone replaces a real - life friend with a computer, which can even lead to feelings of depression. Thirdly, people can become addicted to the computer. For instance, when there is a birthday celebration, an addicted person might say, ""first I got to beat this level,"" indicating that they will not step away from the computer. Time passes quickly when one is on the computer, which is a waste of life. Eventually, others may start to hate the addicted person as they seem to care about nothing but the computer. These are the reasons for my opinion on the impact of computers, as presented in the newspaper article I read."
258	258	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, spending excessive time on the computer is never beneficial, whether for work or entertainment. I firmly hold this view because prolonged computer use means less time for exercise, less face - to - face interaction with real family and friends, and it can damage eyesight. In today's era of remarkable technological advancements, people are constantly glued to computer screens. Let's admit it; once on the computer, it can be highly addictive due to the numerous engaging activities available. When we become addicted, we lose the motivation to engage in other activities such as exercise. Studies indicate that @PERCENT1 of kids who use their computers for more than @NUM1 hours a day are obese. The root cause is clearly their addiction to computers, which makes them reluctant to go to the gym or participate in physical activities. In school, many kids choose computer programming classes over physical education, further reducing their exercise time. While computers are amazing tools, they turn into enemies when they start to affect our health and physical fitness. Interacting with others on the computer may seem positive, but it has a negative impact on real - life interactions. Some people develop anti - social behavior in real life due to excessive computer interaction. For example, some kids who are pleasant online are extremely quiet in person because they are more comfortable communicating through the computer and have lost their real - life interaction skills. Although it is useful for staying in touch with overseas friends and family, one should not overdo it to the point of being uncomfortable in real - life interactions. Our eyes are one of the most important body parts. Most people are unaware that prolonged computer use strains the eyes, which can lead to various problems. For example, there is a high probability that computer - addicted individuals will need glasses in the future. A recent poll shows that over @PERCENT2 of people who use their computers for more than @NUM2 hours a day have acquired glasses. Over time, the strain can accumulate to the point where vision becomes severely impaired, even with glasses. Local newspaper, while computers are indeed great inventions, one should not overuse them.
259	259	1	2	"As society progresses, we are witnessing an influx of unnecessary technology, such as televisions. However, I want to focus on computers. In modern society, there is an unhealthy trend of excessive computer use. In the 21st century, almost everyone uses a computer. People have become so reliant on computers that if all computers were to malfunction, most individuals would be at a loss. This is similar to the Y2K scare, where people feared the end of the world because they thought computer systems would crash and all data would be lost. Humanity has become overly dependent on computers. Since many people rely on computers for various tasks, they often ""forget"" to exercise. Exercise is essential for our bodies. A sedentary lifestyle combined with a junk - food diet can lead to numerous health problems such as diabetes, influenza, heartburn, and other illnesses or disabilities. I firmly believe in the saying ""you are what you eat."" Life already has enough distractions; there is no need to add another one. The computer, initially an ""innocent"" invention, has now become a major distraction from maintaining good health. Nowadays, some people worship the computer as if it were a @CAPS3. Those who use the computer all day long become extremely lazy as they only want to sit and use it. In my opinion, everyone should engage in physical activities. Whether it's basketball, football, baseball, track, tennis, or my personal favorite, skateboarding, people should be physically active at least three times a week. Regular exercise improves bodily functions, enhances appearance, and boosts mood. Exercise can be enjoyable if one makes it so. I hope this essay makes you reflect on your lifestyle. Exercise should be an integral part of your daily routine, not sitting idle and searching for pointless videos on ""youtube."" The way you live your life is your choice, and I hope you choose a healthier one."
260	260	1	2	Over one million people use the computer daily. In my opinion, excessive computer use is unhealthy. Many people overindulge in computer time. It is advisable to manage a time schedule to ensure there is time for exercise and to use the computer only when necessary. One of the main consequences of excessive computer use is weight gain. Many individuals become overweight because they spend too much time on the computer. This problem can be addressed if we all work together. One person alone cannot bring about change, but a collective effort can make a difference. If there are other activities to do instead of playing on the computer, we should choose them. If someone realizes they are overweight due to computer use, they can make a change. By engaging in other activities, it is relatively easy to lose weight. A significant issue is that people are reluctant to create a simple chart to manage their computer usage. Having a chart in front of them can help some people better understand and control their computer time, which can yield positive results. Using the computer for schoolwork is acceptable, but it depends on the duration. I believe people should not spend more than @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours on the computer per day. They should complete their schoolwork and then log off. I would much rather see kids playing outside. Nature and wildlife offer far more value. The effects of computer use can vary, from weight gain to reduced family time and potential impacts on school performance. We need to use our time wisely.
261	261	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am of the opinion that a significant number of individuals allocate an excessive amount of time to using computers. Spending twenty minutes to half an hour on a computer is acceptable. However, using it for an hour or more is excessive. People can easily become engrossed in addictive games or online chat services such as Facebook, MySpace, and instant messaging. Additionally, some individuals may spend a long time on the computer when working on a report, often starting it at the last minute. These are just a few of the numerous ways people can get sucked into their computers. Have you ever started playing a game on the computer and then realized an hour had passed? Games are highly addictive, and it is easy to lose track of time while playing them. Although games can be enjoyable, they can also have a negative impact on the brain. Approximately @PERCENT1 of the global population spends an average of two hours a day on the computer. I believe that some games should be removed from the internet so that people can spend more time exercising and socializing with friends instead of playing trivial games. Have you ever engaged in a conversation and only later realized that you had been talking for an hour and a half and still had homework to do? On average, @PERCENT3 of teenagers spend three hours a day chatting with friends online. Examples of such platforms include Facebook, MySpace, and instant messaging. While it is normal to communicate with friends, it is important to monitor the time to avoid getting carried away. I think we should reduce our use of these websites to ensure that children and teenagers can complete their homework. Have you ever procrastinated starting a report until the last minute? Many teenagers do this. They wait until the day before the report is due to begin working on it, spending hours on the internet trying to finish it. This often results in lower grades compared to starting the report earlier. On average, @PERCENT2 of students wait until the last minute to complete their reports, spending over four hours on the computer. I believe that students should start their reports earlier to improve their grades. In conclusion, I strongly believe that people are spending far too much time on computers due to gaming, online chatting, and last - minute report writing. By removing some games from the internet, reducing online chat usage, and starting reports earlier, people will be more likely to exercise, spend time with friends and family, complete their homework, and achieve higher grades.
262	262	1	2	Do you think it's beneficial to be able to look up information on any topic or communicate with people who are far away? With a computer, these are indeed possible. Being able to talk to distant family members is a great advantage. Some individuals have relatives in other countries whom they haven't seen for a long time, and computers enable them to stay in touch. For instance, the people we sent to @ORGANIZATION1 have families here, and I've heard that they use computers to communicate because they miss their loved ones. Moreover, in areas with bad weather where going outside is not an option, a computer can be a great way to pass the time. Consider the people living in the @CAPS2. During winter, they often get a large amount of snow and have to stay indoors. If they have a computer, they can play games or watch videos to make the time pass more pleasantly. Another significant benefit of computers is the ability to search for any information. You can learn about far - off places without ever visiting them just by looking them up online. Some kids struggle with their homework, and a computer can be a valuable tool to help them understand the material better. Instead of telling the teacher the next day that they didn't do the homework, they can use the computer to gain more knowledge. In my view, computers have a positive impact on people. They allow us to search for information, assist children with their homework, and provide entertainment when we have nothing else to do.
263	263	1	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, every minute of the day, millions of computer users around the world log on to their laptops or desktops. The question has been raised as to whether excessive computer use is a bad thing. In fact, computers can be detrimental because people spend too much time on them, leading to a loss of quality time with friends and family. There are also dangers associated with online interaction and the risk of personal information being stolen. Countless individuals worldwide face these issues daily, and computer usage should be reduced. People of all ages, whether teens, kids, or adults, spend an excessive amount of time on computers, whether it's gaming, browsing websites, or typing essays. For example, among the @PERCENT1 of people with online - accessible computers, @PERCENT2 of them spend @NUM1 hours a day on them. This amounts to approximately @NUM2 billion hours of computer usage globally. As a result, both children and adults have lost face - to - face interaction with others. In the past, kids used to play outside, but nowadays, less than @PERCENT3 of all children get at least one hour of outdoor time. While computers are not inherently bad, overuse can be harmful to children's health. These factors have contributed significantly to the global obesity problem, and computer usage needs to be curbed to address this issue. The addition of online chat to computers has not only increased but also doubled computer usage. The invention of @CAPS2 and instant messaging was originally intended to be a positive development, but it has turned into a problem. Online chat allows people to send hateful and vulgar messages to their enemies without showing their faces. In some cases, teens have been so severely harassed online that they committed suicide. Additionally, dangerous criminals can use platforms like @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 to hide behind their computers and lure children or teens to a meeting place for kidnapping. Last year, @NUM3 out of @NUM4 online chat users were lured by a criminal to a ""meeting place"" and kidnapped, with most of them never being seen again. Millions, even billions, of dollars have been stolen by internet hackers. These hackers break security codes and use other people's money to make online purchases. Four out of five people admit to having multiple sites with personal information, and @NUM5 out of those four people have had at least one account hacked. This problem continues to grow as hackers target vulnerable sites. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, the current level of usage is causing numerous problems. Computer usage needs to be reduced to address issues such as loss of social interaction, online harassment, and information theft."
264	264	1	2	Dear editor, what do you do all day? Chances are, you spend a lot of time sitting in front of a computer. My friends believe that this is extremely unhealthy, and research has proven it. My mom also has experience with computers and shares the same view. Spending too much time on computers is not only bad for our well - being but also for the environment. Around @PERCENT1 of my friends think that computers are a waste of time. People who spend all day on computers often have an unstable diet and lack a proper exercise routine. They argue that the sedentary lifestyle associated with excessive computer use is unhealthy, and it won't change unless people get up and be active. They also worry that if this continues, our country will have a large number of overweight people. Dr. @ORGANIZATION1 has conducted extensive research and emphasizes that more people should get out and enjoy nature. He specifically points out that people sitting in front of a computer instead of being outdoors is not good for them. He has taught people that @PERCENT2 of the time, getting out and breathing fresh air can significantly improve one's life. My mom has firsthand experience with computers. She assures me that when she was younger, people couldn't just sit around without going outside. She believes it's crucial to interact with family and friends to maintain stable relationships. Talking to family helps them stay informed about what's going on in your life, and hanging out with friends enriches your life outside the household. She thinks any kid who sits in front of a computer all day should be disappointed in themselves. Editor, you've done an excellent job since taking on the role. I believe that in your next newspaper, you should stress the importance of not relying on computers all the time. You should encourage people to exercise as my friends suggest, enjoy nature as research has shown, and interact with family and friends as my mother advises. I'm confident that your next article, highlighting these points, will be well - received by readers.
265	265	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, computers have been a topic of intense debate for years, from legal disputes between lawyers and judges to family conflicts between parents and children. Could it be that computers are becoming too much of a good thing? Are they contributing to the increasing social awkwardness in today's society? It's concerning that our entire lives can be documented online where anyone can access it, and the content we view also raises many issues. One of the most discussed topics globally is whether people are less interested in exercise than they were in the @NUM2's. Studies show that in the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, @NUM3 out of @NUM1 people were overweight. As of @DATE1, this number has risen to @NUM5 out of @NUM1. It's truly astonishing. Some people might even be safer staying indoors because of the risks associated with imitating dangerous stunts seen in video games. If you've played a game where the player can lose health and restart when the health bar runs out, you might be tempted to try a dangerous, gravity - defying stunt after playing certain high - octane games. But in real life, there's no restart button. Did you know that @ORGANIZATION1 records everything you do online? For example, if you're a budding guitarist looking for a new Gibson guitar, you'll start receiving numerous ads from online stores. This is because @ORGANIZATION1 sells your information to businesses, and you give them permission by clicking the ""continue with install"" button. This leads to spam emails, but an even more serious threat is on the horizon - the risk of losing your bank account money. If a virus infects your computer, your funds could disappear. So, it's essential to be responsible when using the internet. Let's talk about the more sensitive issue. In the past, you had to buy a magazine or book to see the exploitation of young women. Now, it's just a click away. This is extremely harmful, especially for young boys who are exposed to such content at an early age, and their futures can be negatively affected. Moreover, there's also a high risk of virus attacks when accessing such content, putting you in a lot of trouble. I'm not saying that computers are completely terrible. They can be a good way to relieve stress, like taking out your frustration on a virtual alien in a game. However, they can sometimes be too much of a good thing. We need to use this technology responsibly to avoid the many problems associated with excessive computer use."
266	266	1	2	"Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have had a highly positive impact on people. As an increasing number of individuals use computers, the technology advances, and people gain access to a vast amount of information. Computers are excellent due to their convenience and ability to provide entertainment. For instance, if one wishes to know the capital of @LOCATION3 or the weather in @LOCATION2, all they need to do is search on the computer. The computer is so convenient that it can be used to answer any question. Take my cousin Courthey, for example. Every day, her teacher assigns definitions as homework, and she simply looks them up on the computer instead of spending time searching in the dictionary. Moreover, @PERSON4 is not the only one who finds the computer convenient. A survey revealed that @PERCENT1 of people voted that the computer is the most convenient tool when they have a question. Professor @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION2 stated, ""@CAPS1, as more people learn to use the computer, it becomes increasingly convenient for everyone."" In conclusion, many people rely on the computer for information, and it would be a pity to take this away from them.  On a @DATE1 @TIME1, when you're bored, what can you do? You can turn to the computer! It is an outstanding source of entertainment, whether you're listening to music, playing games, or chatting with friends. My neighbor, @PERSON3, comes home from school alone and often feels extremely bored. So, she uses the computer to play games and talk with friends. She can even communicate with her cousins, @PERSON5 and @PERSON6, who live in @LOCATION1. However, @PERSON3 is not the only one who communicates with relatives online. A survey showed that @PERCENT2 of people agreed that they use the computer to talk to relatives in other places. Dr. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""The computer is the primary source of entertainment for most teens and adults."" @CAPS2, surely you wouldn't want to deprive us of our main source of entertainment. After school, many teens and adults rush to the computers for various reasons. In conclusion, computers have positively influenced people with their remarkable convenience and excellent entertainment options."
267	267	1	2	To Whom @CAPS5 @MONTH1 Concern, @CAPS1, it is truly delightful to experience the joy of simply clicking a mouse and suddenly being able to talk to a friend you haven't seen in years. Computers make this a reality, but their benefits extend far beyond that. They contribute significantly to society by offering search engines and educational resources, enabling easy connections with friends and family, facilitating communication of important matters, and assisting in event planning, among other things.  First, computers have become an indispensable part of both education and research. Students from elementary schools to colleges can access a wealth of information that would be otherwise unavailable without computers. It is even possible to earn a college degree through online universities, which are emerging as a viable option. This is particularly beneficial for mothers who desire to obtain a degree while staying at home with their children. Additionally, computer technology has been applied in scientific research and hospitals. With the help of computers, new discoveries have been made, which have the potential to improve people's lives. Computers are used to search for a cure for cancer, study natural disasters such as earthquakes, and even detect diseases before symptoms appear. They have saved and enhanced lives in ways that were unimaginable sixty years ago.  Second, computers enable people to connect and reconnect with others around the @CAPS2. I recently created a Facebook account, and within a few days, I found three friends who had moved away, a distant cousin who had relocated to @LOCATION1, someone I hadn't seen since childhood, and even my great - grandmother. The possibilities are endless. Email has also been extremely beneficial to society as it helps people communicate and plan events, leading to my next point.  Lastly, computers facilitate communication among people across the @CAPS2. The internet is filled with websites designed to benefit society, such as @ORGANIZATION2; @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Without computers, this program would not have achieved the level of success and benefit it has. Another remarkable website combines education with the aspect of @CAPS2 @CAPS5. It quizzes users on different levels of general knowledge, and for each correct answer, @ORGANIZATION1 donates @NUM1 grains of @ORGANIZATION1. I sometimes visit this site when I'm bored, and so far, I've contributed to filling over thirty bowls of @ORGANIZATION1 while learning.  In conclusion, computers have proven to be beneficial to the @CAPS2 and all within it, not only for people but also for the environment. They advance research, help people reconnect, and facilitate communication. Who knows what else computers will help us achieve in the future?
268	268	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I would like to share my thoughts. Throughout history, humanity has been evolving, from cavemen discovering fire to the modern ability to fly. Along with this evolution, technology has advanced rapidly in recent years. While some people claim that certain technologies, like computers, are bad, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial. They offer the opportunity to learn about distant places, allow online communication with others, and enhance hand - eye coordination.  Computers provide access to places that one might not otherwise be able to visit. For example, if you're working on a research project about @LOCATION1 and have no relevant books, a computer is the ideal solution. The internet can provide the necessary facts, helping you achieve a good grade. While online, you can also communicate with friends and family who live far away. Computers can bridge long distances, enabling almost instant communication. Without them, it would be difficult to stay in touch with these people.  Using computers is beneficial for both the body and the mind. It helps improve hand - eye coordination. When you see something on the screen and click on it, you're actually exercising your body. Some people argue that using the computer means you're not interacting with friends and family, but that's incorrect. I've personally talked to my sister in another room while using the computer, which shows that computers also allow for interaction with loved ones.  I truly love computers. Don't you?
269	269	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I firmly believe that too many people are 'addicted' to computers and spend an excessive amount of time on them every day. This problem is not limited to teenagers; children and the youth have also fallen into the trap of computer addiction. When I was younger, I disliked computers and preferred to play outside. As I grew older, I started using computers more frequently. Now, I believe that computers take away time from family activities, reading good books, and hanging out with friends.  Instead of engaging in these enjoyable and interactive activities, people choose to spend their time on platforms like Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, YouTube, and addictive games. I strongly oppose this excessive attachment to computers, which is as bad as being glued to cheese. If there were something that could keep parents and children together, it certainly wouldn't be the computer. Computers distract kids and teenagers from other aspects of life and prevent families from truly being a family.  Before the invention of computers, family was the center of people's lives. Kids would come home from school and say, ""@CAPS3 dad, I'm home from school. Can we go play catch?"" Now, instead, kids come home to check if @CAPS4 has replied to their Facebook messages. Computers also reduce the interaction time that families used to have. On @DATE1 @TIME1, instead of chatting on MySpace, why not play a family board game, go out to a restaurant, discuss your next vacation, or play a game at the local baseball field?  I understand that some people may not like to go out and engage in physical activities, and that's understandable. However, that's no excuse for sitting in front of the computer instead of reading. Reading is not only fun but also beneficial for the brain. When you read, your brain is actively working, and you can learn new words to show off to your friends and family. It has been shown that @PERCENT1 of students who read regularly... while only @PERCENT2 of those who sit at the computer all day writing replies... In conclusion, we should be more aware of the negative impacts of computer addiction and strive to balance our use of computers with other important aspects of life."
270	270	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 Sun, I am of the opinion that computers are highly useful and offer numerous benefits to people. They enable individuals to stay informed about global events, develop hand - eye coordination, and meet new people online.  Firstly, computers allow people to learn about what is happening around the world. For example, I can keep track of local news by accessing your newspaper online. Others can gather information about potential travel destinations, including the local weather, which helps them pack appropriately. If one of your employees plans to go camping, they can use the computer to find a suitable camping site and learn about potential dangers to avoid. This is crucial because if they get sick during the trip, they won't be able to work. Clearly, computers play an important role in this regard.  Secondly, computers contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination. Many jobs require proficient manual skills. Suppose one of your printers breaks down, and you call a technician to fix it. The technician must have good hand - eye coordination to repair the printer effectively. Similarly, if the wiring in your lights malfunctions and you call an electrician, the electrician needs to be skilled in working with small wires. These skills can be developed through the use of computers. As such, computers are essential in today's workforce.  Finally, computers provide a platform for meeting new people online. After a long day of newspaper production, if you're feeling lonely, you can use the computer to connect with others in chat rooms or online games. Consider an employee who has just broken up with their girlfriend and is feeling sad and unproductive at work. They can use an online dating site to meet someone new, which may improve their mood and productivity. When they are happier at work, they can produce more newspapers, resulting in increased revenue for you.  In conclusion, computers are truly remarkable machines. They empower people to stay informed about global events, enhance hand - eye coordination, and expand social circles by meeting new people online. Their importance in modern life cannot be overstated.
271	271	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I would like to share my view on the situation regarding computers. In my opinion, computers offer more educational value than they cause limitations. For instance, when working on a research project and needing to find information about someone, the computer can quickly provide the details. Also, if planning a vacation to @LOCATION1, the internet can offer insights into the local lifestyle. Moreover, it is now possible to interact with family and friends while using the computer.  I can speak from personal experience. A couple of weeks ago, I had a social studies research project. Without the computer, I would have had to rely on books, which would have been much more time - consuming compared to simply looking up the information online. Additionally, for enhancing the project, I could easily find relevant pictures on Google.  The internet's utility doesn't stop there. Suppose you are planning a honeymoon trip to @LOCATION1 in a month but have no prior knowledge of the place. The computer allows you to learn about it and even take online classes to pick up the local language.  Regarding the concern that being on the computer all day hinders interaction, that's not true. Platforms like @ORGANIZATION1 enable you to chat with multiple friends simultaneously, and video - chatting lets you have face - to - face conversations.  In conclusion, I believe my letter and others like it can show the positive aspects of what computers can truly do.
272	272	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. They contribute to education, facilitate communication with family and friends, and enhance hand - eye coordination.  Computers are invaluable for education. Just look around; it's rare to find a college student without a laptop. Typing assignments and conducting research for essays are essential tasks that rely heavily on computers. The local library closes at @TIME1 pm, which is too early for college students who often work on homework late into the night. For example, if you have a huge essay due the next day at @NUM1 pm, without a computer, you'll be in a bind. Even if you choose to go to the library, it's a time - consuming process that may end up being fruitless if you forget something.  Another benefit of computers is the ability to communicate with friends and family. Email is a cost - effective alternative to cellphones. I have a @ORGANIZATION1 email and pay nothing for it, while the average American spends at least #@NUM2 per month on cellphones. Consider a situation where a family member has a baby and her father lives in @LOCATION1 @CAPS3. Through a webcam, they can have daily conversations, and the father can see the baby.  Lastly, computers can improve hand - eye coordination. My brother, @PERSON1, is obsessed with video games. His constant gaming has allowed him to multitask, like chewing gum, jotting down essay ideas, and thinking about lunch while playing.  In summary, it's clear that computers bring numerous benefits to people's lives. It's hard to deny the positive impact they have in various aspects.
273	273	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am of the opinion that computers have adverse effects on people.  One major issue is the impact on health. Kids and adults should spend more time outdoors. While computers can be useful for information - seeking, the excessive use of computers, especially for gaming, is harmful. It damages children's eyes and makes them lazy. Instead of chatting with friends on the computer, one should call a friend and play games outside. If this change in behavior continues, many kids will be fit and active.  Another problem is the spread of negative information on the computer. Putting bad or secretive things about others online can lead to teasing and humiliation. It can even break friendships if the information is sensitive.  The computer also contributes to the obesity problem. There are campaigns encouraging kids and adults to get up and be active. Without these initiatives, more kids would die at a faster rate due to being overweight. Scientists have found large fat deposits around the hearts of deceased children.  In conclusion, I hope that everyone takes my advice, turns off the computer, and gets active.
274	274	1	2	Dear local Newspaper, Computers offer a world of possibilities. They allow you to interact with loved ones far away, improve hand - eye coordination, and enhance learning experiences.  Imagine having a family member or friend fighting in a war miles away. With a computer and a webcam, you can see and talk to them. You can also make new friends from around the world without leaving your home.  Computers are also great for education. Dr. @PERSON1 has stated that people who use computers have better reflexes. I once had to write a @NUM1 - page paper for @CAPS4, and my hand cramped up while writing. Switching to the computer allowed me to finish the paper in half the time and also improved my hand - eye coordination.  In addition, computers are a valuable learning tool. Many computers are used for learning about different places and people. If you win free tickets to travel anywhere in the world with a celebrity of your choice, you can research the destination and plan the perfect trip. Even if you don't want to travel physically, you can explore places virtually on a computer. You can see the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION1, tropical reef fish, or the @ORGANIZATION2.  In conclusion, it's evident that computers have a positive effect on people. They bring the world to our fingertips and enrich our lives in many ways.
275	275	1	2	Dear @PERSON1, I believe that the advancements in technology and computers have a negative impact.  When computer companies like @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @ORGANIZATION1 make exciting updates to their systems, people are reluctant to turn off their computers. This is a problem as it takes time away from outdoor activities, exercise, and family time.  Nowadays, kids prefer to be on their computers rather than going outside. This is harmful because it's important for students to experience nature. They need to see animals, smell flowers, and feel the breeze. Exposure to the sun, despite its harmful days, is also crucial for health.  Computers also cut into exercise time. Everyone is supposed to get at least @NUM1 minutes of activity daily, but the prevalence of computers has led to a decrease in exercise and a significant increase in obesity rates. Obesity can make life difficult and lead to various diseases.  Another issue is the impact on family relationships. Family is one of the most important aspects of life, and spending time with family can boost a student's performance in school and sports, building self - confidence. However, computers are taking time away from this important bonding.  In conclusion, while computers may make life easier in some ways, their negative effects far outweigh the positives. They are robbing both children and adults of precious time that should be spent outdoors, exercising, and with family.
276	276	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are a negative influence. Most children return home from school and immediately log on to instant messaging platforms to chat with their friends. A significant percentage (represented as @PERCENT1) of @CAPS1 individuals are obese. In my view, engaging in outdoor activities with friends is far superior to sitting in a chair and playing on the computer. When kids play outside, they are bound to have more fun. Moreover, they will learn essential social interaction skills by playing together in the open. They will also have the opportunity to observe nature and gain knowledge about animals. In contrast, when kids are on computers, they are often sedentary and unproductive. Additionally, some children post inappropriate pictures of themselves on social media platforms like Facebook, which can lead to serious trouble. They may also say things online that they would never utter in person. The computer, therefore, serves as a means for kids to get into difficult situations. When playing baseball, football, or tag outside with friends, kids get exercise and have a great deal of fun. Regular exercise significantly reduces the likelihood of obesity. Some argue that computers enhance hand - eye coordination, but activities like catching a football or hitting a ball are more effective. Others claim that computers can provide information about distant places, but that is what school is for. In conclusion, physical activity and social interaction through outdoor play are clearly better than chatting or video - calling friends. There are too many overweight people in @LOCATION1, and the computer is not helping the situation. It is high time we encourage children to put down their devices and go outside.
277	277	1	2	Dear @LOCATION2 press, you may be unaware that @PERCENT1 of the @NUM1 people surveyed by the university in @LOCATION1 agreed that using laptops and computers had a profound positive impact on their lives. I wholeheartedly concur that computers bring significant benefits to society and our daily lives. With a computer, one can interact with people across the globe, receive assistance with schoolwork, and simplify daily routines. Five years ago, I had to relocate from @LOCATION4 to @LOCATION3, leaving behind all my family and friends. Thanks to modern technology, we could communicate with them via email, instant messaging, and video chat, eliminating the need for costly long - distance calls. There are numerous individuals like me who have friends and family living far away, whether they are in different countries, old schoolmates, or camp friends. Computers offer an excellent means of staying connected. Computers also streamline daily life. A mother taking care of her children might find it challenging to go to @CAPS1 & @CAPS2 when one child is engrossed in video games and the other is watching their favorite @CAPS3 show. Fortunately, she can go online, select the food and quantity she needs, and arrange for delivery. She may also be unable to go shopping, but with her computer, she can visit her favorite store's website, pick out the clothes she wants, and have them delivered. During @CAPS4, a computer can be invaluable, alleviating the stress of time constraints. While some people oppose the use of computers or believe that some individuals abuse their benefits by spending excessive time on them and neglecting physical activity and nature, as long as usage is reasonable, computers offer numerous advantages. In conclusion, computers are excellent for maintaining connections, simplifying daily life, and facilitating research for school. They are an indispensable part of modern life.
278	278	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I am convinced that computers have a positive effect on people. They are a remarkable piece of technology that enhances our knowledge, enables communication with others, improves hand - eye coordination, and provides faster access to news. Computers are a valuable source of knowledge. Instead of spending extra time searching for a book in the library for a report, one can look up the necessary facts online. The vast amount of information available on websites allows us to learn about anything we are interested in. For example, students can quickly find relevant information for their school projects. Computers also facilitate communication with family and friends. Unlike making phone calls or sending letters, which incur costs, sending an email is free. People with loved ones living far away can communicate with them as long as they want without any expense. Webcams can also be attached to computers (if not already built - in) to enable face - to - face communication. Another advantage of computers is their contribution to hand - eye coordination. Typing is a crucial skill that computers help us develop. While writing an essay by hand can be tiring and boring, typing on a computer is more efficient. Although it takes time to become proficient at typing, it is extremely useful in various aspects of life, such as writing term papers in high school or college application essays. Finally, computers keep us informed about the news faster. When significant events occur, like the earthquake in @LOCATION1, the information spreads on the internet before it reaches the traditional news media. In conclusion, computers are highly useful tools that enhance our knowledge, enable communication, improve hand - eye coordination, and provide timely news. Most importantly, they are a source of entertainment. We should embrace the benefits that computers offer in our daily lives.
279	279	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that technological advancements, particularly in the form of computers, have numerous positive impacts. Computers are beneficial for people of all ages as they teach hand - eye coordination, allow access to global information, and enable seamless online communication. These advancements have significantly improved society and the overall quality of life worldwide. Computers are excellent for developing hand - eye coordination. Typing is a skill that is essential in today's world, and computers provide the perfect platform for practicing it. Even young children can learn basic typing and hand - eye coordination skills through games on the computer, which will benefit them throughout their lives. In addition to skill development, computers are a vast repository of information. For instance, when students are assigned to write a report on a different country, the internet provides a wealth of information at their fingertips. Instead of spending hours in the library searching through books, they can quickly find the information they need. Moreover, when planning a family vacation, the internet can offer hundreds of vacation spot suggestions with just a few clicks. Computers also revolutionize communication. People with friends and family living far away can stay connected through platforms like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. Whether it's a business trip or just a long - distance relationship, the internet allows for instant communication. You can even have face - to - face conversations through a webcam. In conclusion, computers and technological advancements are a boon to humanity. They teach essential skills, provide access to global knowledge, and enable seamless communication. I urge the writers and editors of the newspaper to recognize the positive effects of these advancements. Technology can only enhance our way of life, and we should support its continued development for the betterment of all.
280	280	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1, I am of the opinion that computers have a positive influence on people. They are a highly useful piece of machinery that teaches hand - eye coordination, allows people to learn about distant places, and enables online communication. Computers play a vital role in developing hand - eye coordination. In school, students need to type various assignments such as @CAPS1 prompts, @CAPS2 labs, and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 vocab. Typing accurately and quickly requires practice, and the ability to type without looking at the keyboard is a prime example of hand - eye coordination. This skill is invaluable later in life, whether it's for writing term papers in high school or college application essays. Computers also offer a window to the world. A few years ago, when I was planning my first trip to @LOCATION3, I knew little about its history. Sitting at my desk and turning on my computer, I felt as if I was in @LOCATION3. I learned about its delicious cuisine, rich culture, and took a virtual tour of the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and the great @CAPS7. I even listened to @CAPS8 music and picked up some @CAPS8 words. In just an hour, I explored @LOCATION3 from the comfort of my home. Furthermore, computers facilitate communication. I have cousins living in @LOCATION2, and due to the @NUM3 - hour time difference, phone calls can be difficult. We use the computer to send emails and have video chats. Social networking sites like @CAPS10 or @CAPS11 accessible via computers allow us to connect with people we don't see regularly. On @CAPS11, we can even interact with our favorite stars or musicians. Some experts may claim that people spend too much time on computers, but this is not true for everyone. We still engage in physical activities, spend time outdoors, and interact with family and friends in person. The increasing use of computers is a positive trend as it brings so many benefits to our lives. In conclusion, computers are a powerful tool that enriches our lives in multiple ways, and we should continue to embrace their use.
281	281	1	2	To the Local Newspaper writer, I firmly believe that computers bring significant benefits to our society. They enable us to connect with others more rapidly and conveniently. Moreover, we no longer need to spend excessive time on the phone. This is why I am convinced that computers are advantageous for our society. Are computers a good or bad thing? Undoubtedly, they are a good thing as we can email our family and friends at any time. However, we should not be overly reliant on them. Without computers, communication would rely on phone calls or text messages, which is quite different. In my view, I am truly grateful for the existence of computers. On computers, we can access various platforms like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and even work. This clearly shows that without computers, our lives would be very different. I believe that most people do not spend too much time on computers because many use them for office work. Computers make our lives much easier. Although some people may misuse them, overall, I am certain that computers benefit our society.
282	282	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I understand you're seeking opinions on whether computers have a positive impact on people. Despite many opposing views, I firmly believe computers have a positive effect. Firstly, computers are excellent for research. Without them, both children and adults would lack essential tools for acquiring knowledge. Studies indicate that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students have computers at home, and a student without computer access may receive about @PERCENT1 lower grades due to poor research abilities on projects. Secondly, computers can unite the world. Users of Facebook, @CAPS2, and Twitter can communicate with people across the street, the country, or even the ocean. People in @LOCATION5 can play games and chat with those in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION3. Thirdly, computers are great for businesses. Many people have job - related websites that increase their visibility and help others understand their business. Take your newspaper as an example. Without computers, you couldn't conduct research, type, or print your newspaper, and your website wouldn't be able to attract readers. Although some people may abuse computer privileges by spending too much time on them instead of exercising or interacting with others, it's only @PERCENT2 of computer users. It's their choice, and there's little we can do to change it. In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial to people as they facilitate research, support schoolwork and business, and enable global communication.
283	283	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I'm writing to express my disagreement with the idea of keeping kids off computers. Computers are educational as they teach kids hand - eye coordination. For those interested in working with computers in the future, they can learn to operate them. There are also websites that offer guidance on using a computer. Additionally, computers are essential for homework. When kids come home from school, they often have assignments that need to be done on the computer. If they can't use computers, it will be difficult for them to complete their homework. For instance, if a class tells the teacher they don't have access to computers, it will pose a problem. Moreover, computers are a great way to relax. After a long day at school, I like to do my homework and then listen to music on the computer. If computers were taken away, people would be constantly in a bad mood. Therefore, I think kids should be allowed to use computers, and we get enough exercise in school by carrying heavy books.
284	284	1	2	Dear @STATE1 news, computers are an outstanding invention with a positive impact on people. They are extremely useful in daily life. People can conduct research, learn about any topic, and communicate with friends online. When writing a school paper or working on a project, if you need to know about an unfamiliar topic, you can search for answers on the internet. For example, if you're planning a family vacation to California, you can book flights, reserve hotel rooms, and explore tourist attractions right on your computer. You can even learn a new language or take online courses if you're too busy to attend college. In addition, social media platforms like Facebook and MySpace are excellent for staying in touch with friends. You can instant - message them and get quick responses. Overall, computers are beneficial as they support research, learning, and social interaction. I hope you recognize their importance and agree that everyone should have access to them.
285	285	1	2	I walked into the living room and saw my mom intently looking at the computer screen, with pictures of caller masters and logos all over the web page. I realized that the internet had convinced my mom better than I could that we should go on vacation. Nowadays, more and more people use computers. While some oppose the positive view of computers, I strongly support them. They make work easier and allow us to communicate with people thousands of miles away instantly. I have a personal experience to illustrate this. One day, I was feeling down in the basement. Then, I heard the familiar sound of my computer's speaker when I received an instant message. It was @PERSON1, a close friend from a camp I used to go to. He invited me to go for a bike ride and hang out. I happily agreed. Without computers and instant messaging, @PERSON1 and I, along with @ORGANIZATION1, would have drifted apart. An exaggerated argument against computers is that users don't exercise. I use my computer frequently, but I've come up with a system. Every time I enter the room where my computer is, I do @NUM1 pull - ups. I started this system @NUM2 months ago, and I've seen significant improvement in my muscles. I can now do @NUM3 pull - ups at a time, compared to struggling with @NUM2 at the beginning. Computers also provide easy access to the internet, which has vast amounts of information. I've often used it for essay research when textbooks were insufficient. For example, my country project last year got very little information from books. Additionally, computers can be great teachers. A student who had never done water sports learned to waterski after watching YouTube videos for @NUM2 weeks. In conclusion, computers are amazing as they maintain friendships, encourage exercise, and offer endless learning opportunities. We should spread the word about their benefits.
286	286	1	2	Dear Computer Co., computers have a detrimental impact. If one can play life - like games on a computer, why would they venture outside? I firmly believe that the games on computers should be removed so that people can relish all the wonderful aspects of life. Were people not glued to computers all day, they would notice how they are destroying nature. In conclusion, eliminating computer games could lead people to engage more with the real world and be more conscious of environmental protection.
287	287	1	2	"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, your access to resources, entertainment, and communication with others might be diminishing. You know that a large number of people think this @PERSON2 is harming our society. However, I believe they fail to recognize the benefits that computers bring. Computers act as silent teachers, imparting knowledge without our full awareness. Hand - eye coordination is a prime example. Moreover, we use computers to explore potential travel destinations or have conversations with distant friends and family. Computers are an extraordinary piece of technology. First, every physical activity requires hand - eye coordination, such as cooking, cycling, or driving. Unfortunately, not everyone excels in this area. One of @CAPS7 friends, @PERSON1, had extremely poor hand - eye coordination. So, for his birthday, I decided to get him a computer. It's been @NUM1 month since he got it. At his son's party, when he tried to hit a baseball, he managed to hit the ball @NUM2 out of @NUM3, compared to his previous record of @NUM1 or @NUM5 out of @NUM6. This is a tremendous improvement in just @NUM1 month! A simple computer significantly enhanced @CAPS7 friend's hand - eye coordination. Second, computers can help us learn about far - off places like @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION4. Do you really want to endure the icy cold and piercing winds of @LOCATION1 just to learn about it? Some might, but what if you can't travel there due to financial or flight - related issues? I want to study polar bears and glaciers without worry. A statistic from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of @CAPS5 states that ""@PERCENT2 of people would love to experience the thrill of the @ORGANIZATION1 lights. But only @PERCENT3 of them said they'd actually travel to @LOCATION2 to see them"". So, @PERCENT4 of those people won't go, whether due to money or the cold. They say they love the computer because they can experience the @ORGANIZATION1 lights without braving the cold. Finally, there's nothing better than using a computer to communicate with family you rarely see. The editor for the @LOCATION3 Local said, ""@CAPS7 parents live over @NUM8 miles away. I rarely get to talk to them because I can't afford to travel often. So, I use my computer, and now we communicate @PERCENT1 more than before. I love the computer as it keeps me close to my loved ones."" In conclusion, computers are a gracious and highly beneficial device that can improve hand - eye coordination, help us learn about distant places, and facilitate communication with loved ones."
288	288	1	2	Dear newspaper, I am of the opinion that excessive computer use is detrimental. Many people spend an inordinate amount of time on the internet. They become so engrossed that they neglect normal activities. Staying up all night on the internet leads to sleep deprivation, leaving them exhausted during the day. A large number of people are internet - addicted, which causes them to spend less time with their families. This results in the breakdown of relationships with family and friends. Lack of exercise is also a consequence of this addiction. For instance, my stepbrother is constantly on the internet and ignores everyone around him because of his game. Another problem is over - focus on the internet. People forget about the real world, neglect their chores, and don't cook for their families. They also have no time for outdoor activities they once enjoyed. Internet addicts usually don't sleep well and have no time to study at night. As a result, they are tired at school or work during the day. Last month, my mom joined Facebook and is always on it. She ignores everything around her when using it. She tells me she has no time to study because of the internet and has even stopped reading the Bible in her free time. In conclusion, getting hooked on the internet is a bad habit. It ruins relationships, leads to a sedentary lifestyle, and causes people to neglect their responsibilities.
289	289	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, the impact of computers on people is not positive. I believe people spend too much time on computers. There is inaccurate information on computers, and there are still telephones and cellphones for communication. Most people waste a significant amount of their time on computers, whether it's playing games, checking @CAPS2 - mail, or working. This time could be better spent on more important things like being with family and friends, enjoying nature, or exercising. Excessive computer use instead of exercise has had a major impact on people's health. Some people are overweight because they eat and then don't exercise. My sister works on the computer all day, and she says @NUM1 or @NUM2 ladies at her workplace are unhealthy because they only use the computer and eat granola bars, which are usually healthy. If people spent at least half an hour outside breathing fresh air instead of using the computer, they would feel better. My doctor used to tell me and my brother, ""@CAPS3 out and play an hour a day!"" This is good advice, and I strongly encourage people to engage in outdoor activities rather than playing on the computer. Computers are often used for research. While some information is helpful, it's hard to determine the accuracy. When using books or encyclopedias, we can trust the sources. If you had to write a report using only the internet, how could you know if the information is reliable? Sure, computers can improve hand - eye coordination through video games, but in real life, do you need to know how to shoot a dragon or dodge falling candy? This is just an example of unnecessary information and skills that keep people glued to the computer. Another function of the computer is communication. Before computers were advanced, people were happy to make phone calls. Now, with computers, people use @CAPS2 - mail, instant messaging, or Skype. What happened to cellphones? In conclusion, people should reduce their computer use, focus on more meaningful activities, and be more cautious about the information they obtain from the internet."
290	290	1	2	Dear reader, @CAPS1, there has been a debate about whether computers are truly beneficial to society, especially since most @CAPS2 now own one. Computers assist people with daily tasks and clearly do more good than harm. It's hard to imagine how most people could do their jobs without them; life would become much more difficult. Consider successful schools in our country; it's rare to find one without computers. Computers are the easiest way to access information, which is crucial for children's learning. Whenever someone has a question, they can simply Google it, which is very useful for research projects. Thanks to computers, people are more knowledgeable. Computers are not only important in school but also in the workplace. They allow people to conveniently type up papers and submit them to bosses or teachers, saving time and effort while producing a more professional result. Computers also play a vital role in communication. Through email or instant messaging, one can communicate with someone on the other side of the world without a huge phone bill. Some @MONTH1 view this as dangerous because one could chat with strangers. However, it also exposes us to new cultures. Now, it's possible to learn about life in @LOCATION1 firsthand. Without computers, it would be extremely difficult for an ordinary person to interact with someone from another country, almost like being isolated from the world. Many people are interested in learning other languages, and there are better ways than sitting in a classroom. As a global citizen, do you really want to be cut off from others just because they live far away? A major concern about computers is that people will stop reading books. However, a recent study shows that more people have started reading since computers became popular. This proves that the emergence of new and fun technology doesn't mean other activities will be abandoned. People will continue to do what they've always done, with an additional option. Moreover, it's up to each individual whether they want to spend time on the computer. If someone doesn't like the idea, they have no right to deprive others of it. Computers were created to help humanity, not control it. In conclusion, computers are a universal device that broadens our horizons, allows us to learn new things, and promotes communication. They are a positive addition to our lives and should be embraced.
291	291	1	2	Have you ever considered the remarkable contributions that computers have made to our lives? Currently, we can acquire knowledge about anything we're interested in, communicate with individuals across the globe, and even drive progress in other technological domains. There's no doubt that computers have had a positive impact on people. Just envision this: one moment, you can be in the scorching deserts of @LOCATION3, and the next, in a lush, steamy jungle teeming with wildlife—all without leaving your room! Through computers, people can explore new places and things at their convenience. The vast array of resources on the internet enables us to learn about different places and time periods. Although this information might be available in a local library, accessing it via the computer is far more convenient. Why go through the hassle of borrowing books from the library when the internet is accessible at any time? There's no need to register for a library card, no late fees, and no waiting lists. Clearly, using a computer for research is highly valuable. @NUM1 out of ten people stated that they prefer to email someone rather than talk on the phone. With computers, people can instant message or email anyone anywhere in the world. Making a call from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 can be costly, but with email, I can communicate with my @CAPS1 friend, @PERSON1, for free. I recall when she moved to @LOCATION2. It was sad, but we promised to stay in touch. Thanks to email and instant messaging, it was easy to keep in touch and share the latest news! The ability to communicate effortlessly is an incredible privilege that wouldn't exist without the aid of computers. Lastly, computers have facilitated advancements in other areas of technology. Where would we be in science and medicine without computers? These machines have assisted scientists in conducting experiments. Through simulated experiments, they can ensure that no other variables will influence the results, making experiments extremely accurate. Computers have also contributed to the progress of medicine. They've been crucial in discovering cures for various dangerous diseases. Who knows, perhaps in @NUM2 years, there will be a cure for cancer. All these remarkable achievements have been positively influenced by computers. Although some people might think that computers have a negative impact on our daily lives, I firmly disagree. People can learn, communicate, and drive technological progress with just a click of a mouse. Computers have had a positive impact on people in numerous ways, so keep clicking!
292	292	1	2	"Forty years ago, life was far more challenging. People had to travel to libraries to conduct research, and every document, doctor's note, and building plan had to be written by hand or on an old - typewriter. Today, computers have transformed our lives. They allow us to communicate with one another, access millions of websites on the internet, and assist with schoolwork. Almost every day, my mom and dad receive friend requests from long - lost school friends, relatives, and current friends. Modern computers enable the world to connect and stay informed. My dad always says, ""@CAPS2 makes the world go round."" With social networking sites, everyone is constantly receiving a wealth of @CAPS2 about each other. Video chat is another effective communication method. All @CAPS3 computers come equipped with a video camera, and if you have a @CAPS4, you can purchase one. This allows you to see the person you're talking to. I've heard many inspiring stories about video chat. One involves a soldier in @LOCATION1 and his wife back home. The doctors set up a computer with video chat in the operating room, and the soldier was, in a sense, present in two places at once. He got to witness the birth of his baby and see his wife. Computers are truly amazing! Another great aspect of computers is their easy access to the internet. There's a useful website called @CAPS5.Dcotors.Com. If you have an illness or a symptom, simply type it on the homepage, and it will list all possible causes, outcomes, treatment methods, and where to find the medicine. In the past, one had to visit a doctor and pay for a consultation. Computers also greatly assist with schoolwork. Many teachers now require students to type their assignments as it's easier to read and correct. I also find typing faster than writing. For example, if you need to research the periodic table and record @NUM1 facts and all the elements, there are countless websites on this topic. Just type it into Google. You can also enhance your work by adding images through copy - pasting. Computers benefit both students and teachers. Finally, computers (and keyboards) are helping people improve hand - eye coordination. Many schools offer typing classes to help students. I recently found a study by @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 on the internet, which showed that people who practice typing for at least @NUM2 minutes a day can improve their hand - eye coordination by @PERCENT1. This improvement would benefit many people. In conclusion, computers have had a profound and positive impact on our lives. From communication to internet access, and even in improving physical skills, they've made the world a better place. If we were to abandon computers, the world would surely be a much worse place."
293	293	1	2	Dear Newspaper people, in my opinion, computers have had a significant impact on our lives. Without computers, we wouldn't be able to research important people and events. For instance, I didn't know who Harry @PERSON1 was until I looked him up on the internet. He was the @NUM1 president. Also, typing important papers would be a hassle. Many people, especially those with @CAPS3, rely on computers to type their papers. Without them, everything would have to be hand - written, and some people have poor handwriting. Moreover, computers provide multiple ways to communicate. If your phone is dead or broken, you can email a family member or friend. You can also use Facebook or instant messaging. For example, if you need to tell someone something important, these digital communication methods come in handy. In conclusion, computers have become an essential part of our lives. They facilitate research, make paper - writing easier, and offer various communication channels. While it's important to have other forms of exercise and activity, the benefits of computers cannot be ignored.
294	294	1	2	Dear readers of @ORGANIZATION1, currently, there's a debate about whether computers benefit society. In my view, computers offer numerous advantages. Firstly, they can assist children with their schoolwork. Not all children are outgoing, and a computer can be a great help. Many kids aren't sure what they want to do in life, and the computer can guide them. Every child from kindergarten to the end of their schooling has homework. Computers can help with math, science, and social studies assignments. As children enter middle school, they need to do reports and projects. If a parent can't take their child to the library to borrow books that might get lost and require payment, the computer provides a convenient alternative. Secondly, computers enhance communication in several ways. Some kids like to use @CAPS2 to chat. While parents may think @CAPS2 is their world, it can also be used to organize groups. There are many shy people who are afraid to socialize, and the computer can help them make friends. Additionally, if you're late or unable to attend an appointment or meeting, you can inform the other person using the computer. Thirdly, computers can help people discover their career paths. If someone is good at fixing computers, they can become a computer @CAPS3. There are also many beautiful places whose pictures people upload to their computers. Some people may discover their talent through the computer. For example, someone having a bad day can write a story, share it with friends, and potentially get it published. In conclusion, computers are incredibly beneficial to society. They help with schoolwork, improve communication, and assist people in finding their talents and career paths. I firmly believe that computers play a great role in helping society progress.
295	295	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that the over - use of computers by kids and adults has a negative impact on people. Firstly, computers can lead to addiction. Once people get addicted to computers, it's difficult to break free. They become so engrossed in the virtual world that they forget to live a real - life. Addiction is hard to overcome, so we shouldn't confine ourselves to a virtual box but live life to the fullest. Secondly, spending excessive time on computers makes people lazy. The less they exercise, the less active they become. This is especially a problem for teens. Teens are constantly surrounded by computers, cell phones, iPods, and other electronics. Many teens get irritable and moody with their parents due to excessive screen time. Lack of exercise can lead to severe consequences such as obesity and cancer. Obesity can occur not only from overeating but also from a sedentary lifestyle. People who don't move around become lazy and lose the motivation to do anything. Finally, computers cause people to spend less time with their families. In daily life, teens are often glued to their cell phones, computers, and music players. These electronics are driving a wedge between teens and their loved ones. If this trend continues, many teens will lose the important relationships in their lives. In conclusion, computers have a detrimental effect on people. They cause addiction, make people lazy, and reduce the time spent with family. We should be more aware of these issues and use computers in a more balanced way to avoid these negative consequences.
296	296	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1. I firmly believe that computers are highly useful, and people can gain a wealth of knowledge from them. The computer is an incredibly intelligent invention and is perhaps the most remarkable technological advancement to date. Computers are invaluable when one needs to gather information about a particular person. For instance, if you're a policeman and your superior instructs you to meet someone at @ORGANIZATION1 and tells you about the person they're pursuing, but you know nothing about that individual, a computer can provide details about their criminal record and convictions. Similarly, if your teacher assigns a report on "" @PERSON3 lopez"" and you're unfamiliar with the person, you can use the computer to learn about their life. Additionally, if you're interested in your country's history and the leaders behind it, the computer is an excellent resource. Computers also greatly assist students with their homework. If your teacher asks for a neat essay on @PERSON2 and your handwriting is poor, you can use a word - processing program on the computer. If you forget to write down your homework in your agenda, you can check the school website. And if your teacher asks you to find a book about the @CAPS1 and all copies in the library are taken, you can search on the computer for a nearby place that has the book. Another significant advantage of computers is that they help you stay in touch with family and friends. Writing letters can be time - consuming, so you can use online messengers like ""@CAPS2"", Facebook, or MySpace. If you send a letter to the wrong address, you can go online to contact a friend or family member. Moreover, you can have face - to - face conversations via webcam. I sincerely hope you share my view that computers are useful and beneficial to people. They facilitate learning about others, support students in their studies, and enable us to connect with loved ones. I trust you'll find my views worthy of consideration."
297	297	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I'm aware of the ongoing debate about the impact of computers on society, and I firmly believe that they bring significant benefits. Firstly, the online capabilities of computers are a major asset. Through online chat rooms, people can interact with others, which can boost morale, especially for military officers and soldiers who are separated from their families. They can have instant virtual meetings with their loved ones. Online banking is also a great convenience; it saves a trip to the bank and reduces gas consumption by allowing you to pay bills from home. Secondly, the internet, created @NUM1 years ago, is a remarkable invention. You can purchase items on websites like eBay and Amazon, which saves time. It also enables you to learn about foreign nations and stay updated with news. People can get immediate information about natural disasters and community problems, rather than relying on newspapers or television. Finally, computers offer overall help in various situations. For students, online research can improve their grades on projects. Studies have shown that computer training, such as playing online games like Call of Duty, can enhance soldiers' accuracy by improving hand - eye coordination by @PERCENT1. This seemingly small improvement can be life - saving on the battlefield. Computers are also widely available in places like libraries and internet cafes. Some may argue that computers take time away from exercise, but this can be easily addressed by using the internet to buy an indoor jogger. In conclusion, computers benefit society through their online features, the internet, and their overall utility in future scenarios. I hope you will support the cause of computers. Thank you for considering my opinion.
298	298	1	2	Dear newspaper, I am of the opinion that the use of computers is highly beneficial. They can teach people hand - eye coordination. When using a computer, people learn to focus their eyes and use their hands simultaneously. To maintain focus, one might need to wear glasses to deal with the light, and this also helps when typing without constantly looking down. Coordinating hands on the computer helps users know the location of different keys. Computers also offer the opportunity to learn about different states and countries. You can assess how nice or bad these places are, read about their cultures and religions. In the states, you can learn about @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2 and appreciate the beauty of your own state. Another advantage is the ability to interact with family and friends online. There are numerous websites where you can search for and communicate with your loved ones, even if they are in a different state. You can discuss various topics such as family life and express your feelings of missing them. In addition to these benefits, computers allow you to play different games, type on a notepad, and use the calculator when stuck on a math problem. Overall, computers are a valuable tool that can teach hand - eye coordination, help you connect with others, and expand your knowledge about different places. I strongly believe people should make use of computers.
299	299	1	2	Some may question whether computers have a negative impact on people, but I firmly believe they are a positive force. Computers provide an easier and faster way to access information. One of the main advantages is the ability to learn about faraway places. The internet offers a quicker source of news compared to newspapers, which may take a day to publish. If you don't have the money to travel, you can explore these places online. It's a more efficient way to gather information about the world. The computer business also relies heavily on computers. There are numerous jobs that require computer skills. Without computers, many people would be unemployed, and businesses would struggle due to a lack of necessary information. Moreover, computers enable us to communicate with people from afar. While phone calls are an option, video chat allows you to see and talk to the person, which is a more personal experience. It helps in making new friends and staying in touch with old ones and relatives. Without computers, we would lose touch with those living far away. In conclusion, computers are an excellent means of getting information. They allow us to learn about far - off places, support the computer - related job market, and facilitate long - distance communication. I am convinced that computers have a positive impact on society.
300	300	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, when you look at a map, whether it's of a town, a state, a country, or the world, you'll see computers everywhere. It's time to shut down these computers and start focusing on exercise, enjoying nature, and spending time with our families. Obesity is a major problem, and computers are partly to blame. Take @CAPS5, for example. He used to weigh over @NUM1 pounds because he spent all his time on the computer. But when he decided to exercise, he lost a significant amount of weight and now weighs only @NUM2 pounds. A doctor, computer expert, and author on exercise, nature, and family, @PERSON1, says that if people stopped using computers and went to the gym, over @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1's obesity would decline. Computers also cause people to miss out on the beauty of nature. @PERSON1 claims that over @PERCENT2 of people will never experience nature once they get a computer. Imagine the sight of plump fruits hanging from lush green bushes in spring, the magnificent waterfall shining as it flows into a creek, and the peaceful scenery under the oak trees with the sounds of crickets and owls. This is what we should encourage people to enjoy, not waste time on electronics. Furthermore, computers are keeping people away from their families. My friend @PERSON2 was once a captive of the computer, but he managed to break free in time to prevent his child from attending an illegal party. @PERSON1 says that @PERCENT3 of families with computers have little communication and may end up splitting. We must put an end to this. Computers are making us their slaves, preventing us from exercising, enjoying nature, and spending time with our families. I urge you to join me in this fight to bring people back to the real world.
301	301	1	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, the focus of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 is entirely on computers, which are seemingly capable of everything. However, it is worth pondering whether they genuinely assist us. While computers can conduct research, they have a negative physical impact. People spend less time exercising, interacting with family and friends, and this can have long - term consequences for @CAPS1 lives. Exercise is essential for @CAPS1. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 states, ""People need to engage in activities other than sitting in front of the computer screen."" In fact, one hour of exercise is beneficial for health, yet two - thirds of @CAPS4 do not exercise. This is why @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in @CAPS3 often leads to a state of laziness, inactivity, worthlessness, and overweight, and computers are to blame. The lack of face - to - face interaction with relatives is also due to computers. Although computers allow us to video - chat with relatives, use social media like Facebook and MySpace, or chat via other means, this convenience promotes laziness. One could visit relatives in person instead. As @PERSON2 says, why waste energy going to a travel agency when the internet can serve the same purpose? @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people have not seen their relatives in other states for years. People are overly reliant on computers for games and other activities. @NUM3 out of @NUM1 @CAPS4 use the computer daily. Computers also cause job losses. Since everything is simplified, there is less need to hire secretaries, employees, and other office personnel. Factories can use computerized @CAPS10 to take over jobs more quickly, easily, and cheaply, and they may eventually replace human workers completely. In conclusion, although computers initially seemed like a great invention, upon closer examination, they prevent us from exercising, seeing friends and family, and can have a detrimental impact on @CAPS1 lives. I hope you understand my perspective."
302	302	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 times, do you think computers benefit society? I firmly believe they do! There are numerous reasons why computers are both resourceful and helpful. In our community of Watertown, many citizens view computers as an excellent resource, while others hold the opposite view. Computers can benefit society in multiple ways. Firstly, the internet on a computer offers more than @NUM1 million things to learn. When struggling with homework, a computer is a valuable resource. For instance, one can quickly access @CAPS3.com to search for any topic. If you need to know a conversion, it can be easily found on the internet. Additionally, websites like nytimes.com and cnn.com provide daily news, which I personally use weekly. When planning a vacation, the computer can help you learn about different destinations. When my family planned our trip to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1, we relied heavily on the computer. Secondly, the internet provides various ways to interact with people. Social networking websites such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter allow us to connect with family and friends from the past. These free platforms enable us to add friends, send messages, and post pictures. Web - chatting allows for video communication, where you can see someone from across the @ORGANIZATION1 through your webcam. Emailing is also an effective way to communicate, similar to writing a visual letter. Lastly, computers are indispensable in business. Microsoft Office, including Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and @CAPS4, is widely used in countless businesses for planning, selling, presenting, managing, and writing about products. Businesses also use web - chatting for conference calls, enabling a production company to communicate face - to - face with a Chinese company without being in the same room. Moreover, in manufacturing, work sites like @CAPS5 companies use computers to control machines. I know this because I watched a show about the @ORGANIZATION2 factory on @CAPS5 @CAPS6. In conclusion, computers have a profound and positive impact on people. They can teach us new things, connect us with others across the @ORGANIZATION1, and are essential for business operations. If I were an expert, I would have no concerns about computers as they are truly magnificent. Do you share the same belief?
303	303	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, the use of computers does not bring benefits to our society. Instead of spending quality time with our loved ones, such as friends and family, we are consumed by this electronic device that many rely on. Having a computer in our daily lives is not a good thing. It consumes a large amount of electricity, is expensive to purchase and replace, and exposes our private information to hackers and other malicious individuals. The electricity consumption is just the beginning. Using electricity for this so - called device not only wastes money but also harms the environment. Greenhouse gases and fuel are being wasted, and the air is being poisoned. A local environmentalist, @CAPS3, says, ""I don't have a computer at my house, and I get along pretty well."" This shows that we can live well without computers taking over our lives. In addition to being harmful to the environment, computers are also bad for the economy. My dad often says he doesn't like to waste money, yet he bought a computer that crashed twice. The money spent on buying, restoring it once, and then restoring it a second time is a complete waste. Computers also waste our time. My grandfather always said, ""I don't know why you folks waste all your precious time and money on these doo - dads!"" As more people acquire new devices, it becomes difficult to keep track of information, which is a nightmare for ordinary people but a boon for hackers. As people become less aware of their electronic lives, hackers can obtain whatever they want. A local resident said, ""A few months ago, I posted a message on the @CAPS5 website's message board saying I would be on vacation for a week. Since it was a mobile upload, my address was also posted. When I came back, half the things in my house were gone!"" Burglaries, robberies, and easy internet access can lead to chaos. The protection provided by computers is weak. In summary, computers consume a large amount of electricity, waste our time and money, and allow bad people access to our private information. Please recognize how terrible computers can be."
304	304	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, I disagree with the view that some people support technological advances and believe that computers have a positive effect on people. There are several reasons for my disagreement. Firstly, staying up late on the computer affects sleep. Many people don't get enough sleep, which makes them grumpy in the morning. I once stayed at @CAPS1 friend's house, and she was up on the computer all night without any sleep. In the morning, she was extremely grumpy. @CAPS1 language arts teacher, ""@PERSON1"", says, ""Staying up late on the computer all night isn't healthy because you get dark circles under your eyes and you're sleepy. There are a lot of side effects."" @NUM1 out of @PERCENT1 of parents agree with this view. Secondly, computers lead to less exercise. Parents should consider whether they want their kids to be lazy and on the computer all day or to exercise and get healthier. @CAPS1 friend's kids used to be on the computer all the time, which is not healthy, especially for their young age. A few weeks ago, I talked to them about being active, and now they rarely go on the computer and are always outside playing. @CAPS1 science teacher, @PERSON3, says, ""Exercise is better than doing anything non - active, and it can be fun."" @NUM2 out of @PERCENT2 of kids agree with @CAPS1 science teacher @PERSON2. Thirdly, interacting with family and friends in person is better than being on the computer. If you were in your family's shoes, you would realize they would rather have you hang out with them. When I was younger, my family had to yell at me to get me off the computer. Eventually, I understood their feelings. @CAPS1 mom says, ""I should hang out with @CAPS1 family and friends more often."" @NUM3 out of @PERCENT3 of @CAPS1 family members and friends agree with @CAPS1 mom. In conclusion, I disagree with the statement that computers have a positive effect on people because they cause people to get insufficient sleep, exercise less, and interact less with friends and family."
305	305	1	2	"Computers are a highly debated topic. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of homes in @LOCATION1 own at least one computer, and about @PERCENT2 in @LOCATION2 do as well? Some people are not happy about this, while others embrace it. I own a computer, and it offers numerous benefits. Firstly, it helps with writing. At school, I use it for English writing prompts and to write conclusions for science labs. Many other kids also find it helpful in this regard. Secondly, computers are great for entertainment. Millions of people play games on computers, such as ""World of Warcraft"", ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1"", and classics like ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5"". Social networking sites like @CAPS6 and Twitter allow us to connect with others, and instant messaging (I.M.) enables real - time conversations with friends. I.M., or @CAPS7 messaging, is almost instantaneous, similar to email but more immediate. Video - chatting is another great feature, where you can see the person you're talking to, almost like a face - to - face meeting. Thirdly, computers make shopping easier. You can order products from websites. For example, I got my @CAPS8 from @LOCATION3, and my dad is going to buy a @LOCATION1 bulb on @ORGANIZATION1 as the bulb for our @CAPS9 is wearing out. This is especially convenient for the @CAPS10 @PERSON1, as they don't have to drive to the store. In conclusion, I believe computers are beneficial to society as they assist with writing, provide entertainment and socialization opportunities, and simplify shopping. Although my reasons may not be the most comprehensive, they are important to me. The ability to type essays, play games, socialize, and order products online is truly amazing. These are some of the reasons why I and many others love computers. I wonder, do you like or dislike computers?"
306	306	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, computers are essential for development. They impart skills such as hand - eye coordination, enable online communication, and facilitate learning about distant people and places. Although many people disagree, I firmly believe that computers benefit society. Nine out of @NUM1 schools use computers daily, and their communities remain in good condition. I understand your concern that computers are reducing real - world social time, but in fact, they are enhancing the community. Consider a student playing basketball. If his teammate passes the ball and he fails to catch it due to a lack of hand - eye coordination, this issue could be mitigated if he spent more time on the computer. There are numerous coordination games on the internet, like pinball of @CAPS1, which help develop this skill. When playing these games, one keeps their hand on the mouse or keyboard and eyes on the screen, which trains the ability to avoid looking down. This skill is transferable to basketball, enabling better ball - catching and throwing. @NUM1 out of people stay in touch with family or friends online. Communicating with someone you haven't seen in a while is a wonderful feeling, as it confirms that they still remember you. Online communication allows you to know others better, as they may share things they wouldn't disclose otherwise. When you meet in person, you'll have more topics to discuss. Moreover, if you plan to visit a place, researching it on the internet can prevent disappointment. Suppose you want to learn about a famous person; simply search on the computer. There is a wealth of educational content on computers that can be useful in life. However, I do concur with you on one point. Society is losing its communication skills. Spending excessive time on the computer is not beneficial. People are no longer picking up the phone to call friends. They are isolating themselves from others, except for their computers. We cannot allow society to remain in this state. Those who spend all day on the computer need to change. In conclusion, I believe that computers are an asset to the community. Many think they are ruining everything, but this is not the case. Computers are excellent for learning about people and places. The question now is, do you want people to stop using computers? It's time to decide whether we should use computers to further our education.
307	307	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, the world is currently inundated with electronics, and the computer is the latest craze. However, despite its popularity, one must question whether it is truly the best thing to have. Many children and adults are addicted to computers, which is taking over their lives. Four out of five people each year are losing interest in outdoor activities. This is not the way to live. We all want our children to be active and healthy, not sedentary. Nowadays, when parents want to punish their children, they often take away electronics. But in the past, children were grounded from hanging out with friends or playing outside. Another serious problem is that computers are driving a wedge between us and our loved ones. Kids are more interested in ""@CAPS1"", ""@CAPS2"", or slaying virtual dragons than spending time with family. They choose the computer over family members who have been with them their whole lives. As a result, families are becoming more fragmented. Now, families only gather during dinner. Instead of talking to their parents about problems, kids turn to websites like ""@CAPS3"" or ""@CAPS4.com"". The computer has also changed people's interests. Fewer people enjoy outdoor activities and nature. Some have stopped reading because they prefer playing games. Some are even too lazy to pick up the phone to order a pizza. Job - seekers no longer look at newspapers; they rely on the internet. The world is becoming overly dependent on electronics. We must put an end to this trend before our children and grandchildren become out of shape and overly reliant on computers. Do we really want to destroy our world and lose family bonds? I firmly believe that we should make life better by getting rid of computers."
308	308	1	2	In my opinion, computers are extremely useful. When you need to remember something, you can simply check your email, and it will help you recall your tasks. Additionally, if you are lost, you can quickly look at a map on the computer. For school projects, the computer is a great tool. You can search for relevant websites to complete your work. If you need to check an important website, just type in the address, and it will appear on the screen. Moreover, if your child has nothing to do, there are many games on the computer. These include math games, @CAPS1 games, and you can also find knock - knock jokes. In conclusion, computers offer a wide range of benefits. They assist with memory, navigation, education, and entertainment. We should make good use of them to enhance our lives.
309	309	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, amidst all the current discussions about computers, I agree with those who believe that computers are consuming too much of our time. I rarely see people playing outside anymore because, apparently, computers are considered more entertaining than spending time with friends and family. One has to wonder why the obesity rate is so high these days. Well, computers are one of the culprits. I recall that when my parents were kids, there were no computers, and they went outside to enjoy nature. Computers have their advantages and disadvantages, but I do not think they benefit our society. Firstly, computers are taking away the time we should spend with friends and family. I remember the days before Facebook and @CAPS6 were created. Back then, people actually engaged in fun activities with their loved ones. A recent study showed that from @DATE1, @PERCENT1 of all Americans use computers for more than @NUM1 @CAPS2 a day for various reasons. Computers were initially invented to simplify tasks, but now, we mainly use them for social networking. Secondly, over the past @NUM2 years, the obesity rate has increased by @PERCENT3. The causes are unhealthy eating habits and sitting in front of the computer all day without exercising. I am almost @PERCENT2 sure that if people stopped using computers, our world would be a healthier place. Don't we feel sorry for those who are overweight for their entire lives because of these habits? I believe most people would. Lastly, we live on an amazing planet, but few people seem to appreciate it because they spend all their time on computers. A recent study revealed that @PERCENT4 of people stay indoors doing nothing all day! That's more than half. In conclusion, I hope this situation will change soon. Computers have become a nuisance, and it seems that people have lost their real lives. Although computers have spread to various societies, let's ensure they don't take over this friendly town of @CAPS1.
310	310	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION3, a poll conducted by the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1) indicated that @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 people believe that computers are a more convenient way to conduct research than going to the library. In recent years, there has been an ongoing debate about whether computers are beneficial to society. Currently, in America, @PERCENT2 of all people own a computer. In my view, computers are indeed highly beneficial to modern society for several reasons. They facilitate better and easier global communication, make text and information more accessible to the public, and drive necessary technological advancements. Communication is crucial in America and the world today, and it is primarily enabled by computers. Computers offer better, faster, and more reliable communication. In the @DATE2's, if you wanted to communicate with someone far away, you had to send a letter, which carried the risks of non - delivery, theft, and long delivery times. However, today's email and instant messaging (@CAPS2) solve these problems. They are reliable, cannot be stolen, and can reach anywhere in the world within seconds. Computers are not only a means of communication but also one of the most prominent research tools. Without the internet, people would have to go to the library, where there is a risk of the required book being unavailable or the library being closed. Through the internet, all the world's information is accessible at the click of a button. Furthermore, computers are at the forefront of today's technological progress. They enable the creation of self - operating inventions, which not only save human effort but also save lives and pave the way for the development of more advanced technologies. In conclusion, computers are the most remarkable technology of the @DATE1. They enable faster and more reliable communication, serve as the world's largest library, and drive the creation of even more advanced technologies. Computers are an extremely valuable asset to society and are indispensable in this era.
311	311	1	2	Dear Newspaper editor, I firmly believe that computers are excellent for everyone. Firstly, with just a click, one can explore places across the globe. Moreover, it enables seamless communication with friends and family. Ultimately, it significantly simplifies life.  There are several reasons to get a computer for your family. Instantly, you can learn about things you were previously unaware of, such as ancient civilizations, diverse cultures, and tonight's dinner recipes. It can also assist with schoolwork. For instance, if you need to learn about the [@CAPS1 @CAPS2] of [@LOCATION1], all you have to do is type it in. Similarly, typing in the multiplication table will yield results in seconds. The internet is ideal for searching for all types of information.  Secondly, the internet allows you to communicate with family and friends. I've heard many people emphasize the importance of spending more time with family. With a computer, you can talk to someone in [@LOCATION2] or anywhere else. It's like having a pen - pal without the cost of envelopes and stamps. Although computers are expensive, they are well worth the investment as you can do almost everything on them.  Lastly, getting a computer makes life much easier. Instead of going to the library to get a cookbook, you can simply type in chicken dinner recipes, and your computer will present hundreds of ways to prepare a delicious chicken meal. You can also inform a friend that you can't attend their party. It can even help you with your homework. Buying a computer will make your life more relaxing.  In conclusion, you should buy a computer. By doing so, you will learn numerous things. It's like having a comprehensive book that contains everything you need or want to know. This is why having a computer and using it for a reasonable amount of time is highly beneficial.
312	312	1	2	Dear [@LOCATION1 @CAPS1], I believe the use of computers is beneficial, and here are the reasons. Firstly, you can find various things online. Secondly, you can have fun, and lastly, you can make [@LOCATION1] friends. I will write [@NUM1] paragraphs to explain these reasons.  As mentioned in the introduction, the first reason is the ability to find things online. If you're unemployed, you can search for jobs on the internet. If you want to attend college but lack the time, you can take online classes. These details support this reason.  The second reason is that computers are extremely fun. When I'm bored, I play games. If you're not into games, you can take surveys or discover interesting facts. This is how I justify this reason.  The third reason is that you can meet [@LOCATION1] people. You can search for old friends online. Additionally, social networking platforms like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter allow you to meet [@LOCATION1] individuals. Most people would like to make such connections.  To conclude, the first reason is the ability to find things online, the second is having fun, and the last is meeting [@LOCATION1] people. Overall, computers offer these great advantages.
313	314	1	2	"I am convinced that in this era, computers are not having a positive impact on some people as they have taken over their lives. In a generation filled with computers, there are numerous health concerns. Moreover, when you're addicted to Facebook, you have less time for more important things. Additionally, computers often lead to financial strain.  Computers can be quite dangerous to your health. For example, excessive typing can lead to arthritis in the hands and fingers in the long term. Did you know that more seizures are induced by computers than by epilepsy? Dr. [@LOCATION1] claims that ""People don't cause obesity, computers do."" [@CAPS1] also believes that a significant portion of obesity is caused by an addiction to computer games.  When you're depressed, taking a long nature walk can make you feel better. However, many people rely on their computers when they're down, which usually makes the situation worse. When you're constantly on Twitter, Facebook, Google, and YouTube, it's difficult to find time for important matters. For example, if you're a parent and you start caring more about the computer than spending time with your child, they may feel abandoned. This lack of attention could lead them to turn to alcohol or smoking. I'm sure you've never thought of a computer in this way.  Computers can be a good way to unwind, but they can also become an addiction. When you're addicted to sitting in front of a computer, you forget about the beauty of nature. Money can also fuel this addiction. For instance, online shopping addictions are common because it's so easy. All you need to do is enter your credit card number, creating the illusion that you're not spending money until the bill arrives. You also need to pay for kids' websites like Webkinz, as well as for internet and electricity bills.  It's evident that computers only bring health problems, reduce the time in your daily schedule, and take money out of your pocket. In my opinion, computers are nothing but a trouble in our lives."
314	315	1	2	Newspaper and Readers, computers are an integral part of our lives and society. However, there are still those who believe that computers are harmful. In fact, computers have numerous positive effects on people, including facilitating communication, information - gathering, and entertainment. The positive effects of computers far outweigh the negative ones.  Computers have made communication effortless. There are multiple free communication methods available through computers. For example, instant messaging, [@CAPS1] - mail, video chat, chat rooms, [@CAPS2] (and other social networking sites) enable you to stay in touch with friends and family. This is beneficial as it allows people to maintain relationships that might otherwise be difficult due to financial or convenience issues. Being social is essential for people's well - being, so communication is a significant positive effect of computers.  Acquiring information is much easier with a computer. For example, if a child needs to learn about the climate of the [@CAPS3 @CAPS4.S] for a social studies project, instead of having to ask his mom to drive him to the town library, spend time searching for a book, he can simply log on to [@ORGANIZATION1]. This saves him time and effort. Moreover, the internet provides a wealth of useful information, such as flight times, prices, restaurants, stocks, weather, news, and any other facts you may need. Having a computer is a great advantage in life.  Computers are an excellent source of entertainment. In today's economy, we can all benefit from avoiding high rental fees for movies and the high cost of Xbox or PlayStation games. Internet gaming is very entertaining, and there are many free games available. Additionally, there are websites that offer free movies and TV shows that can be streamed directly to your computer. These are great solutions to the increasing cost of entertainment. Saving money and enjoying good entertainment are both positive effects that computers offer.  I hope that after reading this, newspaper readers will recognize the benefits of computers. The next time you're facing a late fee for a library book or movie, remember that the internet and your computer provide an alternative.
315	316	1	2	To whom it may concern, computers are beneficial to society. They promote learning, coordination, and general welfare. Although computers may limit a person's exercise and interaction, their positive effects far outweigh this drawback.  People learn a vast amount of knowledge from computers. One can learn definitions of new words, scientific theories, algebraic equations, history, law, and multiple languages, among countless other things. When used for learning, computers allow people to study on their own time, things that they might not learn in school. They stimulate the brain and encourage thinking beyond conventional boundaries. They also teach the brain to better direct the body to meet its needs.  Coordination can be a challenge for some people. Without it, people would struggle to catch a ball, avoid dangers, or even stand. To improve coordination, practice is necessary. Using a computer, specifically the mouse, can enhance hand - eye coordination. At first, directing the mouse to a specific location on the screen may be slow, but with practice, coordination improves, and the process becomes faster. This enables people to use the computer more efficiently for gaming, learning, or helping others.  Helping others is crucial in today's world. It's important to stay informed about the news so that we can offer assistance. Computers facilitate this. For example, on the day of the deadly earthquake in [@LOCATION1], most of the world learned about it within an hour through computers. News sites reported it, social networking sites like [@CAPS2] discussed it, and people shared information online. This rapid spread of news saved many lives in [@LOCATION1] as people immediately rushed to help. Computers also encourage people to help through news dissemination.  Many websites are designed to help while you play. For example, www.freenrice.org donates [@NUM2] grains of rice for every correct answer, and they have donated over [@NUM3 @CAPS3] grains of rice. Clearly, computers and such websites have a positive impact on the world.  Overall, it's evident that computers have a predominantly positive impact on the world. Despite reducing exercise, they promote learning, enhance coordination, and encourage people to help one another and stay informed about current events.
316	317	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, the question of whether people benefit from using computers is a matter of debate. Some argue that choosing computers over exercise and outdoor activities is detrimental. However, I firmly believe that computer technology offers numerous advantages.  Computers enhance hand - eye coordination and reaction time. Many computer games are designed to improve these skills. As one plays more games, the ability to quickly react and click the mouse button becomes more refined. These skills are transferable to real - life activities. For instance, I play a lot of @CAPS3 @NUM1, and it has significantly improved my hand - eye coordination, which is evident in the four sports I participate in.  In terms of learning, the internet provides a vast amount of content that is not available in school. It allows students to learn about foreign countries and cultures. I use the internet almost every night to write papers and gather information, which has been extremely helpful for my studies. Typing papers on computers is becoming the norm, as teachers now require typed and printed assignments. Moreover, digital documents can be saved and are less likely to be lost compared to hand - written ones. Computers also help with organization, with built - in calendars that send schedule reminders and provide a place to store data like music and pictures.  Communication is another area where computers shine. People use platforms like @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and I - chat daily. I rely on my computer to ask about homework or practice schedules. It has made communication much easier, especially when it comes to interacting with people in foreign countries. When events occur overseas, the computer is often the first source of information.  In conclusion, despite the opposition, the benefits of computers in terms of hand - eye coordination, learning, and communication are undeniable. Our lives would be very different without computer technology, and it is up to each individual to continue utilizing this valuable tool.
317	318	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers are a great asset to society and are being used for beneficial purposes. They are useful for people of all ages.  For kids, it is easier to look up information for @CAPS3 on the computer. This helps them gain knowledge, and contrary to what some parents think, kids do a lot of reading on the computer. Just because they don't go to the library to borrow books for their reports doesn't mean they aren't learning. In fact, they have access to all the information that a library can offer. Computers enable kids around the world to quickly and easily find information about both past events and current affairs. They can also get weather updates, which helps keep them safe. Over @PERCENT1 of the information available in the library can be found on the computer. If kids didn't use computers, they would miss out on a lot of knowledge.  Computers are also beneficial for adults. They can work, look at houses and cars, and handle many other important tasks through the computer. It helps adults manage their busy lives and make positive changes in their lifestyle, such as in their eating or behavior.  In conclusion, there are many reasons why people should not oppose the use of computers. They assist kids with @CAPS3, provide important facts, and help people of all ages. These facts can surely bring about positive changes.
318	319	1	2	Computers have undoubtedly had a positive impact on society. They help organize thoughts, which in turn reduces stress. On average, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS1 experience stress. By organizing thoughts on the computer, one can easily review them later, alleviating the worry of forgetting important ideas. This reduction in stress leads to increased confidence, which has a positive effect on society.  Imagine working on a school project. With a computer, everyone can contribute, and you can choose which contributions to keep. You can also block unwanted programs. This device has improved @LOCATION1's society.  The computer also contains articles that inspire children to strive for their goals. For example, a child read an article about @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1's book. After researching @PERSON1 on the internet, the child started seeing @PERSON1 as a role model and made great strides in school, aiming for a @CAPS4. Clearly, the internet had a positive impact on @CAPS6 society in this case.  Finally, when faced with overwhelming situations, the computer can be a great way to relax. Taking a break to play simple games available on various websites can make a stressful situation seem less daunting. After the break, one can approach the problem with a clearer mind.  In conclusion, computers have a strong, positive impact on @CAPS6 society. They reduce stress, inspire the younger generation, and help in dealing with difficult situations. We should continue to make good use of this technology.
319	320	1	2	Dear editor of the @ORGANIZATION1, in my opinion, people are spending too much time on technology. I know many people who are constantly on their devices and neglect their work. Moreover, excessive computer use often means less time for exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends.  There are several risks associated with computer use. Staying too close to technology can lead to addiction and may even damage brain cells. Sometimes, people get locked out of their accounts due to security issues. Downloading certain things can introduce viruses that can crash the computer's hard drive and system. There are also other negative aspects such as the threat of stalkers, hackers, and the potential for seizures and blindness.  However, computers also have their advantages. They teach hand - eye coordination, allow people to learn about distant places and people, and enable online communication with friends and family. In my life, playing army games on the computer has helped me develop tactics that I use when playing label - tagging with my cousins and friends at a sports complex.  I've witnessed the negative effects on eyesight. For example, about @NUM1 months ago, when I stayed at my aunt's house, my cousins played games until they had to take a bath, clean, and eat. They didn't go to sleep until eight in the @TIME1. This kind of excessive use is harmful.  Parents should limit their children's computer time. I, for one, only spend about twenty minutes on the computer at a time and then log off and go back online later.  In conclusion, while computers have both good and bad aspects, it's important to use them in moderation to avoid the negative impacts and make the most of the positive ones.
320	321	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1, and I'd like to discuss the wonderful impact of computer technology on mankind.  Many great discoveries and useful information can be found on the computer. Studies show that <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of families in the United States have at least one computer at home. Computers are an excellent tool for quickly looking up important information without spending hours in a library. They also facilitate communication and make our lives much easier.  Imagine being stressed while searching for a topic for a history essay for @NUM2 hours in a library, with a pounding headache and the urge to quit. Now, picture yourself at home, sitting comfortably, and getting instant information with just a few taps on the keyboard. This is one of the significant benefits that computers bring to humanity.  Computers are also great for learning at a fast pace. I've personally used them to my advantage. By logging on to Google and typing in a subject, it's like having a personal teacher at home. A local study compared two groups: Group A with a library full of books and Group @CAPS3 with a @CAPS4 @CAPS5. When given the same essays, <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of students in Group @CAPS3 passed with excellent grades, while only <@PERCENT1@NUM4> of students in Group A passed with a @CAPS9 or higher. Higher grades lead to better test scores, which in turn attract more funding.  Computers are also a great way to reconnect with loved ones. If someone's special other has moved far away, they can use instant messaging, email, or video chat to stay in touch. For business people, it's a way to have meetings without traveling long distances. I have @NUM2 aunts who are very important to me, and I rely on computers to talk to them every day.  Surveys show that @PERCENT1 of people in the @CAPS10.S.A have family in other states, countries, or continents. Computers provide a means of staying in contact. Additionally, computers have created jobs, with <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of jobs relying on them.  In conclusion, computers are an amazing invention that is evolving humanity rather than impairing it. They have positively impacted learning, communication, and our daily lives, and their importance will only continue to grow.
321	322	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. They assist students with projects, enable people to learn about other places, and help in finding information on unfamiliar topics. A significant percentage of teachers assign computer - related projects. Most reading teachers have students read a book and then type an essay or a review. Teachers generally prefer typed essays over hand - written ones, as this allows students to explore beyond the traditional mode of writing. I am confident that other students would concur that typing an essay is a better option. If there is a place you wish to know more about or plan to visit someday, the computer can be your valuable resource. You can use it to determine the best time to visit that place. For instance, if you hear about a tragic accident like the earthquake in @LOCATION1 on the news and want to stay updated, the computer can keep you informed about the daily developments. Moreover, when reading a book, you may come across unfamiliar words, or students may have spelling words whose meanings they don't know. The computer can provide the full definition and pronunciation of these words. In essence, computers can help you find any necessary information. In conclusion, computers are not just toys for kids to play with all day. They are useful tools that assist in getting work done, learning about different places, and obtaining information on various topics.
322	323	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I am of the opinion that computers have a profound and positive influence on people. In the following paragraphs, I will elaborate on the reasons why computers are beneficial, specifically focusing on how they enhance typing skills, provide valuable information, and facilitate social interaction. Statistics show that over ninety - four percent of people today own a computer and have learned a great deal from it. First, let's discuss how computers help with typing. The @CAPS2 on a computer is not arranged alphabetically, which means that users need to practice more to improve their typing speed and accuracy. I recall my first attempt at using the @CAPS2; it was quite challenging at the beginning, but with more practice, I became more proficient. Eventually, I no longer needed to look at the keyboard, and this process taught me skills that are useful in the workplace. Secondly, computers are a treasure trove of information. They are particularly useful for students and anyone seeking knowledge. The internet on a computer contains a vast amount of data, and search engines can provide answers in a matter of seconds. This information can be used for various purposes, such as research for a school project or learning about a new hobby. Finally, computers are excellent for socializing. If you want to talk to a friend but don't feel like making a phone call, you can use social media platforms like @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 to chat. There are over a million such websites, offering a wide range of options for social interaction. It also allows people to connect with friends and family from all over the world, thereby enhancing social skills. In conclusion, computers have numerous wonderful effects on people. They improve typing skills, offer a wealth of information, and promote social interaction. It is evident that computers are an indispensable part of modern life.
323	324	1	2	I firmly think that computers have played a crucial role in shaping @LOCATION1 into what it is today. Computers offer multiple benefits, including facilitating learning, providing entertainment, and allowing for time management so that people still have the opportunity to go outdoors. Regarding learning, computers make the process more efficient. Typing essays on a computer is faster, and making changes is easier compared to hand - writing. Additionally, it is more cost - effective to use a computer to access information about foreign countries on the internet rather than traveling there in person. Moreover, using a computer helps develop hand - eye coordination through typing and mouse usage. It can also teach life lessons by reading articles written by others. For those with free time, computers offer various forms of entertainment. On rainy days or when going outside is not possible, one can play computer games. Social media platforms like Facebook and messaging services like AIM allow people to communicate with friends. Programs such as Skype enable conversations with distant family members in other countries. Online shopping is another advantage, as it saves gas and time compared to going to physical stores, and some of the items purchased can be used outdoors. Some people claim that computers keep kids indoors, but there are ways to address this issue. Shut - off timers can limit the time spent on a computer. Many individuals learn to manage their computer time effectively. Parents can also set rules, such as restricting game - playing on certain days or times. Keeping computers in the family room can prevent children from using them late at night in their bedrooms. In conclusion, computers are beneficial in many ways. They assist in learning, provide entertainment, and can be managed to ensure a balanced lifestyle. I hope that after reading this, you will recognize the positive impact of computers on society.
324	325	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, although computers have their uses, I do not support their excessive use. The advancement of technology has had a negative impact on people's lives worldwide. There are several reasons why computers are not beneficial to society, including a lack of exercise, decreased time spent outdoors, and less time spent with family and friends. When using a computer, people usually sit in a chair, which does not contribute to maintaining a healthy and fit body. To stay healthy, one needs to engage in some form of physical activity throughout the day, and sitting at a computer for long periods does not fulfill this requirement. Moreover, using a computer not only leads to a lack of exercise but also reduces the time spent outdoors. Fresh air is essential for good health, and not getting enough of it can make people more susceptible to illness. If everyone were to use the computer for the majority of their day, the number of sick people would be alarmingly high. In addition, it is challenging to keep a large family close - knit, and excessive computer use does not help in this regard. Spending quality time with family and friends is more valuable than playing computer games. In my opinion, family should be the most important aspect of one's life, and we should not sacrifice family relationships for the sake of using a computer. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computer use, such as lack of exercise, reduced outdoor time, and less family interaction, show that it is not beneficial to society. I appreciate your time in reading this letter.
325	326	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I am convinced that computers are among the most useful tools we possess. They serve multiple purposes, including facilitating communication, providing knowledge, and helping us complete work more efficiently. First and foremost, computers are excellent for communication. In today's world, where many students go to college and families are often separated by distance, computers offer a convenient way to stay in touch. Parents can send emails to their children at college, and families can use video - conferencing tools like @CAPS3 to talk to each other. For students, email is a valuable means of submitting assignments and asking questions. If a student is sick or has a broken printer, they can email their work to the teacher and still receive full credit. It also allows students to clarify any doubts about their assignments, ensuring successful completion of projects. Secondly, computers are a vast source of information. The average person accesses the @CAPS2 ten times a @DATE1 to gather knowledge. Search engines like @ORGANIZATION3 or Yahoo can provide answers in a matter of seconds, much faster than traditional library research. Moreover, websites not only offer text - based information but also include pictures to enhance understanding. For example, if someone living in @LOCATION1 reads about an animal native to @LOCATION2, they can find pictures online to get a better idea of what the animal looks like. This process also keeps the brain active, as users need to piece together information from different sources, which helps develop problem - solving skills. Finally, computers make work more efficient. On average, computers can complete work fifty times more efficiently than manual work. Programs like @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and @ORGANIZATION2 help correct spelling and grammatical errors while creating professional - looking presentations. Studies indicate that @PERCENT1 of people with poor spelling or grammar habits can correct their mistakes quickly with the help of these programs. In conclusion, computers are extremely useful in modern society. They are essential for communication, learning, and work. Their ability to connect people, provide knowledge, and streamline tasks makes them an indispensable part of our daily lives.
326	327	1	2	I believe computers have a positive impact on people. Whether computers are beneficial or not depends on one's perspective and personality. Some may argue that computers have a highly positive influence, while others claim the opposite. In my view, computers are advantageous.   Firstly, using computers can enhance hand - eye coordination. For instance, as I'm typing this, I'm constantly improving my typing speed. Also, different people have different preferences and abilities regarding typing and writing. Some are faster at typing, while others are better at writing. I personally type faster than I write.   Secondly, computers offer a great way to relax. After a long day at school or work, one can come home, play music on the computer, and unwind. Moreover, one can multi - task, like playing music while chatting with friends. I also use my computer to do homework.   Lastly, learning to type fast is extremely useful. For example, if you have a school story due the next day, being able to type quickly can help you finish it on time.   In conclusion, computers are a valuable asset. People can enjoy the benefits of computers while still appreciating nature. Overall, computers have a positive effect on people.
327	328	1	2	"I firmly believe that computers bring great benefits to our community. Over the years, technology has advanced significantly, and the computer stands out as one of the most important inventions. Most schools have computers because they are beneficial to society.   One major advantage is that computers help save paper. In today's society, the concept of ""going green"" is crucial. To provide each student in a grade with paper, a large number of trees need to be cut down. Adults should understand the importance of paper conservation. If we need to share information, we can simply email it instead of printing.   Computers also make our work neater and allow us to communicate with friends and family. For example, the mayor can send important messages about water pollution via email.   In addition, computers are an excellent tool for learning. Kids today need to learn about different cultures and economies. The internet is much faster than searching through numerous books. All you need to do is type in the relevant keywords, and the information is right there.   Furthermore, using a computer can improve hand - eye coordination. This is especially important for those who want to be athletes. Typing and moving the mouse are ways to develop this skill, and playing educational video games is an even better method.   Considering all these benefits, such as benefiting the community, promoting environmental protection, and facilitating learning about other places, we should make good use of computers."
328	329	1	2	"Dear town @CAPS1 paper, I am in favor of computers for several reasons.   One reason is the ability to communicate with friends online. Platforms like Facebook and MySpace allow us to chat with friends throughout the day. All we need to do is type what we want to say, and our friends will receive the exact words and can reply. For example, a simple ""hi"" can be sent and responded to easily. This online communication is a significant advantage of having a computer.   Another reason is the opportunity to learn. If you want to learn a language, you can use search engines like Google. A plethora of websites will appear, and you can choose the fastest and easiest one for your learning needs. Being able to access such learning resources quickly is a great benefit of computers.   The last reason is the availability of video games. When you're bored and have no one to talk to, you can play either mind - numbing or educational games on the computer. In science class, we played a game related to gravity, which was both fun and educational.   In conclusion, I support the use of computers because they enable us to talk to friends online, learn new things, and play games."
329	330	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing to express my view that computers do not have a positive effect on people.   Firstly, computers pose a significant safety risk, especially for children. With the development of technology, child predators can easily access personal information on social media platforms. More than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 share all their personal details on these websites, making them vulnerable. For example, a predator found all the necessary information about my friend @PERSON2 on his Facebook page and sent him a threat. Fortunately, the police were able to arrest the predator before he could harm @PERSON2. @PERSON1 pointed out that the negative impact of this technology on society outweighs its benefits. @ORGANIZATION1, do you want @CAPS3 to be at risk from these predators because of computers?  Secondly, @CAPS3 are spending too much time on computers. They are neglecting their homework and physical exercise. Websites that allow chatting and gaming have made @CAPS3 lazy and addicted. My friend @PERSON3 used to play sports outside for hours when he was young. Now, as he has grown older, he spends all his time on the computer, and his grades have dropped, and he has gained weight. Statistics show that more than @PERCENT2 of @CAPS3 have similar problems. Dr. @DR1 Much said that @CAPS3 have lost the joy of outdoor activities and the motivation to study well due to computers. @ORGANIZATION1, do you want your @CAPS3 to face these issues?  Lastly, computers are costly. Many families spend a large amount of money on buying and fixing computers, as well as purchasing software and programs. A family friend bought a @CAPS5 for @MONEY2 and then spent @MONEY3 on programs. Statistics show that @PERCENT3 of families waste their college funds on computers. Dr. @DR2 @CAPS6 said that families don't really need computers but are wasting their money on them.   In conclusion, considering the safety risks, the negative impact on study and health, and the high cost, computers have a negative effect on people.
330	331	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, a recent scientific study reveals that excessive sitting, particularly in front of computers, is harmful to health. Although computers are useful, I believe they are not entirely beneficial to our society.   Excessive computer use hinders physical exercise. Exercise is essential for maintaining a healthy and fit body. However, many people sit at their office computers all day, and even kids who spend too much time on computers are at risk of obesity. Scientists have concluded that too much sitting goes against the natural way our bodies are designed to function. In the movie ""WALL - E,"" humans became obese and weak after relying on computers for a long time. While this is an extreme example, minor cases of obesity related to computer use are common around the world. Going outside instead of sitting in front of a computer is a sure way to stay healthy.  Computers also limit our ability to experience nature. Simulations cannot replace the real thing. If you want to see a frog or other animals, you should look for them in the real world. Developing a connection with nature can have a positive impact on our well - being. Instead of exploring virtual worlds on a computer, we should explore the real world while we still can.  Moreover, excessive computer use weakens our relationships with family and friends. It creates a gap between family members. If an adult spends too much time on the computer for non - work purposes, they may not support their family, resulting in no income, a poor quality of life, and an uncertain future.   In conclusion, although computers have their uses, they prevent us from exercising, experiencing nature, and being with our families. So, we should get outside and make the most of the real world."
331	332	1	2	In the past few decades, the prevalence of computers per family has grown significantly. Concurrently, there has been an increase in people's weight and a decrease in physical activity. Computers are not only a waste of time but also a substantial drain on financial resources.  Over the past @NUM1 years, many individuals have gained a considerable amount of weight. Online shopping has replaced regular trips to the supermarket, reducing physical exertion. Studies indicate that those who visit supermarkets or stores in person are less likely to be overweight compared to those who shop online. Moreover, search engines like Google provide an easy way to view images, eliminating the need to travel and thus reducing calorie expenditure. For instance, walking to see a mountain can burn up to @NUM3 times more calories than simply looking it up on Google.  Another issue is the potential for computer - related distractions. One might get addicted to computer games and forget important commitments, such as sports practice. Skipping practice means less sweating and potential weight gain. Scientists suggest that playing a sport can lead to a weight loss of up to @PERCENT1 compared to a sedentary lifestyle.  In the academic realm, computers bring more problems than solutions. Before computers, students rarely forgot their homework. Now, numerous issues can arise. Printer malfunctions are common; for example, last year, my printer stopped working @NUM1 times, preventing me from completing my homework. This affected my grade by over @PERCENT2. Handwriting is often more convenient as well. During an in - class prompt, I was sent to the computer lab, but all the computers were occupied. When I had to write it by hand, my teacher had trouble reading it, and I received a lower grade than my classmates.  Research can also be hindered by computer reliance. My parents got rid of our books due to computers. One day, during a power outage, I couldn't research euthanizing dogs, which led to a poor grade on a science event and dropped my average from an A+ to an A-.  Finally, computers are a waste of money. They can cost up to @MONEY1 for purchase and installation. A library can offer the same resources as a computer, yet in my family, @NUM11 out of @NUM7 computers are used only once a week.  In conclusion, computers do not benefit society. They contribute to weight gain, are less convenient than handwriting, and are an unnecessary expense. We should reconsider our over - reliance on them.
332	333	1	2	Dear local newspaper, computers have a significant impact on people. Some of these impacts are negative, such as taking away time from family and friends, reducing social life, and leading to a lack of exercise.  I interviewed @PERSON1 yesterday. When I asked what @CAPS1 usually does when visiting grandma's house, @CAPS2 replied that @CAPS2 usually uses the computer. This shows that computers are taking over family time. Instead of using the computer, one should engage in activities like playing Monopoly or @CAPS4 with family members. If family members don't have these games, one can bring them.  People often think that social media platforms like Facebook, AIM, email, and MySpace allow them to interact with friends. However, this is not true. When I asked my friend @PERSON3 about these platforms, @CAPS2 thought they were great for interaction, but in reality, they are just computer - based websites. Using these sites doesn't help maintain a real social life. There are many activities in the town, such as going to the gym, community center, or library, where one can hang out with friends.  Regarding exercise, sitting in front of the computer for long periods is a problem. When sitting in the chair, one doesn't exercise and may gain weight. For example, when I asked @PERSON2 what @CAPS2 does while on the computer, @CAPS2 said @CAPS2 eats. Without proper attention, people may eat more than they need. The town has sports leagues like @CAPS6, softball, and baseball. Joining a team is a better option than sitting in front of the computer.  In conclusion, computers are not the best things in the world. They prevent people from staying fit, having a social life, and spending time with family. We should limit our computer use and engage in more real - life activities.
333	334	1	2	Dear @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1, initially, I was unsure whether I was for or against people using computers. After careful thought, I decided that I am against it, mainly due to safety, education, and inappropriate content issues.  Safety is a major concern when using the computer. On platforms like MySpace, people may not be who they claim to be. For example, a person who appears to be a young @NUM1 - @DATE1 - year - old on the site could actually be much older. My friend on MySpace was talking to a 41 - year - old without knowing his age. When they met up, she was raped. Not everyone on the computer is honest, and this poses a real danger, especially to young users.  Computers also have a negative impact on education. Instead of studying, reading, or doing homework, many students come home from school and immediately go on MySpace, @CAPS2, or @CAPS5. Although these websites can offer some learning opportunities, they mainly distract students from their academic responsibilities. For instance, instead of learning new and useful information, students are focused on reading messages and looking at comments. Education is crucial for both adults and children, and the computer often gets in the way of learning and achievement.  Finally, there are many inappropriate sites on the computer. One must be very careful about what they access on MySpace and other similar platforms. There is a risk of stumbling upon content that one is not supposed to see.  In conclusion, the negative aspects of using computers, including safety risks, educational drawbacks, and inappropriate content, far outweigh any potential benefits. We should be more cautious about our computer use, especially when it comes to interacting with others and accessing information.
334	335	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, headlines like '@CAPS2 at @CAPS3 killed in a horrific accident' flash across the computer screen one after another. What is meant to be a quick check often turns into hours, taking time away from family.  I understand that computers can be helpful, but in my opinion, they usually have a negative impact on the public. Firstly, there are numerous websites with false information. Computers are also full of viruses, scams, and internet predators. Offers that seem ""too good to be true"" are often traps to steal credit and personal information. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people have been scammed at some point in their lives. For example, someone I know thought they were buying boots but received a warning from the credit - card company. In a computer - processing class, my friends and I found a seemingly reliable website that turned out to be completely fake. This shows that computers put those who are not well - informed at risk.  Secondly, computers steal people's time. Family time, homework, and exercise are all limited. I see this with my younger brother. Once he starts playing video games, homework is forgotten. He always says, ""@CAPS5, just one more game!"" But one game turns into two and more. It's not just children; many of my friends spend three hours a day updating their status or pictures on @CAPS6. There should be a limit between a short computer session and letting it control our lives. When surveyed, most students said they spent at least two hours on the computer every night.  In conclusion, while computers have some benefits, the negative impacts on the public, including financial risks and time - stealing, are significant. We should be more cautious when using computers and set boundaries to avoid being negatively affected. We need to limit our computer use and help the public recognize the dangers."
335	336	1	2	Imagine a world without computers. There would be chaos in war, and even the clutter on your desk would be more difficult to manage. The chats you have with your best friend on AIM wouldn't happen. You might not be able to complete a report on @LOCATION1 if all the books in the library are checked out, as you can't rely on digital resources. In fact, there would be no novels or space programs without computers.  Businesses rely heavily on technology. You can't simply send a letter and expect @CAPS2 to reach the office in five minutes. Computer - based communication is extremely popular, with @PERCENT1 of the world using AIM or other chat services. A study by a @CAPS1 professor found that @NUM1 out of every student doesn't talk to family on the AIM service. The professor said that @CAPS2 is a good way to stay in touch with family and keep up with current events.  However, if computers are taken away, a lot of information will be lost. It will be like everything is buried in a pile of papers. For example, @DATE1, my computer crashed, and I had a report due, but all the books were gone. I could only finish the report when the computer was fixed.  Thanks to new computers, @CAPS3 is more organized, and NASA's operations on Mars are running smoothly. NASA depends entirely on computers. They have given us many things; @PERCENT3 of all household appliances come from NASA's work. A comment from NASA implies that without them, there would be no cars or phones.  In conclusion, we need to decide whether we can live without computers. The people who have built this country should consider if we really shouldn't have computers. I firmly believe that computers are essential, and so should you.
336	337	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I, along with many others, firmly believe that computers are not merely good but highly beneficial. Every day, computers are advancing our world incrementally. We utilize them for communication, entertainment, and knowledge acquisition. They are like companions that offer endless fun and learning opportunities.  Computers have a profound impact on communication. In the past, communication relied on traditional mail, but it has since evolved into e - mails, Twitter, and Facebook. These platforms have revolutionized modern communication. Friends from afar can view photos, share information, watch videos, and chat. Platforms like @ORGANIZATION2 even enable instant messaging. Video chatting is an innovative way to have a real - time visual conversation. According to @ORGANIZATION1, since @DATE1, @NUM1 more users have signed up for web - cams, indicating the positive influence of computers on communication.  In terms of entertainment, computers are a great source. Computer games, which cost around @MONEY1, provide instant access to fun. Surfing the web for news or funny videos is also an enjoyable pastime. Almost everyone with a @CAPS2 enjoys surfing the internet. If you can't hear your favorite song on the radio, iTunes allows you to store, organize, and play music in a virtual library. YouTube offers free access to music videos and songs. Clearly, computers are a hub of entertainment.  Finally, computers are invaluable for education, as they provide a vast amount of knowledge. Websites like Wikipedia and dictionary.com are excellent resources for learning. In conclusion, computers bring numerous benefits in communication, entertainment, and education, making them an essential part of our lives.
337	338	1	2	Dear local Newspaper, I read the article, and I think you guys are correct. In @DATE1, kids prefer to stay inside on the computer. @CAPS1, it's hard to say what they're doing. Some kids are on Facebook all day, while others are on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3. Sometimes, kids don't even like to exercise; they just stay on the computer and keep eating.  I believe that if there were no technology, kids today wouldn't be in such a bad state. Some kids don't even want to hang out with their friends or family; they'd rather stay home on the computer. However, we should exercise more instead of being glued to the computer.  If we're always on the computer, we won't learn anything at school. When we're at school, kids might be thinking about going home to use the computer instead of focusing on their education. What if kids drop out or stop coming to school because they want to chat with friends or strangers on the computer? For example, what if a girl doesn't want to go to school and just stays on her computer, talking to a stranger?  Kids should go out and exercise instead of being on the computer all the time. By doing so, they won't be in such a bad physical and mental state. In conclusion, we need to limit kids' computer usage and encourage them to engage in more healthy activities.
338	339	1	2	Dear @PERSON2, in a home in your town, all you can hear is a child saying, “Mom, mom, mom, drive me to the library to get books.” You can also see many residents eager to travel to foreign countries but lacking the funds. Is this the kind of situation you want to see in every home?  Computers have a significant impact on people. They allow individuals to communicate and interact with one another. They also enable people to learn about places they've always dreamed of visiting and make life more convenient. For these reasons, computers are the most beneficial asset to society.  Firstly, computers enable friends and family to communicate without incurring any costs. I have relatives who are too poor to afford high phone bills. Not everyone can afford phone conversations, but using a computer for communication is free. A recent poll in the @ORGANIZATION3 issue @NUM1 on @DATE1 showed that @PERCENT1 of computer owners use them for communication instead of phones. Some people claim that computers are time - consuming, but with so many people using them to talk, there's no need to worry about phone bills. @PERSON1, a @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION4, said that fewer people needed loans after the introduction of instant messaging and video chatting on computers. This indicates that friends and families have shifted to online communication, saving on phone expenses.  Secondly, anyone can find information about distant lands using a computer, even from the comfort of their bedroom. A boy named @CAPS3 @PERSON4 from @ORGANIZATION1 said that he always wanted to visit @LOCATION2 when he was young. He was excited when he found facts and pictures about it on the web. @PERSON3, a teacher at @ORGANIZATION5 @ORGANIZATION1, conducted a poll and found that @PERCENT2 of students had done projects related to foreign countries. This shows that many people rely on computers to learn about foreign places.  Finally, computers are extremely convenient. A poll by @ORGANIZATION2 showed that @PERCENT3 of people would rather have a computer than a car, highlighting the importance of computers. I used to think computers were bad, but after I got one, I realized how useful they are.  In conclusion, computers facilitate communication, provide access to information about foreign lands, and offer great convenience. They are truly a valuable asset to society.
339	340	1	2	The use of computers is on the rise. People use them for communication, leisure, and various other purposes. However, the question remains: Are computers a good thing?  Computers offer numerous advantages. They provide practically unlimited information. You can use platforms like @ORGANIZATION1 to stay in touch with family. Programs such as @ORGANIZATION2 Word allow you to create documents and PowerPoint presentations to organize your ideas, and @ORGANIZATION2 Excel helps manage finances. If you own a camera, Windows Movie Maker enables you to create your own movies. Additionally, computers are a source of entertainment, allowing you to play games, watch movies, and listen to music.  On the other hand, computers also have drawbacks. They are expensive. When communicating on a computer, you can't see who you're really talking to. Many people store important information on their computers, which can be at risk. Computer infections can lead to information theft, leaving people vulnerable. Bugs can severely damage a computer, making it unusable. The internet also hosts hate sites that promote terrorism, racial violence, and drug use, and people can be slandered online. Moreover, computers can take over people's lives. Some people spend too much time on Facebook and neglect reading or interacting with family.  Some people believe that the cons of computers outweigh the pros, but I disagree. While the cons can be annoying and sometimes serious, if you're smart enough to avoid @CAPS2 - @CAPS3, install anti - virus software, and never disclose your information to an unknown source, the benefits of computers far exceed the drawbacks. In conclusion, with proper precautions, computers can be a fun and convenient addition to our lives.
340	341	1	2	Have you ever wanted to know about a different place or see your now - grown baby cousin? Owning a computer is extremely beneficial to society. It allows you to gather information, chat with family and friends, and even improve hand - eye coordination.  A computer is a vast source of knowledge. It can tell you about different cultures, places, or something as simple as what a @LOCATION1 creampie is. With just a click of a button, you can expand your learning, making it a unique and valuable tool.  Computers also facilitate communication. New computers are equipped with webcams, enabling you to see and talk to family and friends without the need for long - distance travel. This is especially beneficial for those with relatives living far away.  In addition, computers can improve hand - eye coordination. Typing a school paper on a computer helps develop this skill. Hand - eye coordination is useful in various aspects of life, including activities, schoolwork, and jobs.  In conclusion, computers are a great asset to society. They enhance our ability to learn, communicate with loved ones, and improve our physical skills. Our society today would be very different without computers.
341	342	1	2	### Rewrite of the first item (in narrative style) Dear editor, more and more people are using computers, yet not everyone believes this is beneficial for society. As the newspaper editor, you have the power to inform the public about this situation. In my view, computers are desperately needed.  Computers enable people to learn about distant places, people, and the weather. I have an uncle named @PERSON1, who has @NUM1 little girls. Every morning before school, @PERSON1 checks the weather on his computer to ensure it's safe for the kids to go to school. One day, he forgot to check and took his daughters to school. Unbeknownst to him, the roads were extremely icy. Sadly, @PERSON1 and his daughters were in a car accident, and two of the girls broke a few bones. Clearly, checking the weather on the computer could have saved them a trip to the emergency room.  Secondly, computers allow people to communicate online. Dr. @DR1 from @CAPS1 states that chatting online on platforms like @CAPS2 is the best way to stay in touch with old schoolmates, camp friends, and others. I whole - heartedly agree. Adults can keep in touch with their middle - school friends, and @PERCENT1 of students say they usually go online to study or find homework resources. I believe chatting online to study for tests is a great idea as it can help students get better grades. Some parents think it's a waste of time, but teachers say that since @CAPS2 was invented, students' grades have been soaring.  Finally, most jobs today rely on computers. My dad works for @ORGANIZATION1, and the computer helps him communicate with clients worldwide. The chat function can translate languages, making it easier than phone calls. Teachers also use computers to record students' grades, which simplifies their work as it automatically averages the scores. The computer has revolutionized people's jobs.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people. They offer the ability to learn about far - off places, people, and the weather, facilitate online communication, and are essential in many jobs. I urge you to write a positive article about how computers benefit society. Please consider my suggestion.
342	343	1	2	### Rewrite of the second item (in subjective style) Dear editor, my name is @CAPS2, and I'm a @NUM1 - year - old girl who loves reading the daily newspaper. When I was going through last week's papers, I saw an ad asking for articles about the positive or negative aspects of computers. I'm here to convince other readers about the negative impacts of computers on people. As an active computer user, I've experienced all these negative factors firsthand.  People who spend more than an hour on the computer are often engaged in @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or playing computer games. Many kids are overly absorbed in these games. I saw a segment on @CAPS5 @NUM2 that reported @PERCENT1 of all teens play on the computer at least once when they should be doing homework. Computer games are a major distraction for kids' learning. They seem to think @CAPS3 is more important than math homework, and clearly, computers don't contribute to kids' learning.  Kids and even adults who are too involved in computer use become less talkative. They feel they need to focus on winning and beating their friends in the game. This single - minded focus on winning can lead to long - term consequences. Being self - conscious and lacking social skills are the most significant long - term effects of excessive computer - game involvement.  Moreover, kids who are overly engrossed in computer games don't get enough exercise, which can lead to obesity. They think they're getting exercise while playing, but in reality, they're just sitting still. They're so addicted to the games that they don't think going outside is important.  In conclusion, computers offer no real benefits. They prevent learning, cause anti - social behavior, and lead to obesity. These are all long - term problems that can have a negative impact on life. Don't we all want a happy and successful life? I know I do, and that's why I'm against the overuse of computers.
343	345	1	2	"### Rewrite of the third item (in narrative style) Dear Local Newspaper, have you ever thought about all the interesting things you can do on computers, like making calls, ordering groceries, and reading school books? Nowadays, it seems that technology holds the world together, and I believe computers are at the top of the list.  My older sister moved to @CAPS2, and it was difficult to stay in touch and see each other. But then we discovered @ORGANIZATION1, a site where people from all over can add contacts, chat, call, or have webcam conversations. Now we use it every day, and it's like she never left home. @PERSON2 shared this about the internet site @ORGANIZATION1.  Many people love their computers, and studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people get more done in a day online. @PERSON1 said, ""My days are more efficient because of the computer. At work, I can order groceries and have them delivered by four o'clock. When I get home from work, I can make doctor and school appointments and schedule meetings with just a click, no need to look at the calendar or pick up the phone.""  @PERCENT1 of couples today say they met online through platforms like Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, or AOL. The internet is great for meeting new people. You can interact with others, get to know them, and look at their profile pictures. I've made some of my best friends online through a mutual friend's page, and our friendship is going strong.  Schools have also taken education to the web. All class books are available online at home, and students can check their grades and receive comments from teachers. This encourages students to use the web both at home and at school.  I hope I've made you realize that the internet isn't all bad. People spend a lot of time online because so many things, like school, shopping, and entertainment, have moved to the web. Personally, I spend an hour or two on the web chatting, studying, and watching TV. Even when I go for a walk or play my @CAPS5, I'm still connected to the web because the @CAPS5 has Wi - Fi.  In conclusion, computers allow us to connect with others and get things done efficiently. I hope you now share my view on the positive aspects of the internet."
344	346	1	2	### Rewrite of the fourth item (in subjective style) Dear @LOCATION1, as a teenager growing up in this technological and @MONEY1 society, I firmly believe that computers are more harmful than helpful. I think books are better resources, people can find fun in other ways, and computers can be dangerous and cause health problems. As a well - read newspaper, your stance on this subject can influence many minds.  I know computers can help find information, but I believe books are more reliable. On the internet, anyone can write and post an article, even if it's false. You could come across someone claiming to be a doctor in their @NUM1's when they're actually a @NUM2 - year - old working at @ORGANIZATION1. You can never be sure who to trust on the computer, but with books, you know the information is accurate. Sure, the computer might be the quicker option in some cases, but maybe we need more challenges. With the growth of technology, each generation is getting lazier and less interested in books, and it's time to change that.  People can have fun without computers. Many use social networking sites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 to connect with friends, but you can't be sure if the person is who they claim to be. If you want to talk to friends, you can call or text them. Too many teens these days stay in their rooms, play computer games, and spend less time with their families. Why not play cards or board games with your family? It's much more enjoyable in person than virtually. Going outside for fresh air is also a great alternative. And if kids start handwriting their papers, it will improve their handwriting. Besides, some kids don't have access to computers, and you have to handwrite your @ORGANIZATION2's anyway, so why not?  Computers can also be dangerous and harmful to health. Social networks allow kids to post all their information, which can lead to stalking or kidnapping. The internet also has inappropriate images and websites that no one, especially youngsters, should be exposed to. Staring at a computer screen for hours is bad for your eyes and can cause serious vision problems in the long run. Typists are also more prone to arthritis and other finger - related problems due to the repetitive finger movements.  Getting rid of computers would have a positive impact on people's well - being. While many enjoy using computers, they're not really necessary. Books are better, there are other ways to have fun, and computers pose health risks. Why spend a lot of money on a tool that isn't essential? Don't be deceived by the media's tricks to make you buy a computer. Next time you turn on your computer, ask yourself if you really need it or if there's a better way to achieve your goals. Sometimes, it's better to go back to the old, manual ways of doing things.
345	347	1	2	"### Rewrite of the fifth item (in narrative style) Dear local @CAPS1, I heard you're unsure whether computers are good or not. Well, they are, and I have several reasons to prove it.  First, computer games help improve hand - eye coordination. Every day, when using the mouse to play games, you need to be very coordinated to be good at them. This skill is useful in daily life, whether it's playing catch with your son or picking up an object. It's truly important.  Secondly, computers can help you learn about different ethnic backgrounds and far - away places. If you're planning a trip, you'd want to know about the place and what you need. Even just looking at the beautiful countries online can be amazing. For these two reasons alone, you should reconsider your view.  Finally, and I think this is the most important reason, computers help people stay in touch. My mom doesn't have a Facebook account, but she's been chatting with all her old friends. She says it's ""nice."" Having friends is important to everyone, and computers make it easier.  In conclusion, there are many reasons why computers are beneficial. They enhance hand - eye coordination, allow us to learn about far - off places, and help us stay connected with friends. I hope I've convinced you. I'm sure you'll make the right decision."
346	348	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I understand that some people view computers as a waste of time and dangerous. However, computers can be incredibly beneficial in various ways. For instance, they allow you to pay bills online, plan vacations, and even attend college classes. Many people struggle with bills; they are inconvenient, and computers offer a solution. Given that many work long hours, coming home to find bills already paid would be a relief. Computer programs can expedite bill - payment, enabling you to relax and enjoy your free time.  Computers are also excellent for vacation planning. Every year, many people use online programs to organize their trips. My family and I planned a trip to @LOCATION1 in the @DATE1 of @NUM1. When we arrived at the airport, we had first - class tickets, and a ride was waiting for us when we got off the plane. That @DATE1 was truly memorable.  As we enter a new era, more people are taking online college classes, especially those who work or have children at home. These courses are suitable for working individuals as they are concise yet informative. Without a computer, taking these classes would be impossible.  In conclusion, a computer is a valuable asset. Whether you're a working professional or a parent wanting to return to school, consider taking online college classes. And if your family desires a vacation, explore the online travel programs available.
347	349	1	2	To whom it may concern at the local newspaper, I concur with the view that computers can be helpful, allowing us to chat with others. However, their overuse comes with severe drawbacks. When people spend excessive time on computers, they neglect exercise, family, and most importantly, their health. Prolonged computer use can lead to poor eyesight, increased junk food consumption, and subsequent health issues such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes.  Computers are highly addictive, causing people to stay up for hours. This can result in poor hygiene. I believe this issue deserves attention and should be reported in the newspaper. To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 residents, I know using a computer can be enjoyable, but the fun ends when serious health problems arise. This is a very serious matter.  By spending too much time on computers, people miss out on being with their loved ones and engaging in activities. It's like being addicted to a drug. For the sake of your family and your own well - being, it's time to step away from the computer. I propose that all computers be banned for at least one week for non - work or non - school use, which could also be beneficial for your health.  Some may think this is an overreaction, but it's not. Do we want the number of people with diabetes and other health problems to increase? I'm sure the answer is no. So, get up, go for a jog, and spend quality time with your family. Listen to this advice and break this bad habit.
348	350	1	2	Dear local newspaper, can you imagine a world without computers? I can't because I firmly believe that computers are amazing.  Firstly, computers provide a great platform for meeting new people. Who doesn't enjoy making new friends? With a computer, you can search for classmates or people with similar interests. If you're feeling lonely, you can go online and start conversations. It's actually quite fun and harmless. Meeting new people is one of the reasons why I think computers are great.  Secondly, computers are indispensable when it comes to printing materials or working on projects. My science teacher always requires printed assignments. Without a computer, how could I meet this requirement? If you forget your homework, you can ask a friend online or check the school website. Printed assignments always look better, so computers are a great asset for students.  Finally, computers are a treasure trove of information. You can look up almost anything on them. For example, if you're looking for a place to visit but don't have the address, you can search on the computer. If there are problems with your house, car, or bills, the internet can offer solutions. And if you can't find a product in stores, you can buy it online.  In conclusion, computers have a profound and positive impact on our lives. They enable us to meet new people, complete projects and homework, and access a vast amount of information. They truly help us in numerous ways rather than causing harm.
349	351	1	2	Dear newspaper, while some claim that computers don't benefit society, I hold a different view. Computers offer far - reaching benefits to society, including facilitating learning, simplifying work, preventing accidents, and saving lives.  Computers make learning and work easier. You can type documents, plan your schedule, create presentations, and check your email. These functions streamline work processes. Moreover, the internet is a vast source of knowledge. You can learn about virtually anything, and it's even possible to obtain a medical degree online.  The capabilities of computers extend beyond learning and work. They play a crucial role in preventing accidents in moving vehicles. Many cars on the road today can almost drive themselves, thanks to computer technology. The same goes for planes and trains. In some cases, the human operator is only present as a backup. @CAPS1 are fully computerized, with humans simply instructing the computer. This computerization makes the world a safer place for everyone.  Finally, computers save lives. In hospitals, they are essential for record - keeping, monitoring vital signs, and assisting in surgeries. During surgery, computers allow for minimally invasive procedures and are more accurate than human surgeons, which directly saves lives. They also ensure that operating rooms are sterile, reducing the risk of infection.  In summary, computers benefit society significantly more than one might initially think. They enhance learning, simplify work, prevent accidents, and increase the chances of survival when people are hospitalized. So, what's your opinion of computers now?
350	352	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, experts agree that people should go outside and exercise, and there are three main reasons for this. Firstly, people and kids today often lack sufficient exercise. Those who don't exercise can gain weight. Parents and children who spend all day on computers or laptops are at a higher risk of becoming overweight. Kids, in particular, have a hard time exercising because they are overweight from excessive computer use and playing computer games.  Secondly, going outside allows people to spend time with friends and family. Kids should stop spending so much time on computers and instead go out more often with their loved ones. Parents, too, should prioritize spending time with friends and family over staying at home on the computer.  Lastly, people should go outside to enjoy nature. Many people know what nature is, but they don't fully understand its true meaning. Adults should spend more time outdoors, especially considering that @PERCENT1 of the world doesn't have access to computers.  In conclusion, going outside and exercising is crucial for both physical health and social well - being. It's time for people of all ages to step away from the computer and embrace the benefits of the outdoors.
351	353	1	2	Technology is highly beneficial to people. Without it, we couldn't make calls, access the internet via computers, or communicate with family and friends. Many individuals rely on technology for their jobs. For example, those in the automotive industry use computers to assess the age of cars. This highlights the necessity of technology. People require technology for numerous purposes. Computers are particularly significant as they enable us to search for information online and conduct tests. We can also use technology to make calls and access websites like google.com. In conclusion, technology is essential for our daily communication and various activities.
352	354	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, over the years, computers have been an outstanding invention. They have assisted people in acquiring more information, communicating with others, and inventing new technologies. This has had a positive impact on our country. Let me explain. Computers are beneficial to our country because they help us find information for school and determine our locations. For instance, I can find information for my science project more quickly using a computer than by going to the library and searching through books. I'm in [NUM1] grade. Moreover, if we get lost on the roads, a computer can guide us to our destination. Another reason computers are positive for our country is that they facilitate communication with friends and family. As [PERSON2] said, ""When I can't contact my mom, I email her on my computer."" Additionally, parents can contact their children's teachers via email to check on their progress. Finally, computers aid in the invention of different things. Scientists can easily develop new technologies using computers. As [CAPS4] [CAPS5] stated, ""The computer has helped us first make a model of our invention and then start working on the details."" Over the years, computers have helped us with almost everything. In conclusion, computers assist us in searching for information, contacting people, and creating new inventions. They have also been helpful in wars. We should allow computers to remain in [LOCATION1]."
353	355	1	2	Dear [CAPS1], I believe that while computers can be a waste of time, they also offer numerous benefits. One should only use a computer when necessary. Many people spend hours on the computer, either out of boredom or to avoid going outside. As computers have become faster and more efficient, more individuals are purchasing them each year. Computers are useful in various ways. They can be a source of learning, a tool for job - hunting, and a platform for shopping. If you're looking for a job, you can find a suitable one on the computer. You can also gain a vast amount of information from it; you can look up anything and even ask questions. Moreover, if you can't find an item in a store, you can search for it on the computer, though you'll likely need a credit card. In conclusion, computers are both helpful and potentially time - consuming.
354	356	1	2	"Dear Newspaper, [CAPS1], I use the computer quite often, but I think it's one of the most addictive and time - consuming inventions in today's society. While computers have advantages like allowing us to communicate with distant friends and family, do schoolwork, and gather information, I believe people should reduce their computer usage. Sure, we can interact with friends and family through email, [CAPS2] messaging, or social networking sites like [CAPS3] or [CAPS4]. However, we can easily communicate the old - fashioned way using cell phones or writing letters. Exercise is crucial these days, yet many people don't get enough of it. Obesity has increased by [PERCENT1] since last year. If people keep wasting time staring at their computer screens without exercising, this percentage will rise. Computers can also cause various medical problems. About a month ago, my back was bothering me, and the doctor said one likely cause was leaning forward to use my laptop. Specialist [CAPS5] Oz said, ""Computers can also cause vision problems and headaches."" We can prevent these issues by taking a stand against excessive computer use. We should limit our computer use to two or three times a week and only use it for important reasons. I hope this makes people aware of the negative effects of computers."
355	357	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I'm writing to inform you that computers are having a significant impact on humans, with both terrible and less - severe consequences. Many ordinary people now stay indoors all day, playing games on the computer, or using social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and [CAPS1]. This issue is interfering with school, work, and exercise. Every day, more people are failing to get enough exercise or complete their work. We must stop this concerning trend. People who stay indoors all day are less healthy than before. Their immune systems are weakened, increasing the risk of illness, which can even lead to severe conditions or death. If you stay inside all day, the computer can become so addictive that it takes over your life. To stay healthy, one must eat right and engage in activities like riding a bike. If someone is frequently on the computer indoors, it's similar to being addicted to watching TV or playing [CAPS3]. Computer addiction can also disrupt family events and sports. When you're on the computer, you may forget about homework, which can lead to a significant drop in grades, summer school, or repeating a grade. Moreover, not preparing for sports due to computer use can prevent you from performing at your best. These are the common ways computers are affecting people, though there are other reasons as well.
356	358	1	2	To the esteemed @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1, I firmly disagree with the experts who worry that people are spending excessive time on computers and less on exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with loved ones. The issue is not the computers themselves; purchasing and using a computer is a matter of personal choice. We cannot blame the computer for people's lack of physical activity. Moreover, computers are highly valuable as they facilitate education. For instance, there are numerous online computer courses for those seeking degrees in various fields. With a simple click, one's future and career can be transformed. Additionally, computers enable us to learn about different cultures and ways of life. I have a great interest in @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2, even after the terrible storm they endured. Thank you for considering my perspective, and I hope it will change your view on a life without computers.
357	359	1	2	Activity knows no bounds, while technology has its limitations. In life, one can engage in an endless array of physical activities, constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible. However, technology, despite its rapid advancements, has inherent constraints. It cannot fully replicate the real - world experiences that come with being active. For example, no virtual reality can truly replace the feeling of running on a beach or climbing a mountain. Therefore, while technology has its place, we should not neglect the limitless potential of an active lifestyle.
358	360	1	2	Do Computers @CAPS1 Society? This question may never have a definitive answer, but I have my own opinion, which I hope will resonate with many. Exercise is an excellent way to maintain physical fitness. However, if one spends all day sitting on the @ORGANIZATION1, they have little chance of staying in shape. While others are out at the park, swimming in the pool, or fishing at the lake, those glued to the @ORGANIZATION1 are likely to become overweight. Moreover, using the @ORGANIZATION1 excessively can be detrimental both physically and socially. It prevents people from spending quality time with friends and family, and may even lead to the loss of old friendships as new ones are formed by those who are more socially active. Additionally, spending too much time on the @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1 means missing out on the wonderful @CAPS2 life that one has been looking forward to since childhood. So, the next time a friend suggests going online after school, it's better to decline to avoid getting addicted.
359	361	1	2	Computers have an overwhelmingly positive impact on people. They offer a multitude of benefits in various aspects. Firstly, computers are a rich source of knowledge. They can teach us about history and distant places. With just a search for the word @LOCATION1, millions of web pages filled with new information and exciting facts about @LOCATION1 appear instantly. This is far more efficient than going to the local library to find a relevant book. Moreover, the internet provides different views and perspectives on a subject, something that may be hard to find in library books. Secondly, computers can be a great source of entertainment. There are countless entertaining websites, and one can read books and magazines online for free. For game enthusiasts, almost any type of game, such as board games, video games, strategy games, and adventure games, can be found on the computer. Sports fans can find information on different sports and ways to improve their skills. Those who like to watch @CAPS1 can also do so on the computer, as many @CAPS2.V programs put their episodes online for easy viewing. Thirdly, computers are an excellent means of communication. They allow us to stay in touch with friends and family, no matter how far away they are. We can send emails with attached pictures and files, and use instant messaging programs to communicate in real - time. Video calls through webcams also make it possible to have face - to - face conversations. In conclusion, computers are truly a positive force as they educate, entertain, and connect people.
360	362	1	2	I firmly believe that the use of computers is not a big problem. In fact, the @ORGANIZATION1 is under - appreciated for several reasons. Firstly, in terms of communication, it is a convenient, fast, and generally safe option. Contrary to the view that computer use reduces family interaction, I communicate with my family and friends regularly on the @ORGANIZATION1. When I need help, I can either chat with someone on Facebook or send an email. Usually, I get an answer within a day. Additionally, the internet is a vast source of information, and it's easier to look up answers online. Compared to phone calls, chatting on the @ORGANIZATION1 is safer as it's harder to trace, and one may not know who they are talking to on the phone. Secondly, computers can teach social and life skills. For example, adults who can type well and fast can earn on average @MONEY1 more. Social networks like Facebook can help young adults learn basic social skills, which are crucial when looking for a job. Good social skills can lead to better relationships with bosses and potentially result in promotions. Thirdly, computer addiction is not as prevalent as people think. Only about @PERCENT3 of Facebook users are addicted, which is minuscule compared to alcohol addiction (@PERCENT1) or drug addiction (@PERCENT2). It's also not deadly, and can be cured with a quick recovery. As long as one uses the @ORGANIZATION1 for an hour or less a day, there is no need to worry. As @PERSON1 at the @NUM3 said, computer use is not a major problem. It's a convenient way to communicate, a tool for learning, and not a significant source of addiction.
361	363	1	2	I firmly believe that computers bring numerous benefits to society. Almost everyone uses or owns a computer, which aids in handling important matters and simplifies tasks. In a sense, using a computer provides exercise as it makes your fingers move more quickly. The computer is truly one of the greatest inventions in the world. You can chat with friends and family, print documents, and play games. It also allows you to research famous people, look up information on the deceased, and view pictures. However, computers can make people lazy. They are addictive, causing people to just sit there and not want to get off. Some people don't understand how to properly use or have a computer. If they did, they might change their minds. You can access platforms like MySpace, thanks to Tom, and communicate with friends, family, and people from different towns and states. Moreover, you can visit Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Twitter. The computer and the internet are not only fun but also offer a bit of exercise. They are also helpful for schoolwork, homework, and researching countries, places, houses, and vacations. On the other hand, some people argue that enjoying nature is beneficial as it keeps you healthy and strong, encourages sports participation, and allows for outdoor fun instead of staying indoors all day, doing nothing but staring at the computer screen and losing sleep. In my opinion, both have their merits, but I still support the view that computers are the best.
362	364	1	2	The notification “You've got mail!” appears on my computer, which is filled with emails from distant relatives and friends. Without computers, maintaining efficient contact with these people would be impossible. Over the past few decades, technology has advanced significantly, leading to the development of remarkable computers. With computers, we can type faster, communicate with distant relatives, and access information like never before. This incredible invention has enabled us to accomplish truly astonishing feats. Firstly, we have replaced typewriters with computers. Now, we can type faster, improve hand - eye coordination, and edit papers without peer assistance. Given the large amount of typing required in colleges, most occupations, and daily lists, computers have made this process faster and easier. It is likely that most of the things you need to type are done using a computer. Secondly, we have developed excellent hand - eye coordination skills. By typing and reading simultaneously, our eyes are trained, similar to when playing the piano. Lastly, with spell - check, we can edit papers independently. The computer can instantly detect problems, making it undoubtedly more effective. The ability to type documents is clearly one reason why we need computers. Another reason is communication. Thanks to various communication applications such as @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, we can communicate with a large number of distant friends and relatives. For example, when my sisters were at college, it was difficult to communicate with them. However, through @CAPS2, I can see their pictures, instant - message them, and even have video chats. Without computers, this would not have been possible. Additionally, email provides a fast and easy way to inform people about schedule changes, ideas, and store sales. It has replaced traditional mail. Clearly, the communication aspect of computers is a significant reason for their necessity in our lives. Finally, computers allow us to access information more easily and quickly. With search engines like @ORGANIZATION1, we can find facts and figures within seconds, with hundreds of options. The process is extremely efficient: just type in what you're looking for, and you'll get the relevant results. There are also many more options and sites to choose from. For instance, typing in a specific animal will yield numerous pages on the topic. Undoubtedly, computers have made information searching easier and faster, which is why we need them in our daily lives. In conclusion, computers are an amazing invention that has opened up many opportunities for modern society. Without them, we would struggle to type documents quickly, communicate effectively, and access information efficiently. Thanks to computers, we can achieve incredible things. People across the country are experiencing the efficiency of using computers, and we can too. It is evident that computers are effective and are driving technological advancement in our society.
363	365	1	2	Can you envision a world where people are like lifeless zombies, overly obsessed with technology such as computers, televisions, and cellular phones? If we don't put an end to this excessive use, our world as we know it will come to a sudden halt. Computers can lead to obesity, a lack of social interaction, and a waste of time. Our world cannot afford to spare time for such issues. Our planet is run by humans, and if we neglect its needs, we and our beloved planet @LOCATION1 will perish. Computers are not beneficial to our society today. Firstly, computers play a major role in causing obesity, which is one of the most commonly discussed health problems globally. While many factors contribute to obesity, technology, particularly computers, has a significant impact. Instead of sitting in front of a computer all day, people could engage in more productive activities such as taking a walk, starting a club (for adults and children), or helping neighbors. Although computers may improve hand - eye coordination, they do not teach us how to stay fit. As adults, we should understand the importance of combating obesity. Children are the future, and we don't want future leaders to be known for widespread obesity. Secondly, computers reduce “bonding” time between family and friends. Both adults and children are lacking in social needs. They don't have proper verbal and physical interactions with their “online friends”. This is likely the reason why family relationships are deteriorating these days, and the root cause is computers. Moreover, people spend too much time on computers, which is contributing to the high unemployment rate. People claim they “don't have enough time”, but in reality, they are devoting all their time to computers. If they removed computers from their lives, they would have plenty of time for other things. No one wants to be an unemployed “stay - at - home” person. In conclusion, computers are not beneficial to our poorly - managed society. They cause obesity, damage social relationships, and consume people's time. Although some may think computers allow for online chatting with “friends”, they fail to meet our physical and verbal social needs, resulting in low self - esteem. If newspapers continue to publish articles about the “benefits of computers”, people will soon stop believing this nonsense and stop buying these newspapers. After all, nobody wants to read lies.
364	366	1	2	Nowadays, all we seem to hear about is computers, with new websites, chatrooms, and games emerging constantly. I agree with experts who suggest that we should spend more time outdoors with family and friends. Computers are taking over people's lives. You never know who might be looking you up on Facebook or @CAPS4. And you can do almost anything on them, whether it's during lunch or at other times. I have to admit that computers are cool devices, but there must be a limit. We can't spend all our time on @CAPS3, looking up what @PERSON1 said to @PERSON2. We need to come back to reality and spend time with our families. Although @CAPS3 is a cool device, it's not safe to post personal information on it. Facebook and @CAPS4 are probably two of the most dangerous websites. Anyone could simply type in @PERSON1 and find @NUM2 matches and locate you, even if you don't know them. People aren't always who they claim to be. Someone might say they're a @NUM3 - year - old just leaving college, but in reality, they could be a @NUM4 - year - old @CAPS6 about to enter a senior center. Don't trust anyone. These days, you don't even need to leave your house. You can shop, talk, file taxes, pay bills, and have a virtual life on @CAPS3. Soon, human interaction might occur entirely through @CAPS3. Some computers may even have smarter systems than some humans. In short, we should limit our time on @CAPS3, or that's where we'll end up spending all our time. I firmly believe that computers are overused in our daily lives. They're taking over, they're dangerous, and they make it so you don't have to leave your house to make a living. I hope you'll consider my thoughts.
365	367	1	2	According to @ORGANIZATION1, there are numerous positive aspects of technology, especially computers. Computers offer the opportunity to communicate with people worldwide, access educational websites, and simplify bill - paying and shopping. Communicating with people from different parts of the world can be fascinating. Through the internet on computers, you can learn about different cultures and stay in touch with friends and family in other cities, states, or countries. Some may argue that computers are expensive, but it's a one - time cost. Computers are beneficial for both students and teachers. Students can get homework help on educational websites. For teachers, they can post students' grades online, eliminating the need to answer constant questions about class averages. Although there are inappropriate websites, there are many ways to block them. For example, when I was in @CAPS3 for @CAPS2, I needed a lot of help. My teacher recommended a website called StudyIsland, and regularly using it helped me raise my grade to @CAPS4. Computers also enable us to pay bills and shop at lower prices. Although online purchases may arrive a few days late, the time and money saved by not going to the store are significant. They are also very helpful for people with disabilities. In conclusion, computers bring many positive benefits. They allow global communication, access to educational resources, and facilitate bill - paying and shopping. As the local newspaper states, computers are a great asset to society, and many things would be impossible without them.
366	368	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @PERSON1, computers have offered numerous benefits. They have facilitated learning for both children and adults, increased employment opportunities, and assisted law enforcement. While it is true that some individuals spend excessive time on these devices, this does not negate their positive contributions.  Computers are powerful educational tools. Children can use them to research homework or explore topics out of curiosity. Adults, even those with prior education, can make new discoveries about space, the human body, etc. These discoveries, in turn, enrich the educational content for children.  In the current economic climate, many people are unemployed and struggling to support their families. However, without computers, the unemployment rate would be even higher. @PERCENT1 of the workforce is involved in computer - related jobs, and the absence of computers would mean job losses for these individuals.  Computers also play a crucial role in law enforcement. For over @NUM1 years, they have helped in catching criminals. Despite the increase in crime in recent years, computers have been instrumental in apprehending wrongdoers. They can store vast amounts of data, such as fingerprints, pictures, @CAPS2, and previous criminal records, which aids in identifying and catching criminals.  In conclusion, computers have multiple positive impacts. They have enhanced learning, created jobs, and supported law enforcement. Even if some people overuse them, the overall benefits are undeniable, and we should encourage the continued advancement of technology.
367	369	1	2	"Do you own a computer? Is there one in your home? On average, a household has two computers, but this is not a positive development. @CAPS2 computers are encroaching on time that could be spent on hobbies, in nature, and in real - life interactions.  Firstly, computers steal time from hobbies and socializing. Some of my friends spend @NUM1 hours a day on the computer instead of playing sports or hanging out. The computer becomes the center of their lives. People often ask me, ""@CAPS1 weren't you online @TIME1?"" and I reply, ""@CAPS2 I have a life that doesn't revolve around @CAPS3.""  Secondly, computers draw us away from nature. People no longer appreciate the beauty of the outdoors. In our orderly lives, we need the wilderness more than ever as it helps us value ourselves and our planet. However, computers take this opportunity away.  Thirdly, computers distance us from real - life interactions. Some people struggle with face - to - face conversations and only know how to communicate via email or @CAPS5. While it can be relaxing to escape real life, some individuals seem to have lost touch with basic real - life skills, like knowing how to write a proper letter.  In conclusion, computers divert time from real life, nature, and hobbies. Additionally, excessive typing can lead to arthritis in the hands."
368	370	1	2	In today's @LOCATION1 and across the world, computers have become a common household item. However, some people believe that computers do not benefit society. In my opinion, computers are an invaluable asset to our daily lives.  The internet enables us to communicate with friends, family, and people globally. There are several ways to communicate. One option is through instant messaging services like @CAPS1 @CAPS2, which are fast and cost - effective. You can send and receive messages at any time and place with minimal hassle. Another way is using social media platforms such as @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, where you can update your status on your wall for your friends to see and comment on. The best way, in my view, is using a webcam. It allows you to see and hear the person on the other end, enabling them to express themselves freely without the limitations of text and pictures.  Computers help bring order to our otherwise disorganized world through various applications and programs. @ORGANIZATION1 offers a suite of apps for tasks ranging from document writing to spreadsheet creation, presentation making, and flyer design. These apps are essential for starting a business or promoting an invention. @CAPS5 focuses on storing and organizing information in files as per your preference, offering quick access. Document folders are also useful for quickly saving and organizing data.  Most importantly, computers are indispensable when researching projects or gathering up - to - date information. When you have a limited time frame to research, create, and organize a project, books are too slow. The internet provides fast and reliable access to information. For example, use the search engine @ORGANIZATION2 to find the difference between @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, and @LOCATION2 for questions about the @CAPS7 @CAPS8.  In conclusion, computers are not just good for society; they are essential for civilization. They facilitate global communication, help us organize our lives, and provide easy access to information.
369	371	1	2	Approximately @PERCENT1 of the world's population uses computers. Although you may spend a significant amount of time on the computer, it offers several benefits, including the ability to contact family and friends, exercise your brain, and still have time to enjoy nature.  Email is a popular way to stay in touch with family and friends. There are also other platforms like Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter. I once wasted my cell - phone minutes calling my aunt, but such simple communication could have been done via email.  Online, you can exercise your brain by learning new information. For example, my sister can go online to learn more about science when she needs help. Some experts may think spending too much time on the computer is a problem, but it is useful for gaining knowledge. Online tutoring is also available, which further helps in mental development.  Regarding nature, about @PERCENT2 of the world's population enjoys it. However, it can sometimes wait. Some people dislike certain seasons and prefer to stay indoors, like during snowfall. While nature is important, the changing seasons and bad weather can make outdoor activities less appealing.  In conclusion, the computer has many positive aspects. Despite the time spent on it, it allows us to connect with loved ones, expand our knowledge, and still have the option to enjoy nature.
370	372	1	2	"Dear newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a highly positive impact on people. They are extremely helpful, providing education and facilitating interaction.  Computers improve hand - eye coordination. Dr. @PERSON4 noted in recent surveys and tests that @PERCENT1 of people have shown a significant improvement in hand - eye coordination due to computer use. They also teach typing skills. At @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 more students have learned to type thanks to computers. For business people, creating PowerPoint presentations on computers is much easier than making large poster boards. I once used a PowerPoint for a @CAPS2 @CAPS1 project instead of a poster, and it was far more convenient.  In schools, computers are used to educate students about new things. For instance, students can learn about interesting places. @PERSON5 said, ""@CAPS2 friends is moving to @LOCATION1 and she had no idea about it, so we looked it up on the internet and found a lot of cool information."" Computers also teach students about new cultures. At @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT2 of students learned about @NUM2 new cultures in a year because of computers. They can also inform us about interesting people. I was surprised to learn that President @PERSON2 had @NUM3 brothers and grew up in @LOCATION2.  Computers are also widely used for interaction. Instant messaging is free, which saves parents from paying high phone bills. In a survey in the town of @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @PERCENT3 of people found it easier to talk to friends using computers. Online dating sites have also helped people meet new partners. @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS6 wonderful! @CAPS2 husband and I met online and have been together for @NUM4 years."" Communicating with distant relatives online is free, as @PERSON3 said, ""@CAPS6 so much easier talking to people online.""  In conclusion, computers have a very positive effect on people. They are helpful tools for education and interaction, and their benefits are far - reaching."
371	373	1	2	"To the relevant party, I've recently learned about the ongoing debate regarding the impact of modern - day computers on society. Some individuals believe computers have a positive influence, such as facilitating the acquisition of new knowledge and enabling interaction and communication with others. Conversely, there are those who argue that society is devoting an excessive amount of time to computers. They note that this leads to people spending less time on physical exercise, enjoying nature, and being with their families.  In my view, people are overly attached to computers. Many assume that all information on the internet is true, but this is far from the case. A staggering @PERCENT1 of teens across the country are addicted to computers.  Firstly, the information posted on the internet is not always reliable. Since anyone can post content, regardless of its veracity, it can mislead users. For instance, my friend found a website with detailed information for an essay. She submitted it, but the teacher returned it the next day, marked with ""false information"" in large red letters. Had she sourced the information from a book, she likely would have received an ""A+"".  Secondly, @PERCENT1 of teens in @LOCATION1 have become addicted to using computers. My friend was obsessed with Facebook from @NUM1 to @NUM2, using it daily. As a result, she started failing classes, neglecting her homework, and skipping test - preparation. She ended up failing the @NUM3 grade because of her addiction to the website.  Given these points, I concur with the experts' concern that people are spending too much time on computers. To maintain a healthy lifestyle and avoid excessive addiction, it is crucial to set limits. Make the wise choice."
372	374	1	2	Dear local Newspaper, I firmly believe that heavy users of technology, especially computers, face numerous drawbacks, and this issue affects adults and children alike. Children who frequent chatting websites like Facebook are experiencing a decline in their academic performance. I've discovered that children who use Facebook often fail to submit their homework, and their grades are plummeting. I once heard a student say that after starting to use Facebook, he stopped doing his homework and reading. His grade dropped from a @CAPS1 to a @CAPS2 average because he was more focused on the computer than on schoolwork and reading.  Computers can be highly addictive. Once you start using a website, the frequency of use can quickly increase from once a day to multiple times a day. It can feel as if the computer is an extension of you, and it becomes difficult to break free.  Allowing oneself to chat online can also be extremely dangerous. Young males and females may find it exciting to chat with someone from a different state or city, but in reality, it is fraught with risks. The person on the other end of the chat could be a murderer, a kidnapper, or a wanted criminal. On chat lines, users can provide false names, pictures, and ages, making it impossible to verify their identities. This is why, in some cases, people go missing after chatting online.  Another negative aspect of excessive computer use is that it can cause a distraction from family. Instead of sitting down and asking family members about their day, one may rush to get on the computer. Moreover, it can lower test and quiz grades. Spending hours on the computer instead of studying for an important exam can lead to failure, and the only one to blame is oneself due to the addiction to computer use.  In conclusion, @PERCENT1 of people have been negatively affected by computers. It is advisable to stay off computers unless they are being used for educational purposes.
373	375	1	2	I disagree with the idea that people should spend a lot of time on the computer, and I'll explain why.  First, if you're a @NUM1 - year - old man, excessive computer use can prevent you from spending time with your kids. Additionally, it can cause eye problems. So, it's not a good idea to be overly reliant on the computer.  Second, if you're married and spend a lot of time chatting with other women online, it can lead to problems with your wife. Many people have faced relationship issues when their spouses discovered their online interactions.  Third, if you're a kid like me, spending too much time on the computer means you won't have as much fun or make friends. You'll miss out on playing with your little sister outside and spending time with your family.  In conclusion, these reasons clearly show that people shouldn't spend a large amount of time on the computer.
374	376	1	2	@ORGANIZATION2. My name is @PERSON1, and I'm @NUM1 years old. I attend @ORGANIZATION1. I'm going to discuss the experts' view that computers are affecting society. While some technology advocates believe that computers have a positive impact on people, and more and more people are using computers, not everyone agrees that this is beneficial for society.  Those who think computers benefit society point out that people can learn more, communicate with others online if they don't have a cell phone, research vacation destinations, and see what those places look like. However, I believe computers are indeed one of the greatest inventions. In my life, they are very important. If I fall behind in some classes, I can do research and study at home. After losing my cell phone, I can still talk to my friends online. When my parents don't want to take me shopping, I can shop online, which makes it easier to find what I want.  People can learn a great deal from computers. They are like a window to the world. You can explore the earth, space, cities, and stay updated on what's happening on the internet. Computers don't negatively affect society; instead, they make things easier. They give people the ability to learn about distant places and people and allow them to communicate online.  For example, I didn't know much about @LOCATION1 except that it was hot. After researching it online, I found that it's like a cool park with many fun things to do. I went there on vacation, and it was just as I'd read. Online is also a great place to stay in touch with friends and family.  Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on computers instead of exercising. While it's true that some people spend a lot of time on computers, they still exercise. For instance, when they go out with their families, they play sports or walk while shopping, which is a form of exercise. I spend @NUM2 on the computer, but I still play basketball from morning until afternoon because I value my health.  In conclusion, although some experts are worried about the impact of computers on society, I believe that computers are a positive force. They help us study, find information, and communicate, and they don't prevent us from leading an active lifestyle.
375	377	1	2	Dear Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, can you imagine life without your computer? If not, it's time to reconsider. Millions of people spend countless hours staring at computer screens, whether it's for @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, or other purposes. This sedentary lifestyle is not healthy. Not only do people miss out on exercise, but they also fail to appreciate the ever - changing natural world around them. Teens and young children are getting lost in the cyberworld and not using their after - school time effectively for studying or doing homework.  The increasing use of computers also poses several risks. First, the obesity rate in @LOCATION1 is rising rapidly. A recent study by the @LOCATION2 government shows that @NUM1 people are overweight and @NUM2 are on the verge of obesity. By exercising and going outside more, we @CAPS4 can reduce the obesity rate and lead healthier, happier lives. Spending all your time in front of a computer screen only increases the likelihood of becoming overweight.  Second, excessive computer use means less time to enjoy nature. The natural world is constantly changing, and if you rarely leave your home, you'll miss out on many amazing experiences. Moreover, frequent computer use leads to faster wear - and - tear of the device. When you replace your old computer with a new @ORGANIZATION2, where does the old one go? To a landfill! If every @CAPS5 threw out one computer a year, there would be over @NUM3 million discarded computers, and we'd be surrounded by trash. Clearly, excessive computer use harms the environment and your health.  Finally, the growing use of computers increases the number of internet predators. The chances of you or your child being targeted by these predators are soaring. As more kids use the computer, the internet safety level drops. Children may watch inappropriate videos on YouTube, engage in cyberbullying on @CAPS6, or unknowingly share personal information on MySpace and Facebook. @PERCENT1 of kidnappings are potentially linked to information found on the computer.  Do you want such a thing to happen to you or your family? I'm sure not. So, get up from your computer chair, go for a run, ride a bike, and give your computer a break. Limit your internet and computer use because it only causes harm and offers no real benefits. Thank you for reading, and don't support the rapid, unregulated advancement of computer technology.
376	378	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a highly beneficial impact on society. There has been a controversy regarding whether computers are advantageous, but in my view, it's evident that they are. They enable us to maintain contact, complete daily work, and offer entertainment. Computers are crucial for communication. With a simple click, anyone can send an email. Without computers, we'd have to rely on the postal service or the telephone, both of which incur costs. In the event of a hurricane, families can check their emails or the internet to be aware of the danger. Making a call is risky as the recipient might not answer. Clearly, the communication ability of computers is a compelling reason for their continued use. Secondly, computers assist us in daily work. Most people work during the week, and we rely heavily on computers. For instance, an office - worker creating a PowerPoint presentation for the company's new brand can start working immediately by turning on the computer. Without it, completing such work would be extremely difficult. The need for a desktop, laptop, or other computer device is undeniable in the workplace. Lastly, computers allow us to play games and browse the internet freely. Like many teenagers, when I get home, I go straight to my computer. I can check game scores, listen to music, and play solitaire without the hassle of turning on the TV and enduring commercials, or using other media devices. There's no doubt that computers provide fun and are very helpful. Although some claim that computers are unnecessary, they are integral to our lives. In conclusion, the benefits of computers in communication, work, and entertainment clearly justify their place in our society.
377	379	1	2	I am of the strong opinion that computers have a profound influence on people. They have transformed our lifestyle in numerous ways, allowing us to interact with others online, learn about distant cultures, and explore the vast expanse of the internet. Computers facilitate global interaction among friends and family. Platforms like MySpace, Facebook, and @ORGANIZATION1 offer seamless communication. On Facebook, it's easy to upload a personal photo to your profile. With @ORGANIZATION1, you can chat with friends and even see what they're doing, though a webcam is required. I have @ORGANIZATION1 and find it an excellent resource. I have relatives in @LOCATION1 whom I see only once a year, but thanks to my computer, I can stay in touch with them throughout the year. Computers also help us understand different cultures and lifestyles. I remember a commercial where a little boy was talking to his father on the computer. The boy was lying down and eating an @CAPS1 cookie while chatting with his dad, who was doing the same. They both dipped their cookies in milk, ate, and laughed. It was a heart - warming moment, showing that despite the distance, the computer brought them close. Exploring the internet on a computer is another great advantage. On a rainy and boring day, you can play fun games. You can also look up details of your favorite basketball games, such as the points @PERSON1 scored for your fantasy team. At school, you can check your grades. For example, if I had all A's except for a @CAPS2 in math, I'd know I need to study harder for the next test. In conclusion, computers are an essential part of our society. They enable online communication, offer insights into distant places and people, and provide a platform for internet exploration. Their impact on our lifestyle is truly remarkable.
378	380	1	2	The sound of a light - bulb going off in your head represents the moment of learning something new. Without the internet and computers, we'd be stuck with boring textbooks. In my opinion, computers have a highly positive effect on people. They offer a wealth of valuable information, can answer questions in @NUM1 seconds, and provide global communication. Suppose you need to know who the third president of the @CAPS2.S was. Would you use the computer to save time or rummage through old books? The internet has taught me many facts, such as the capital of @LOCATION2 being @LOCATION1, details from the constitution of the @ORGANIZATION1, and the tragic assassination of @PERSON1 in his car. A technology major at @CAPS4, @PERSON2, recently stated that @NUM2 in @NUM3 websites on the internet are for educational purposes. According to him, the internet is a significant part of education, and without computers, our knowledge would be severely limited. Another technology major, Lila, mentioned that @PERCENT1 of people communicate through computers, @PERCENT2 through phones, and @PERCENT3 through mail. Also, @NUM4 in @NUM5 people over the age of nine have an email, and an incredible number of emails are sent daily. These statistics highlight the importance of computers. They not only educate but also connect us globally. In conclusion, taking a step back, we can clearly see how valuable computers are to us, as they are integral to our learning and communication.
379	381	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I am deeply concerned about the increasing dependence on computers and firmly believe that they do not benefit our society as much as some might think. Firstly, computers are causing people to neglect their friends and family. Many individuals are spending more time in front of a screen rather than interacting with their loved ones. I recall visiting my cousin @PERSON1. All I got was a quick '@CAPS4' before he rushed to his room to continue his computer activities. Family and friends cannot be replaced by a computer screen; it's simply not right. Secondly, computers are having a negative impact on our physical and mental health. Nature is the best way to take care of our bodies and minds, but due to computers, most people are not getting enough outdoor exercise. Nearly @NUM1 people say they spend more time on the computer than anywhere else. This is not a healthy way to spend our time. We must address this issue before more people abandon nature for computers. The fresh air, trees, and birds are far more beneficial than the artificial environment of a computer. Lastly, computer addiction is a serious problem. Many people are getting addicted to what they find on their computers, which leads to laziness and a lack of interest in other activities. I witnessed this with my brother. When he first got his computer, he locked himself in his room for days, only focusing on socializing and gaming. Addiction is a matter that requires immediate attention. In conclusion, computers are over - ruling family and friends, causing a neglect of nature, and leading to widespread addiction. Although they do help people stay in touch globally, there are alternative methods like mail. We need to be more aware of the negative impacts of computers on our society.
380	382	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers offer immense benefits to society. They allow us to learn about far - off places, assist with schoolwork, and enable online communication. Computers are a gateway to global knowledge. Without them, we might never know about some countries. They help us learn about different destinations for vacations, and the places we should visit or avoid. They have broadened our horizons and made the world a smaller place. In terms of schoolwork, computers are a great asset. Most school projects involve research, and computers make this process much easier. Instead of carrying heavy textbooks back and forth between school and home, we can use online textbooks. This saves time and effort. Moreover, chatting online is a more cost - effective alternative to phone calls. As @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students prefer online chatting, it also helps improve typing skills, which are useful in the future. Computers provide easy access to information, making them a better option than traditional textbooks for school - related tasks. Finally, computers enable us to communicate with others online. Without them, staying in touch with people would be much more difficult. In conclusion, the benefits of computers in learning, schoolwork, and communication are undeniable. They have become an indispensable part of our lives and should continue to be embraced for the positive impact they bring.
381	383	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, do you think computers are beneficial as they provide us with useful information? I certainly do, @CAPS2. This is just one of the reasons I support the use of computers. They offer information for learning, enable communication with others, and provide entertainment.  When I need to learn or find out something I'm unfamiliar with, I turn to my computer. Search engines like @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS3, and @LOCATION1 let me input a question or phrase and present links to relevant websites. Additionally, we can download and install software for learning, such as language - learning programs or math - practice tools. For example, my grandfather wanted to learn @CAPS4 but couldn't attend classes. He got a program to learn at home.  Computers also facilitate communication. Social sites allow us to ""chat"" with friends by typing, and video chat enables face - to - face conversations. This is important as some believe computers make people ""anti - social"", but it actually helps us connect with distant friends and relatives and can enhance the social lives of shy people.  Entertainment is another advantage of computers. We can access music, movies, and play video games. If we're traveling and worried about kids getting bored, we can play a movie on a laptop. We can download music to an iPod or @NUM1 player from the computer.  However, I recognize the negative impacts of computers. Some people stop exercising, become overweight, interact less with others, and spend less time outdoors.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers can benefit society. They offer information, enable communication, and provide entertainment."
382	384	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I'm sure you agree, as I do, that computers have a positive impact on people. There are several reasons for this: they help us learn about distant places, allow us to communicate with others and learn about different cultures, and improve hand - eye coordination.  If you're planning a trip, computers can assist in various ways. You can learn about your destination, find good hotels, and arrange transportation by logging onto Google. When working on a school project about a different part of the world, you can use platforms like Skype, Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. to communicate with friends. You can gather information about school assignments, due dates, and plan activities.  Hand - eye coordination is crucial, especially for drivers. Without it, one might face high insurance costs. Computers can help improve this skill. If you lack good hand - eye coordination, you'll struggle with many tasks.  In summary, computers are a valuable addition to our society. They help us learn about travel destinations, manage tasks, and even make us better drivers.
383	385	1	2	"Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. The invention of computers is the most significant event of the @DATE1. Professor @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION3 states that ""the invention of computers has led to hundreds, even thousands, of new discoveries."" Just this week, @CAPS3 have discovered @NUM1 new drugs that could potentially cure cancer. A report from @ORGANIZATION1 reveals that @PERCENT1 of Fortune @NUM2 companies are solely run by computer programs, and the remaining @PERCENT2 plan to switch to computer - based operations by the end of @DATE2.  For personal use, computers are extremely useful. They teach hand - eye coordination, improve reflexes and reaction time. Video games available on computers can enhance physical skills. Flight and driving simulators are widely available in the consumer market. Flight schools require students to complete hundreds of hours of flight simulations, and some driving schools have students learn in simulators first. Games like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 improve reflexes as players need to think quickly and dodge objects, thus enhancing reaction time. These programs help us deal with real - life obstacles and encourage creative thinking.  Computers also allow us to learn about faraway places and people. We can explore different cultures and religions without traveling. This helps us understand and relate to people from other parts of the world. As @CAPS4 said, ""We are afraid of only what is different from us. If we know about different people and places, we have nothing to fear.""  Finally, computers enable global communication. Through platforms like @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS6, we can stay in touch with friends who have moved away. @ORGANIZATION2 reported that out of its @NUM4 million users, @NUM5 million have friends in different countries. I experienced this myself. When I was @NUM6, my friend @PERSON2 moved to @LOCATION1. We lost touch until @ORGANIZATION2 was invented. One day, we found each other online and started video - chatting regularly. These programs help us make new friends and reconnect with old ones.  In conclusion, the birth of computers has brought about vast improvements in society. People can communicate with friends abroad as if they were in the same room. Business meetings can be held via computer programs like @CAPS8, and government officials can interact with leaders worldwide. Despite some concerns about the impact on communication, I believe computers are an effective tool that everyone should have access to."
384	386	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I am convinced that computers have a positive impact on people. They allow us to communicate with people in different countries in an instant, send emails quickly, and get immediate answers to our questions on @LOCATION1.  When a relative goes on vacation in a foreign country and forgets their cellphone but has a laptop, we can use email to stay in touch. We can also use video chat on a computer to have real - time conversations.  Email is a great alternative to traditional mail. With regular mail, we often have to wait two to three days for a reply, and there's a risk of the letter getting lost. In contrast, the waiting time for an email reply depends on the recipient's typing speed, usually @NUM1 to @NUM2 seconds. There's an 83% chance that an email will reach its destination. If it gets lost, we'll be notified and can resend it.  @LOCATION1 is a valuable resource. Whenever we're curious about something, we can go there and get an instant answer. We can ask any question, from the price of something in @LOCATION2 to complex math problems like the square root of pi or the value of @NUM3.  In conclusion, computers are beneficial as they facilitate international communication, offer a reliable email service, and provide instant access to information.
385	387	1	2	Dear editor, @CAPS1, did you know that @PERCENT1 of children who spend most of their time on the computer and don't exercise can develop weight problems and blood disorders? This is just one of the negative impacts of computer technology advancements. If these advances continue, the number of affected children will likely increase, and other problems may arise.  Obesity is a serious consequence of excessive computer use. It can constrict vital organs and lead to blood disorders such as high blood pressure and diabetes, which can ultimately cause a heart attack and even death.  Weak immune systems are also common among computer - addicted individuals. I have a friend who is often on the computer and has a weak immune system. He misses at least @NUM1 day of school per week, which results in poor grades.  It's quite evident that the advancement of computer technology is a bad idea. Children are becoming obese, and the development of a weak immune system is a controllable issue.  I urge you to write an article highlighting these health problems caused by technology to raise awareness and prevent the further spread of these issues.
386	388	1	2	In today's world, hardly anyone remains untouched by the influence of computers. While some hold the view that computers are detrimental due to people spending excessive time on them, the reality is that computers play an indispensable role in our daily lives. Computers facilitate global communication and enable us to make a positive impact on the world. For instance, we can communicate with people worldwide and send donations to areas in need, such as @LOCATION1 or @CAPS1. This ability to connect and contribute can transform the lives of those in third - world countries. In the educational realm, computers are invaluable. Students with poor handwriting can type their reports and print them. They can also conduct research for essays with ease, accessing information through search engines. Moreover, if a student forgets their homework, they can retrieve it from the school website. Businesses also rely heavily on computers. When files are lost or misplaced, workers can access backup files. Ordering supplies is often done online, and companies use email to disseminate information about upcoming events. It's true that some individuals may overuse computers, but this is a personal choice. Many jobs would be unfeasible without computers. Therefore, it's evident that computers, when used appropriately, are both good and extremely useful.
387	389	1	2	Dear newspaper, I've read your article on people's opinions regarding the impacts of computers. In my view, having computers is an excellent thing. They enable us to communicate with distant others rapidly and offer vast learning opportunities. Additionally, they enhance hand - eye coordination. One of the primary advantages of computers is the ease of communication. Without them, it would be nearly impossible to interact with people from far - off places so effortlessly. With webcams, we can even see each other during conversations. Platforms like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, webcams, or simple social media comments on Facebook or MySpace are all viable communication methods. Among them, @CAPS2 or webcams are perhaps the quickest and most exciting options. Secondly, computers are a treasure trove of knowledge. There are countless websites that provide a wealth of up - to - date information. It's far more convenient to search for information on the internet than to sift through numerous books. The internet offers dictionaries, news, weather forecasts, historical data, and maps. With all these resources, one may even find books redundant. Finally, computers help develop hand - eye coordination. When we start using computers at a young age, we may not type very fast initially. However, with the advancement of technology, there are touch - screen and wireless devices. As we progress from looking down at the keyboard to looking at the screen while typing, our hand - eye coordination significantly improves. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are an essential part of daily life. They are a convenient means of communication, a great learning tool, and a facilitator of hand - eye coordination development in children.
388	390	1	2	I am convinced that computers bring numerous benefits to our lives. They allow us to interact with others, stay connected with distant family members, assist with our studies, and provide easy access to information. Computers have revolutionized communication. In a world where family and friends are often geographically separated, computers enable us to communicate effortlessly. We can email, instant - message, play games, and even use social media platforms to stay in touch. We can also use video - conferencing tools like webcams to see each other, which makes the interaction more personal. In terms of entertainment, computers offer a wide range of activities for children. After a long day at school and sports practice, kids can relax by playing games, chatting with friends, watching movies, or uploading pictures on the computer. This not only provides a form of relaxation but also keeps them safe at home, away from potential negative influences. Computers are also extremely useful for educational purposes. They allow students to type essays and projects with ease. Moreover, search engines like Google and Bing provide accurate and comprehensive information on various topics, making the research process much more efficient. It's important to note that while computers can be a source of distraction if used excessively, they are still an indispensable part of our lives. We have the power to control how much time we spend on them. In conclusion, computers are of great significance, making our lives easier and more convenient. Their benefits are undeniable, and they will continue to play a crucial role in our future.
389	391	1	2	The use of computers is highly beneficial to society, and more and more people are recognizing this fact as of @DATE1. These virtual portals of information and communication are not only helpful but also environmentally friendly. Consider the environmental impact. Paper production involves cutting down trees and a wasteful manufacturing process. If more people used computers, we could save countless trees. For example, I once completed a school assignment by looking up information on the computer, typing it, and emailing it to my teacher, without using a single piece of paper. Computers also offer a fast and efficient way to access information. Instead of spending hours searching through books, we can simply type our query into a search engine and get the information we need almost instantly. A poll at @CAPS2 @CAPS3 school showed that @PERCENT1 of students who use computers for research get faster and more accurate results. Moreover, computers are becoming increasingly energy - efficient. Many people around the world use solar panels to power their computers, making them an eco - friendly option. While it's true that excessive computer use can cause distractions and headaches, the future of technology is centered around computers. In the near future, we'll be ordering food from restaurants using computers or touch - screens. In conclusion, despite some minor drawbacks, computers are an amazing invention. They are a great alternative to the wasteful use of paper, offer quick access to information, and are an integral part of our future. We should embrace their use and make the most of their benefits.
390	392	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are essential in our lives for various reasons. They offer online education opportunities, help us reconnect with long - lost family and friends, and support students in their research. For individuals with mobility issues, computers are a gateway to education. Those who cannot attend regular schools can find free educational resources on the internet. Computers can assess their learning levels, much like a teacher, and allow them to study for tests. This empowers them to gain knowledge and improve their lives. Computers also play a crucial role in helping families and friends stay connected. Many people use computers to search for long - lost relatives or friends. They can chat through websites, find addresses and phone numbers, and even reunite in person. The internet has made it possible for people to fulfill their dreams of finding their loved ones. Students rely on computers for research. Without computers, they would struggle to access the information they need for projects. Computers expose students to historical figures and events they may not have known about otherwise, inspiring them to learn more about history. This helps improve their intelligence and academic performance. In summary, computers are indispensable. They are a lifeline for those with limited mobility, a means of connection for those with distant family and friends, and a valuable educational tool for students. Without computers, many people's dreams and futures would be severely impacted. Therefore, it's clear that we all need computers in our lives.
391	393	1	2	@ORGANIZATION1, technology is advancing significantly, and numerous inventions are emerging. However, shouldn't we be concerned that people are spending excessive time on technology? I know @CAPS1 is worried. Take computers, for example. They have the capability to connect to the internet and enable users to chat with people worldwide. This is what makes me anxious. In this essay, I will elaborate on why spending too much time on computers is detrimental. It is harmful because people neglect exercise, fail to appreciate nature, and reduce interaction with family and friends. Firstly, people are forgetting the importance of exercise. Exercise is crucial as it helps maintain fitness and good health. With the widespread use of computers, people become less physically active, leading to weight gain, elevated cholesterol levels, and increased stress. Secondly, they miss out on the beauty of nature. When people start using computers, they stop engaging in various activities. They no longer go outside to breathe fresh air. They become confined to a small space, focusing solely on the computer. They don't go camping or play outdoors; they do nothing but sit in front of the computer every day. Finally, a major problem is that they stop interacting with family and friends. When parents are on the computer, they pay little attention to their children. When teenagers are on the computer, they ignore their parents and friends, the people who care about them the most. They only care about themselves. @CAPS2, that's why I believe we should reduce our computer usage. For the following reasons: people stop exercising and maintaining fitness, they stop enjoying nature, and they stop interacting with family and friends. @CAPS2, what's your opinion?
392	394	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are highly beneficial. Most computers are portable, offering great convenience. Laptops, in particular, are mobile computers that can be easily carried anywhere. Many individuals own laptops, which they can use at home or take with them on the go. Computers are also a source of entertainment. During leisure time, users can play a variety of games or create videos. Moreover, computers provide a vast platform for research. The internet, a highly successful innovation, allows users to access a wealth of information. Students can use it to complete homework, and professionals can type up essays for work or school. In conclusion, the portability, entertainment value, and research capabilities of computers make them an essential and valuable tool in our lives.
393	395	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I believe people should exercise more instead of spending excessive time on the computer. Computers, along with junk food like McDonald's, are significant contributors to the high obesity rate in our nation. I'm a computer enthusiast myself, but I'm also aware of the negative impacts. I would stay on the computer all night if I could, but I don't want to neglect my health. I usually go to bed at @NUM1 and limit my computer use to one or two hours, depending on whether I'm working on a project. Reducing computer time can make life more enjoyable. Instead of sitting indoors, people can go outside to play sports like football, hang out with friends, or have a good time with family. In conclusion, if people limit their computer use to an hour and a half, the obesity rate could decline. Additionally, this would also contribute to energy conservation and help protect our planet.
394	396	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I think it's acceptable for people worldwide to use computers. The reason is that many people rely on computers for various important purposes, such as handling emergencies. In @ORGANIZATION1, students use computers to access social media platforms like MySpace and Facebook, where they can chat with friends, family, and even people from all over the world. Some also use these platforms to communicate with relatives living in different states. However, there is a significant drawback. Some individuals use computers to sell drugs, which is extremely harmful to society. This is one reason why some people become overly attached to their computers. Drug dealers use the internet to conduct illegal transactions, and this behavior is not something that most people would engage in offline. I know this because my friends are smart and would never participate in such illegal activities. In conclusion, it's okay for people to use computers as long as they have an internet connection. However, it's up to drug dealers and other bad actors to decide whether they want to continue their illegal behavior. Eventually, they will be caught and face the consequences. Computers are meant for entertainment and useful activities, not for illegal drug sales.
395	397	1	2	Nowadays, the technological industry is dominating modern society, captivating users and causing virtual addiction. What's the benefit of this? Recent studies have shown that those immersed in the online world are less social and more prone to depression. Additionally, sitting in front of a computer all day means not burning calories, leading to unnecessary weight gain that could easily be avoided. Going to the library can be just as, if not more, useful than using the internet. Moreover, there are various negative impacts associated with computers, such as trojans, cyberbullying, and exposure to violence. In essence, computers can be a waste of money. Families are becoming less connected, and the culprit could be the computer on the desk. Instead of socializing with family and friends, computer addicts choose to sit and engage in online activities. A @LOCATION1 woman expressed her concern about her two teenage children's computer obsession, stating that they spend hours on it every day. The article I read the other day mentioned that most depressed people admitted to being online for at least @NUM1 hours a day. This shows that computers can be misused. We should either remove computers from our children's lives or limit their use. Studies indicate that @PERCENT1 of people who spend most of their day online are either overweight or on the verge of it. Instead of experiencing the real world firsthand, they rely on online information and others' opinions. Overweight people are at a higher risk of health problems and premature aging. In a library, people are more focused on their tasks. The reason is that the internet is too expensive and distracting. In a library, there is less chance of getting into trouble, playing online games, or accessing inappropriate content. Libraries also offer more reliable and credible sources for study. You can go to the library with family or friends and even get tutoring. Computers lack these advantages. I used to be a computer addict myself, and I know the negative effects it can have. Now, I've overcome my addiction and am more sociable and healthier. I'm @NUM2 pounds and in great shape, and I've even joined the school's cheer team. I often go to the library to study. In conclusion, we should limit our computer use and choose the library as a better alternative for a more fulfilling and healthy life.
396	398	1	2	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2, when we reflect on the technological advancements over the years, it becomes evident that they have significantly influenced the present - day and people. The crucial question is whether these advancements are for the better or if they will take a turn for the worse. Today, I will discuss technology and explain why I believe it is having a poor impact on society. People are spending less time exercising and enjoying nature. They are constantly on the computer, neglecting their social lives. They fail to realize how much they are harming themselves. The number of obese people, especially children, is increasing daily. This is due to a lack of exercise as some individuals are too preoccupied with responding to texts, talking on the phone, and playing unnecessary video games. Not only are they physically harming themselves, but they are also missing out on the wonders of nature. The @ORGANIZATION1 is one of the most beautiful countries in the world; people should take advantage of this. Moreover, without proper exercise, one's heart is at serious risk. Even simple activities like jumping jacks or sit - ups can contribute to better heart health. Our parents and grandparents brought us into this world, supported us in difficult times, and would do anything to protect us. However, technology is pushing them away. Many people text at the dinner table while their family is trying to have a conversation, stay in their rooms playing ""fun"" games, and hide behind the screen instead of socializing with those who matter most: family and friends. Although friends may be more understanding, they still notice when we are too busy with our computers to meet up. No one can live without friends, and friends need us. In conclusion, technology is corrupting the minds of human beings, and this needs to stop. As I've said, we should be healthy and happy and spend enough time with the people we care about. Who knows, maybe they can make us happier than our electronic devices. So, fellow citizens, get up from that desk chair, turn off your electronic devices, and re - enter the real world."
397	399	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I disagree with the view that computers have a negative impact on people. In fact, computers are extremely beneficial in schools, workplaces, and at home. The absence of computers would have a more adverse effect on people than their presence. For students, computers are an absolute necessity. They are used for research, typing essays, letters, and various other written works. This applies to the entire society. In almost every school across the country, students use computers daily. Personally, I have to log on to a computer to type an essay for a class at least twice a week, and some @ORGANIZATION1 students do so even more frequently. For example, my @CAPS1 teacher assigns numerous essays and letters. She has repeatedly stated that she won't grade work with poor handwriting. Using computers eliminates the issue of unreadable handwriting preventing grading. I understand the argument that computers reduce the need for handwriting and may cause people to lose this ability. However, with the advanced technology of computers and the precision of typing, handwriting may no longer be required in the future. Computers also make research incredibly easy. Teachers assign research projects to students at all grade levels and in all classes. Traditional research methods such as using books are slow and ineffective. Using a computer to search for information is fast, simple, and yields better results. In the workplace, computers are equally useful. For instance, someone may need to create a PowerPoint presentation. Not only does the computer have the PowerPoint software, which is an effective way to set up projects, but it also allows for comprehensive research in one place. This simplifies the process of gathering information and eliminates the need to search through books and consult others. While it is true that some people may spend too much time on computers, most learn to balance their time. Overall, the benefits of keeping computers far outweigh the drawbacks. Writing essays, letters, typing for projects, and conducting research are all faster and easier with computers. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on society, and we should embrace their use.
398	400	1	2	Dear Newspaper Readers, @CAPS1 computers have significantly transformed the way people use technology, bringing about numerous changes in our society. They enable people to access information more rapidly than ever before. People can also communicate with friends, especially on popular websites. In schools, particularly in colleges, computers are widely used. The use of @CAPS1 computers in education is of great significance. When my grandparents were in school, they had no knowledge of computers. They relied on prior knowledge, teachers, and dictionaries. We are extremely fortunate to have computers in schools today. My @CAPS1 teacher often assigns essays and letters, and having computers to type on ensures that our work can be graded even if our handwriting is poor. @CAPS1 computers offer numerous benefits, especially in terms of learning about the world. When it comes to online communication, @CAPS2 is a popular choice. Approximately @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people have @CAPS2. People use it to talk to friends they enjoy interacting with. Even people outside Canada have @CAPS2, which is quite surprising. Communicating with people in different countries is an amazing experience and provides an opportunity to make new friends. This also has an impact on people's lifestyles. In high school, teenagers can choose to take specific computer - related classes. These classes are beneficial as they help students improve their typing skills, which is especially useful in college when there is a large amount of typing to be done in a short time. I know people who stay up late to complete their papers, but taking computer classes can help them type faster and get more sleep. In conclusion, I firmly believe that @CAPS1 computers have a positive impact on our society. They have dramatically changed our lives for the better. Thank you for reading this letter, and I hope you will consider these points.
399	401	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 paper editor, people are spending too much time at home using computers, which is worsening their lives. We should establish a ""computer - free day"" where everyone goes outside and exercises. Exercising regularly can improve our physical health and help us better understand the world. The more we exercise, the stronger we become. People love computers because they can communicate with friends and play games. However, we also need to go outside. I sometimes find myself spending too much time on the computer and not getting enough exercise. I hope to change this and spend more time outdoors. We can still use computers, but we should limit our usage and spend more time outside. For kids, computer usage should be restricted to two or three hours a day. Currently, many kids spend far more time on computers, which is not good. They should go outside instead. In conclusion, we need to strike a balance between using computers and spending time outdoors to lead healthier and more fulfilling lives."
400	402	1	2	Dear local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers offer excellent benefits to people. Firstly, they enable family and friends to communicate over long distances. Secondly, typing on a computer enhances hand - eye coordination. Thirdly, they allow people to learn about far - away places. Lastly, they provide students with the opportunity to research topics they are studying. Researcher @PERSON1 stated that nearly @PERCENT1 of families live far apart. Computers facilitate communication among these families, whether through instant messaging or webcam chats. Moreover, @PERCENT2 of these geographically separated families use computers to communicate. Typing on a computer is also beneficial for hand - eye coordination. Some people type without looking or are very slow, but regular computer typing can improve this skill. Good hand - eye coordination is useful in many aspects of life, such as playing sports or performing simple tasks like throwing something in the trash. Computers also open up the world for learning. For example, in the third grade, I had to research hammerhead sharks. Teachers often ask students to look up words or topics on the computer. It is a convenient and effective way to access information about far - away places. In conclusion, I hope that my three reasons - facilitating family and friend communication, improving hand - eye coordination, and enabling research - have convinced you that computers are a positive addition to our lives. Thank you for taking the time to read what I had to say, and I hope you will consider these points.
401	403	1	2	I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. They play a crucial role in teaching hand - eye coordination, enabling individuals to learn about distant places and people, and facilitating online communication. Given these numerous benefits, it is only logical that computers should be an integral part of our lives. When using a computer, one has to keep an eye on the screen while simultaneously operating the mouse or keyboard. This constant interaction between the eyes and hands enhances hand - eye coordination, much like in sports where one has to coordinate visual perception with physical movement. For instance, in baseball, a player needs to watch the ball while moving their arm to catch it. Computers also serve as a vast source of knowledge. Through various websites, we can gain information about far - off places. If there's an earthquake in a particular region, we can access detailed reports and images on the computer. Moreover, if we're planning a vacation, we can learn about the destination's culture, weather, and attractions. We can also discover information about famous people. All it takes is a simple search on a computer to learn about our favorite celebrities. In terms of communication, computers have revolutionized the way we interact. Platforms like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 allow us to stay in touch with friends and family, especially those living in distant locations. Email is another essential tool for both teachers and professionals to handle business matters. At school, students can receive additional learning materials and engage in different activities through the computer. Computers also offer entertainment options. We can play games and even explore nature virtually. They are an excellent means for learning and socializing. If you want your child to learn and have fun, you should recognize the positive influence of computers. So, after considering all these aspects, it's clear that computers have a positive effect on people.
402	404	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I'm of the opinion that computers have a detrimental effect on people and society. Firstly, many children and students waste a significant amount of time on the computer. I've noticed that a lot of kids come home from school and immediately start playing on the computer instead of getting things done. Take my cousin as an example; he spends every day on the computer, just wasting his time. Secondly, children should be using the computer for studying, not for playing video games or visiting unauthorized websites. More than @NUM1 students and children are on the internet playing games and doing the same mundane things every day. I've seen countless kids engrossed in computer games. Thirdly, students won't learn anything if they waste their time on the computer. The computer is a tool for studying, but many students don't use their time wisely. Over @PERCENT1 of students fail classes because they spend too much time on the computer and not enough time studying. People should also be spending more time with their friends and family. Friends are extremely important as they care about and love us like family. But if we waste our time on the computer, we won't get to know our friends well. For example, my acquaintance is always on the computer and never goes to see her friends. Her friends stop coming to her because she only cares about the computer. Family is also more important than being on the computer. They care about us, and we should at least spend some time with them. Many families have stopped spending time together because the computer has become a priority. Helping the community is also a worthy goal. However, many people have stopped participating in community services. I've seen trash on the grounds because people don't care. Finally, going out and playing sports to stay fit is very important. But more than @NUM2 people have stopped playing sports because of the computer. Playing sports is fun and beneficial for our health. In conclusion, the over - use of computers has a negative impact on our lives, and we should limit our time on them and focus more on the important aspects of life.
403	405	1	2	According to a survey in @LOCATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people agree that the use of computers benefits society, and I wholeheartedly share this view. Computers have a positive effect on people for several reasons. One significant benefit is the development of hand - eye coordination. When a person uses a computer, they must keep their eyes on the screen while operating the mouse or keyboard. This requires a high level of coordination. Some may argue that excessive computer use means less physical exercise, but this is a fallacy. The hand - eye coordination learned on the computer can improve skills in sports. In baseball, for example, a player has to watch the ball and move their arm simultaneously to catch it, which is similar to the coordination required when using a computer. @PERCENT1 of teachers at @ORGANIZATION2 believe that computers are a great educational tool. They provide access to information about far - away places and people. With a computer, one can go to a search site, type in the name of a place anywhere in the world, and instantly get detailed information and pictures. This is a significant advantage in today's technology - advancing society. Teachers can assign projects about different countries or people, and students can easily gather information on the computer. This not only helps students learn but can also inspire them to explore these far - off places. In addition, @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people have some form of online communication. Computers allow people to stay in touch with others, especially those living far away. Some may claim that spending time on the computer reduces time spent with family and friends, but this is not true. In modern society, with family members and friends often living in different locations, the computer provides an easy way to stay connected. For example, when a child goes to college far from home, the family can use the computer to chat and keep in touch. In conclusion, computers benefit society by teaching hand - eye coordination, facilitating learning about distant places and people, and enabling online communication. In our modern, technology - driven world, computers have a positive and indispensable role.
404	406	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that the effects of computers on people are positive. In a rush and unsure if you need rain boots? Simply check the computer. Without computers, most offices would struggle to run their businesses. Keeping everything in files is cumbersome, especially in schools. Teachers store students' grades on computers; otherwise, they'd need an enormous filing cabinet. I understand that some people think computers have a negative impact. They might argue that it takes time away from nature, friends, and family. However, many people take their laptops to the local park on warm days and sit under a tree to use the computer. Students often do their homework there to relax. For those with family or friends in other states, who may not have the house number or time for a long conversation, email and social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace are great options. A local shop owner, @PERSON1, said, ""I'm so busy I barely have time for myself. When I want to say hello to my sister in @LOCATION1, I usually do it on Facebook because she loves to talk."" I recall one morning before school when I was in a hurry and had no idea what to wear. I checked the local news website for the weather forecast, and I'm glad I did. Otherwise, I would have been caught in a downpour without an umbrella. Computers are also useful for keeping up with the news or just relaxing and playing games. So, if you're wondering about the weather for a park study session with a partner, go ahead. But don't forget to email her first since you lost her phone number. In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits and have a positive impact on our lives."
405	407	1	2	Dear Local @CAPS1, I am convinced that computers have a positive effect on people. There are multiple ways in which computers bring about these positive impacts. Firstly, computers serve as a powerful tool for bringing people together and facilitating interaction. They enable people to communicate with one another. Through the internet, people can send emails; while a traditional letter might take days to reach its recipient, an email is delivered instantly. Social media platforms like Facebook also connect people. When friends can't meet in person, they can simply log on to their computers. Webcams on computers allow for face - to - face conversations, enabling people to see facial expressions and hear voices, which is more engaging than a phone call or a letter. Secondly, computers are a vast source of knowledge. Whenever we want to find something out or have a question, the internet is at our disposal. It provides access to a wealth of information that might not be readily available from other sources. We can view pictures and videos of places and things we may never see in real life. For example, if we want to see a picture of @CAPS2, we can easily search for it on the computer. Videos can also be a source of entertainment, like watching something funny to brighten our day. If we miss a favorite show, we can find it on the computer. Lastly, computers allow us to perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible without them. When a teacher assigns a paper, typing it on the computer is much more convenient than using a typewriter. If a mistake is made, we can easily correct it without having to re - type the whole thing. Computers also enable us to play music by inserting a CD. In conclusion, computers benefit society and have a positive effect on people. They enhance social interaction, facilitate learning, and enable us to perform various tasks. I hope you agree that computers are a valuable asset to society.
406	408	1	2	I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on people. The use of computers affects a person's time as they may sit for hours playing online games. It also impacts their health because they don't get fresh air or spend time with family. Moreover, it affects their education as the time that could be used for homework is spent on the computer.  Using the computer wastes a person's time. Instead of being outside playing or doing household chores, or helping family and friends, one sits there for hours. All the time that could have been used for something productive is wasted because of the computer.  Computers also harm health. Being inside a room without fresh air and lacking exercise is bad for the body. It can also affect emotional health. When on the computer, people don't interact socially, which may lead to a loss of connections with friends and family. As connections are lost, the reliance on the computer may increase, worsening the situation.  Finally, computers affect education. Instead of doing homework and studying for an important test, one may be on the computer learning nothing. This can lead to poor academic performance. I once pushed my homework aside to use the computer, and my grades dropped significantly.  In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on time, health, and education. Although computers can be used for educational purposes, humans often prefer fun. I hope this helps you realize the negative effects of computers.
407	409	1	2	Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1. I am @NUM1 years old and attend a @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 called @ORGANIZATION1. I am a bright student, and in my opinion, people benefit from using computers. You should continue reading this essay as I will present @NUM2 good reasons for this view.  Computers teach hand - eye coordination and enable people to learn about distant places and individuals. For instance, when I use the computer for research, I can learn about new places and people. Additionally, @CAPS2.V on @CAPS3 @NUM3 states that people learn about far - away places and people on the internet @PERCENT1 of the time.  Computers also allow people to communicate online. Every day when I visit my Facebook on the computer, I can talk to my friends and others. According to computers.org, @PERCENT2 of the time, people can talk to others online.  Furthermore, computers help students obtain information for projects. When I use the @ORGANIZATION1 computers, I can gather information, such as about @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 govina. A magazine on computers indicates that kids get a lot of information for projects @PERCENT2 of the time.  In conclusion, people benefit from using computers as they teach hand - eye coordination, provide the ability to learn about far - away places and people, allow online communication, and help students get information for projects. These are the @NUM2 reasons why I believe people benefit from using computers. I hope the local newspaper can make this view more believable.
408	410	1	2	"Dear editor, computers are a waste of time. When kids return home from school, they put aside their homework and immediately turn to the computer. Computers are wasting the minds of young children, and some don't even bother to look outside because they are engrossed in the computer.  If there is only one computer at home and no time limits, it can cause conflicts between siblings or adults. For example, if one sibling has been using the computer for a long time and the other wants to use it without parental supervision, there may be fighting and yelling. Also, if someone does something improper on the computer that messes it up, the person responsible for fixing it can get very angry.  Parents often tell their children to ""have a nice day outside,"" but many people waste the day sitting on the computer with their favorite snacks. They are too lazy to get up, go for a walk, or play in the snow.  My @NUM1 @NUM2 - year - old twin brothers like to play shooting games on the computer. They enjoy ""killing people"" in these games, and I'm sure many boys of their age feel the same. These games teach kids nothing useful; instead, they teach them how to kill people or animals or engage in dangerous activities that could harm themselves.  In conclusion, I hope this letter shows that computers can harm others, waste people's lives, and have a negative impact. Instead of spending time with family at the park, people are on the computer. Computers generally have a negative effect on people, which is not good."
409	411	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 of my local newspaper, while more and more people use computers, not everyone believes this benefits society. Computers can be harmful to users' eyes, lead to less interaction with ""real"" people, and result in an unhealthy lifestyle.  Computers are detrimental to eyesight. Between @DATE1 @DATE2 and @DATE3, doctors observed nearly a @PERCENT1 increase in eye problems that required surgery, glasses, or contacts, which can be directly linked to the overuse of personal computers. Studies show that those who use computers for over four hours a day may have severely deteriorated vision by the age of @NUM1. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 also stated that overuse of computers has a negative impact on workers' eyesight. Although work may be done faster, the cost of medical treatments exceeds the additional profit from modernization.  Computers reduce face - to - face interaction. Research indicates that people learn less about their peers through computer - mediated communication. The @ORGANIZATION1 found that there are roughly @PERCENT2 fewer conversations at social gatherings compared to @DATE1. Social relations professional @PERSON1 said that people lack understanding when they can't sense the emotions behind a person's words. Video chatting doesn't fully convey real feelings.  Computers also lead to an unhealthy lifestyle. Sitting indoors all day without fresh air is bad for the lungs and can cause breathing problems. According to @CAPS4's @CAPS5, the average person gets @PERCENT3 fewer workouts, likely due to computer overuse. The obesity rate has risen from almost zero to over @NUM2 in the past ten @DATE1.  In conclusion, personal computers have a negative impact on society. They cause poor eyesight, reduce social interaction, and promote an unhealthy lifestyle. We should be aware of these issues and strive to make the world a better place."
410	412	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that using computers is beneficial. They can help with learning and saving the environment, and they can also contribute to human progress.  Computers are excellent learning tools. For example, if you need to write a report on the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 of the @CAPS2 but have little knowledge about it, a simple Google search can provide hundreds or even thousands of entries. You can learn about any subject at any time on a computer, including the computer's own history.  Computers can also help save the environment. Paper comes from trees, and cutting down trees harms the environment by depleting oxygen and destroying habitats. If more people use computers, less paper will be used. We can use computers to send documents, bring them to tax appointments, and even for schoolwork. Teachers can assign homework via email, and students can complete and return it electronically. Additionally, we can use less fossil fuel by communicating via the internet, such as through Skype.  Moreover, computers can help us advance. They can assist in finding better medical treatments, more efficient travel methods, and improving daily life. With the help of computers, we may discover better ways to treat serious medical conditions like cancer and the common cold. They can also help find more efficient fuels or even develop teleportation devices and aid in space exploration. In daily life, we can imagine having a computer - controlled system that prepares a hot shower, breakfast, and work equipment in just five minutes.  In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits, from educational research to environmental protection and human progress. These are the reasons why I believe in the positive impact of computers.
411	413	1	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, in my view, computers are truly remarkable. I firmly believe that they have a profound impact on people's lives. There are three key reasons to support this stance. First, a vast number of jobs in the state or nation rely on computers. Statistically, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 jobs utilize a computer or computer - related hardware. When you consider occupations such as teaching or factory work, it becomes evident that these jobs would be nearly impossible to perform without computers. Over the past @NUM3 years, we have witnessed numerous technological advancements, and a valuable lesson we've learned is to make the most of our computer time as it can expose us to new knowledge.  Second, compared to @NUM3 years ago, we now have a plethora of highly useful search engines. In the @NUM5's, books were the sole source of information. While reading is an excellent activity, using a computer to find information is significantly faster and more convenient. All you need to do is visit @ORGANIZATION2, type in your query, and within about @NUM6 seconds, you'll get around @NUM7 links to relevant websites. It eliminates the need to search through a table of contents; just a simple click on a link suffices.  Third, computers are extremely helpful at home. In the state of @LOCATION1, approximately @PERCENT1 of people own a laptop or a computer. This is far from being a negative aspect as computers can assist with various tasks, including helping with children, cooking, and organizing. For instance, if you're unsure about the start time of ""@CAPS3's"" friends' birthday party, you can easily ask his mom on @CAPS4. Or, if you need a dinner recipe, you can find it on cooks.com.  In conclusion, having a computer in one's life is highly beneficial because of their widespread use in jobs, the abundance of search resources, and their usefulness at home. Undoubtedly, computers have an outstanding impact on people's lives."
412	414	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I'm convinced that computers have a negative influence on people. I hold this view because people often become so engrossed in computers that they neglect other aspects of life.  Take my friend, for example. He loves spending long hours on the computer. For some, there isn't much variety in computer activities. People who are glued to the computer miss out on going out with friends to places like the mall. While some may use the computer for important tasks, it often takes over their lives.  Moreover, when people are on the computer, they don't enjoy themselves fully. I know from personal experience that sitting on the internet all day isn't fulfilling. On a beautiful day when the family goes to the beach, those focused on the computer won't want to join and enjoy the moment. Sometimes, they'll waste the whole day on the computer and have nothing else to do afterward. Life is meant to be enjoyed, and excessive computer use can prevent that.  Finally, doctors warn that constantly staying on the computer isn't good for health. One should exercise regularly instead of just sitting around. Prolonged computer use can also harm the eyes as you're constantly staring at the screen. It's essential to engage in healthy activities to take care of our bodies.  In conclusion, I firmly agree that computers have a negative impact on people. They prevent us from having fun, enjoying life, and maintaining good health. I hope this letter can be published in the newspaper.
413	415	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, computers are ubiquitous. You can use them to learn or play games. However, despite their widespread presence, I believe they do not have a positive effect on people, mainly due to the risks of privacy invasion and addiction.  Computers are everywhere - at home, school, in cars, at work, and in hotels. Their prevalence is indeed helpful as many modern - day systems are computer - driven. In the future, we'll see even more of them. Businesses rely heavily on computers, and it's likely that they'll become even more automated. The computer industry also creates jobs in manufacturing, programming, repair, and supervision.  But the safety of using computers is often overestimated. On chatting websites, you could encounter dangerous individuals, such as child molesters. They can obtain your address, look at your house on a website, or even get your house blueprints. This puts you at risk of a potentially life - altering and terrifying encounter.  Another issue is the addiction to computer games. There are various types of games, whether virtual - world games or simple, meaningless ones. They are so addictive that you might plan to play for @NUM1 minutes but end up playing for @NUM2 hours. Once you start, it's easy to get trapped.  In conclusion, although computers have their advantages, the risks of privacy invasion and addiction mean that they do not have an overall positive effect on people. People need to be aware of these issues and know when to limit their computer use to avoid drastic changes in their lives.
414	416	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that we should reduce our reliance on computers. The main reason is that excessive computer use can cause severe damage to our eyes.  Sitting in front of a computer all day also means a lack of exercise. You'd just sit there like a couch potato, and over the course of a year, you'd likely gain a lot of weight. It's not a healthy lifestyle.  Moreover, when you're constantly on the computer, you miss out on the beauty of nature. You won't be able to see the trees, flowers, and wild animals. And without going outside, you won't get any fresh air.  Finally, computers can also isolate us from our friends and family. You won't have the opportunity to spend time with them, to see how they've grown or changed.  In conclusion, based on these reasons, I believe that we should cut down on computer use to protect our health, enjoy nature, and maintain good relationships with our loved ones.
415	417	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing to express my opinion on the positive effects of computers on people. I believe that computers have a significant and beneficial impact on our lives.  Computers are indispensable in various places. Hotels use them to manage guest information and activate room keys. Restaurants rely on them to generate bills. Hospitals store patient files on computers, making it easier for doctors to access and understand the information. Schools use computers to neatly store students' grades and allow students to type up papers.  Computers can also be a source of employment. You can work on fixing them, installing @ORGANIZATION1 programs or apps, or maintaining websites. Even large companies like @MONTH1 and @ORGANIZATION1 depend on computers for their operations.  Although some people may not get enough time outdoors due to computer use, computers help us earn money and achieve success in life. Once we have financial stability, we can then enjoy outdoor activities.  In conclusion, computers have a far - reaching impact on schools, the community, stores, and people's lives in general. Their benefits in terms of organization, work, and income generation make them an essential part of modern society.
416	418	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION2, I am @PERSON1 from @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. I believe it would be beneficial for your understanding of the impact of @ORGANIZATION1 computer usage throughout @LOCATION1 to hear from a young teen. At my age, people are highly dependent on computers. They can be entertained by online games, communicate with friends and family, and stay informed about global events. Although not everyone benefits from having a computer, most of the time, people are satisfied and gain advantages from using them. Firstly, computers have a positive impact as they offer entertainment. Whether it's playing online games or participating in a fantasy sports league, there are diverse entertainment options. Besides non - educational activities, there are numerous educational websites on the internet where children can learn. In my personal life, I often use @CAPS2, an online game website, and am involved in fantasy football teams. My younger brother, Parker, spends hours on certain websites. Even though he may seem glued to the computer screen, he is learning. Experts claim that children around the world learn more from computers than from textbooks or teachers because computer screens capture people's attention. Since learning is crucial, if spending an hour in front of a computer can improve a child's learning, it is worthwhile. Secondly, computers facilitate communication with friends and family. My brother is attending college at @ORGANIZATION1, and since we don't see him often, our family uses a program called @ORGANIZATION4 to video - chat with him. An online poll on @DATE1 asked how people regularly communicate with friends or family. Sixty - three percent of the votes indicated that people communicate via computer most of the time, 32% said over the phone, and about 16% said in person. This shows the prevalence of computer - based communication through platforms like Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. Lastly, computers help people access news from around the world. At my house, every time I open the internet, there is breaking news about the war in @LOCATION6, devastation in @LOCATION5, and more. A few months ago, a class at @ORGANIZATION3 made a pie - chart and found that 56% of their classmates got world news from computers. It's not just students at @ORGANIZATION3; most people get news from the internet. Just the other night, our waiter from @LOCATION4 said he gets all his news about his hometown from the internet. In conclusion, based on the reasons stated above, it is evident that the impact of computers on people is mostly positive. People can be entertained, communicate with loved ones, and stay informed about global events. As mentioned in the first paragraph, not all effects are positive, but most are.
417	419	1	2	The local newspaper has asked for my opinion on how computers affect people. Computers do have an impact. People can meet new individuals, learn about different places, and communicate with friends. People can meet new people from all corners of the world. Through @CAPS1 or email, they can maintain contact with these new acquaintances. It is a fast and novel way to expand one's social circle. Learning about new places has become extremely convenient with computers. By simply clicking on a webpage, one can access a wealth of information about new destinations. Computers offer a quicker means of learning, providing all the necessary details about the places one wishes to explore. Computers also enable easy communication with friends. There are numerous social websites where people can interact. Instead of waiting until the next school day, one can talk to friends at any time through the computer. In conclusion, computers have a significant and positive impact on people. They allow us to meet new people, learn about new places, and communicate with friends. In today's world, computers are capable of fulfilling all these functions. I hope this explanation of how computers affect people has been informative.
418	420	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 people, some claim that using a @CAPS1 offers no knowledge, but I firmly believe it enhances hand - eye coordination. A @CAPS1 is one of the most useful tools in the world. First, computers are filled with technologies that assist people daily. Regarding interaction with family and friends, platforms like Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter are popular. Approximately @PERCENT1 of teens and adults use MySpace and Facebook, and about @PERCENT2 of younger children use @CAPS2 to interact with friends. This technology is truly invaluable. Second, learning to use a @CAPS1 is essential, and it also improves hand - eye coordination. For learning, one can learn typing, write stories using @ORGANIZATION1 Word, and understand internet usage. In terms of hand - eye coordination, learning the functions of each key on the keyboard can enhance skills. Third, searching on Google or the @LOCATION1 is a common activity. Google is widely used to look up pictures for projects, labs, or any purpose. The online dictionary helps in understanding word meanings, which is useful for learning and doing homework. In conclusion, all these reasons are valid, and computers are the best sources on the planet. Everyone desires education, and computers play a crucial role in facilitating it. Computers are truly wonderful and beneficial to all.
419	421	1	2	"More and more people are using computers, but not everyone believes this is beneficial for society, and I am one of them. I think spending a reasonable amount of time on the computer can be beneficial, but computers have become a huge part of people's lives. I believe people should spend less time on the computer and more time exercising. This would make them much healthier. On the computer, one can view pictures of beautiful places, nature, and people. However, actually traveling and experiencing nature in person is far more rewarding than just looking at pictures. Another reason I am against excessive computer use is that it reduces interaction with family and friends. When people spend too much time on the computer, they seem to drift away from their loved ones, as if they are ""too busy"" to meet them. In conclusion, I strongly oppose the overuse of computers. People should balance their computer time with physical activity and social interaction to lead a healthier and more fulfilling life."
420	422	1	2	Some people are overly obsessed with computers. They often stay up all night playing games or using @CAPS1. These computer - lovers rarely interact with others and prefer to be alone. Those who go online to research may be deceived. Some information on the internet may be false or someone may be joking with them. If someone loves computers so much that they stay up all night and lose sleep, they may miss work and become tired. This is a sign of a problem, and they should stop. Staying up all night can cause one to miss important events, such as a child's party. If a child's parent misses such an event, the child may lose trust in them. When people stop interacting with others, they have a serious problem. They may only want to go out to get junk food and soda. Spending too much time on computers is bad for health. People may get cranky when their computer is taken away, which is a sign that they need to realize their excessive use and start exercising. Otherwise, they will become unhealthy. When writing a report, many people turn to the internet. While it can be a good source, it may also provide false information. One may end up turning in a poor report if they rely solely on the internet. Instead, a good book can be a more reliable source. In conclusion, the internet can be consuming, and people should not use it all the time. Perhaps computer manufacturers should shut down all computers worldwide for a week so that people can experience life without the internet and realize its proper usage.
421	423	1	2	I firmly believe that computers have a highly positive impact on people. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, computers are extremely educational. They are like a vast repository of information. Many teachers direct their students to the online realm for learning purposes. A significant number of individuals go online to research information for their school, job, or projects. Renowned websites brimming with information, such as @ORGANIZATION1, can only be accessed via a computer. For instance, envision having to conduct research using only books while living far from a library. The internet simplifies this research process as you have access to it at any time!   Secondly, computers make tasks remarkably easy. They offer numerous convenient ways to carry out various tasks. Without computers, interacting with people worldwide would be arduous. Almost all of the @CAPS4/@CAPS5 in the @LOCATION2, like @PERSON1's, @ORGANIZATION2, or @PERSON2's, have online websites to assist shoppers, and they even allow online purchases, which is far more convenient than traveling by car. I recall a time when I wanted to buy something from a store in @LOCATION1. I simply went online at home and made the purchase! Moreover, computers make activities like ordering @CAPS8, obtaining plane tickets, and seeking help much easier and save time!  Thirdly, computers are highly enjoyable. They provide a plethora of activities. For example, when you're bored, you can turn on the computer and search for a game you like. There's always a suitable game. Additionally, you can enjoy yourself by chatting with friends and family. You can stay in touch while relishing their company. Another appealing aspect is that people can send things to one another rapidly via email. Imagine not having a phone and needing to inform your husband on a business trip that your son is seriously ill. Sending a message by mail would take at least @NUM1 days, but by email, it only takes a few minutes. Thus, computers can also offer a certain level of safety to everyone!  In conclusion, computers have a very positive impact. They enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to search other countries, and facilitate communication with friends. Although some oppose this view, stating that computers can damage eyesight, lead to a lack of exercise, and pose risks to children, these issues can be easily addressed by limiting children's usage, monitoring their contacts, and encouraging them to participate in sports. Therefore, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact.
422	424	1	2	"I've noticed that there's a debate about whether computers benefit our society. Some think they are essential, but I firmly believe computers benefit society in three key ways: bringing people together, providing research resources, and enabling online shopping.  Computers bring people closer through the internet. Many families have relatives living far apart, making it difficult to stay in touch. However, with social networking sites like Facebook or MySpace, distant relatives can communicate and share pictures. The internet can also unite couples, as seen in those @CAPS3 harmony commercials that claim to have brought singles together.  Computers are also a great research tool. There are numerous search engines on the internet that lead to countless websites. Researching on the computer is much easier than going to the library. In the library, you have to find the right book, read most of it, and then locate the information. On the internet, you just type in your query, click, and you're done.  Online shopping, made possible by computers, offers a better shopping experience. It helps you avoid long lines at retail stores. For example, during ""@CAPS4 @DATE1"" sales, people often wait in line for hours at stores. Instead, you can buy products from the comfort of your home and have them delivered. Many websites also offer special online deals, allowing you to save money.  In conclusion, computers benefit society by bringing people together, providing research resources, and enabling online shopping. Our world would be vastly different without them."
423	425	1	2	Computers, while being a significant part of people's lives, have several negative impacts. Staring at a computer screen is detrimental to our health. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own computers, which could be a contributing factor to obesity in @LOCATION1. Spending long hours on the computer restricts people from going outside and exercising, preventing them from maintaining a healthy lifestyle and weight. Also, excessive computer use can strain the eyes, causing tiredness and drowsiness.  The information on the internet is often unreliable. Anyone with a computer can post on blogs, websites, or communication platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or MySpace. Not all posters are experts, and the information could be false. In contrast, books are more accurate as they are written by knowledgeable people and revised by editors. As more @CAPS1 rely on computers for information, they may be harming themselves in the long run.  We also rely on computers too much. Technical glitches can cause problems. For example, if you're writing a paper on a computer and it disappears due to a technical issue, you may not have time to fix it. My sixth - grade teacher once had a big French paper erased right before printing. This shows how over - dependence on computers can backfire.  In conclusion, computers are harming our society. They are unhealthy for our bodies, the information on them is often inaccurate, and our over - reliance on them leads to problems. I strongly advocate reducing our dependence on computers.
424	426	1	2	It has come to my attention that many individuals in our community utilize computers for positive purposes. Computers offer hand - eye coordination, which is beneficial in various real - life scenarios. For example, in a restaurant, a waiter or waitress needs to have good coordination to carry heavy trays. My mother, who works as a waitress, often tells me about the importance of this coordination. Also, good hand - eye coordination from computer use can improve reaction times while driving.  Some claim that computer use can lead to poor eyesight, but this is a personal consequence. Overall, the hand - eye coordination aspect is a positive effect of computers.  Computers also enable people to research far - away places. This is useful for students working on projects that require information from other countries. It can also inspire people to take trips. Although some worry that kids may access inappropriate websites or that they won't get enough exercise while researching, about @PERCENT1 of kids can still use the computer and then go out for exercise.  Finally, computers allow kids and adults to communicate with friends and family quickly. Instead of sending mail, which can take time, messages can be sent in @NUM1 minutes. Around @PERCENT2 of kids use computers to talk to their friends. However, there is a concern that kids may interact with strangers. To address this, a simple security question can be used to verify the identity of friends.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on young adults, children, and parents. They improve hand - eye coordination, facilitate research, and enhance communication. Although there are some valid concerns, such as eye problems, lack of exercise, and online safety, these can be managed by setting limits, monitoring children, and encouraging physical activity. Therefore, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact.
425	427	1	2	Computers are a remarkable technological advancement, but many people spend an excessive amount of time on them. This over - usage prevents them from experiencing the outside world.  Nature offers a unique experience that cannot be replicated online. When stuck at school or work, people miss out on the beauty of nature. Taking a break to explore the outdoors can relieve stress, especially when one wants to be alone. Some argue that nature can be explored online, but looking at pictures is no substitute for a first - hand experience. There's always something new to discover in nature.  Excessive computer use also leads to a lack of exercise. Fresh air and physical activity are essential for a healthy body. Moreover, it reduces the time spent with family and friends. Family is precious, and as we grow older, the time we have with them decreases. While online chatting is an option, meeting in person is a more fulfilling experience.  In conclusion, people are spending too much time on computers. They miss out on the wonders of nature, exercise, and quality time with loved ones. Although computers are useful for tasks like creating spreadsheets and writing essays, they shouldn't consume all our time. We should make an effort to balance our computer use and engage more with the real world.
426	428	1	2	Dear local newspaper, using the @CAPS1 is an effective way for people to interact with one another. However, it can also expose individuals to online risks, such as viewing inappropriate content, communicating with strangers, or encountering online predators.   Approximately @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 kids and adults access the computer either after school, work, or in the evening. They use it to check various things, and kids often use it for entertainment, chatting with friends on @ORGANIZATION1 programs, or playing online games. Three - fourths of kids under age @NUM1 go online more frequently than adults aged @NUM2 due to their interest in online content.   Some people claim they only use the computer briefly to check things, but this is often untrue. Most individuals spend several hours online, which can negatively impact their relationships with family and friends. @PERSON1 from the @ORGANIZATION1 stated that people spend excessive hours on the computer, and this behavior needs to stop for the sake of their loved ones. @PERSON1 also compared it to an addiction.   Do you really want to be addicted? It's better to step away from the screen and engage in activities with friends or family, like going to the @CAPS3, the beach, or taking a walk in the park. The experience of spending time with loved ones and having fun is truly unparalleled.
427	429	1	2	@ORGANIZATION1, computers are remarkable tools and a significant part of modern technology. Nearly every family owns one, and about @PERCENT1 of my class has access to computers. The widespread use of computers is due to their usefulness as a learning resource and their ability to facilitate communication with friends.   Although computers can be time - consuming, their long - term benefits outweigh this drawback. Firstly, they simplify tasks. Navigating between pages is quick and easy, which is especially beneficial for work. Instead of making multiple phone calls to clients, one can send emails to them all within minutes. Computers are also useful for schoolwork and vacation planning. They allow users to find great deals from travel agencies, which is crucial during a tough economic period when saving money is essential.   Secondly, computers are an excellent current learning resource. They provide access to up - to - date articles on various topics, unlike some books with outdated information. Additionally, there are affordable online schools, which are a great option for those who want to further their education while working.   Computers are also the ideal means of staying in touch with friends and family who are not nearby. While some may think that phones serve this purpose, not everyone has a phone. Through email, Facebook, AIM, and other platforms, people can easily communicate. For example, I use my computer to keep in touch with friends I haven't seen in a while.   In conclusion, computers are a valuable resource as they simplify life, serve as a learning tool, and help maintain relationships. They have become an integral part of society and should continue to be so.
428	430	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, computers and other technology are a wonderful addition to the world! I disagree with the view that computers have a negative impact on people. Here are my @NUM1 reasons.   Computers and technology make life more convenient. They offer access to bank accounts, stores, research, and educational resources. For instance, instead of going grocery shopping, one can order food online effortlessly. Shopping for clothes and household items is also a breeze, as users can simply browse a list and make selections without waiting in long lines. I once went to @CAPS1 to pick up items for a party but faced a long queue. So, I went online, made my selections, and had the items shipped to me in less time than it would have taken to wait in line.   Another advantage is the ability to communicate with family and friends for free. There are numerous websites, such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, MySpace, Yahoo, and Ohvoo, that allow for free texting, video - chatting, and voice - chatting. I remember one day when I didn't want to spend money to talk to a friend, so I video - chatted with them. It was @NUM3 times better and cost nothing. This is especially useful for long - distance communication, as phone calls can be expensive.   Finally, as long as one controls the time spent on computers or other technology devices, there is no problem. By setting a time limit, one can ensure a balanced lifestyle. For example, one can schedule time to exercise or socialize with friends.   In conclusion, computers and technology make life easier, enable free communication, and can be used without negative consequences if time is managed properly. Thank you for considering my thoughts.
429	431	1	2	"Dear officials at the @ORGANIZATION1, the issue of computer use has become a topic of concern. While some experts believe that computers are beneficial, I firmly believe that their overuse is having a detrimental effect on society.   Computers are significantly altering the way people communicate. Instead of face - to - face interactions, teenagers and adults are relying on ""@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"" to communicate with friends and colleagues. This has led to the formation of bad habits, such as reduced physical interaction and the use of terms like ""@CAPS3"" and ""@CAPS4"" instead of proper words. This is creating a large gap in human social - interactions and is causing harm.   The amount of time wasted on computers is astonishing. People who log on to search for a fact or ""@CAPS5"" something often end up spending hours on the computer, getting distracted by other programs. A recent poll shows that the average person aged @NUM1 spends over two hours on the computer each day. This time could be used for more productive activities.   The health of humans is also being severely affected by computer use. As the obesity rate rises, people are sitting in front of their computers instead of engaging in physical activities like exercising, going to the gym, or taking a walk. Teenagers are missing out on outdoor play and fresh air. Whenever I talk to my friends, they usually say they are on Facebook or Ohvoo instead of being outside.   In conclusion, the overuse of computers is harming society rather than helping it. This is due to the negative impact on social skills, the wasted time, and the health issues it causes. If people limit their computer use, they will notice a positive change in their lifestyle."
430	432	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, experts report that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 spend @NUM1 hours or more on the computer daily, while the recommended time limit is @NUM2 hour. This excessive computer use has several negative consequences.   Firstly, people are not getting enough exercise. Obesity and diabetes affect <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of @CAPS4, and these are life - threatening diseases. If people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, such as going to the gym or taking a walk outside, the spread of these diseases could be curbed.   Secondly, nature offers a wonderful experience. While camping may not be for everyone, there are many other ways to enjoy nature. One can visit the zoo or the aquarium, or simply sit by a pond and watch birds. These activities are far better than sitting in front of a computer screen looking at pictures of nature.   Lastly, computer use is weakening social bonds. Although one can communicate with family and friends via email, instant messaging, @CAPS5, and @CAPS6, it is not the same as face - to - face interaction. People are becoming less friendly and sociable, and there is a decline in social skills.   In conclusion, computers have a long - term negative impact on people. They lead to a lack of exercise, prevent people from enjoying nature, and weaken relationships with friends and family. This is a growing problem that needs to be addressed. Thank you for your time.
431	433	1	2	In my view, computers are essential in our modern lives. Without them, connecting with family members living in other states or countries would be extremely challenging. While texting is an option, not everyone has a phone, and calling might not be free depending on one's phone plan. For instance, if a family member plans to visit, they would typically email to inform us. Without computers, they couldn't let us know when they're coming. They might show up unexpectedly when we're not home, leaving them disappointed.  Moreover, computers offer flexibility for exercise. We can choose the time and engage in activities at our convenience. Some people enjoy playing sports outdoors, which allows them to enjoy nature. Even those who seem to be on computers all day likely appreciate nature and may drive to various places. Additionally, everyone needs to exercise to stay in shape. No one wants to be overweight their whole life; they want to look and feel good about themselves.  During holidays, when people want to send greetings to loved ones far away, emailing is a cost - effective option compared to calling. Since calling can be expensive and texting might only be available with certain phone plans, email remains the most practical choice.  Some might say that people are always on computers, but for those who aren't, at least they can use computers to keep in touch with family they rarely see. In conclusion, based on these reasons, I firmly believe that we should not get rid of computers and other related technologies.
432	434	1	2	"The usage of computers has been on a significant rise over the years. Both adults and children are spending a substantial amount of time on these devices. While computers may seem entertaining and useful at first glance, this isn't entirely true.  Computers are no longer just for work; they've become a new means of communication. Communication has always been an integral part of our lives, and everyone has engaged in some form of interaction with others. However, computers are misusing the privilege of communication. Online chat platforms are preferred by many because they're easy and convenient. But the people on these platforms may not be who they claim to be, posing a great danger, especially since children of all ages are using them. Children often don't know who they're talking to and tend to say whatever comes to mind.  The way we communicate online is different from in - person communication. When using a computer, people tend to use shorthand. For example, the word ""you"" is often spelled ""u"". These changes become a natural habit and seep into our real - life communication and writing. As a result, instead of seeing a proper sentence like ""Did you think about her project"", we might see ""wat did u tink bout her pro"". This can negatively affect children's grades as their spelling and vocabulary may deteriorate.  The excessive use of computers also has environmental impacts. People are less likely to go outside when all their communication can be done at home. This lack of outdoor activity not only harms our health but also wastes energy. When people do go outside, it's often just for simple tasks like taking out the trash. Fewer people are taking care of the planet by gardening, planting trees, or picking up litter. If everyone took just ten minutes a day to help the environment, it would benefit both our bodies and the planet. It would also reduce computer usage and change our view of civilization.  In conclusion, we should limit our computer use, get out, and do something productive. The computer will always be there, but we only have one planet, and we shouldn't let a simple piece of technology destroy it."
433	435	1	2	Many adults believe that computers are a waste of time and can be addictive or harmful to health. However, it depends on how we use them. One of the amazing aspects of computers is socializing. We can interact with friends, family, and even strangers safely online. It allows us to learn about different lives and cultures outside our local area.  Computers also help us stay in touch with distant family and friends. For example, my sister went to [LOCATION1] for six months, but it felt like only two weeks because we could communicate and share pictures. Additionally, we can connect with people we don't usually talk to in school, such as classmates or teachers. These social - interaction methods make us feel like we're never alone.  Apart from socializing, computers have many other important uses. For instance, we've all forgotten our work at school or the office at least once. With computers, we can easily access and print our assignments from our teachers' websites, saving us time and effort. When we're curious about the weather, we can check weather.com instead of waiting for a forecast. And for breaking news, we can get the information directly instead of watching a long - running news show.  Parents should recognize the beauty of this technology. Humans have created something complex and interesting, and we should be proud of it. Another great advantage is the ability to work from home. Teachers can grade papers on their comfortable couches, and business owners can run their companies from their living rooms. My father owns a company and works from home most days, which allows him to spend more time with the family.  Online banking is also a time - saver. Instead of going to the bank and spending hours with an accountant, we can access our account information with just a few keystrokes.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are a valuable use of time and will continue to be beneficial in the future. So, the next time we log on to our computers, we should make the most of their many advantages.
434	436	1	2	Dear Readers of the Local Newspaper, the use of computers is on the rise, but not everyone believes it benefits society. Supporters of technological advancement think that computers have a positive impact on people. They enhance hand - eye coordination, enable us to learn about distant places and people, and allow online communication.  However, some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on computers, leading to less exercise, less enjoyment of nature, and reduced interaction with family and friends. I side with these experts because many people take computer use to an extreme.  One problem is the increased electricity bill. When users are constantly on the computer, it runs continuously, which drives up the cost of electricity. I can relate to this because I used to be a heavy computer user, and my guardian would scold me about the high bill. After reducing my computer usage, the bill decreased.  Another issue is obesity. Obesity occurs when a person is overweight. I have an imaginary friend who is a heavy computer user. He never exercises with his friends because he's always in front of the screen.  Finally, heavy computer users tend to neglect interactions with family and friends. I used to be one of them. I would decline invitations to go to the movies with friends and avoid helping around the house. But I learned to use the computer responsibly and not waste my time on it.  In conclusion, being a constant computer user is unhealthy as it can lead to obesity, increase the electricity bill, and reduce social interaction. We should all learn to use computers in a more balanced way.
435	437	1	2	I believe that the effects of computers are negative. A growing number of people are spending excessive time on computers, resulting in less exercise, less enjoyment of nature, and reduced interaction with family and friends.  In my school, [NUM1] out of [NUM2] students agree that they rarely exercise because they're always on their computers. For example, [NUM3] - year - old [CAPS1] used to go to the gym daily before getting her own computer. Now, she spends her afternoons in front of the computer screen. Without computers, kids would likely be outside getting exercise.  I've often found myself in front of the computer on a beautiful day. Instead of enjoying nature, I was stuck indoors. I think it would be beneficial for everyone to unplug their computers for a day and go outside for fresh air. If we continue to stay on computers all day and avoid going outside, we might turn into a lazy society.  I also recall numerous times when I cancelled plans with my dad because I was on the computer. Many people can relate to this. Instead of going out with friends, people are just instant - messaging them. The internet is wonderful, but we've forgotten the joy of real - life socializing.  In conclusion, the negative effects of computers are evident. People are spending too much time on them, leading to less exercise, less appreciation of nature, and less interaction with loved ones. After reading this, I hope you can see that computers are causing more harm than good.
436	438	1	2	Dear newspaper, people are spending an excessive amount of time on their computers. Instead of engaging in physical exercise, they remain glued to their screens. It is essential for individuals to appreciate nature and spend quality time with family and friends. Firstly, those who are constantly on social media platforms like Facebook or MySpace are neglecting physical activity. Currently, the obesity rate is alarmingly high, and this sedentary lifestyle is extremely unhealthy. In my family, members who are always on Facebook are not exercising and are gradually gaining weight. A significant proportion, eight out of ten, are not getting enough exercise. We must encourage people to be more active. Secondly, people need to take the time to enjoy nature. Everyone is so engrossed in their computers that they fail to relax and appreciate the natural world. They seem unaware of the environmental pollution and the fact that once animals become extinct, they are lost forever. If people stepped away from their computers for a moment, they could observe these animals before it's too late. Computers act as a barrier between the indoors and the outside world. Finally, computers are interfering with people's relationships with family and friends. Everyone is so preoccupied with the latest technology that they neglect face - to - face interactions. I know some people who, during dinner time, bring their food to their computers so as not to miss out on anything. Family and friends are of great importance, yet a large percentage, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2, only see them on holidays. In conclusion, computers are causing people to miss out on exercise, nature, and social connections. We need to motivate people to get up and away from their computers.
437	439	1	2	I'm about to share some thoughts that could change your overall view of computers. Some might claim that computers are excellent as they are fast and can provide what you need. However, I firmly believe that computers have more drawbacks. They can be addictive, lead to high electricity bills, cause children to spend less time with their families, and pose significant risks to teens and children of all ages. Computers are undeniably addictive. As a fact, @PERCENT1 of students spend most of their time on the computer. The reason for this addiction is the instant - messaging feature that allows people to communicate with others worldwide. While it may seem harmless, it can be costly. @PERSON1, who deals with electricity bills, has reported that due to children spending more time on the computer, household bills have increased by almost @PERCENT2, making it difficult for families to pay. Computers are also one of the main reasons why children spend less time with their families. This is true in many households, including mine. My sisters and I spend more time on the computer than with each other, which can lead to arguments. Statistics show that @NUM1 people prefer to spend time on the computer rather than with their own children or parents. Is this the kind of separation you want for your family? Moreover, computers are not always safe for children and teens. There are numerous reasons for this. When our children are on the computer, we have no idea who they are talking to or what they are discussing. Teens are likely to meet strangers online, and there are stalkers and posers pretending to be someone they're not. Children can fall victim to these deceptions, which could lead to dangerous situations such as kidnapping or sexual assault. They can also suffer from verbal abuse and emotional damage. We must be vigilant and monitor our children's online activities. In conclusion, these reasons clearly show that computers are not truly beneficial to our society.
438	440	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that spending too much time on the computer is detrimental to people. It can lead to obsession, get one into trouble, and have a negative impact on education. One reason for this is the potential for obsession. For instance, on a beautiful day, if you call a friend to play outside and they decline because they are @CAPS3 on the computer, specifically playing games, it shows an excessive attachment to the device. Another issue is the trouble that can arise from excessive computer use. Getting into trouble online can have serious consequences, such as being sued or having the website removed from your computer. If parents find out, you'll be in even more trouble and may be grounded, meaning you won't be able to use the computer for a long time. Finally, spending too much time on the computer can harm your education. If someone neglects their homework in favor of computer use, it can significantly affect their grades. In @CAPS5 @CAPS6, this could prevent you from graduating and going to college, which is a major setback if you're aiming for a good college. Although computers are important in @CAPS5 @CAPS6, one should not overuse them. In conclusion, all the reasons I've presented clearly demonstrate that excessive computer use is bad for people.
439	441	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper: Computers have become an integral part of people's lives, but I firmly believe their effects are entirely negative. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, computers are extremely time - consuming. People often lose track of time when using computers. Once they start, it's difficult to stop. A poll of @NUM1 kids revealed that @NUM2 of them felt groggy and had headaches after using a computer for just two hours. While using a computer may seem entertaining, like chatting with a friend on @CAPS1, it's the person, not the computer, that brings happiness. You might as well meet the person in real life. Therefore, computers waste time and should be used less. Secondly, computers are unreliable. Many people rely on their computers, and when they malfunction, it causes frustration and anger. Dr. @PERSON2 at @ORGANIZATION1 has stated that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2's frustration and anger is due to non - working computers. Reducing computer use would lower people's anger levels and bring about other positive changes. Finally, computers contribute to health problems and make people lazy. The obesity rate is at an all - time high, and @PERCENT2 of obesity is caused by computer use. @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION2 has reported that @NUM3 out of @NUM4 non - computer users are much healthier as they exercise instead. In conclusion, computers are time - consuming, unreliable, and harmful to health. Their negative effects on people are undeniable.
440	442	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1, imagine a world where you can talk to anyone globally with just a button press. This has become a reality thanks to computers. I wholeheartedly support technological advancements related to computers for several reasons. Firstly, computers are beneficial for society as they enhance hand - eye coordination. Nine out of ten computer users have shown improved hand - eye coordination. Bill @CAPS2, the creator of @ORGANIZATION1, has said that the keyboard is crucial for building this skill. I remember when I first got a computer and had poor hand - eye coordination; now, I can type with my eyes closed. Although some may think that computers reduce physical activity, the improvement in hand - eye coordination is a significant advantage. Secondly, computers allow us to learn about distant places and people. Nineteen out of twenty students use computers for learning about a place or a person. @PERSON3 has noted that the way students study has changed, with most now using computers. I recently did a report on @PERSON1 using only my computer. While enjoying nature is important, the knowledge gained through computers is even more valuable. Finally, computers enable us to communicate with the world instantly. Ninety - nine out of a hundred students use online communication. @PERSON2, the creator of @CAPS4, an instant - messaging website, has said that @CAPS4 is the easiest way to stay in touch. I recall going on vacation and still staying connected with my friends through @CAPS4. Although exercise is essential, maintaining social connections is also important. In conclusion, I support computers because they improve hand - eye coordination, facilitate learning, and enable global communication. I hope this explanation makes it clear why you should also support the use of computers.
441	443	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. People can engage in numerous activities and acquire knowledge on computers. For instance, they can access information about sports, the animal world, history, and much more. I personally enjoy researching the history of @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 pioneers who have transformed humanity. Additionally, computers teach typing skills and navigation. If your mother asks you to find a website to buy new furniture, you can use your computer skills to fulfill the task. Moreover, if you have a project on the @CAPS2 revolution and have spent time researching it on the computer, the project will be relatively easy. Computers also enhance communication skills on platforms like Facebook and @CAPS5. In school, kids often tell each other to get on Facebook after school. Furthermore, computers allow you to look up your idols. As a fan of football and basketball, I often search for my idols, @PERSON1 Peterson and @PERSON2 Iverson, on the computer. Finally, computers improve reading skills as there is always something to read on them. In conclusion, the benefits of computers are evident, and they have a significant positive influence on people.
442	444	1	2	"Dear Newspaper, the question of ""@CAPS1 a computer @CAPS15?"" has sparked continuous discussions and controversies. Senior scientist @PERSON2 stated, ""I believe that computers can help people connect with friends and distant relatives."" This view is correct. Computers bring people together, whether they are friends, family, or relatives from far - off countries. They also assist with daily needs, such as homework. People can perform various tasks on a computer, including doing homework, finding a store, checking traffic and weather. They can play games, connect with friends, learn recipes, and follow the football game. By creating a global link, people can learn about one another. @PERCENT1 of large corporations find the @CAPS3 and computer very useful. @PERSON4, a charity fund - raiser in @LOCATION1, said, ""@CAPS4 using the @CAPS3, I can find willing participants in charities."" Secondly, people can use the @CAPS3 to share their products on platforms like @CAPS6 and @CAPS7. They can also create websites for this purpose. @PERSON1, the co - owner of The @CAPS8 @CAPS9, a duct @CAPS8 wallet company that raises money for @LOCATION2, is creating a website to raise awareness of a tragic event. Many business owners, like @PERSON1, use the @CAPS3 to expand their businesses. @PERSON3, the successful owner of @ORGANIZATION1, asked, ""@CAPS12 stay in the past when the door to the future @CAPS1 open?"" Using computers, people can gather data and create new inventions. They can create @NUM1 - @CAPS14 diagrams on a computer and send data to companies, potentially creating @CAPS2. Computers are not just toys; they are important tools that can benefit the world. Although some may find drawbacks to computers, the positive aspects are undeniable. I hope this article can prove that computers are not all @CAPS15."
443	445	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that we should use computers. When we need help, we can find the answers on the computer. Sometimes, it is the only way to get in touch with someone. Also, people often need to check instant mail on the computer. For example, when a student needs help with homework, they can use Google or visit a website like http.historywork.com. Moreover, computers offer a wide range of functions. We can play games, connect with friends, learn recipes, and follow the football game. Through the computer, we can create a global link and learn about others. Additionally, we can use it to find stores, check traffic and weather. Many large corporations find the computer very useful. People can also share their products on various websites. Some business owners create websites to expand their businesses. Computers can also help us gather data and create new inventions. We can create diagrams on a computer and send data to companies. In conclusion, computers are valuable tools that can meet our various needs, and we should make good use of them.
444	446	1	2	"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I firmly believe that people should reduce their computer usage. Just envision a world where more people are outside, healthy, and there is less cyberbullying and lower electricity consumption. Firstly, @PERCENT1 of people who use the computer for more than two hours a day are either at risk of being overweight or already overweight. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""@CAPS2 people think using the computer has benefits, but it actually increases the risk of being overweight or getting diseases like diabetes. The community must take action."" My neighbor, @PERSON2, conducted a study on overweight adults and teenagers. @PERCENT2 of the @NUM1 people @CAPS3 interviewed said they don't go outside and use the computer for about @NUM2 hours a day. I urge the citizens of the @LOCATION1 area to cut down on internet time and enjoy nature. Secondly, less computer use means less cyberbullying. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people on socializing websites have experienced more than @NUM2 encounters of cyberbullying. My sister's friend, @PERSON3, overdosed on Advil due to cyberbullying. Fortunately, her mother brought her to @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1 in time. If people reduce their use of socializing websites, fewer people will be affected by cyberbullying. It is crucial that people limit their computer use to @NUM7 or @NUM8 hours a day. Finally, using the computer less means saving money on electricity bills and having more time for family vacations. Dr. @DR1 from the Peabody Museum in @LOCATION2 encourages people to use less electricity on the internet to help the environment recover. @PERCENT3 of the power used in homes is for computers. My grandmother believes that less computer time means more time with family and on vacations. In conclusion, reducing computer use is beneficial for our health, safety, and the environment, and people should take action to achieve this."
445	447	1	2	"Dear newspaper, in my opinion, computers clearly have a negative impact on people. People who frequently use computers tend to exercise less. I recall when I was about @NUM1 years old, I was always on the computer, and I quickly gained about @NUM2 lbs. A survey by the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1) showed that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS4 between ages @NUM3 are overweight due to computer use. Famous singer @PERSON2 said, ""I keep gaining and losing weight because of computers."" Research has proven that using the computer for more than @NUM4 minutes a day can lead to weight gain. Clearly, computers contribute to our society's weight problem. People who use computers often miss out on the beauty of nature. I watched the movie @CAPS2 last week and realized how amazing nature is. A survey by @NUM5 grade @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1, showed that @NUM6 out of @NUM7 @CAPS4 have never noticed the beauty of nature. Famous physician @PERSON4 said that those who don't appreciate nature may not grow up normally. Computers have diminished our connection with nature. Families also become more detached when someone uses a computer. I remember when my sister @PERSON5 was in @NUM5 grade, she was always on the computer and disconnected from the family. A test by @ORGANIZATION3 showed that teens rebel @NUM9 times more with the help of a computer. Famous talk - show host @PERSON3 said that @CAPS4 should not use computers as they will become detached from friends and family. In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on people as they reduce exercise time, make @CAPS4 forget about nature, and separate family and friends. Therefore, I urge people to limit their computer use."
446	448	1	2	Computers are highly advanced pieces of machinery. With these sophisticated devices, users can gain knowledge about various places and stay informed about global events. Typing, a universal writing method, is significantly faster than handwriting. Additionally, engaging in online interactions is a convenient and enjoyable way to relieve stress by communicating with users worldwide. There are thousands of news stories each day that remain uncovered due to time constraints on news channels. To access global news quickly and easily, one can visit a website and view hundreds of stories with a single click. Moreover, websites offer in - depth news as there are no space limitations. Some websites even have areas for users to donate to those in need. Patrick, the founder of the organization, stated that online platforms bring in billions of dollars in aid to people who would otherwise be in dire straits, and the primary source of this funding is internet websites. Without the internet, millions of people would be unaware of those desperately seeking help. Typing is a rapid and relatively straightforward writing method that saves valuable time. Teachers often assign writing homework, which takes approximately twice as long to complete by hand compared to typing. Using typing allows individuals to save time and focus on other important tasks. Furthermore, typing is a compulsory course for many freshmen, and prior experience benefits both teachers and students. A typing instructor said that students who excel not only achieve an 'A' but also halve their homework time. Stress is a prevalent issue across all age groups, and computers are an effective means of stress relief. Playing interactive games with people from around the world broadens one's cultural perspective. One can utilize typing skills to communicate with others and share opinions. A person at an institution noted that although it may seem surprising, individuals who use computers for an hour a day are more culturally advanced. Additionally, video chat enables communication with people in foreign regions. Friends, family, and exchange students can talk and see each other, which alleviates parents' concerns about their children living abroad. In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits in terms of information access, communication, and stress - relief, making them an indispensable part of modern life.
447	449	1	2	Computers are beneficial as they allow people to find what they need. They can discover places, obtain items at reasonable prices, and engage in enjoyable activities. People can use computers to search for products and compare prices, ensuring they get the best deal. They can also explore different locations virtually, which is useful for travel planning or learning about new cultures. Moreover, computers offer a wide range of entertainment options such as games, movies, and music. In conclusion, the advantages of computers in helping people meet their needs and have fun are undeniable, making them an important part of daily life.
448	450	1	2	Dear Readers, in my opinion, spending time on the computer has both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, computers enable users to conduct research, communicate with friends and family, and learn about any subject. When it comes to research, if one needs information for a project or to study a particular topic, the computer provides the fastest way to access the required data. The ability to talk to loved ones is also crucial, as it helps maintain relationships, especially when distance separates people. However, there are also drawbacks. People often spend excessive time on the computer, getting distracted without realizing how much time has passed. Staring at the computer screen for long periods can cause permanent damage to the eyes. Additionally, individuals may ignore their friends and family while engrossed in computer activities, which can lead to relationship problems. In conclusion, while computers offer many useful functions, it is essential to use them in moderation to avoid the negative consequences. We should be aware of the time we spend on the computer and make sure it does not interfere with our health and relationships.
449	451	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I firmly believe that people should have access to computers for several valid reasons. Firstly, it serves as an excellent means of communicating with distant relatives. For instance, if a relative lives in @CAPS1 and calling from the @LOCATION1 would cost @MONEY1 per minute, using a webcam on the computer allows for face - to - face communication at a lower cost. This is far better than a simple phone call as it enables users to actually see their relatives. It also allows those on business trips to check on their families. Secondly, computers can help individuals stay fit and healthy. One can look up @ORGANIZATION1 yoga poses, follow fitness lessons on the screen, and search for healthy recipes if on a diet. There are also options to purchase @ORGANIZATION1 work - out equipment to maintain a good physique. Lastly, when going on a long trip, computers are invaluable for obtaining directions. Instead of spending money on a @MONEY2 @ORGANIZATION3, one can look up directions on the internet and print them out. This is not only cost - effective but also quicker, and the printed maps can be easily carried. In conclusion, computers offer a multitude of benefits, including facilitating communication, promoting health, and providing travel assistance. I hope this perspective will open people's eyes and perhaps influence some scientists' views.
450	452	1	2	There should definitely be computers in society, and there are several good reasons for this. Firstly, paying bills is much easier and faster online. Instead of dealing with piles of paperwork, people can use computers to handle their financial obligations efficiently. This convenience makes computers an essential tool for modern - day financial management. Secondly, social media platforms like Facebook are a great way to connect with friends, make new ones, and have fun interacting with others. It allows people to stay in touch with their social circles and share experiences, which is an important aspect of social life. Thirdly, computers are extremely helpful for research. When one needs to gather information on a specific topic, a computer can provide a wealth of knowledge. It has all the resources required to conduct in - depth research, making it an indispensable tool for students, researchers, and anyone seeking information. In conclusion, the benefits of having computers in society, such as bill - paying convenience, social connection through platforms like Facebook, and research assistance, are undeniable. People rely on computers for these important functions, and I hope others can share their own positive experiences with computers.
451	453	1	2	I'm writing to your local newspaper to share my view that computers have both positive and negative impacts on people. Historically, the negative effects have been more prominent. A survey in @CAPS2 magazines showed that @PERCENT1 of people experienced negative impacts from computers. In my opinion, computers have a negative effect on people. First, people are reducing their interactions with family and friends. Social interaction is crucial. When using a computer, one simply sits and stares at the screen without real - world interaction. A survey at @CAPS3 @CAPS4 indicated that @PERCENT2 of people are on the computer and not interacting with those around them. Parents see their kids less because the kids are constantly on the computer. Interacting with family and friends is beneficial to one's well - being, but computers take away time from such activities. Second, people miss out on enjoying nature. Those engrossed in computers may not go outside. People need fresh air, and learning about nature is essential. A local magazine survey showed that @PERCENT2 of people are on the computer instead of enjoying nature. Lastly, people are spending too much time on computers and less on exercise. Exercise is vital for the mind and body. The lack of exercise is increasing rapidly. As more people get computers, they exercise less. Dr. @DR1, a local doctor, has observed more people becoming overweight and exercising less. He says computers do not provide exercise and recommends people use computers less. In conclusion, I believe computers have a negative impact on people. The reasons are the lack of interaction with friends and family, the neglect of nature, and insufficient exercise. I hope you are aware of these negative effects, and the decision is yours.
452	454	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I want to share my thoughts on excessive computer use. Even though I use a computer a lot, I still have fun with friends and play sports. But too much time on the computer can lead to a lack of exercise and make people more prone to getting sick. Spending long hours on the computer can make kids shy in real - life situations. Exercise is healthy for both kids and adults, yet there are too many people spending hours on the computer doing all sorts of things. Staring at a computer screen for a long time won't keep you fit. People should limit their computer time to @NUM1 minutes a day and then exercise. This way, you can balance internet use with activities that are good for you. I feel bad for those who waste all their time on the computer. Seeing them gain weight from lack of exercise makes me want to help. No one should put themselves in such a situation. People who stay online a lot get sick more often. Sitting around like lazy people, they don't get fresh air, which can cause colds or make those with health problems very ill. They need to think twice about their computer habits. I'd rather have fun outdoors getting fresh air than sit on the computer and risk getting sick. It's different if you're sick from work or school and use the computer. But getting sick because of the computer is just gross. People who use the computer often are also shy in person. An online fight can make them so uncomfortable that they stop talking. Real - life interaction is great, but being shy and lonely because of the computer is something to be ashamed of. In conclusion, people should take care of themselves and not spend so much time on the internet. Remind yourself to limit computer time to @NUM1 minutes a day and exercise. Don't forget to stay healthy and go for a jog once in a while. Don't let the computer dominate your life. Thank you and have a great day.
453	455	1	2	People often use computers for various purposes. They might be chatting via email, creating websites, or watching videos on YouTube. Some individuals don't like to go outside and enjoy nature or spend time with family. Instead, they are busy checking out new websites, playing games, booking vacations, or looking for sales at Walmart. They may also be browsing for a new truck or researching the history of wars and their origins. In essence, computers offer a wide range of activities that can keep people occupied, but this sometimes comes at the cost of real - world experiences.
454	456	1	2	I believe computers are useful as they assist people with their work. They can be used for various tasks such as work, finding maps, and solving problems in school subjects like math, science, and social studies. However, many people become addicted to computers. Some people play games on the computer all day and don't go outside. They don't talk to or see their friends, which is like having no real life. Some students even don't want to go to school because they are tired from excessive computer use and just want to use the computer non - stop. People who are overly addicted to computers don't use them for the right reasons. They can get health problems like headaches or feel nauseous. They also miss out on many activities, such as going to the @CAPS1 to watch football, soccer, @CAPS3, volleyball, or taking their dogs for a walk. Some people buy computers for games, while more mature individuals buy them for work or to find locations. The computer is helpful, but it also makes many people addicted. Computers can also break easily. People may download games or other things that give the computer a virus, and then they have to spend around @NUM1 $ or @NUM2$ to fix it. New computers can cost between @NUM3$ and @NUM4$, and they are faster and from different brands. When people's computers break, some may act irrationally. They may isolate themselves in their rooms and not respect their parents. They may also get into trouble. In conclusion, computers can be helpful, but they also have many negative aspects. We should make some changes to ensure that people use computers in a more appropriate way.
455	457	1	2	Welcome to the @DATE1. In today's world, technology is advancing rapidly, and the invention of the computer stands out. A single computer has numerous capabilities, including educational access, helping people stay in touch, and broadening one's horizons. Around the world, schools are adding computers or computer labs. This is because computers take learning to new heights. Whether a student needs to write an essay about @PERSON1's presidency or gather information for a science experiment, a computer can help. Programs like @ORGANIZATION1 enable @CAPS1 to present their work efficiently. For children who can't attend school or adults seeking a college education, online schools accessed via computers are available. Computers also help people stay in touch. Communication is essential for healthy relationships, and computers offer an easy way to maintain contact with distant friends and family. Some people rely entirely on computers to stay connected because they don't live close by. With proper internet safety, one can make new friends with similar interests. Computers are like keys that open doors to new ideas and places. They can introduce people to new music genres. There are also free video tutorials on the internet to teach different skills. In one's free time, a computer can be used to research the people of @LOCATION1 or the pyramids of @LOCATION2. In the @DATE1, computers are an essential part of daily life. You need to decide whether you support this remarkable technology or not. The knowledge you can gain from a computer is astonishing. Remember, computers are not just for entertainment but also for education. So, click the mouse and discover the great impact computers can have on your life.
456	458	1	2	Dear editor, it is evident that many children and adults are fond of using the computer, yet they may not be aware of its adverse effects. At a young age, various risks exist while on the computer. One can engage in inappropriate activities online, neglect physical exercise, or lack quality time with family.  Regarding inappropriate online activities, a child may access malicious websites, interact with strangers, or become a victim of harassment. For instance, when a child creates a Facebook account, it is not uncommon for unregistered child molesters or sex - offenders to send friend requests. They may feign friendliness to gain the child's trust and potentially kidnap them. Additionally, one can either harass others or be harassed and visit inappropriate websites.  In terms of physical activity, today's children tend to stay indoors and use the computer instead of going outside.  Moreover, the emergence of new technologies such as cellphones and laptops has led children to prefer spending time with friends over family. While cellphones have their uses, it is essential to allocate more time for family.  Constant computer use is detrimental as it exposes users to risks like interacting with strangers, harassment, and accessing inappropriate content. It also leads to a sedentary lifestyle, increasing the likelihood of diabetes, high blood pressure, and childhood obesity. Lastly, new technologies have reduced family time. In conclusion, it is crucial for individuals, especially children, to use the computer in moderation to avoid these negative consequences.
457	459	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, in my view, computers bring numerous benefits to society. They can preserve memories that might otherwise fade, such as @CAPS3, @CAPS1's, and typed letters. They also offer dieting tips from local experts and enable long - distance communication with family without incurring hefty phone bills.  Computers serve as a learning center, providing @CAPS2 tips on various topics. For example, if you are stressed about a school paper and lack facts, countless websites can offer the necessary information. You can then achieve excellent grades, like getting an A on your paper.  Another @CAPS2 aspect is the ability to communicate with family members in different cities, towns, states, or even continents. When you miss them deeply, you can see, talk, or type to them, alleviating your sadness. A significant portion of Americans feel that missing a family member is like losing a part of their heart.  Computers also store those small memories that might slip from our minds, including @CAPS3, websites, and written work. As @PERSON1 said, losing such memories is like losing a part of life.  In conclusion, computers are incredibly valuable for knowledge acquisition, maintaining family connections, and memory preservation. I hope you recognize their importance for the mind, the useful tips they offer, and the role they play in family communication.
458	460	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, you may have witnessed someone using a @CAPS1 to email a co - worker or a person using a laptop at a coffee shop. I can confirm that computers are not only needed but also beneficial to them.  In the workplace, computers are indispensable. Many people rely on them for their jobs. For example, @ORGANIZATION3 conducted a survey and found that @PERCENT1 of people use computers for work. These individuals depend on email to communicate with their bosses and save important documents for meetings to secure well - deserved raises. Even @ORGANIZATION1 uses computers to write articles for the paper. More than half of @CAPS2 or @ORGANIZATION2 benefit from working on computers.  Computers also facilitate family communication. When family members live far away, email, @CAPS5, @LOCATION2M, or @CAPS3 can bridge the gap. Some experts claim that people spend too much time on computers and less on exercise, nature, and family interaction. However, @CAPS5 was originally invented for family communication, and even the military uses computers to stay in touch.  Although computers have some drawbacks, the future of technology is promising. Computers were the starting point, and technological progress has not stopped. We should embrace this new technology and not be overly critical. In conclusion, despite the minor flaws, computers are a force for good, and we should look forward to the even greater technological advancements to come.
459	461	1	2	Dear The Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a significant impact on people, and the nature of this impact varies depending on the duration of use. In my opinion, computers are highly beneficial for several reasons.  Firstly, communication is a major advantage. There are numerous websites that allow you to talk to friends and family. With the latest technology, video - chatting has become possible, enabling you to see and hear your loved ones through a small camera. This is an excellent way to stay connected.  Secondly, the computer is a vast source of information. There are countless websites that can answer all your questions. Websites like @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 can recommend other research sites, helping you learn a great deal.  Lastly, computers can assist with various tasks. They can be used for online classes, matchmaking, job - hunting, and more. In a tough economy, you can search for jobs by simply typing keywords into the computer, and it will notify you of relevant opportunities.  Computers are an amazing new technology that continues to evolve. We should make good use of them to learn, get help, and stay in touch with family and friends. However, we should not take them for granted but use them wisely. In conclusion, computers offer a wealth of benefits, and we should embrace them in our lives.
460	462	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, technology has advanced rapidly over the years, making life easier for ordinary people. Computers, in particular, are essential in daily life as they offer multiple benefits.  One of the primary functions of computers is communication. Programs like ""@CAPS2"", ""@CAPS3"", and ""@CAPS4"" provide new ways to stay in touch and have fun with friends. Email is also a great tool for communicating with distant family members, eliminating the long wait associated with traditional letters.  Computers are also a powerful learning resource. They allow us to research foreign places and discover facts that would otherwise be unknown. For example, you can research the @ORGANIZATION1 online and plan a flight there within a week. This is a significant step forward in the education process.  In addition, computers enhance safety and security and provide access to breaking news. You can check the best route home from the comfort of your home, avoiding traffic congestion.  In conclusion, I hope this discussion has changed your perspective on computers or reinforced your existing positive view. It is important to spread the word about the importance of computers for a better future. Although some people may not like electronics, we should educate them about the benefits. Computers are valuable tools for progress, and we should embrace them rather than criticize them."
461	463	1	2	To the local newspaper, there are those who believe that computers do not benefit society, but I firmly hold the opposite view. Computers are an invaluable resource in our daily lives. They are a vast repository of all types of information, enabling us to learn about various subjects. Moreover, they serve as an excellent source of entertainment. Additionally, the use of computers does not significantly alter the time we allocate to exercise, enjoy nature, or interact with our loved ones.  Search engines like Google and Yahoo, along with @CAPS1 and @LOCATION1, are indispensable. They assist us in solving trivial matters, such as finding a quick remedy for a stomach - ache or a funny joke to share at the office. They are also incredibly useful when dealing with more serious issues, like what to do when a newborn has a cough and sneeze. Not everyone can visit the library every time they have a question, and the information on computers is limitless. Whether it's learning a new language for a trip to @LOCATION2 or getting help with difficult geometry homework, computers can handle it all.  Entertainment on computers is boundless. There are countless videos and movies on YouTube, and even the sight of a skateboarding dog can keep us in stitches. On addictinggames.com, there are @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to engage in. There are also @CAPS4 of games on @ORGANIZATION1, from classic games like Pac - Man to Scrabble. I often use @ORGANIZATION2 to communicate with distant family members.  Computers also do not change our patterns of exercise, nature - appreciation, or social interaction. There are videos on the computer that teach us new yoga moves and other ways to shed extra weight. There are websites to help us plan family camping vacations. And we always make time for face - to - face interactions with family and friends.  In conclusion, computers are undoubtedly beneficial to society. They are informative, entertaining, and do not turn us into isolated individuals. Everyone should recognize the help they offer.
462	464	1	2	Dr. @DR1, there is a debate about the effects of computers on people and why some individuals do not agree that computers benefit society. Some people use computers to communicate with friends and family online.  Computers can be used for a multitude of purposes. We can use them to explore places we want to visit virtually. When it comes to work or enrolling in another school, many tasks can only be accomplished through a computer. Admittedly, computers can be expensive, but in many cases, it is worthwhile to own one.  One concern is that some people spend too much time on computers, reducing the time they spend on exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. However, computers also offer solutions. For families and friends living far apart, they can communicate online, especially when they don't have cell phones or landlines. Additionally, those who want to explore nature but don't know where to go can use the computer to find suitable places.  Another advantage is that people can exercise through the computer. It doesn't matter how much time people spend on the computer because they can accomplish a great deal. For example, students can complete projects and conduct research on the computer. Many find computers to be a source of fun.  In conclusion, those who are skeptical about the benefits of computers should give them a try. Computers have a significant impact on people, and although there are concerns, their advantages far outweigh the drawbacks.
463	465	1	2	Almost everyone owns a computer these days. Computers teach hand - eye coordination and allow people to learn about distant places. It's astonishing that some people claim otherwise; I find such claims completely baseless.  Today's computers are integrated into our everyday tools. They are used in the production of cars, cellphones, and televisions. They also simplify work and facilitate interaction with others. I firmly believe that computers benefit society, and those with a different view should delve deeper into the matter.  Cellphones, cars, and telephones are all products of human ingenuity combined with technology. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of cars have built - in computers? With just a press of a button, all the doors can be unlocked, and a switch can lower the windows, all thanks to computers.  Computers also make life significantly easier. Many of the items we use daily, such as toothpaste, baseball bats, and pencils, are produced by machines programmed with computer chips. I recall my history teacher saying that it used to take @NUM1 hours for a human to make a baseball bat from scratch. Now, with the help of computers, it only takes about @NUM2 minutes.  Some experts argue that people who use computers frequently don't spend enough time outdoors interacting with family. But I think this is untrue. Cellphones are a common tool for long - distance communication. And if that's not enough, we can always chat online on our laptops.  In conclusion, computers clearly benefit us in numerous ways. They are involved in the production of our daily items, simplify work, and enhance our ability to interact. We use them every day, and we should hope that they continue to be an integral part of our lives for a long time.
464	466	1	2	Computers have a positive impact on people. They can improve hand - eye coordination, teach us about history and different cultures, and provide a great way to relax and have fun.  Regarding hand - eye coordination, computers train our hands to move according to what our brains tell them and what our eyes see. This skill is crucial as it can help with driving by reducing reaction time and enable people to write more neatly. For example, a driver with good hand - eye coordination can turn the wheel or hit the brakes faster, potentially avoiding an accident. A climber can also grab onto a ledge more quickly.  The internet is a treasure trove of information. Many people are unaware of historical facts, such as the number of soldiers on @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or the number of countries in the world. Americans, in particular, may lack knowledge of @LOCATION2 history and world history. We can use search engines to find answers to any question, from the end of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to the collapse of @LOCATION1 in @DATE1. We can also learn useful and interesting things like food recipes and the contents of paints, or keep up with the news on Yahoo.  Computers are also a lot of fun. We can chat with friends, listen to music, and play games simultaneously. If we miss our favorite show at @TIME1, there are hundreds of websites where we can watch it for free. We can legally and freely listen to our favorite bands' new albums on YouTube, Playlist.com, and other sites.  In conclusion, computers are excellent for interacting with friends and family, improving hand - eye coordination, and learning new things. They offer a wide range of benefits in both education and entertainment.
465	467	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, computers have a significant positive impact on society. This is because they enhance our communication skills, provide us with information, and improve our technological proficiency.  First, computers are a great tool for developing communication skills. I find them incredibly useful. They give us access to websites that enable us to connect with old and new friends. It is a quick and easy way to communicate, whether we are at home or on the move with a laptop. We can talk to people from all over the world.  Second, computers are a valuable source of information. When teachers assign papers or newspaper articles, students can simply go home, open a search engine, and type in the topic. They will immediately have access to thousands of sources of information. In fact, @PERCENT1 of the population in @LOCATION1 prefers computer sources over books because it is much easier to find specific information on computers.  Finally, computers boost our technological skills. Although some computers may seem easy to use initially, companies are constantly increasing their complexity and releasing new software. By using these high - tech computers and software, the current generation is becoming more technically advanced compared to many other countries. This has a profound impact on our country's overall technical capabilities.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on society. They provide us with communication skills, information, and technological proficiency. I hope that after reading this, we can all see the benefits of computers from the same perspective.
466	468	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I have come across reports in both the news on @CAPS2.V. and your publication indicating that an increasing number of individuals are becoming overly reliant on computers. I am not suggesting that this is entirely negative, as computers provide access to the internet, enabling activities such as browsing websites and engaging in online chats. However, I firmly believe that people should spend more time outdoors participating in activities like football, basketball, or baseball. For adults, there are also job opportunities that do not involve computers, such as building houses for the homeless, constructing animal shelters, working as a maintenance person, a pool lifeguard, or in other non - computer - based hotel jobs. One could also work at a restaurant offering regular or fast - food services. If leaving the house is not possible, one can turn to video games, which, while somewhat similar to computers, offer an alternative to continuous computer use. In conclusion, a balance between computer use and other activities is essential for a well - rounded lifestyle.
467	469	1	2	Computers are increasingly integrating into our daily lives. They have facilitated various aspects of our world, including work, bill payment, and entertainment. However, these benefits are overshadowed by several negative effects. The rise of computer usage has led to an increase in obesity as people spend more time sitting and less time outdoors. Kids and teens today prefer to be on their @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 accounts rather than engaging in physical activities. Moreover, the web is filled with ads for unhealthy foods, making children more prone to consuming junk food. Additionally, the internet promotes false ideas about easy diets, misleading people into believing they can lose weight effortlessly. Alongside the growth of computer usage, there are also escalating dangers. Viruses can hack into computers, steal personal information, and cause significant damage. Cyber - bullies pose a new and serious threat, as demonstrated by the tragic story of a girl who took her own life after being bullied by another girl and her mother. Online predators are also a major risk to teens, luring them into dangerous situations. Furthermore, excessive computer interaction among young people leads to ignorance. Many kids, including myself, would rather be online than read books or do homework. This can result in neglecting schoolwork and developing weaker minds for the future. Ads and false information on websites can further mislead the youth. In conclusion, while computers have contributed to the advancement of the world, certain aspects of their use create ignorance and danger for people of all ages.
468	470	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter to express my concerns about the impact of computer use on people. In our society, excessive computer use reduces the time people spend outdoors, exercising, and interacting with family and friends. Firstly, it is important for everyone, regardless of age, to get outside for at least @NUM1 minutes daily to breathe fresh air. However, computer use can limit this time, which may not be healthy. Secondly, too much time on the computer restricts the amount of daily exercise. Health expert @PERSON1 states that people should exercise for an hour a day to stay healthy, but @PERCENT1 of people fail to do so because of computers. This often happens when playing engaging games. One may plan to play for @NUM2 minutes, but it can easily turn into @NUM4 minutes or even an hour. Finally, over - using computers limits the time spent with family and friends. Although webcams allow virtual meetings, it is not the same as spending quality time in person. Therapist @PERSON3 emphasizes that friends and family are not permanent, and we should make the most of the time we have. If one's eyes are constantly on the computer screen, there will be little opportunity for such interactions. In conclusion, I hope you will take these concerns into consideration as there are significant drawbacks to excessive computer use in terms of exercise, enjoying nature, and social interaction.
469	471	1	2	I firmly believe that computers bring numerous benefits to society. They simplify our lives in multiple ways. Firstly, computers have made life easier. They offer a more convenient means of looking up information compared to relying on a person or a book. Typing reports has become much simpler, as we no longer need to worry about making mistakes on a typewriter and having to re - type the entire document. Computers can save reports and even help us identify some errors. Additionally, they can assist in taking care of children from home. Secondly, computers have revolutionized communication. Through social networks like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, we can talk online with friends, including those we don't usually see or talk to. These platforms also make it easier and more enjoyable to make new friends. Thirdly, computers are great teachers. They can teach us about places we've never visited. We can get answers to any question on the internet, and they also help develop hand - eye coordination through online games or games with @CAPS3's. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people of all ages. Their technology simplifies our lives, enhances communication, and broadens our knowledge, which is why I believe they are beneficial to society.
470	472	1	2	@ORGANIZATION1, I concur with technology majors who believe that the use of computers has a positive effect on people. I think computers are essential for social interaction, homework, research, and entertainment. After school, @PERCENT1 of teens head straight to their computers. They log into social media platforms like Facebook, MySpace, Formspring, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, etc. With proper time management, these websites are important for social interaction. They are also a great way to stay in touch with long - distance family and friends. For example, I've made friends at @DATE1 camp, some of whom are across the ocean in @LOCATION2. Facebook allows me to keep in touch without incurring high long - distance call costs. Similarly, my family members in @LOCATION1 are far away, and I can see pictures of my new cousin on Facebook instead of spending money on envelopes, stamps, and prints. In terms of schoolwork, three out of five homework assignments require a computer. Whether it's taking a test, defining a word, or working on a project using PowerPoint and other Microsoft documents, the computer and internet are indispensable for research and academic success. Some people worry that people are spending too much time on the computer and that children are becoming lazy. However, in a recent vote, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 mothers preferred their children to play and interact on the computer rather than being couch - potatoes. The computer offers many forms of entertainment, especially on rainy days. In conclusion, computers play a vital role in our lives, facilitating social interaction, aiding in schoolwork, and providing entertainment, and they have a positive impact on people.
471	473	1	2	The impact of computers on society is a double - edged sword. On one hand, they offer numerous benefits. They educate people about @CAPS1 regions, including how others live, obtain food, and raise children. For law enforcement, computers are invaluable. Cops can use them to search for suspects and check if a speeder has a prior record. In the educational field, teachers can find lessons or teaching materials, and it can also assist with typing skills. Many individuals perform better when working on a computer, like when writing a high - school paper. Moreover, the computer allows people to interact with others and make @CAPS1 friends. On the other hand, there are significant drawbacks. When meeting people online, one often has no idea about their identity or background. Some may have a criminal history and could involve you in trouble due to their personal issues. Excessive computer use is also a problem. Some people become so engrossed in their online relationships that they neglect their family. Physical activity is often sacrificed as well; people who used to exercise regularly stop and never resume. Some individuals even stay home on the computer instead of participating in outdoor activities or family gatherings. In conclusion, while computers bring many conveniences, we must be cautious of their negative impacts and use them in a balanced way.
472	474	1	2	Do you enjoy using the computer? After reading this, you might change your mind. It's known that a large portion of @ORGANIZATION1's population uses computers. Spending @NUM1 hour on the computer can damage your eyes, and you may end up needing glasses, which is not desirable. Sometimes, it's difficult to stay away from computers. The internet has multiple uses. It enables communication with friends and family and provides a platform for gaming. Additionally, computers are great for learning. You can study about presidents or explore your family history. Given the potential harm to your eyes, it's advisable to limit computer use to @NUM2 or @NUM3 minutes. This is what I would recommend to safeguard your health and still make use of the computer's benefits. In the end, being mindful of computer usage is crucial for both physical and overall well - being.
473	475	1	2	As @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 technology advances, the proportion of Americans using computers has steadily increased. Among them, @PERCENT1 are children aged from @NUM1 to @NUM2. Most teens use computers to socialize on platforms like @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and Facebook or to play online games. However, there are other teens who face cyberbullying or are put at risk by interacting with strangers. I believe we should limit our technology use. Social media platforms are growing at an alarming rate, causing many teens to prefer staying on the computer over outdoor activities. I, too, have accounts on @CAPS2, Facebook, and @CAPS3, and they have prevented me from getting enough exercise. I often wonder how to break this attachment. I've started going for runs, studying more, and spending time with my family to reduce my dependence. Online gaming is another concern. Many kids, especially boys as I've observed at school, are obsessed with it. But only the website owners truly benefit. These games are not educational and are a waste of time. Instead, kids should be studying, doing homework, or hanging out with friends. Cyberbullying and the risk of interacting with strangers on chats are also significant issues. For kids who are bullied at school, the computer was once a refuge, but now it can be a source of more problems. Limiting computer use or implementing parental controls can help prevent these issues. In conclusion, while computer usage has advantages, safety, health, and education are major concerns due to modern technology. I hope my thoughts on this matter are considered, and I look forward to your response via email within the next three days.
474	476	1	2	I firmly believe that computers have a highly positive impact on people worldwide. They offer a wide range of functions. For academic work, they are extremely useful. You can also communicate with others on the internet and learn interesting facts about famous people like @PERSON1. I recall working on a project using the computer and getting a @NUM1 grade because of it. This clearly demonstrates the computer's helpfulness. In daily life, computers can teach you about different places and cuisines. For example, if you want to make pizza but don't know how, you can search for instructions on the computer. A professor from New York Tech School in Virginia stated that the world would be nothing without computers. @PERCENT1 of the people at the school agreed, while @PERCENT2 disagreed. Imagine a world without computers; we wouldn't have cell phones or TVs. We might not even know about these technologies. Without computers, the world would be lost, just as the professor said. Teenagers would be bored without computers as most of them don't like outdoor activities. Adults would also face difficulties in their work; they would have to hand - write everything, and let's face it, some people's handwriting is not legible. In conclusion, computers are incredibly beneficial for everyone. The entire world should continue to use them because without computers, we would regress to a time of limited information and productivity.
475	477	1	2	The opinion of @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 is quite concerning. There is a growing problem of people getting addicted to @CAPS2, such as games, websites, communication, and email platforms. Many individuals, like those addicted to @CAPS3, are overly dependent on computers. Those addicted to @CAPS3 often get caught up in online conversations and observing others. This addiction leads to negative consequences. In school, students may perform poorly as they don't focus on their studies, resulting in bad grades. Socially, they may lose touch with family and friends, becoming lonely and depressed. In essence, the computer becomes their only companion. Another issue is the impact on physical health. If someone is addicted to a website, they tend to be sedentary and can easily gain weight. In @LOCATION1, there is already a high obesity rate, and excessive computer use only exacerbates the problem. To address these issues, people need to spend more time with friends and engage in physical exercise. Staying away from excessive computer use is essential for a healthy and balanced life. In conclusion, we must break free from computer addiction to lead a more fulfilling and healthy lifestyle.
476	478	1	2	Computers have become ubiquitous, serving thousands of purposes. In @LOCATION1, many of us spend hours each day fixated on our computer screens. However, excessive reliance on computers is not beneficial. On @DATE1, numerous individuals spend countless hours on their computers instead of engaging in other activities.  Computers are not the ideal way to spend one's time as they lead to less exercise, potential decline in school grades, and weakened communication skills. Firstly, spending excessive time on the keyboard leaves less time for physical activities such as running or playing with friends. In @LOCATION1 on @DATE1, the prevalence of obesity is increasing, potentially due to the fact that many people prefer to use their laptops for shopping, watching movies, and even obtaining a college education. Fewer people go for walks as they would rather be on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1. Without the constant use of computers, people would have more free time to go outside or participate in sports.  Secondly, many children and teenagers are attached to their laptops and carry them everywhere. Instead of studying for tests, they often spend time on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1. They choose to use these platforms rather than opening their books. Moreover, spending long hours on the computer reduces the time available for homework, leading to a situation where they may stop doing it altogether. Computers consume time that could be better spent on pursuing a college education.  Lastly, with the availability of email and online chat, many people on @DATE1 prefer to communicate with others via their laptops rather than in person. This can result in a lack of communication skills. What may seem appropriate online could sound inappropriate in real - world interactions. This loss of skill may lead to a generation more accustomed to cyber - talk than @CAPS3.  In conclusion, it is better to spend time outside or with friends rather than being glued to the computer. Personally, I would rather engage in other activities than be confined to a computer indoors.
477	479	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, there is an ongoing debate about whether technological advancements, such as computers, are beneficial to our daily lives. In my opinion, computers are a valuable addition for several reasons.  One of the main advantages of computers is the easy access to information and knowledge. With just a few clicks, one can obtain any information they desire. Although some may consider platforms like email, @CAPS2, and @CAPS1 to be wasteful or dangerous, they also offer the opportunity to make new friends every day. Additionally, time limits can be set to prevent excessive computer use.  Computers provide us with quick access to knowledge. Any topic of interest can be found on the web. For homework, school projects, and work, the web offers information that may not be available elsewhere. While the library is a great resource, when in a hurry, online encyclopedias and resources like World Book are more convenient. Technology has become an integral part of our lives, and although opinions vary, one thing that everyone can agree on is that it is fast and simplifies daily tasks. Online shopping for clothes, books, movies, and tickets is just one example of how computers make life easier.  Computers also play a crucial role in maintaining social connections. Friends and family may not always live nearby; they could be in another state, country, or even on the other side of the world. Platforms like @CAPS2, @CAPS1, and email allow us to connect with people globally at any time. Email has been around for a long time, and newer websites like @CAPS2 and MySpace enable us to stay updated on others' daily lives. @CAPS1 or iChat allows for instant communication. While these platforms cannot replace in - person interactions, they help us stay in touch.  To address concerns about excessive computer use, time limits can be set. Spending too much time indoors on the computer can be unhealthy as it reduces exercise and time spent outside. By setting a specific time limit, users can be reminded when there are @NUM1 minutes left, encouraging them to spend more time outdoors.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are a beneficial part of our lives. They offer easy access to information, help us stay connected with friends and family, and time limits can be used to manage usage. In today's age, computers have become indispensable.
478	480	1	2	Do you truly believe that computers have a positive impact? Don't you think that too many people spend excessive time on their computers? You've asked me to write to the local newspaper about my views on the effects of computers on people, and I firmly believe they have a negative impact.  When people are on the computer, it can cause headaches and eye strain. Instead, they could be outside exercising. One of the main reasons I think computers have a bad effect is addiction. There are many things people can get addicted to, such as Facebook, MySpace, and Formspring. For instance, when my sister gets home, the first thing she does is go on Facebook, Formspring, and YouTube.  Another reason is eye damage. When you stare at a computer screen for a long time, you may not notice, but your eyes are being damaged. I needed glasses in sixth grade because I was addicted to the computer for so long, and my eyes were severely affected.  Computers are also a waste of time. When it's sunny outside, you should be outside with friends, family, or just taking a walk instead of being at home on the computer. Moreover, when you're on the computer, you could be doing more productive things.  Although some may think computers have positive effects, they actually damage our bodies. These are the reasons I believe computers have a bad impact on people. Instead of spending time on the computer, people should join a sports club. It's time to take action by creating more clubs and activities. The problem is that people spend too much time on the computer, and these are my reasons for opposing their excessive use.
479	481	1	2	"Dear newspaper, I understand that you are writing an article on whether computers are helpful to society. In my view, computers are a great addition to society as they play a significant role in jobs across the country and provide accessible information.  Computers have proven to be essential in job profiles worldwide. Consider a salesperson, for example. Salespeople rely on computers to store data, such as on @ORGANIZATION3. A study conducted by the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 found that @PERCENT1 of jobs in @LOCATION1 require the use of computers. Dr. @DR1, a computer programmer at To Go Industries, stated in an interview with the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that ""computers are present in everyone's life, especially in the workplace."" People who work with computers find it easier to calculate and store data compared to those without computer access. In a way, computers act as a helping brain for hard - working individuals.  Students also benefit greatly from having access to global information. I believe that @PERCENT2 of people would agree that students around the world often need to research information for class topics. A @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2 in @CAPS6 said, ""I prefer using the internet for research at @ORGANIZATION2. It's much faster than searching through books, and people from around the world share their opinions online, unlike a book with only a few authors.""  Take the example of @PERSON1. One day, he was in the library with his class, assigned to research a topic in a book. He read five books and only managed to get half a page of notes for his assignment. The next day, when he was allowed to use the @ORGANIZATION2 computer, he got three pages of notes. ""I was so relieved to log on to the internet,"" @PERSON1 reported. A survey by the @CAPS8 foundation showed that students prefer using computers for research.  In conclusion, computers are a magnificent part of society. They assist many jobs in @LOCATION1 and help students access information. I sincerely hope you share my view on the importance of computers in today's world. What is your opinion on computers?"
480	482	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 of Newspaper, there is a concern that computers are a menace to society, but in fact, they are very helpful.  Computers can assist in finding directions. If you need to go to a place, especially one that is far away or has a complex route, there are detailed maps on the computer. Specialists claim that over @PERCENT1 of viewers reach their destinations using these maps. This is beneficial for those with limited driving skills. Computers also provide instructions on how to make things. For example, if you want to make a cake, you can find recipes on the computer. They can also support project - making. For instance, they offer information about @CAPS3 mythology for creating a @CAPS3 - themed project. Additionally, there is software on the computer that can teach languages. Similar to language books, but with animated teachers, it can help people learn languages. Reading in different languages on the computer can also improve normal reading skills.  Computers are also useful for people with reading difficulties. Did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 Americans have trouble reading? Computers can provide a lot of reading practice as almost everything on the computer needs to be read. Moreover, using a computer can improve hand - eye coordination. When typing on Microsoft Word or using other applications, people watch the screen rather than their hands. There are also many games on the computer designed to enhance this skill.  Finally, computers are a great source of entertainment. There are numerous fun games for all ages on the internet, and platforms like YouTube offer a wide range of funny videos.  In conclusion, computers are helpful in multiple ways. They can provide directions, assist with reading, improve hand - eye coordination, and offer entertainment. They are a valuable tool in our lives.
481	483	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, the impact of computers on society encompasses both positive and negative aspects. A negative consequence is the tendency to become tired and lazy. When one spends more than @NUM1 minutes on the computer, lethargy sets in, and the motivation to get up diminishes. This issue affects many people as of @DATE1, especially those who rely on computers for work. Kids are particularly vulnerable; after school, they often prefer sitting in front of the computer rather than engaging in other activities. Limiting computer usage would be beneficial for kids, adults, and overall brain health. Adults who spend excessive time on the computer for work or checking emails frequently neglect family and social interactions. I can relate to this as my @CAPS4 dad is constantly on the computer for work and rarely talks to us. Sometimes, I wish computers had never been invented because they can be so frustrating. However, it's also important to take breaks from computers and spend quality family time. Technologies like emailing, chatting on @CAPS3, AIM, and @CAPS2 are useful forms of communication. For instance, if someone can't text or doesn't have a phone, these platforms offer an alternative. My @CAPS4 dad often uses emails to communicate with my soccer coach about my game attendance, and it's very convenient. @CAPS3 is also a great way for kids to interact, especially if they don't have phones or don't see each other at school. In conclusion, computers present a mix of positives and negatives, including issues like laziness, lack of social interaction, and the benefits of communication.
482	484	1	2	While the majority of people view the invention of computers as a positive development, I hold a different opinion. The invention of computers, which grants access to the internet, brings numerous drawbacks. The internet is rife with inappropriate content such as pictures, writing, and games, and it also has the problem of unclear identification. The most concerning aspect is the uncertainty of the identities of internet users. On social websites like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, a profile might claim to belong to a fourteen - year - old, but in reality, it could be a forty - year - old who has just been released from prison. There is no reliable way to ensure the safety of online interactions. Internet games are also highly detrimental. They are one of the contributing factors to obesity in America. Moreover, they draw kids away from their families and can lead to addiction. Staring at the computer screen for extended periods due to gaming can cause eye - strain. Additionally, the internet hosts inappropriate content like bomb - making websites and illegal music - downloading platforms. Overall, although computers are useful for research, they are unreliable in terms of safety and can lead to obesity and family disputes.
483	485	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on people. One of the problems is that kids are deprived of physical activity, which is essential for their daily exercise. They spend so much time on the computer that they miss out on the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors. Additionally, computers prevent kids from spending quality time with family and friends. I can't understand how people can sit in front of a computer all day without moving. First, kids don't get enough exercise because of excessive computer use. Almost everyone has a computer, including me, but that doesn't mean we should use it constantly. As an athlete who enjoys using the computer, I still make sure not to be glued to it all the time. Doctors recommend that everyone gets at least an hour of exercise every day, but many people who use computers or other electronics a lot fail to meet this requirement. This lack of exercise is contributing to childhood obesity. If kids just sit in front of the computer all day, they are likely to become overweight. People need to step away from the computer and engage in activities like sports or games. Second, people are missing out on the outdoors. If someone likes sports, they should invite friends to play basketball instead of spending three hours on @CAPS4. Even simple activities like walking home from school with a friend are a great way to be outside. During winter, people often think there's nothing to do, but having a snowball fight with friends can be a lot of fun. No one should feel embarrassed to play games like tag, regardless of their age. There are countless activities to do outside rather than being on the computer. Kids should enjoy their youth before they have to face the serious aspects of life. Lastly, when people are on the computer, they are not spending time with friends and family. Chatting on @CAPS4 is not the same as hanging out in person. It's easy to invite friends over by simply sending a message. I don't understand why some people find it embarrassing to spend time with their family. My dad and I enjoy playing basketball and ping - pong together. People should find activities that their parents like and try them out. In conclusion, it's important to reduce computer use and focus on exercise, outdoor activities, and socializing with loved ones.
484	486	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, I often wonder about the extent to which computers affect our lives. Technology has advanced significantly, making our lives more convenient. However, it has also changed people's behavior. For example, with the invention of cars, people have stopped walking and exercising, they spend less time with family and friends, and they miss out on the wonderful things happening outside. I believe that technology, especially computers, takes up a large portion of our lives by doing much of the work for us. First, the issue of obesity is becoming increasingly severe. In @LOCATION1, the obesity rate is rising rapidly. People are getting fatter by sitting in front of a computer, eating, and not exercising at all. Instead of playing sports like soccer, volleyball, or baseball, or even going for a run, they are glued to the computer playing games that offer no real benefits. I asked a woman about her thoughts on this, and she said, ""I think that people don't think about their health; they just want to make life easier."" I completely agree with her. Obesity can lead to serious health problems and even hospital visits. Second, we should also consider the amount of time we spend with our friends and family. Maybe some people bought a computer because they were spending too much time outside and not with their family. But now, they are often at home, in front of the computer, still not spending quality time with their loved ones. Spending time with family is crucial as we might miss out on important events like family parties or simply watching a TV show together. Lastly, if you are a parent and you are constantly on the computer, you might feel terrible if you miss important moments in your child's life, such as their first word. We often miss out on wonderful things because of technology, and we don't want to regret it later. In conclusion, many people have become addicted to computers. We should make sure to give time to real - life experiences, exercise, and social interactions, or we might end up hating ourselves for missing out on so many wonderful things."
485	487	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I think some people are overreacting about the negative effects of computers. It's not going to kill you, although I'm not advocating for people to be on the computer all day. Nowadays, almost everyone has a computer. First, many people seem to be overreacting. They claim that spending time on the computer means missing out on life. However, when using a computer, people are still interacting with family and friends, just through typing instead of verbal communication. I don't understand why there is so much opposition to computers. It's similar to the issue of global warming, where there are many warnings but few people listen. So, it's unlikely that people will heed the warnings about the potential negative effects of excessive computer use, such as weight gain. That's just my take on this topic. Second, a computer can't actually kill you. It's just a machine. While it's true that excessive computer use can lead to obesity and boredom, I can't even stay on the computer for more than an hour because it gives me a headache. This is another one of my opinions. Finally, computers are ubiquitous today. They are not the sole cause of obesity. Everyone, including my mom, has a Facebook account. There are also other types of websites like sexual, gaming, and friendship - based sites. I believe Facebook is the most popular because so many people use it. In conclusion, I've shared my views on how some people overreact, how a computer isn't likely to kill you, and the widespread use of computers in today's society.
486	488	1	2	Computers have little to no negative effect on people; rather, they assist us significantly. They are useful in fields such as research, medicine, and can even help in detecting cancer. People often visualize computers as the machines placed in a room and frequently used, sometimes just for entertainment instead of research. However, there are more advanced computers that scientists utilize daily. Computers do have a positive impact on us. Many kids play games or listen to music on computers out of boredom and perhaps use them a bit too often. For me, I only use the computer on rainy days when I can't go outside. Humans mainly use computers because they simplify life. For instance, instead of handwriting a report, one can type it; instead of searching through a book, one can directly access the information. Also, to stay updated on a favorite sports team, one can visit their website instead of attending the game. In my view, computers have a beneficial effect on us. I'm a sports enthusiast, so I play sports regularly and use the computer for both fun and research. It doesn't affect my lifestyle as I still exercise and play with friends daily. There's no reason why people can't use computers frequently. Computers don't always have a positive effect, but they don't always have a negative one either. I exercise, enjoy nature, interact with friends and family, and also use the computer often. Experts shouldn't be overly concerned about people using computers too much.
487	489	1	2	Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, I understand both perspectives regarding the importance of computers. However, computers have revolutionized our way of life. Just imagine what the world would be like without them. I believe computers are an essential aspect of our lives, especially for students and teachers. For example, if a student needs to write a report on @LOCATION1, they can search for facts on the computer, condense them into a paragraph in a word - document, and email their teachers if they have questions. Finally, they can print the finished report. This way, they don't have to bother their parents to go to the bookstore and spend @NUM1 on a book they may only read once. Also, without computers, there would be limited communication outside of school. Another example is online textbooks, which save students from carrying heavy textbooks home. I know computers have made my schoolwork and other tasks much easier. Secondly, @PERCENT1 of businesses claim to use computers daily, and some agree that their businesses would fail without them. Computers simplify business operations, especially with business management and file - keeping programs. Businesses can store customer information, compare income, and manage inventory on a computer without a cluttered file cabinet. They can also save money by eliminating jobs like record - keepers. Additionally, businesses can save time by having meetings via webcam instead of having people travel long distances for each meeting. They can also email important things like sales projections. Computers are also useful at home. People can do grocery shopping, order pizza, and shop online. They can pay bills online, which saves paper. Suppose a mother has a sick child and wants to know how to heal him, what to feed him, and what medicine to give. She can look up this information on the computer and bookmark the websites for future reference. Computers have made life much easier for mothers. Without computers, our lives would be much more difficult. If the student couldn't use a computer for the report, they might fail. The sick child might not get proper care, and the hungry child might be fed unhealthy food. Clearly, computers are an important part of our lives.
488	490	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, have you ever known someone who lives far away? Or have you ever used @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3? These are just some of the capabilities of computers. Computers have greatly benefited society. They enable people to communicate, learn skills through games, and present information with images, making things easier. Firstly, computers simplify communication. Without computers, three inconvenient things would occur when we want to talk to someone: getting in trouble at school, memorizing and dialing a phone number, or talking to the person in person, which can be annoying. Clearly, computers make it easier to communicate. Moreover, computers allow us to connect with far - away friends and family. We can write emails or chat with them. This has been helpful to me as I communicate with a friend in @LOCATION1 and recently sent an email to my aunt. Undoubtedly, computers make communication easy regardless of distance. Secondly, every computer I've seen can play games, either from a disk or on a website. These games can teach us various skills. For example, typing skills can be learned. A few days ago, I played a game where I had @NUM1 seconds to type as many words as possible, as fast as possible. The game becomes more challenging as it progresses, starting from three - letter words to seven - letter words. Also, in an information - processing class at @CAPS4, after finishing assignments, we could play type - to - learn @NUM2, a typing game. Some games require strategic thinking to win. They teach us to be prepared for various situations, process information around us, and make quick decisions, which are useful in real - life scenarios. Tower - defense games are another type. They train teenagers to think critically as if their lives depend on it. If we were to join the army and become a captain, we could organize troops effectively based on the skills learned from these games. These games also teach us to plan ahead and make better decisions, such as choosing between a weaker upgrade now or saving for a stronger one later. Games can be fun and educational. Lastly, computers make tasks easier and display images on @ORGANIZATION2. In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial in communication, skill - building, and simplifying daily tasks.
489	491	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, it's evident that more and more people are using computers, and the question is whether it's good or bad. In my opinion, computers can be bad as people are spending too much time on them. People are spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I remember a time when my friend used to spend most of his day on the computer, not even for schoolwork. He would bring food upstairs, throw the plates on the floor, and go to sleep without doing anything productive. Despite our efforts to make him clean up, he didn't. When I invited him to go out for a walk, he refused, saying he could ""walk"" on the computer. Eventually, he became obese, and the doctor diagnosed him with obesity. But he didn't seem to care. Now, he has diabetes. We've repeatedly told him that spending too much time on the computer is bad. Another reason is that people need to learn to enjoy nature and get outside. I recall a friend who would stay indoors on the computer for days. When I asked him to come out, he always refused. One day, when he had to go out to get new computer software, he was scared of the light and ran back inside. This clearly shows that spending too much time on computers is harmful. In conclusion, excessive computer use has negative impacts on people's physical health and their ability to enjoy the real world."
490	492	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I've heard your discussion about whether computers are good or bad. In my opinion, computers are a bad thing. Firstly, the time people spend on computers could be used for outdoor activities, especially on nice days. It's undeniable that technology, particularly computers, is one of the main reasons people are becoming obese. Secondly, some people use computers for inappropriate purposes. It's puzzling why computer makers don't block such content. It's disturbing that some people create these inappropriate websites. From my computer class, I've learned that computers can be misused in more inappropriate ways than I ever imagined. The @CAPS1 and final reason is that some people have shared too much information on computers and have suffered injuries. The internet may seem like fun and games until someone gets hurt, as my mom says. In conclusion, I'm not a fan of computers. The reasons are that kids don't get enough exercise, people are doing inappropriate things on them, and they can be used to cause injury or even death. These are the reasons why computers are a bad thing. Please keep these points in mind.
491	493	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I firmly believe that computers bring significant benefits to society. They offer a faster and more efficient way to accomplish various tasks. For instance, in communication, email serves as a valuable tool. When one is swamped with work and lacks the time to engage in a phone conversation or simply doesn't wish to spend an extended period on the phone, email provides a convenient alternative. It eliminates the need to wait for the recipient to answer the phone, which could be time - consuming, and also avoids the issue of a dead phone battery or the recipient not answering when urgent information needs to be conveyed.  Computers are also excellent for information retrieval. If someone is planning a trip, they can use the computer to search for hotels, obtain maps, and book plane tickets. They can even get a virtual preview of the destination. In an academic context, when a student has a school project but insufficient time for extensive reading, the internet offers a wealth of resources. Whether it's researching a country, a president, an animal, or looking for pictures, the internet has it all. Additionally, for building projects such as plastering a wall, buying a window, or constructing a shed, one can find detailed instructions and information about the necessary supplies on the internet.  In the professional realm, computers are indispensable. Architects, for example, can use them to create detailed sketches of buildings. Moreover, computers are crucial for data storage. Doctors' offices store patient information in computers, and the government also uses them to safeguard sensitive data. There are also jobs related to computers, such as computer repair and manufacturing.  In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial to society. Without them, many people would be unemployed, and various aspects of life, including fast communication and work - related guidance, would become significantly more challenging and limited.
492	494	1	2	"Dear Newspaper, the @CAPS1 generation has grown up in an era dominated by the complex technology of computers. Through my years of using them, I've come to realize that they are not as helpful as they initially seem. They can lead to addiction and create numerous distractions.  Many doctors have pointed out that computers are linked to ""the new depression."" The internet, in particular, is a major contributor. For a large number of teenagers, having accounts on social networks like Facebook, MySpace, or Formspring is extremely common. From personal experiences, I've witnessed how some people abuse these platforms to bully others. As a result, individuals not only face ridicule in school but also in the virtual world of cyberspace. This often leads to social depression, and it can be incredibly difficult for people to escape from this negative cycle, which in turn causes high levels of anxiety.  Addiction to computers is another significant problem. A large number of people are so engrossed in the internet that they spend a substantial amount of their free time on it. Approximately @PERCENT1 of computer users claim to be addicted. I know from my own experience that there is always something on the internet that lures you back in. If you spend more than an hour a day on the computer, it's a sign of addiction. Parents often attribute this to a lack of self - control, but many adults also struggle with the same issue. Since they are relatively new to using computers, they frequently go through a phase of addiction. This addiction problem could be completely eradicated if we stopped using computers.  Computers also create numerous distractions for students. When students sit down to write papers, they often have multiple windows open simultaneously, which severely hampers their productivity. Social networks exacerbate this problem. Constantly chatting with others on these platforms can cause students to lose track of time. Multitasking on the internet while trying to complete schoolwork often leads to lower grades and incomplete homework.  In conclusion, computers do more harm than good. They cause social depression and anxiety, lead to addiction that takes over people's lives, and create distractions that make it difficult to concentrate. I firmly believe that computers have negative effects and should be completely eliminated."
493	495	1	2	Dear Local newspaper, did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 obese children spend @NUM3 or more hours a day on a computer? While computers may be fast and convenient, they are one of the reasons why our country has become one of the most obese countries in the world.  Computers are detrimental to humans for several reasons. Firstly, they prevent people from enjoying nature. As we are aware, forests are being cut down, and pollution is causing significant damage to our planet. To truly save our world, people need to experience the beauty of nature firsthand. However, being on a computer keeps people indoors. Depending on one's job or school schedule, people can spend at least 6 - @NUM2 hours a day inside.  Secondly, computers take away from the time that should be spent with friends and family. Prolonged computer use can make people anti - social. After spending a long time on the computer, individuals may forget how to interact with others. If there are millions of such people in society, it will soon become chaotic. Some people become so obsessed with their computers that their families may leave them, and they may fall into depression.  Finally, computers are a waste of time, money, and effort. They also reduce the time available for exercise and maintaining good health. With less time to exercise, people are more likely to gain weight and become obese. Moreover, a lack of exercise makes the body more susceptible to diseases and injuries. Those without healthcare may not be able to afford the medical bills and could even become homeless.  In conclusion, the negative impacts of computers on our lives are evident. They prevent us from enjoying nature, spending time with loved ones, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, we should be more cautious about our computer use.
494	496	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, would you like it if your children spent all their time on the computer? I certainly wouldn't. The excessive use of computers by children and even adults can lead to several problems.  Firstly, it reduces the time spent with family. For example, @PERCENT2 of people are so absorbed in their computers that they neglect their children. I recall reading on Facebook about a man who was so engrossed in a game that he didn't answer the phone when informed that his son had been hit by a car. Can you imagine your child going through such a situation?  Secondly, it has a negative impact on health. A study shows that @PERCENT3 of internet users do not exercise or work out. Among them, @PERCENT4 are suffering from obesity. My cousin, who is always on the computer, was told by the doctor to reduce his computer time because he is obese. He weighs @NUM1 pounds due to his excessive computer use. Do you want your children to face the same health issues?  Lastly, today's kids are overly obsessed with computers and computer - related language. @PERCENT1 of computer users use computer language in school, and many of them install internet access on their phones to use social networks like MySpace and Facebook. If you were to write computer language in your newspaper article, wouldn't you risk getting fired?  In conclusion, I hope you will take my concerns into consideration. Excessive computer use makes kids and adults unhealthy, causes kids to be overly obsessed with computers, and reduces the time spent with family. We need to find a balance and limit computer use to avoid these negative consequences.
495	497	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I am convinced that computers are having a profound and mostly negative impact on people's lives. More and more individuals are being drawn into the allure of what computers can do, while neglecting the more important aspects of life.  People should be engaging in physical exercise and spending quality time with friends and family. In reality, computers don't offer as much educational value as one might think. Many people fail to recognize that computers can deprive them of crucial elements of life.  One of the most significant issues is the lack of exercise. In this generation, there are more overweight and obese kids than in any other. People get so caught up in their computer activities that they forget to exercise regularly. Computers simply add to the list of excuses for inactivity. Watching TV already consumes a large amount of people's time, and studies have shown that it makes people less aware of the world and less connected to those around them. Computers are similar; you may think you'll be on for just a minute, but before you know it, @NUM1 hours have passed. While computers may exercise your brain to some extent, they don't provide the physical exercise that is essential for good health.  Even when using computers for school research, they may not be as helpful as expected. Due to lack of time, many people turn to the computer instead of going to the library. However, a large portion of the websites they visit contain incorrect information. You might read something that sounds reasonable, but it could be completely wrong. This can lead to poor grades on assignments that you thought you had aced. Moreover, most people don't know how to effectively search for information on the computer. They simply type their query into Google, click on the first link, and use the information on the page. Then, with multiple windows popping up, they quickly get lost and often give up, resorting to goofing off on the computer.  If people were to visit the library and conduct research the traditional way, they would notice the many things in life that they are missing out on. Instead of playing games on the computer, people should focus on their family and friends. Although you can communicate with others on the computer, it can't replace the real - life bonding experience.  In conclusion, computers are not beneficial overall. They lead to a lack of exercise, provide false information, and distract people from spending time with their loved ones. We should prioritize the important things in life and reduce our over - reliance on computers.
496	498	1	2	"To the concerned parties at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, specifically @CAPS4 @CAPS5, envision a world without computers. In such a scenario, drivers would struggle to maintain control while navigating the roads, as they would have difficulty managing the steering wheel and observing the surroundings simultaneously. Phone bills would skyrocket since people would have limited alternatives for communication. Moreover, students would be extremely anxious at home, lacking access to study materials. Computers have a profound impact on various aspects of our lives. They facilitate the development of hand - eye coordination, offer numerous channels for communication, and enable students to learn and stay informed from the comfort of their homes. Therefore, computers should remain an essential part of our daily lives.  Firstly, computers should be retained in our community because they can teach hand - eye coordination, even to young children. A recent report from @ORGANIZATION2 indicates that in the past five years, the number of driving students who pass their exams on the first attempt has nearly doubled. Video games, computer mice, and typing train the young brain to work in harmony with the body's arms, fingers, and other appendages. As @PERSON1, the head of surgery at @ORGANIZATION1 hospital, states, ""Hand - eye coordination is crucial not only on the road."" He further adds that younger doctors, who grew up playing video and computer games, can perform robotic surgeries with greater precision compared to their older colleagues. Without the coordination acquired from using computers, many jobs would be out of reach. When surveyed, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 local business managers stated that they would prefer an employee who can type over one who cannot. Thus, computers can teach valuable hand - eye coordination skills that last a lifetime.  Secondly, computers should be present in homes as they enable people to communicate with others globally. In a @DATE1 poll, only @PERCENT1 of @NUM3 - year - olds had e - pals, but a recent poll shows that this figure has increased to @PERCENT2. Computers have opened up diverse communication channels, including email, @CAPS8, and social networking sites. Parenting expert @CAPS9 notes that parents prefer their teenagers to communicate via email or @CAPS8 rather than talking on the phone, as it keeps the house quiet, frees up the phone lines for others, and reduces phone bills. A friend of mine once only communicated online for a month, and her parents encouraged her because their phone bill decreased by a third. Evidently, although one may feel that computers consume time that could be spent with others, they actually provide a means to connect with people worldwide.  Finally, computers can assist students in learning. In today's schools, students rely on online homework postings and accessing e - books. Once, my brother forgot his book bag at school for a week but was able to obtain all the necessary study materials online. We were grateful as it alleviated the physical strain on his back. When surveyed, @PERCENT3 of @NUM4 graders reported using e - books at least twice a week. The internet is also a valuable research tool. @NUM5 out of @NUM2 high school students stated that they use printed books for research less than once a month. Clearly, the internet is an invaluable learning resource.  In conclusion, computers contribute to our development in terms of coordination, communication, and education. They have an overwhelmingly positive impact on individuals and society as a whole."
497	499	1	2	Nowadays, a large number of people use computers. Computers allow family and friends to interact, conduct research on various places and ideas, and enable users to create neatly formatted documents. However, computer technology also has its drawbacks. It discourages people from being physically active, exploring nature, and having face - to - face conversations with family and friends.  I'd like to share my personal views on computers. I really love computers. I spend a significant amount of time on @CAPS3 because it allows me to connect with friends I don't get to see often. I can even keep tabs on how my cousin in @LOCATION1 is doing. Computers are also very helpful with my homework. When I'm working on a project about a subject I don't fully understand, I can simply open my laptop, search for the information I need, and voila! I have all the details I require. After that, I can type up my report and select some pictures to print. Computers are amazing!  But I can understand the opposing view. Computers can be time - consuming. I admit that I've spent hours at a stretch on the computer, and this has become an issue. Experts claim that people are spending excessive time on computers and less time in the real world. My brother is a perfect example. He is obsessed with the @CAPS2. When my mom calls him down for dinner, he gets so engrossed in what he's doing that he skips the meal. His friends call him, but he ignores them until he finishes his game.  I agree that people shouldn't spend too much time on computers. You might have read this and wondered how I truly feel. Well, I was supposed to pick a side, but here's the thing. I love my laptop. I'm addicted to @CAPS3, but I still play sports, talk to my family, and enjoy taking walks in the woods or on the beach. I'm neutral on this issue, just like @CAPS4 from @CAPS5. Scientists say computers have positive effects on people, while some experts are concerned about their negative impacts. @PERSON1 believes both sides are right. Computers are wonderful and are one of the fastest - growing technologies in the world. However, we don't need to spend all our time on them. I hope you understand my perspective on this matter.
498	500	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that technology, particularly computers, has a positive impact on people. Similar to other electronic devices, computers can enhance hand - eye coordination. Additionally, many educators, such as teachers, utilize computers to access educational resources for their students, enabling them to learn about different people and places. Others use computers to communicate with family and friends who may be located in different towns, states, countries, or even continents. After reading this letter, I hope you will understand my reasoning.  Firstly, technology - enhanced dictionaries available on computers contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination. Before the widespread use of computers, people had limited success in writing quickly. They often resorted to using short notes or shorthand notations like ""w/"" or abbreviations. Today, with the help of computers, people can write more rapidly and form full words and sentences. Even when they initially struggle to express themselves clearly, computers assist them in putting their thoughts into proper sentences. Moreover, playing computer games further improves hand - eye coordination.  Secondly, teachers rely on computers to access a vast amount of schoolwork and information related to history and geography. A computer functions like an online schoolbook, capable of providing information on almost any topic. It can retrieve details such as the birth date of @PERSON1, the extinction of dinosaurs, or the current activities of the government. Computers can also store the knowledge one acquires. They are equipped with search engines like @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2, which help users locate the required information. Statistics reveal that more than @PERCENT1 of the world's population uses search engines to find information on the computer. These search engines offer access to websites, pictures, movies, maps, and more, making computers an indispensable tool for research.  Finally, computers offer a solution for those who don't want to travel long distances to visit relatives. They provide various means of connecting with others, mainly through email. Email is like a traditional letter but in electronic form. There is also @CAPS1, which functions similarly. With a special camera connected to the computer, one can have face - to - face conversations with relatives. There is no need to travel to @LOCATION1 to see loved ones.  In conclusion, most people utilize computers effectively. They gain hand - eye coordination skills, learn important facts about people and places, and can communicate with others regardless of distance. Clearly, computers are a valuable and positive part of society."
499	501	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, do you agree with my view that people are spending too much time on computers instead of exercising? Let me explain the reasons.  First, more and more people are using computers, but the question is how it benefits them. In my opinion, computers are an addictive technology that makes people lazy and slow. Can using the computer solve the problems you have with your family? Absolutely not! I speak from personal experience. My mom is always on Facebook, and I really hate it. I feel that she loves the computer more than me. Do you want your kids to have such thoughts? As time passes, her time on the computer keeps increasing. There was a time when I needed her help with my homework, and I was thinking about how the computer was taking her away from me. I'm not saying this out of anger; I'm just trying to point out that computers, in this way, don't benefit anyone.  Second, I want to inform the @CAPS12 @CAPS13 paper that people are spending more time on computers than exercising. The obesity rate has reached an all - time high, and I believe it has increased by @PERCENT1! This is unacceptable. People come home, pick up fast food like @CAPS15.K and other junk food, and then sit in front of the computer to eat. Over time, they gain weight, and their appearance deteriorates. They start to look sloppy, and no one wants to be around them. Eventually, they look back and regret their actions.  Finally, excessive computer use leads to less time spent with family. This causes a rift between family members. Children may pick up bad habits and do the opposite of what their parents want. This clearly shows that the computer is not beneficial at all.  In conclusion, I have explained why I dislike computers. They don't bring any real benefits, make people lazy, and keep them away from their families. So, does the local @CAPS13 paper agree with me?
500	502	1	2	Dear local newspaper, some people are starting to recognize that computers are having a negative impact on people. I am also of this opinion because some individuals become so engrossed in using computers that they spend all day on them, get addicted, and lose the motivation to do anything else.  One reason why computers are having a negative impact is that some people use them for studying all day. After coming home from school or work, they immediately turn on the computer and stay on it from @NUM1 to @NUM2 at night, repeating this routine day after day. Another reason is that people get addicted to the virtual world on the computer. They become so focused on their online friends and activities that they neglect their real - life relationships. Finally, sitting in front of the computer for long periods of time leads to a sedentary lifestyle.  In conclusion, these are the reasons why computers are having a negative impact on people. They cause addiction, disrupt real - life relationships, and promote an unhealthy lifestyle. It is important to be aware of these issues and find a balance in our use of computers.
501	503	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that using a computer is beneficial. It allows individuals to explore new technological aspects, such as educational games and informative websites. Moreover, it serves as a means of communication with acquaintances, especially when phone numbers are unknown or when there has been a long - standing gap in communication. A computer can enhance one's intelligence as it is not the sole activity in a person's day. When not using the computer, people engage in various activities like spending time with friends and family, eating, sleeping, working out, or doing homework. In my view, computer usage is a healthy choice. It offers learning opportunities comparable to those in a school environment. Additionally, continuous hand movement while using a computer strengthens hand and lower - arm muscles. In conclusion, computers are healthy and do not encroach on time for exercise, socializing, sports, sleep, or eating. Therefore, people should continue using computers while ensuring a balanced daily routine.
502	504	1	2	"Clicking sounds fill the air as ""@CAPS1!"" is typed. What if your computer freezes? What will you do then? Computers have a decidedly positive impact on people. They are a valuable source of information, a platform for socialization, and a tool for skill improvement. Imagine needing to conduct a research project but lacking access to the local library. With a home computer, all you need to do is sit down, type in a few keywords, and you'll obtain all the necessary information and more. The computer provides access to knowledge on just about every topic. Whether you're learning something new with limited printed resources or conducting in - depth research, the computer is your ally. Many wrongly assume that computers are only for entertainment. In fact, search engines like Google, Netrekker, and @LOCATION1 are brimming with valuable information. Reading on a computer can be more engaging than poring over a dull library book. Some may think that computers isolate people. However, there are numerous ways to socialize through computers, including email, instant messaging, and video chatting. Social networking platforms like MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr enable people to connect with relatives, friends, and even make new acquaintances safely. Computers also help improve skills. For instance, using a computer enhances hand - eye coordination as you look at the screen, type, and click the mouse. Typing strengthens hand muscles. Moreover, computers teach effective research skills, which are useful for future academic and personal research. Computers play an indispensable role in everyone's life, regardless of age, and undoubtedly have a positive effect."
503	505	1	2	Chances are, @PERCENT2 of you own a computer, and you might spend @NUM1 or even @NUM2 hours on it. However, computers have several drawbacks. Excessive computer use can lead to a sedentary lifestyle. Many kids spend long hours on platforms like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3, neglecting outdoor activities and exercise. This lack of physical activity is detrimental to a growing teen's health. It's essential to limit computer time and get some fresh air. Computers are also harmful to eyesight. Unlike video games that can be played from a distance, a computer is used just @NUM2 - 7 inches away from the screen. Over time, your eyes become accustomed to this close - range viewing, making it difficult to read at other distances. I knew a kid who played video games from about @NUM8 foot away for long periods and ended up blind. It's crucial to consider how close you sit to the computer. The internet contains an overwhelming amount of information, including inappropriate content. When researching a topic, something unrelated and inappropriate may pop up. Kids should not be exposed to such content, so it's important to be vigilant. After reading this, I hope you recognize that computers are harmful physically, mentally, and socially. Next time you're on a computer, keep these points in mind.
504	506	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I've noticed a debate about whether computers are useful. Some think they are, while others believe people spend too much time on them. In my opinion, computers are beneficial. They offer a convenient way to stay in touch with friends. If you haven't seen a friend in a while, you can email or search for them online. They're also great for long - distance communication with family members when phone calls are costly; you can use instant messaging instead. Computers are a valuable research tool. You can find information on any topic without having to visit the library and search for a specific book. They're available 24/7, making them ideal for homework. Moreover, if you need to buy something but can't afford it, you can often find it online at a lower price. Some online - only items aren't available in physical stores. However, it's important not to be on the computer all the time. While they're extremely helpful for socializing, schoolwork, and shopping, balance is key.
505	507	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I am convinced that many people are not reaping the benefits of computer use. There are far more rewarding activities than spending excessive time on the computer. Using the computer too much leads to less exercise, which has a negative impact on health. According to a study by @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of people who overuse computers are overweight. This high statistic is concerning. Excessive computer use can also lead to addiction, which may result in people accessing inappropriate websites and content. Additionally, staring at the computer all day can harm your eyes, making it difficult for them to adjust to different visual distances. Many people miss out on the beauty of nature because they rush to the computer as soon as they get home. Fresh air is beneficial for everyone, and it's a shame that so many people forgo this experience. I interviewed @PERSON1, who said that computers prevent people from staying updated on the world around them. There are also animals in need of help, but computer - obsessed individuals often miss these opportunities. Computer use also takes time away from family and friends. In some cases, parents addicted to computers neglect their family responsibilities. They may not assist their children with school projects or participate in family chores. Family parties are also affected; for example, my brother once ignored our family guests to sit on the computer. In conclusion, people should limit their computer time. By doing so, they can improve their health, enjoy nature, and strengthen family and social relationships. Thank you for considering my opinion.
506	508	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, since the invention of electricity, technology has advanced at a remarkable pace. Computers have evolved from room - sized behemoths to twelve - inch flat - screen monitors. In contemporary society, computers are essential tools that assist in file organization, research, and enjoyable online networking. They also enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about distant places, and facilitate online socialization. One might wonder how difficult life would be without computers. However, while performing our regular computer tasks, we often overlook that writing can overwork the hand nerves, leading to tendonitis or arthritis. Typing on computers is faster and less harmful to the hands. According to @PERSON1, the chief orthopedic surgeon of @ORGANIZATION1, ""Hand - eye coordination helps improve balance and athleticism."" Some individuals disagree, believing that excessive computer use can result in a lack of physical activity. There are portable computer devices like @CAPS3 that can be used outdoors while walking. Since I was ten years old, I've dreamed of visiting @LOCATION1. Although I couldn't afford a plane ticket, the internet allowed me to take virtual tours of the country's vibrant landscapes and ancient historical sites, making me feel as if I were actually there. @PERSON2, the creator of an online webcom called @ORGANIZATION2, developed this computer system to enable people worldwide to connect, see, and communicate with whomever they choose. I frequently use this program to talk to my sister at college, allowing us to socialize as if she were at home and learn about her college experiences."
507	509	1	2	Dear editor of the local newspaper, @CAPS1, did you know that the average person spends three or more hours daily on the computer? The time spent staring at a blank screen could be utilized for community service, exercise, or simply having fun with others. All this valuable time is wasted due to computers. Spending excessive time on a computer reduces the time spent with family and friends, causes health issues, and can even become addictive. Firstly, computers prevent us from spending quality time with our family and friends. After work or school, people often seek comfort from the web instead of engaging in more relaxing activities like playing games with family or going out with friends. Human relationships are transient, and every moment with loved ones is precious. Computer technology, which outlasts humans, fails to offer comfort when someone is down. For instance, a teenager being bullied online would find no real support from the computer. In contrast, if they were with family or friends, they could share their troubles and lift everyone's spirits. @CAPS2, time on the computer means less time with family and friends. Secondly, computers are detrimental to health. Staring at the screen can damage eyesight, especially for those with vision problems. Excessive typing also has its drawbacks. Moreover, computer use can be addictive. If someone finds an interesting website, they may visit it multiple times a day. Online games and social networks are also highly addictive. Computer addiction can lead to health problems and withdrawal symptoms when one tries to quit. It is crucial to limit computer time to prevent addiction. In conclusion, computer technology is harming humanity. It reduces time with loved ones, has negative health impacts, and contributes to a growing number of computer addicts. However, these issues could be avoided if people simply spent less time on the computer.
508	510	1	2	Dear editor, while computers do have some positive aspects, their negative effects far outweigh the benefits. @CAPS2 bullying is a prevalent and severe consequence of computer use. It has affected many children, and tragically, we have lost some to it. @CAPS2 bullying occurs in @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 kids. It is a social disease that must be eradicated as it has led to suicides, threats, and the loss of young lives. Without computers, this problem could be eliminated. Childhood obesity is also a significant issue in @LOCATION1, and computers are partly to blame. Kids should be outside playing with friends instead of being glued to the computer, which has become an addiction they can't break. Computers are not only harmful to kids but also to adults. Staring at computer screens for extended periods can damage eyesight, and since sight is often our most important sense, this is a serious concern. Online, people face extreme harassment, and the bright screens are harmful to the delicate human eyes. Clearly, computers do not benefit society. Kids should be exercising outdoors rather than sitting at home on the computer. Everyone should unplug their computers permanently and avoid using them again to protect the well - being of individuals and society as a whole.
509	511	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are not bad. A computer can be a valuable tool, helping with learning, chatting with friends, and providing entertainment. It can also pave the way for success in life. For example, it can assist in learning computer engineering, a well - paying job that involves fixing computers. Although computer engineering may seem challenging initially, search websites can provide all the necessary answers. Chatting is extremely popular among kids, adults, and teenagers. It has its pros and cons. On the one hand, it helps save on phone bills by reducing the need for long - distance calls. On the other hand, excessive computer use can damage eyesight, so it's important not to get too close to the screen. The computer is a source of great fun, with millions of websites to explore. Some of my favorite ones are @CAPS2.com, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS3.com, which offer a wide range of games for both kids and adults. I've demonstrated that computers are beneficial as they aid in learning, cut down on phone expenses, and are highly entertaining. Admittedly, they may reduce exercise time or harm eyesight, but these issues can be mitigated by setting a time limit for computer use and maintaining a safe distance from the screen.
510	512	1	2	Dear People, computers are not entirely a good thing. When you think about it, people often get so engrossed in chatting or social networking that they don't want to log off. This is a waste of time as that time could be spent on more meaningful activities. If you have kids, excessive computer use means less time with them. Instead of helping with homework, having meals together, or just relaxing as a family, some people, like mothers with children, spend all their time online. This can lead to kids developing bad habits and staying out late. You also need time for yourself, such as cleaning the house, cooking for your husband, going shopping, or taking your kids to the mall. Computers just make us lazy and don't offer real comfort. If you're working, you should focus on your work or hang out with friends instead of spending @NUM1 hours on the computer. You could call friends over, go shopping, or do some cleaning at home. However, there are some good aspects of computers. You can find any information you need, look at interesting things, and talk to distant family members. If used properly, computers are useful, but if you're constantly logged into Facebook or other platforms, it's not healthy. You have plenty of other options, like going to the beach or the gym. So, try to limit your online time and go out and do something more productive.
511	513	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing this letter on behalf of all the busy individuals in our country. We have reached the conclusion that computers are not merely a want but an absolute necessity in our lives. Firstly, we require them for communication with others. Secondly, computers are essential for conducting research for school and work. Lastly, children need computers to type essays, prompts, or papers for each class.  Communication is of utmost importance in daily life. For example, I have a grandmother who lives in @LOCATION1. I only get to see her in person once or twice a year. Throughout the year, I video - chat with her using a @CAPS3 computer, as it is far more convenient than traveling there. Without computers for video - chatting, I would have no communication with her except those one or two times a year. Using a computer for communication is extremely helpful as it allows us to perform numerous tasks without the need for travel, such as video - chatting.  Another reason why computers are a necessity is that they make research easier. Many children today have a large amount of homework and spend time on the internet. For me, the internet is a quick way to obtain research. Moreover, the research I find is as accurate as that from a library book. Computers are absolutely necessary when children have a heavy load of homework and projects that require research.  When it comes to schoolwork, it is almost unimaginable to type essays and prompts without a computer. Just on @DATE1, I had to type an English essay and a fluent paragraph. If I hadn't typed it on a computer, it would have been very difficult. Typing on the computer is not limited to school; my @CAPS3 dad frequently types up reports and essays for his company. Nowadays, many things need to be written on the computer to achieve the desired results.  In conclusion, computers are modern devices that we must embrace. They enable excellent communication with people around us, even across the country. They also make school research more efficient. Finally, they can type papers and essays quickly. Computers are a necessity for modern living.
512	514	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, People are spending an excessive amount of their time on the @ORGANIZATION1. Instead of experiencing the @ORGANIZATION1 firsthand, they are viewing it through videos or @CAPS2 on the internet. It is not natural for people to be internet fanatics. Earth is a beautiful planet, boasting trees, mountains, seas, and humans. We created the internet, yet people seem to love it more than the very planet they stand on.  The planet should be explored physically, not just virtually on the web. People should experience the @ORGANIZATION1 before nature is completely covered by cities and factories. People use the internet extensively for plans, business, entertainment, and socializing. All these activities could be carried out with relative ease even before the invention of the light bulb.  Life is a precious gift, but people are wasting it on an artificial existence. For instance, @ORGANIZATION1 is one of the most popular and addictive games ever created. In this game, players create a character in a mid - earth planet and battle monsters with other players. Some people, including myself, think it is more fun than real life, but it is just a fantasy for people to escape their seemingly meaningless lives.  I write this in the hope that one day people will realize that this is real life and start living it.
513	515	1	2	Dear local newspaper @CAPS1, it is true that technology is blinding everyone. More and more people are getting sucked into electronics, and fewer people are concerned about our planet. There are many wonderful things in the world that could be at risk.  Some people in @MONTH1 claim that spending a lot of time on the computer can help find cures for diseases. However, these are just excuses to be lazy and waste their lives on the computer. What will happen to sports in the world? The players will get old and retire, and if no one takes their place, the games will be canceled. I am a big football fan, and I don't want to see it canceled.  Some of my friends say they are addicted to the computer, and I always hope they can break this habit. When they get older, they will need a @CAPS2. If they remain addicted, they won't want a @CAPS2, which means they won't have money, can't pay bills, and may lose their houses.  It is not true that people can find cures for things just by looking on the computer. They need to learn about them first, which may involve looking in books and doing in - depth thinking.  I hope the way people live changes quickly because the situation can get really bad. If we stop this lifestyle, things can improve, our planet @CAPS3 will last longer, and we can make it a better place.
514	516	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I've recently learned about the debate on whether computers are over - used. While computers can be unhealthy, I generally believe they are helpful. They offer many opportunities that would not exist without them. I'll elaborate on this in the following letter.  One of the significant advantages of computers is in the area of studying and schoolwork. Computers provide ways for people to conduct research. For students, it could be research for a project or an essay. For adults, it could be information on starting a business. In both cases, computers make it easier to obtain information compared to visiting a library. Personally, I know a website called @LOCATION1, where teachers can set up online tests for students. This would not be possible without computers. Students can even take online courses, being taught through the internet instead of in person. This is beneficial for those who can't always attend classes.  Computers also offer a popular form of communication, such as e - mail and I @CAPS3. These communication methods have become extremely popular recently, and I use both. While it can be a problem for some people as it prevents them from interacting with the real world, in general, I think it is helpful. It also provides an additional way for parents and teachers to communicate.  I'd also like to mention how computers benefit adults. Many people pay their bills online. It is a hassle to mail bills every month, and computers greatly reduce this inconvenience. They also make it easier to buy things, look for jobs, and perform many other tasks. Without computers, tasks like job - hunting would require much more effort.  In conclusion, I've made my point clear. Moderation is key. Those who argue that computers are unhealthy are referring to people who over - use them. Generally, computers do more good than harm and can make people's lives much easier. They are very helpful in education, and this alone should be enough to convince you that computers are beneficial. I hope I've made my point and that you agree with me.
515	517	1	2	Dear local newspaper, Computers are relatively new, and almost everyone has one and wants one. They are both fun and useful, but there is a question of whether they are being over - used. As a student and a teenager, I know I use my computer far more than necessary.  While computers are indeed a great invention, they are time - consuming. You might be doing work or chatting with a friend, but you're just sitting there. Using the computer takes away time from exercise and other activities. I'm not saying to stop using the computer completely, but it doesn't make sense to sit on the computer chatting with a friend who lives nearby when you could be outside playing a fun game like kickball. It's better to use online chatting for friends and family who live far away, like in other states.  Computers are a great tool for work, projects, or homework, especially if your job involves research. However, most people abuse this privilege and visit websites unrelated to their research. If you need a computer for school or work, stay focused on the task at hand so that you can get the work done. For the average person, whether a student or someone with a job, it's hard not to use the computer. There are many useful things to do on it, but that doesn't mean you should be on it all day and night. Spend about @NUM1 minutes to an hour a day chatting with distant friends or doing research, and then get up and enjoy nature. You don't need more than an hour.  I strongly agree with the experts that people are spending too much time on their computers. Use it to benefit you, not just to avoid boredom. Don't abuse your internet access; stay on task when you need to do research. Remember, an hour a day is more than enough. So, get off your computers and go outside to stay fit.
516	518	1	2	Dear local newspaper, in contemporary times, the usage of computers has witnessed a significant upsurge. While some individuals view computers as a boon to society, others express concerns about the excessive time people spend on them, which leads to insufficient exercise and reduced time spent with friends and family. I firmly believe that computers can be detrimental. This is because some people are overly engrossed in them, which is one of the primary causes of obesity and disrupts people's social lives.  According to recent studies, approximately @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people spend the majority of their time on computers. Many of these individuals engage in online games and social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace, while others use it for shopping or learning. Some well - known online games include World of Warcraft and RuneScape, along with many @CAPS1's @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 games.  A large number of people who spend most of their time on computers are either already obese or have become so. As per @PERSON1, excessive computer use is one of the main reasons for obesity, and many experts concur that it is a leading cause. Between @DATE1 and @DATE2, there has been an increase in computer usage, and concurrently, the obesity rate has also risen.  Most people who spend excessive time on computers have limited interaction with their friends and family. This can result in damaged relationships, loss of friends, and a potential rift with family. Many experts, such as @PERSON2, state that a person can become depressed due to lack of social interaction. He also mentions that some depressed individuals may start contemplating suicide.  In light of these facts, it is evident that spending too much time on the computer is harmful. Would anyone still want to spend excessive time on the computer after being aware of these drawbacks? I am convinced that excessive computer use is harmful to everyone.
517	519	1	2	"Dear Readers, computers have become ubiquitous in today's world. In the @LOCATION1, the majority of people own at least one computer, and the number continues to grow. However, these computers bring more harm than good. They are costly, lead to a sedentary lifestyle and poor health, and give the younger generation the false impression that life is easy.  Computers are a significant financial burden. The costs associated with purchasing a computer, acquiring hardware and protective software, and paying for maintenance are substantial. Dr. @PERSON2, a computer science expert, notes, ""The average computer costs @MONEY1. Then, there are additional expenses for hardware replacement, antivirus programs, and other protective measures. At a minimum, we are looking at @MONEY2. With annual maintenance costing around @MONEY3 per year, it is clear that these machines are quite expensive."" In a recent survey, @CAPS1 out of every ten computer owners reported having to service their computers within the last three months, indicating a large amount of money being spent on repairs.  In addition to the financial aspect, computers pose health risks. When people use computers, they tend to be sedentary and do not engage in physical activity. This lack of exercise is contributing to the rising obesity rate in the @LOCATION1. While diet is a factor, some experts now attribute computer use to the lack of physical activity and, consequently, obesity. Dr. @DR1 @CAPS2 remarks, ""Regardless of what you are doing on a computer, whether it is playing games or studying, you would be better off outdoors, getting some exercise."" A recent study shows that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 families who bought a computer in the last year have significantly reduced their exercise and play time.  Moreover, computers can have a negative impact on the younger generation's mindset. Although computers are a great source of knowledge, the ease of finding information can be a problem. Before computers became popular, people had to put in effort to search for information. Now, children may start to believe that things in life come easily. @PERSON1, a pediatric psychologist, explains, ""A child's mind absorbs most of the things they encounter and considers them normal. If a child gets used to the simplicity of searching on a computer, they will expect everything to be equally easy. When faced with difficulties, they may become frustrated and unable to handle tasks."" @NUM3 out of @NUM4 poll respondents agree that finding information on the computer is very easy.  In conclusion, the increasing use of computers is a growing problem. They drain our finances, damage our health, and mislead the younger generation. Computers are clearly harmful to people as they take away our money, health, and the proper development of our children's minds."
518	520	1	2	Dear newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial. Firstly, they help improve hand - eye coordination. For example, when typing on a computer, one learns how to look at the screen while operating the keyboard. Without developing hand - eye coordination, it would be difficult to perform other tasks that require this skill.  Secondly, if you have a webcam, computers allow you to connect with family members living in different states. You can see their faces and have a conversation as if you were together in person. This is a great way to stay in touch with loved ones who are far away.  Finally, searching the web on a computer is extremely useful. If you want to get @CAPS4 tickets for a trip, the internet is the best option. Researchers say that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people consider getting tickets online as the best way because you can check the departure and arrival times, as well as the return schedule.  In summary, computers are a valuable asset. They enhance hand - eye coordination, enable face - to - face communication with distant family members through webcams, and provide an efficient way to obtain @CAPS4 tickets. Researchers' findings support the idea that getting tickets online is the optimal method. So, ask yourself, wouldn't you want to have the internet for searching and planning?
519	521	1	2	I strongly believe that people should spend more time enjoying nature rather than being glued to computers. The reason is that computers can be addictive. Those who are addicted to computers only know about things on the internet and are often oblivious to the real world.  People need physical exercise, but they won't get it by sitting in front of a computer all day. Computer addiction is a real problem. Those who spend most of their time on computers are likely to be addicted. When addicted, they may fail in school because they neglect their homework.  Don't you dislike feeling weak and tired? Well, that's how people who sit at computers all day often feel. If people want to stay healthy, they should exercise daily instead of sitting in front of a computer.  Many people get annoyed when they are unaware of what's going on around them. Most of these people are heavy computer users because they only know about things that are on the computer.  In conclusion, I firmly hold the view that people spend too much time on computers. This is due to several reasons: computers are addictive, people need exercise to stay healthy, and relying solely on computers limits one's knowledge of the real world.
520	522	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I've heard that you're deliberating on whether computers have a negative or positive impact on society. In my opinion, computers have a very negative impact, especially on students, though adults are also affected.  Computers can be highly distracting. Some claim that computers aren't distracting, but I disagree. There are various websites like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 that can divert people's attention from studying or doing homework. These are platforms where you can chat with friends and view pictures. They can be extremely disruptive when you're trying to focus on something important. For example, I'm not very diligent when it comes to homework or studying. If given the choice between doing homework and chatting on @CAPS1, I'd choose @CAPS1. However, when you think about it, these websites offer little real benefit compared to the value of doing homework and studying, which can improve your academic performance and future prospects.  Computers are also dangerous. People often use computers without being aware of the risks. There are online predators who spend most of their time on the computer, looking for opportunities to harm others. One particularly harmful website is MySpace. It's more dangerous than @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. MySpace is similar to @CAPS1 in some ways but poses a much greater threat. For instance, my mom told me about a friend's daughter who made friends with a stranger on MySpace. She thought he was nice and gave him her number. Fortunately, her mom noticed in time; otherwise, something bad could have happened. The stranger turned out to be an online predator.  Lastly, computers can lead to an unhealthy lifestyle. People who spend long hours in front of the computer don't engage in physical activities like playing soccer, volleyball, or tennis. This lack of exercise can lead to obesity and poor health, which is a significant problem in our society.  In conclusion, computers have a very negative impact on people. They are distracting, dangerous, and can make people unhealthy due to lack of exercise. Overall, the negative effects of computers on people cannot be ignored.
521	523	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, similar to many of my peers, I enjoy sitting in front of a computer to explore its marvels. However, this does not imply that I spend my entire life on it like some others. Thus, I am aware of the consequences of excessive computer use. It has made children my age more aggressive, prone to health problems, and less concerned about the environment. An increasing number of kids are falling into these pitfalls. Excessive computer time can transform even the kindest person into an extremely aggressive one. From personal experience, when you disturb someone engrossed in their computer obsession, they may snap, yell, swear, or even become violent. If someone stays up late on the computer, they are likely to be irritable the next day due to lack of sleep. This aggression can prompt others to respond aggressively, potentially leading to a verbal or physical altercation, which no one desires. Another issue associated with excessive computer use, @CAPS1, is the exacerbation of health problems. Staying indoors all day prevents people from obtaining the necessary amount of vitamin @CAPS3, a vital nutrient derived from sunlight. Insufficient vitamin @CAPS3 intake during childhood can result in a lifelong illness called @CAPS5, which hinders individuals from engaging in activities they enjoy. Moreover, excessive computer time means inadequate exercise, and combined with our current eating habits, this can lead to obesity. Some who do not exercise or eat properly and wish to avoid obesity may develop anorexia. Both of these weight - related problems are detrimental to health, highlighting the health risks of excessive computer use. The final concern I'd like you to consider, @CAPS1, is the decline in environmental awareness. Some large technology companies circumvent environmental protection laws to reduce production costs, yet no one seems to care as long as they can acquire the latest and better technology. People continue to support these companies to satisfy their craving for more computers. I am not suggesting that all computer use is bad. I simply aim to demonstrate that excessive computer time can make people more aggressive, cause health issues, and reduce environmental concern. Therefore, I urge you to write an article in the newspaper about the effects of excessive computer use to inform everyone in the city. This may contribute to a better future.
522	524	1	2	On @DATE1, @ORGANIZATION1 noted that people are using computers more frequently. While some oppose the idea that computers are beneficial, I firmly believe they are. Computers facilitate learning; they are like @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and when one is bored, the internet offers a wealth of entertainment. Today's people are becoming increasingly intelligent, and the internet is one of the contributing factors. The internet is akin to a vast library, housing an abundance of valuable information. There may be information on the internet that no one is aware of until they stumble upon it. Additionally, the internet is convenient and efficient. It also keeps us informed about global events. Without it, we would be at a significant disadvantage. Surveys indicate that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students use the internet for school - related information and projects. Moreover, the internet allows us to purchase items that are unavailable in physical stores. Visiting the library can be a hassle. One has to spend money on gas and make the effort to leave home and drive there. What if there is no library nearby? The internet provides a viable alternative. In a library, one might spend an entire day searching for a book, only to find that it is already borrowed by someone else. This can be extremely frustrating. There are individuals, such as college students, who do not own cars. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 lack cars. So, how can they access the library? When boredom strikes, instead of eating, sleeping, or idly staring at the ceiling, one can turn to the computer. The internet offers a plethora of games and interesting websites. It also enables us to make new friends and stay in touch with existing ones. For photographers, the internet provides a platform to sell and share their work and to advertise their businesses. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 @CAPS3 either have no backyard or nothing better to do. In conclusion, I believe the internet is remarkable. It allows us to acquire diverse information without the need to visit a library, and it offers entertainment when we are bored. Truly, the internet is a great asset.
523	525	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I am of the opinion that computers are highly beneficial to our society. They are extremely useful for homework, enable online communication, and allow us to make plans without leaving home. Firstly, computers are invaluable for homework and studying. Many students are initially reluctant, but with the assistance of a computer, they are more likely to complete their tasks. For instance, when faced with a challenging science or social studies assignment, I can conduct research on the computer. If an exam is approaching and I have left my textbook at school, I can study using my computer. Clearly, computers are extremely helpful in these areas. Secondly, computers simplify communication. Talking on the phone incurs costs, while texting, chatting, or voice - calling online can be done for free. Many people prefer email as it is convenient and allows for the sharing of documents. Suppose I have a work document on yearly company profits that I need to send to my boss. I can simply attach it to an email without having to make a trip. Finally, computers make it easy to make plans and connections. I know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people enjoy traveling, and obtaining plane tickets is a breeze with online booking. It is fast, easy, and secure. If you need to make a reservation, such as for a hotel, you can do it online. Simply select a date, and your room will be ready upon arrival. This is particularly beneficial for traveling business people. In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in our world. They assist with homework, facilitate communication, and enable us to make reservations without leaving home. The best part is that they are both fun and easy to use.
524	526	1	2	Dear Local newspaper, as @CAPS1 mentioned in the article, more and more people are using computers, and those who support technological advancements believe that computers have a positive impact on people. However, I strongly disagree. I believe that computers can ruin one's life and cause blindness. Excessive computer use can have a detrimental effect on one's life. A computer is a device that allows us to do almost anything. We can look up our friends' addresses and play numerous games. I recall watching channel @NUM1 news when a @NUM2 - year - old child fainted after playing a computer game for an extended period. This clearly shows that a few hours of computer use can have serious consequences. Computers can also cause blindness because the screen is too close. The computer is designed for various tasks, but unfortunately, the screen is positioned too close. To see something on the computer, one often has to place their face very close to the screen. I remember when my dad bought a @ORGANIZATION1. He spent the whole day on it, and when he finished, his eyes were bloodshot. A month later, he had to get glasses. This illustrates the harm that can be caused by getting too close to the computer screen. In conclusion, computers can ruin lives and cause blindness. They are harmful, and I urge you to consider the points I have made in this persuasive letter.
525	527	1	2	On @DATE1, @CAPS1 of The @CAPS2, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people in today's society. When used for educational purposes, such as chatting, emailing, or researching, computers bring about significant changes in people's lives. If used for educational games, computers can be a great learning tool. For example, I help my sister with multiplication using a math game on the computer. I also learned to type using Type to Learn @CAPS3 on my home desktop. Many others use computers for similar educational reasons, such as typing projects or creating presentations. Some people use computers primarily for chatting and emailing, and these activities also benefit society. Social media platforms like Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter allow us to meet new people, reconnect with old friends, and communicate with current friends. On @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION1, or @ORGANIZATION3, we can choose to email people instead of using instant messaging. For important messages, email is a better option, while for casual greetings, social media platforms are more suitable. In conclusion, computers do benefit our society. The reasons outlined in this letter support my stance on the positive impact of computers on our society.
526	528	1	2	Dear newspaper editor, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to everyone. Firstly, when one lacks knowledge about something and wishes to learn more, they can simply use the computer to conduct research. The internet offers information on virtually everything, regardless of how distant the subject may seem. Secondly, with a webcam, individuals can see their far - away relatives at any time. Moreover, social media sites like Facebook enable people to communicate with family and friends and view each other's pictures. Finally, computers are highly versatile. There is software available for writing, working on projects, and planning. In modern society, computers are also extensively used in stores and businesses for record - keeping. In conclusion, computers clearly bring numerous benefits to our lives.
527	529	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, while it's true that the effects of computers on people can be quite negative, individuals should be aware of their actions and the potential consequences. Nowadays, people spend more time on computers than on the phone. This often leads to neglecting household chores as they sit glued to their laptops or desktops. Parents and children also spend a large amount of time on websites such as those with webcam features or AIM to chat with friends, instead of using the phone or meeting in person. Teenagers and some adults aged from @NUM1 to @NUM2 frequently visit websites like myspace.com, facebook.com, and formspring.com. These activities can start rumors and result in either good or bad situations, which can have a dreadful impact on those who engage in them regularly. There is often a ""he - said - she - said"" situation, especially among teens. Therefore, people should log off immediately. Most importantly, everyone should be aware of the potential negative situations that excessive computer use can bring and avoid putting themselves or others in harm's way."
528	530	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I strongly believe that both children and adults are spending an excessive amount of time on the computer. Computers have a negative impact on people. A significant @PERCENT1 of parents concur with experts that @CAPS3 spend too much time on the computer and less time with friends. When I was young, I rarely used the computer. However, now my parents often have to remind me to leave it. Since teens joined platforms like @CAPS7, myspace, and twitter, they have become addicted and constantly check what their friends are posting. Psychologist @PERSON2 states that @CAPS3 who spend multiple hours on the internet daily struggle to concentrate in school as their minds are preoccupied with what they'll do on @CAPS11 when they get home. The daily routine of a teenager in the @DATE1 often involves waking up, going to school, getting home, and then going back on @CAPS7. Secondly, continuous computer use can cause health problems. @NUM1 percent of teens who use the computer non - stop need to wear glasses or contacts due to overuse. I often get a terrible headache when I use the computer without a break for a long time because my eyes can't handle it. Pediatrician @PERSON1 notes that when @CAPS3 stay up late on the computer, they experience fatigue the next morning. Middle schoolers are among the most frequent internet users and are often tired at school. People who stay up late have dark, saggy lines under their eyes. Additionally, many @CAPS3 who spend all their time on the internet never go outside. Lastly, children are missing out on the beauty of nature. Those who don't get enough exercise can't think clearly as their brains lack oxygen. Obesity is becoming a problem for children who only sit inside and consume junk food. @PERCENT2 of children in Stratford rarely go outside and exercise. In elementary school, we had recess, but in middle school, we no longer do. The only chance to go outside is in the @DATE3 and @DATE2 when it's warm. In conclusion, the excessive use of computers by children and adults has multiple negative effects.
529	531	1	2	Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, my opinion on computers may differ from others, but I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to our society. They offer vast knowledge on any subject, help us connect with family in far - off places, and provide a better understanding of places we can't visit. Some argue that computers distract kids from spending time with family. However, consider a situation where a family member is on the other side of the world. My cousin lives in @LOCATION2, and the computer is the only way I can communicate with him. Also, if a child's parents are on long - term business trips, the computer becomes a means to stay in touch. Moreover, it's claimed that computers prevent kids from exercising. But if one's exercise is hiking, they can enjoy the scenery while getting exercise. With a computer, one can explore any place without leaving home. For instance, a young kid who can't visit @LOCATION1 can use a computer to check it out. In school, we learn about long - deceased historic people. A computer provides information about them that might be hard to find in books. Although one may not be exercising, they are expanding their knowledge. Going to a library and searching through books can be time - consuming if the required information is not there, while a computer can provide it in seconds. In this era of technological advancement, we should make the most of computers. So, if you haven't seen your cousin in a long time, start your computer and start chatting. The time to embrace the benefits of computers is now.
530	532	1	2	Dear Local newspaper editor, I believe that computers have a positive impact on our lives. They assist kids with homework, projects, and essays, and also support business growth through online stocks. Computers have become an essential part of our lives, allowing us to stay informed about global events and learn new things daily. Some people focus on the supposed negative effects of computers, such as distracting kids from family time. However, when family members are far away, computers are an excellent way to stay connected. For example, they enable online chatting and photo - sharing. It's illogical to claim that computers stop people from seeing their families. Also, the argument that computers prevent people from exercising is unfounded. Not everyone likes to exercise, and it's a personal choice, not forced by the computer. Those who oppose computers seem to think that computers control people, which is absurd. If people take the time to think, they'll realize how much computers have helped our nation grow. Over the years, more and more things are computer - run, and people rely on them extensively. In my opinion, computers have had a positive impact on our country. I can only imagine the even greater benefits in the future as computers continue to develop. As you've read, I've explained my reasons for believing that computers have a positive impact on our lives, and I'm confident that this impact will only increase in the coming years. I can't force you to have a particular opinion on computers, but just think about a world without them, especially if you've grown up using them.
531	533	1	2	In my view, computers are an excellent addition to our advanced technological landscape. They bring about numerous positive impacts on individuals. Firstly, computers simplify almost every aspect of our lives. They can educate people through tutorial or educational websites, as well as other relevant resources. Moreover, they serve as a source of entertainment during our leisure time.  Computers are advancing at an astonishing pace, which might explain why people are so drawn to them. Their positive effects, however, cannot be overlooked. For many, computers have made life significantly easier. Consider the everyday items we use, such as books, well - made clothing, and radio music. These would likely not exist in their current forms without computers. We would have to resort to hand - writing books and hand - sewing clothes. Regarding music, we would be limited to simple stomping and clapping. Even the ancient Egyptians could have achieved far more, like building millions of pyramids, if they had access to computers.  For students, programs like Microsoft assist in neatly completing major school assignments. After finishing my homework each day, I often turn to the computer. While some adults assume that teenagers only use computers for social media like Facebook and MySpace, I admit to visiting those sites. But when I notice my grades slipping, I use educational websites. In about ninety percent of cases, this helps improve my grades and gives me a satisfying result. I've even used the computer to teach my preschool - aged cousins basic arithmetic.  Computers also play a crucial role in education within schools. Beyond that, they offer entertainment through games like virtual solitaire. When I'm on the computer, I can research topics that interest me, such as the invention of a particular place or the nature of the universe. They save me from boredom when I don't want to watch TV all day.  I believe that using a computer is not an addiction for me; instead, it has a very positive impact. Although I may stay up late chatting with friends on Facebook, it's a part of being a kid. The next day, I might discover something in school that I want to explore further, and that's exactly what the computer is for. In my opinion, without computers, we would lack much of the knowledge we have today, and their positive influence on people is unparalleled.
532	534	1	2	"Dear Readers of the Local Newspaper, I'm quite certain that you interact with computers on a daily basis. You use them for writing, gaming, viewing pictures, and printing work. There are numerous practical applications for computers, but currently, many people, especially children, are using them excessively. This unnecessary computer usage can lead to obesity, expose children to inappropriate content, and disrupt family time. By the end of this article, I'm confident you'll agree that computers are detrimental to society.  Have you ever set a New Year's resolution to lose weight? It's quite common. According to a certain organization, [PERCENT1] of adults set goals to get in shape, exercise more, or shed some pounds. We've all seen commercials on TV encouraging us to ""Get fit!"" and promising that we can ""lose weight in just one week."" There are also many entrepreneurs trying to convince us to buy their exercise products, claiming we can build large muscles quickly. But do these diet and exercise plans really work? A study by [ORGANIZATION1] found that the primary cause of obesity is actually computer use.  At [LOCATION1], researchers divided participants into two groups. One group followed a regular commercial diet plan, while the other group continued their normal routine, except they reduced their computer use. The group that cut back on computer use lost nearly [PERCENT2] more weight on average than the group on the commercial diet. Clearly, nothing contributes more to obesity in [LOCATION2] than computer use.  The typical day of an average child in [LOCATION2] involves going to school, taking the bus home, using the computer, having dinner, doing homework, and then going to bed. Unfortunately, this routine repeats [NUM1] days a week, and computer time is replacing exercise time. I urge you, dear readers, to avoid using your computers for just one week, and you'll see the difference.  Another negative aspect of computers is that they not only affect individuals but can also impact entire families. Many children can go a whole day without having a proper conversation with their parents. My friend [PERSON1] often comes home from school and heads straight to his laptop without even greeting his parents. Computers have become an addiction for most teenagers. [PERCENT3] of teens in [LOCATION2] say they use computers daily, and [PERCENT4] claim they have trouble communicating with their parents. There's a direct link between the lack of communication at home for teens and computer use. Teens become so engrossed in the digital world that they forget about their families.  I've made the mistake of being overly attached to social networking and neglecting my family, but I'm lucky to have a stable family environment. Some teens aren't as fortunate. Computers have the potential to damage parent - child relationships, and we should prevent this from happening.  Children are the most affected by this technological revolution. From a young age, they have access to keyboards. However, parents may not realize what they're exposing their children to when teaching them to use computers. Even young children, as young as [NUM2] or [NUM3] years old, can be exposed to inappropriate and vulgar content on supposedly ""safe"" websites. You may not even know who your child is talking to on the computer. With so many messages and emails flying around, your child could be communicating with a stranger. A significant part of a child's development and values is shaped by their early experiences. Introducing a computer to a kindergartener can have unforeseen consequences.  No matter how much you believe in the safety of computers, you can't deny that they expose children to adult content at a young age. Given the concerns of lack of exercise, family separation, and inappropriate exposure, do you really want your children, or even yourself, using a computer daily? Think about it [NUM4] years from now. Will you regret using the computer too much or wish you'd spent more time on other things? Ultimately, the choice is yours."
533	535	1	2	I firmly believe that having a computer is a great advantage. Nowadays, computers are incredibly useful, and many people rely on them for their businesses. There are three main reasons why I think computers are beneficial: looking up information, communicating with friends and family online, and doing homework.  When it comes to looking up information, using a computer is far superior to using a book. For instance, if you have three reports to complete, the internet can provide the information much faster. Searching on the internet might take only [NUM1] to [NUM2] minutes, while looking for the same information in a book could take [NUM3] to [NUM4] minutes.  Another reason is the ability to communicate with friends and family online. If you have relatives living far away, like in [LOCATION2], using the phone or cellphone can result in an outrageous bill. But with a computer, you can easily chat with them. You can also ask your friends about homework or what the assignment is. For example, if you have a friend in [LOCATION1], you can connect with them online.  Finally, computers are great for doing homework. If you have a history assignment, you can access an online book instead of carrying a heavy textbook back and forth between school and home. It's also more time - efficient. Using the internet for homework might take [NUM5] to [NUM2] minutes, while using a book could take [NUM5] to [NUM8] minutes.  In conclusion, computers are extremely useful and important in today's world. Despite the fact that some people don't like or use computers, the benefits of looking up information, doing homework, and communicating online far outweigh any drawbacks.
534	536	1	2	Dear Newspaper [CAPS1], while computers do have positive effects on people, there are also numerous negative impacts. Some of the major negative effects include a lack of exercise, the risk of children talking to strangers, and a decrease in interaction with family and friends.  One of the most significant negative effects of computers is the lack of exercise. Currently, many people in [LOCATION1] are obese due to poor eating habits and a sedentary lifestyle. One of the problems is that these individuals spend too much time sitting in front of their computers and on the couch, rather than going outside. They choose to stay indoors, watching TV and using the computer, which has a profound impact on their way of life.  Another issue is that children may talk to strangers online. Most kids in [LOCATION1] are members of social networks like [CAPS3] or [CAPS4]. There are people who pretend to be teenagers on these websites, which can get children into trouble if they're not careful. Since most people access these sites via computers, it's yet another negative consequence of computer use.  A further negative effect is the reduction in interaction with family and friends. When people are using computers, they focus solely on the screen and ignore their surroundings. This lack of interaction weakens their social skills as they're constantly glued to the computer. If a person becomes overly addicted to the computer, it can lead to serious problems within the family, as communication breaks down and family bonds weaken.  In conclusion, although computers have some positive aspects, the numerous negative effects can cause severe problems. They can lead to tragedies within families and in an individual's life. It's important to be aware of these drawbacks and use computers in a more balanced way.
535	537	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I understand that you may have concerns about the effects of computers on people, but I strongly disagree. I believe that computers are invaluable as they help us learn and perform tasks more efficiently. They also contribute to the community's learning.  Firstly, computers enhance hand - eye coordination, which is essential for many jobs. For example, in the city of [LOCATION1], employees need to type regularly, and having good typing skills is crucial. Moreover, people can learn a great deal about society through computers. Without typing skills, it would be difficult to secure top - class jobs.  Secondly, computers are beneficial for children's education. They help children learn how to type, which is useful for high school. Additionally, children can learn math, science, social studies, and language arts on computers. Even young kids can have fun while learning math and other skills with the help of characters like Dora, [ORGANIZATION1], and Elmo. It's a great way for children to learn and enjoy themselves at the same time, which parents would surely appreciate. In fact, even newborn babies can start learning basic skills like reading, writing, and math, and who knows, they might grow up to be president one day.  Thirdly, computers facilitate global communication and transactions. Without them, we would have to rely on old - fashioned methods. With computers, we can talk to family members who live far away, whether in another state or country. We can also chat with old school friends. Additionally, we can make purchases online.  In conclusion, I've shown that computers have a positive impact on people. They help children learn better, and parents can also benefit. They assist in getting jobs and improving hand - eye coordination both in and out of school. Therefore, computers are a great asset to the community.
536	538	1	2	Do computers benefit us? In my opinion, they do. The ways in which computers benefit us far outweigh the ways they don't. For instance, school - kids can use online textbooks. Many companies have websites, allowing us to learn about them before hiring them. We also rely on computers to look up directions, preventing us from getting lost. School children gain a great deal from computers. Instead of carrying home a large number of heavy books, they can simply access online books. I, for one, much prefer using a computer to lugging around heavy textbooks. When looking for a home decorator, we can visit relevant websites to view their work. This helps us avoid spending a lot of money on a room we won't like. When job - hunting, we can check a company's website to see if we can get an interview, saving us time and effort. Using a computer to find directions is also easier than driving around aimlessly and getting lost. Although GPS devices are available, they are more expensive than using a computer for this purpose. In summary, computers benefit us in numerous ways, such as providing online textbooks and facilitating website searches and address look - ups. That's why I firmly believe computers are beneficial.
537	539	1	2	I truly believe that computers are a positive addition to our lives. They enable online communication, offer various means of assisting others, and are essential for managing finances and bills. Firstly, computers facilitate communication. Approximately @PERCENT1 of people in the United States have family in different states and rarely get to see them. Video chat, available on computers with webcams, allows people to see and talk to relatives and friends from around the world. Additionally, @CAPS1 enables us to communicate with online contacts at any time. My mother got a @CAPS1 account and is now chatting with friends she hasn't seen since high school, which has made her very happy. Secondly, computers are useful in emergencies. We can use email to send urgent messages, and there are even features on computers that can make calls during emergencies. Around @PERCENT2 of people in @LOCATION1 believe that computers have helped many in such situations. Thirdly, computers are crucial for managing money and paying bills. About @PERCENT3 of people in the United States handle their finances and bill - paying on the computer. My parents and many others do the same. Without computers, it would be difficult to manage our finances, and we might even lose our homes. In conclusion, people really do need computers. They help us stay connected with loved ones, assist in emergencies, and manage our money. Everyone should own a computer for these compelling reasons.
538	540	1	2	@ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of the world's population believes that computers are excellent tools for interacting with others, learning about foreign countries and people, and tracing family origins. There are several reasons why computers should remain an integral part of our society. To interact with people from different countries, we can create specific accounts to meet like - minded individuals. We can also visit websites to become pen - pals with people from around the world or download instant - messaging applications. When working on a school project about a country or an explorer, the computer is a valuable resource. It helps us with schoolwork, including homework. When no one is at home to assist with homework, we can use educational websites to better understand the material. To find out about our family history, we can use websites like @LOCATION1 to learn about our ancestors, such as whether they participated in wars. We can also ask our parents for names and search for them on Google. In summary, computers allow us to interact with others, learn about different places, and discover our family roots. These are strong reasons for keeping computers in our society.
539	541	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, computers have become an indispensable part of modern life, with almost everyone using one. However, some people believe that computers are harming society, which is incorrect. Computers are essential for education, are not used constantly by people, and are necessary for many jobs. In terms of education, it's nearly impossible to have a proper education without a computer. For working individuals who need to obtain an additional degree, online schooling available at night allows them to continue working while studying. School projects and essays also rely on computers for research and citation. Without computers, one's educational opportunities would be severely limited, potentially leading to low - skill jobs like those at @CAPS1. People don't spend all day on computers. Both kids and adults have the responsibility to go outside and enjoy fresh air. They use computers mainly for checking emails, playing games, and socializing, but they can make their own choices about how to live their lives. At work, computers are vital. Office workers use them to communicate via email and solve problems. Bank employees need computers to access accounts, and those estimating building costs use them for calculations and record - keeping. Video game programmers spend hours programming games on computers. In conclusion, computers are beneficial for education, people's reasonable usage patterns, and various jobs. I strongly urge everyone to reconsider the importance of computers and the potential negative impacts of living without them.
540	542	1	2	Let's go back about @NUM1 years. Communication with out - of - state family took weeks, knowledge was mainly found in books and retrieved slowly, and everything was done with less speed and precision. Computers have revolutionized this. With just a finger tap, we can communicate globally and search for new information. @PERCENT1 of people have relatives living out of state. I can relate, as I have @NUM2 cousins in @LOCATION2 and @NUM2 in @LOCATION1. Without instant messaging and emails, we'd probably talk to them only once or twice a year. Some claim that computers reduce face - to - face interaction, but for many of us, they are the means of interaction. The webcam is truly amazing. It allows us to have face - to - face conversations with people on the other side of the world, enabling a real connection with different cultures. My @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 have used the internet to reconnect with old college friends. The internet is not just for teenagers on @CAPS3 and @CAPS4. The amount of information available online is astonishing. What would take hours to find in @NUM2 non - functional books can be found in minutes on the web. Any question, no matter how personal, can be answered. While people are right about the need for exercise, we can plan an exercise routine in just five minutes on the web. The computer can meet various needs. Whether we're looking for a nature - loving place, need a dictionary, or anything else, the computer can provide quick results. People often take computers for granted and think we can live without them, but they don't realize how much we depend on them. The technology is here, so we should use it. I couldn't miss the chance to talk to distant cousins or check on old friends. Thanks to computers, I have these opportunities. Although it's unclear if computers have changed the direction of technological advancement, they have definitely provided a great resource. We should make full use of this amazing technology.
541	543	1	2	I firmly believe that, for the time being, computers are a boon to our society. They offer the opportunity to explore various places. In the case of long - distance relationships, one can communicate with their partners. Moreover, computers come with a plethora of useful accessories. For instance, when searching for a new home, Google can be used to find properties for sale in a specific area, and then one can look for a reasonably - priced moving service. There are numerous websites that can assist in finding that ideal place. Computers are also extremely handy during vacations. One can check the weather forecast for the travel period. When planning a trip, a computer can be used to book a flight. Clearly, computers are very useful when it comes to dealing with places. The accessories associated with computers are countless. One popular accessory feature is games. Games are excellent for stimulating the mind. Most games require hand - eye coordination. Take @ORGANIZATION1 as an example, where players need to remove all the tiles before time runs out. When one is bored, games can be a great source of entertainment. In my view, games are a wonderful addition to computers. For those in long - distance relationships, having a computer enables online communication, which eases the sense of separation. With an email account, one can stay in touch with friends not seen at school, providing a means to connect. Social media platforms like Myspace and Facebook serve a similar purpose, allowing communication with school friends. As demonstrated, computers are highly useful. They offer great accessories, facilitate communication, and are helpful with place - related matters. Many people rely on computers in their daily lives. In conclusion, computers are truly amazing.
542	544	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 holds the view that computers are often misused. Teens should be engaging in outdoor sports or spending time with friends and family. Instead, they are overly addicted to the internet, games, and various websites. In @CAPS1's opinion, the computer and web - surfing are detrimental. Firstly, they consume a significant amount of children's time. Secondly, educationally, computers can provide inaccurate information. @CAPS1 believes that it would have been better if, until the late @DATE1's, @ORGANIZATION3 laptops and desktop @CAPS2 did not exist. Nowadays, children, teens, and even adults use computers more than they should. Middle - schoolers and high - schoolers at this stage should be focused on their studies. However, they become overly addicted to @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5, neglecting their schoolwork and priorities, which leads to a decline in their grades. Adults also face this issue. Business people, accountants, and assistants constantly check their emails. Those who work at a desk or in a cubicle are almost always on the computer. In light of this, I believe that jobs should reduce the number of workers using computers, and families should limit the time each member spends online. Another reason for the negative impact of computers is the educational aspect. People can insert their own viewpoints on websites like Wikipedia and @ORGANIZATION2. When students are doing projects or homework and search for information online, they cannot be certain of its accuracy. This indicates that the internet does not always outperform books in terms of providing reliable information. In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people. They consume the minds of children and teens, people overuse the internet, and computers can sometimes offer false educational information.
543	545	1	2	I wholeheartedly believe that computers are truly amazing. They offer an incredible way to meet new people online. Through computers, we can connect with individuals from different corners of the world, expanding our social circles and learning about diverse cultures. Whether it's through social media platforms, online forums, or virtual communities, the opportunities to interact with others are endless. Computers break down geographical barriers and allow us to communicate and build relationships with people we might never have met otherwise. They provide a platform for sharing ideas, experiences, and knowledge. In conclusion, the amazing capabilities of computers in enabling us to meet new people online make them an invaluable part of our modern lives.
544	546	1	2	Dear newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that computers have both positive and negative impacts on people. On the positive side, computers allow us to learn about different places without physically visiting them. We can obtain facts about a country's food, goods, and job opportunities. However, there are also negative aspects. Kids may spend excessive time chatting or playing on the computer, neglecting outdoor activities and sports practice. Additionally, there are risks associated with online communication. Some people on the computer may not be who they claim to be. If I had to choose a side on whether the computer is helpful or not, I would say it is not. A small mistake on the computer, such as sharing one's name, address, or picture, can lead to many bad consequences. In conclusion, while computers offer some educational and informational benefits, the potential negative impacts, especially in terms of time management and online safety, outweigh the positives. Therefore, we need to be cautious when using computers.
545	547	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I am convinced that computers bring numerous benefits to society. First of all, computers are effective in teaching social skills. Through computers, people can interact with individuals from all over the world and make new friends. This interaction allows them to learn about different cultures and the practices in other countries. It also enables communication with family members who are not physically present. Clearly, computers play a significant role in developing social skills. Secondly, computers are a great tool for learning. One can learn how to use a computer if they are not already proficient. There are free online learning games available, or one can purchase a @CAPS3 with more learning options. People can also research recent or past events they are interested in. The ability to learn all sorts of things online makes computers beneficial to society. Finally, computers teach hand - eye coordination. There are various games that require the use of a mouse and keyboard, which helps in developing this skill. Moreover, computers can serve as a source of entertainment, such as chatting with others and playing games during free time. There are also many jobs that require computer skills related to these aspects. In conclusion, computers offer multiple benefits to the social community. They help in learning social skills, provide free learning opportunities for various subjects online (if not paying for the internet), and teach hand - eye coordination. I am firmly convinced that computers benefit society in numerous ways.
546	548	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper, computers are having a harmful impact on children, and this impact will be even more severe on future generations. While using computers in moderation is acceptable, like most things, using them daily instead of exercising is not. Supporters of technology claim that computers have a positive effect, but I firmly disagree.  They argue that computers help with hand - eye coordination, teach about distant places, and enable online communication. However, sports such as tennis, baseball, basketball, and hockey are excellent ways to exercise and practice hand - eye coordination, and they are far healthier than chatting with friends online all day. As my 6th - grade science teacher, Mr. Johnson, says, ""Future generations are becoming overly dependent."" If one can't get up from the computer, it will be difficult to support a family in the future. My mom often tells me, ""Raising a family is hard work. Your family needs food, which means someone needs a job and someone needs to get the food. It takes a lot of time and energy."" I agree that if children practice simple things like going outside for an hour a day, it will be easier for them to have a job and raise a family later.  Rather than relying on the internet to find good online sources for a thesis paper, one should go to the library. The internet is a relatively new data source and has grown rapidly, but not all internet sources can be trusted. The people who posted the websites may not be reliable, and websites are full of viruses. What if your computer crashes due to viruses when you really need it for a school project? A simple alternative is to go to the local library and check out books, which are trustworthy and full of information.  The internet is also not a very safe place. Social media platforms like Facebook, instant messaging services, email, and Twitter are all means of computer - based communication. However, they can be dangerous as you may not know who you are talking to. As my dad says, ""The internet is a vast place open to strangers."" My parents don't allow me to use these communication methods for these reasons, and I support their decision. Instead of talking to strangers online, one should visit friends in person.  In conclusion, computers are strange pieces of technology that can be unsafe, untruthful, and are making children more dependent on adults. I disagree with technology supporters. There are many healthy alternatives to using computers. I believe experts are right to be concerned about people spending too much time on computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. These alternatives not only keep people safe but also promote a healthier lifestyle. Keeping our bodies healthy should be everyone's goal."
547	549	1	2	Dear Newspaper, computers are not something to be feared. They assist numerous people in various ways, such as office workers, teachers, students, scientists, and locals in handling their work and daily lives. Have you not benefited from a computer today? In fact, computers aid us in learning, staying in touch with others, and represent our future.  Some may claim that using computers reduces family interaction. However, I can attest that I stay connected with my grandma, cousins, and aunts via email. With email, you can catch up on news or simply write to friends and family. Moreover, if you're planning a trip to visit loved ones, instead of struggling with a map that may cause you to get lost, you can use Google Maps to plan the shortest route to your destination without any detours.  Computers can do more than create maps; they can provide valuable information. Many schools across the country use computers for teaching. Students can look up information about a particular place, and within seconds, they have all the details they need. In most school papers, students are required to type and cite the websites they used. It's much easier to search for information on a computer than to sift through large books.  Another advantage is that computers don't use paper, which will contribute to a more sustainable future. Millions of tons of paper end up in landfills every day. By using computers to read online, we can conserve paper. Additionally, the future of computers is promising. People have already developed touch - screen computers, and further advancements are expected.  Some people believe that using computers is a bad thing, but let's look at the facts. Newspapers are written on computers; otherwise, journalists would constantly suffer from hand cramps. Doctors also store patients' medical histories on computers; otherwise, important papers could easily be lost.  In conclusion, computers help us learn, keep in touch with others, and are an integral part of our future. We should embrace the many benefits they offer.
548	550	1	2	"Typing and surfing the web can be exciting, but are they worth the significant risks that exist today? Before the discovery of computers, human health was three times better than it is now. While computers can be useful and have some benefits, they are also harmful and should not be used as frequently.  Computers pose several problems. There are unprofessional websites on the internet, they are not conducive to exercise, and they can invade individuals' privacy. Every day, many kids are allowed on computers and end up visiting inappropriate websites. In fact, 60% of kids enter unprofessional websites, and 40% of them do so without parental supervision. As a result, these kids may misbehave at home and school.  However, kids are not the only ones affected. Computers are at risk of being hacked or infected by viruses from uncensored websites. Due to these viruses, computers may crash or prevent access to important documents. Since the invention of the internet, obesity and lack of exercise in people's schedules have increased significantly. A scientist from the World Health Organization, Dr. Smith, said, ""Heavy computer users have lost the use of their muscles and have gained over 20 pounds of fat, making it difficult for them to engage in activities they used to do."" I believe this is true because my sister experienced the same. She ate more and spent less time exercising and more time on the computer.  Some people claim that computers help with hand - eye coordination, but is it really worth sacrificing one's health? Although there are unique things sold on the internet that are not available in stores, it's hard to trust online purchases due to the risk of identity theft and financial loss.  In conclusion, while computers have their uses, the risks they pose to health, privacy, and overall well - being are significant. We should be more cautious about our computer usage and find a better balance in our lives."
549	551	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers bring benefits to society. They teach hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about faraway places, allow online communication, and contribute to the development of better technology.  Firstly, computers teach hand - eye coordination and help people learn about distant places. Four out of five students use computers to do their homework. Last week, when I visited a museum, I didn't know much about ancient Egypt. I used the computer and was able to learn a great deal. Thanks to the computer, I got an A+ on my assignment. This clearly shows the positive impact of computers on students.  Secondly, computers allow people to communicate online. For example, if a man goes out and leaves his phone at home, he can still talk to his family through the computer. My family is in another country, and I haven't seen them in four years. I bought a webcam and was able to see my family after such a long time. This shows that computers help maintain family connections.  Finally, computers contribute to the creation of better technology. They assist in making better cars, lights, and more. In the military, computers help soldiers win wars, and in the medical field, they save lives. My father was seriously ill, and without the help of computers in medical diagnosis and treatment, he might have died. Thanks to computers, I still have my father today.  In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits to society. They teach hand - eye coordination, enable learning about faraway places, facilitate online communication, and drive technological progress. Although spending time enjoying nature is good, the positive impact of computers on society cannot be ignored. I hope these reasons will persuade the local newspaper to agree that computers have a positive effect on people.
550	552	1	2	To the editor of the [LOCATION1] newspaper, I think we should have computers as they would help us meet new people, see new places, and learn new things.  Computers can help us meet new people. We can send emails to them and chat with them on various programs. This allows us to expand our social circle and interact with individuals from different backgrounds.  They also enable us to see new places. By going on the internet, we can look up different locations, view pictures, and learn about their cultures and landscapes. It's like taking a virtual tour of the world from the comfort of our own homes.  In addition, computers help us learn about new things. We can talk to people online, and they can give us ideas on what to study or explore. This exchange of knowledge can broaden our horizons and deepen our understanding of the world.  This is beneficial for all of us because we all have a desire to learn new things, talk to new people, and see new places. Having access to computers is a good thing for everyone, not just a select few.  I sincerely hope you will take this letter into consideration. By having computers, we can all gain a wealth of knowledge and experiences, which will ultimately help us learn about new things and grow as individuals.
551	553	1	2	I firmly believe that computers have a detrimental impact on people. Nowadays, individuals are constantly glued to their computers, spending excessive time on Facebook and other websites, which is often a waste of time. Instead of engaging in outdoor activities such as going for walks, exploring the woods, or exercising, people are sitting in front of their screens. Most people do not get the necessary amount of exercise because they are preoccupied with computers.  The over - production of computers should be halted. If fewer computers are available, people will be more likely to exercise and lose weight. Additionally, less computer use would mean fewer people accessing inappropriate websites. Computers should only be used for legitimate purposes like researching for projects or typing homework papers.  Exercising is crucial for both parents and children to maintain good health. No one wants to develop diabetes at a young age, so it is essential to stay active to prevent such health issues. Computers not only prevent people from exercising but also mess up their brains.  Instead of sitting in front of the computer, people should get outside, exercise, and explore. There are countless interesting things to discover in the woods, such as different kinds of bugs and insects. You might even spot a ladybug. When going for a walk, you can observe various houses, each with its unique color, size, and front door. You may also see different animals like dogs and cats.  Going outside with family and friends is a great way to enjoy nature. You can take pictures and create a scrapbook. Walking in the woods can be a refreshing experience. Once you start spending more time outdoors and exercising, you will realize that it is far more enjoyable than being on the computer. In conclusion, reducing computer use and increasing physical activity is the key to a healthier and more fulfilling life.
552	554	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, in my opinion, computers have both positive and negative effects on people. On the positive side, they are excellent for education, mental exercise, and global communication. Computers provide access to a vast amount of information, which can enhance one's education. Although some of this information may be false, with proper research, one can find reliable sources. This wealth of knowledge allows individuals to exercise their minds, which is beneficial for personal growth. Moreover, computers enable people to communicate with others across the globe, facilitating the exchange of information.  However, computers also have their drawbacks. Excessive computer use can prevent people from getting enough exercise, spending time with family, and maintaining good health. It can be a contributing factor to the high number of obese people. When people spend too much time on computers, they often become detached from their families and immerse themselves in virtual worlds, which can lead to addiction. Prolonged computer use can also cause physical problems, such as eye strain and loss of sight, as well as other health issues associated with long - term sitting.  Despite these problems, there are ways to mitigate the negative effects. Computers can help people find suitable times and methods for exercise, ensuring they stay healthy. They can also provide information on the appropriate amount of time to spend on the computer to avoid eye problems. For those who live far from their families, computers are a valuable tool for staying in touch.  In conclusion, I believe that the benefits of computers outweigh the harms. They offer a wealth of information and the ability to communicate globally. With proper use, we can avoid the negative consequences and make the most of this technology.
553	555	1	2	Dear newspaper, I've heard you're discussing whether the increasing use of computers is beneficial to society. In my view, it has a negative impact on people.  Firstly, spending time online in chat rooms can lead people to interact with unsafe individuals. Take my friend @PERSON5 as an example. One day, she was chatting online with a man who claimed to be @NUM1 and a model. She thought he was acceptable and flirted with him for days. However, her friend later discovered that the man was actually @NUM2 and a pervert. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people in chat rooms say they have been lied to like this. Website designer @PERSON2 points out that more and more people are falling for online lies and getting into difficult situations, such as being asked to meet someone. This clearly shows that the saying “Don't talk to strangers” still holds true in the digital age.  Secondly, excessive computer use means less time for outdoor exercise. For instance, at tryouts, a girl named @PERSON4 wasn't in good shape because she spent her time on Facebook instead of practicing. As a result, she didn't make the softball team. But the next year, she trained hard every day and became the captain. She is not alone; @NUM5 out of every @NUM6 Americans are couch potatoes who choose to go online rather than stay in shape. Nutritionalist @PERSON1 says that this generation is worse than the last in terms of physical activity.  Finally, kids seem to get into more trouble online than on the streets. They post threats, insult each other, send inappropriate messages or pictures, and in some extreme cases, their actions can lead to someone committing suicide. For example, a girl created an online persona to trash a neighbor, which led to the neighbor's suicide. Many people, including singer @ORGANIZATION1, have been caught in sexting, which is embarrassing, inappropriate, and illegal. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people have gotten into big trouble through the internet. Governor @PERSON3 says that the internet and phones are destroying society.  In conclusion, I think we should use computers less to avoid interacting with dangerous people, becoming lazy, and getting into serious trouble. The potential harm is not worth the limited benefits of excessive computer use.
554	556	1	2	Dear newspaper, computers have become ubiquitous in our nation. We have them at home, at school, or at work. While many people believe that computers are bad for our health and reduce family time, I disagree.  Computers are great for improving hand - eye coordination. I've often had trouble with my hand - eye coordination, but when I use a computer, it gets much better. Experts state that @PERCENT1 more people with hand - eye coordination problems have improved through computer use. A teacher at @ORGANIZATION1 said that after students worked on computers for about two months, there was a remarkable improvement in their hand - eye coordination. Many people with computers have passed their hand - eye coordination tests, which supports the positive impact of computers on this skill.  In terms of education, computers are incredibly helpful. I want to travel the world when I graduate from high school, and computers allow me to research the places I want to visit. For example, when my parents told me we were going to @LOCATION1, I did research on different shops, museums, and restaurants the night before. The computer was so useful that I don't know where we would have gone without it. President @PERSON1 also shared a similar experience. When he had a big meeting in @LOCATION3, he used the computer to learn about the local culture and language.  Computers also facilitate communication. I love talking to my friends, but when I'm at home and they're not around, the computer comes to my rescue. I can talk to my friends via webcam or instant messaging. One of my best friends moved to @LOCATION2, and I can talk to her as much as I want through the computer. A survey shows that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people have someone they talk to over the internet.  In conclusion, computers are important in our society. They help improve hand - eye coordination, provide educational resources, and enable communication. They are far from being bad for us; instead, they are essential tools for modern life.
555	557	1	2	Dear editor of the @ORGANIZATION1, I firmly believe that computers are essential for the future.  Computers offer numerous benefits. They are a great source of learning about the world. Even though some people may argue that excessive computer use leads to a lack of exercise, the knowledge and opportunities they provide are invaluable. People with friends far away can use computers to stay in touch. Those who have difficulty speaking can use computers to communicate.  In the medical field, computers are life - savers. The @ORGANIZATION2 relies on computers to save lives. In hospitals, computers are crucial for quickly finding cures. Without them, the process of diagnosing and treating diseases would be much slower, and patients could die. For example, a person with a seemingly normal fever could actually have a serious disease, and without the help of computers, it might be too late to save them.  Computers are also used in water purification and to keep us warm in winter. In libraries, they assist people with medical conditions who can't speak. These individuals can type on a small computer, and it will speak for them. Most people find it easier to talk, chat, and text using a computer.  The internet is a vast source of information. People can learn about things they never knew existed. Kids use computers for schoolwork, and many students rely on them, especially those with physical limitations. For instance, I broke my arm and had to take tests on the computer.  In the military, airforce, and @ORGANIZATION3, computers play a vital role. The military uses thermal sights on guns and tanks to identify people in extreme weather and locate wounded soldiers. They are also working on improving bullet - proof vests with computer technology. The airforce uses computers to communicate with ground forces and can fly planes remotely, saving lives. The @ORGANIZATION3 uses radar to detect approaching boats and submarines, providing early warning of potential attacks.  In conclusion, computers are indispensable. They save lives, enable communication, and are an excellent means of research. We rely on computers to live and survive, and they will continue to be crucial for future advancements, especially in areas with high poverty rates.
556	558	1	2	Dear Local newspaper, imagine a world where people are so engrossed in their computers that they neglect physical activity, the outdoors, and social interactions. In a recent poll by @ORGANIZATION3 magazine, @PERCENT1 of people aged @NUM1 - @NUM2 prefer staying online to outdoor exercise. Since @DATE3, child obesity has increased by @PERCENT2, as children spend excessive time in front of computers. @PERSON2 of @ORGANIZATION1 at @ORGANIZATION4 attributes this rise in child obesity to the lack of outdoor activity.  Spending too much time indoors also reduces the time people spend enjoying nature. Bird watches monthly has seen a decline in subscriptions since @DATE1 as people lose interest in nature. A study by @PERSON1 and colleagues at @ORGANIZATION2 found that @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 spend @PERCENT3 more time indoors on electronic devices, mainly computers, than outdoors. @PERSON3 predicts that this trend will continue as technology advances.  Finally, excessive computer use leaves less time for family and friend interactions. In @DATE4, @PERCENT4 of families ate dinner together, but now only @PERCENT5 do so, often because family members are in separate rooms using computers. This lack of family interaction can lead to a higher crime rate. There is a @PERCENT6 chance that a child will commit a crime due to the frequent use of computers, compared to the @PERCENT7 chance in @DATE5.  Let's envision a world where people engage in outdoor activities, interact with nature, and have meaningful family time. It's time to limit computer use and prioritize a healthy, balanced lifestyle. Do we really want to see these negative trends continue for our youth?
557	559	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, although computers offer numerous benefits, I firmly believe that their negative aspects far outweigh the positives. Prolonged computer use can severely damage eyesight. A significant number of children and adults are now wearing glasses or contacts, largely due to excessive screen time. I know more than @NUM1 kids and @NUM2 parents who have experienced vision problems because of computers.  Using computers for homework is useful, but spending over an hour or @NUM3 hours a day on them can lead to addiction and eventual loss of eyesight. On average, kids spend about @NUM3 or @NUM5 hours on their laptops at night, while the time they spend with their families is often less than an hour. I think technology is the main reason for the growing disconnect between parents and children.  Many kids use the computer to chat with friends on @CAPS3 or @CAPS4, even though they see these friends at school for @NUM6 hours every day. This is an abuse of technology. Computers were invented for knowledge, not for idle web - chats or social media pages.  Nowadays, kids rarely step outside their bedrooms after school. Some even eat in their rooms to continue chatting. This not only takes away family time but also affects mental well - being. The world would be a happier and healthier place if we adhered to the original purpose of technology. I hope you agree that technology is currently having a negative impact on our lives.
558	560	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am convinced that computers are beneficial to society. Students now conduct most of their studies online. They store notes on laptops and use the internet to review class materials. When they need information for history class or other subjects, the internet is readily available. High - school students, who often dislike going to the library, rely on the internet as their primary source of information. If a student has a project due and the teacher requires it to be neat, the computer can write it neatly.  We spend a significant amount of time with our families and friends, and having some personal time on the computer is not harmful. We can use it to search for useful information or talk to friends. Moreover, when people want to learn about other countries, the computer provides up - to - date information.  Most people have computers, and it doesn't have a major negative impact on their lives. Computers are a great resource for students aiming for good grades on projects and for people who want to meet new friends. I hope you will agree that computers have a positive effect on society.
559	561	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people today use computers for essential purposes? It's true! The computer offers multiple benefits, such as helping us stay in touch with friends, providing the latest news, and offering map access.  Instead of incurring high phone bills, many people use email to communicate with friends in different cities or states. Email is easy to use; all you need is your friend's email address, and you can send friendly messages or family pictures. Teens love chatting on sites like Facebook, which allows them to get to know each other better.  The computer is also an excellent news source. Every time I log on, I can see the latest news updates. I once learned about my favorite band breaking up through the computer, which enabled me to attend their last concert. While computer use may not be the healthiest activity, it is a great way to stay informed about politics, celebrities, and other current events.  If you've ever been lost, the computer can be a lifesaver. You can look up directions on websites like MapQuest and print out maps. It's a much easier and clearer way to find your way.  In conclusion, the computer has a very positive effect on people. It allows us to chat with friends, stay informed about the latest news, and never get lost again. There's no doubt that it's time to embrace the computer and enjoy its many benefits.
560	562	1	2	"Some so - called ""experts"" caution that people should not spend excessive time on computers. However, computers offer numerous advantages. They can help develop hand - eye coordination skills, especially when playing interactive high - paced games. Through the internet, we can connect with friends and family who live hundreds of miles away, and learn about different cultures and the people in those countries without leaving home.  Computers are a great platform for skill development. For example, kids can improve their awareness, timing, and hand - eye coordination while gaming. With technological advancements, people can now attend college online at a lower cost and still receive a quality education. Many individuals even work from home thanks to computers.  In addition, instead of the hassle and expense of traveling to a far - away country, we can explore it online. We can find recipes, learn the language, and view pictures of the country and its people. For kids doing reports, the internet provides a wealth of information, saving them the time of searching through countless textbooks and libraries.  The internet also helps people connect. Leading experts from the @CAPS2.S.A. or the Family security agency note that programs like @ORGANIZATION1 and Facebook have enabled families in different countries to reconnect. For instance, with webcams, we can have face - to - face conversations with relatives or friends who live far away. It's a quicker and more engaging way to stay in touch compared to writing letters.  Overall, computers clearly benefit society. They teach us skills, help us learn about distant cultures, and connect people across the globe. I see no reason to oppose these positive impacts of computers on people."
561	563	1	2	"Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are highly beneficial and useful for a wide range of purposes. Each year, numerous innovative applications and websites are developed, simplifying our lives. For instance, ""@CAPS2"" serves as an excellent platform for communicating with friends and family. As someone with out - of - state relatives, I cherish the moments when I log on to ""@CAPS2"" to chat with them. It also allows me to connect with friends after a long school day. Another example is YouTube, which offers step - by - step instructional videos on various topics, including news and music entertainment. Software like Word helps in writing essays and stories, while PowerPoint enables the creation of slide - show videos for school projects and presentations. Excel is useful for making graphs and various charts. And let's not overlook @ORGANIZATION1, which provides valuable information about people, places, or things and is also helpful when using other software like Word. Clearly, computers play an indispensable role in people's daily lives."
562	564	1	2	"The question of whether computers have a positive impact on society can be answered with a resounding yes. Computers contribute to society in multiple ways. Firstly, they enhance hand - eye coordination. A survey by @PERSON3 indicates that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 computer users have better hand - eye coordination compared to non - users. Professor @PERSON1 states that ""people using computers are more coordinated, which is a significant discovery."" Although one might assume that computers reduce coordination, in fact, they improve it. The more one learns to use a computer, the better their hand - eye coordination becomes.  Secondly, computers enable people to learn about distant places and individuals without incurring high costs. For example, I recall when my parents were planning a trip to @CAPS1 to visit landmarks. My uncle brought a new computer, and they decided to stay home, saving a large sum of money. Famous explorer @CAPS2 says that before traveling, they always research the destination on their computer. While visiting a place in person may seem more appealing, it can be prohibitively expensive.  Finally, computers facilitate online communication. A survey by @ORGANIZATION1 shows that @PERCENT1 of people use special websites to talk to others. Renowned social worker @PERSON2 mentions that these websites improve vocabulary and social skills. Although one might worry about the safety of these websites, virus - protection software can mitigate risks.  In conclusion, computers are beneficial as they teach hand - eye coordination, help people learn about far - off places, and enhance social abilities. They are essential for society's growth and learning, so we should support the advancement of computer technology."
563	565	1	2	Dear Newspaper, in today's world, technology is ubiquitous. From grocery store checkout lanes to home coffee makers, everything is constantly being upgraded. While technology has many advantages, there are also significant drawbacks, especially when it comes to computers.  Popular websites like Facebook, MySpace, and @CAPS1 may seem harmless but are often used for harassment. They are supposed to keep friends connected, yet many kids in my eighth - grade class have admitted to either being bullied or bullying others online. Despite the harm caused, computers are still widely used. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids in my school admit to spending excessive time on their computers. They check it as soon as they get home from school and before going to sleep. This excessive computer use takes away from exercise and the enjoyment of childhood. I've seen many kids gain weight, eat poorly, and isolate themselves from reality due to their computer addiction. Some kids are even getting portable computers, indicating their extreme addiction.  On the other hand, computer programs and websites do offer ways to interact with friends. However, this form of interaction is taking a toll on kids' social and grammar skills. Most kids prefer online communication, often with incorrect spelling and grammar. In the long run, this will negatively affect their performance in school and when seeking employment.  Although computers are useful for school research and email, the time spent, the prevalence of bullying, and the decline in social skills are not worth the benefits. We need to reduce our society's reliance on computers. We should ask ourselves if we want our kids to be bullied, gain weight, or lose their social and grammar skills. By considering these questions, we may change our attitudes towards computer use.
564	566	1	2	Computers do not have a negative impact on society. In fact, they can support relationships. When communicating with someone online via @CAPS1, it helps build a connection. For example, using Skype to talk to someone online can strengthen the bond between two people, disproving the myth that computers ruin relationships.  Computers are also effective in teaching hand - eye coordination. When typing on a keyboard, one's finger reflexes improve. Continued typing leads to better hand - eye coordination. Some may doubt the effectiveness of computers in this regard, but in reality, @CAPS1 has a positive impact.  In terms of education, computers are more useful than most people think. On certain websites, such as historical ones, one can learn about different types of people. While some critics claim that computers are not educational, the facts show that they can teach a great deal.  It's easy to assume that computers are not good, but when we look at the evidence, it's clear that they are a valuable asset. If critics take these facts into account, they will realize that computers are better than commonly perceived.
565	567	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that computers have both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, they are extremely helpful for schoolwork, such as conducting research. They also teach hand - eye coordination and allow people to communicate with family members in other countries via webcam.  However, computers can also be detrimental to health and family relationships. They can reduce the time available for exercise. Instead of sitting in front of the computer all day, one could go to the park or take a walk. Moreover, excessive computer use can damage interactions with family and friends. If you stay at home using the computer while your loved ones want to spend time with you, it can cause problems.  Overall, I think computers are more of a good thing. Without computers, many of the modern conveniences in our world would not exist. Their usefulness depends on how and how much we use them. These are my opinions on computers.
566	568	1	2	"I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. Those who support technological progress also hold this view. Computers enable us to access information from afar and enhance hand - eye coordination. They are highly useful for research and fulfilling other necessary tasks. For students, they are essential as teachers often assign typed assignments or PowerPoint presentations. Parents use them for work or to book vacations. Typing on a computer is a skill, and typing games can teach kids this skill. Some fast typers even take tests, and while people naturally type about thirty words a minute, some can reach seventy words a minute.  However, there are also drawbacks. Many kids are attracted to websites like Facebook, iTunes, YouTube, and Twitter, and some become addicted. These websites can also expose users to viruses, which can range from crashing the computer to bombarding the monitor with pop - ups.  In conclusion, computers are a great source of information, but they should not turn into an addictive ""toy."" We should use them for necessary tasks like research and remember to balance computer use with real - world activities such as exercise with friends and family."
567	569	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I don't think the computer is a good technology for our generation. Don't misunderstand me; I used to enjoy using the computer, but I've realized it's harming my health.  One major issue is the lack of exercise. More than @NUM1 million children are overweight because they spend too much time on the computer. I've seen how it's affecting my own well - being.  Another problem is the presence of inappropriate sites on the internet. Kids @NUM2 and younger could access these sites. I believe people should start enjoying nature, traveling, and engaging in activities that can't be done on the computer. Kids should interact with family and friends more often instead of constantly chatting online.  The most serious issue is online bullying. If you have daughters, sons, or grandchildren, you'd be horrified if they were being bullied online, and you'd want the bully to go to jail.  From now on, I'll think about how my computer use affects my life and those around me. I hope others will do the same.
568	570	1	2	You've probably heard your parents say you're spending too much time on the computer. But there are good reasons for using it. You can multitask on a computer, talk to long - lost friends and family, and still manage to spend time outside.  Multitasking means you can do more than one thing at a time. For example, you can read and talk, text and talk, or walk and read. On the computer, you can listen to music while talking to friends or doing homework, like typing an essay. About @PERCENT2 of us can multitask. One of my friends bought a laptop with a built - in camera so they can talk to people they haven't seen in a long time. A mother from @ORGANIZATION1 said she used the camera on her laptop to see her sister who moved to California @NUM2 years ago.  Computers also make it easier to talk to friends. You usually only see your friends during lunch or before class, but on the computer, you can chat anytime.  You might get off the bus, see the sunshine, and decide to do some homework so you can go outside and play. After a few hours outside, you come in around @NUM2:00 pm, have dinner, and then want to relax on the computer.  Only responsible kids plan their time well. In conclusion, computers are great for multitasking, staying in touch with friends and family, and they allow you to balance indoor and outdoor activities.
569	571	1	2	Today's computers are very different from those in the past. While many experts worry that people spend too much time on them, I believe computers are beneficial in many ways.  Firstly, they help develop hand - eye coordination. This is crucial because if you need to type a @NUM1 - page report, someone with good hand - eye coordination can finish it in about @NUM2 minutes, while someone with poor coordination might take a few hours.  Secondly, computers allow us to stay connected with friends and family who have moved away. Thanks to platforms like @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1 instant messaging, MySpace, and Facebook, we can catch up, see new photos, and keep in touch with loved ones who are far away.  Finally, computer skills are essential in the real world. People with good computer knowledge can get great jobs, such as computer programmers, website creators, or editors for movies and @CAPS2 shows. That's why schools offer computer classes, to give students a solid computer background.  In conclusion, computers are not bad at all. They teach us important skills, help us stay connected, and open up job opportunities. It's clear that computers have a positive impact on people.
570	572	1	2	Dear leader of the local newspaper, I've heard the fallacy that computers are ruining our society. In my opinion, this is a completely wrong idea.  Computers are beneficial to society for several reasons. First, they are a vast source of information. Unlike books that need to be republished for updates, the internet can be updated instantly. This is extremely useful for students working on school projects, especially in subjects like @CAPS1. Additionally, online schools and colleges are a cost - effective alternative to traditional ones. With the large amount of information available on computers, traditional schools may become less necessary.  Second, the internet on computers can bring a lot of enjoyment. As more people use computers, companies create various online content that attracts thousands of viewers daily, making television seem less appealing. There is also a constant stream of software, including games, movies, and music. Moreover, it's easy to stay in touch with people around the world through chat programs, allowing distant relatives to connect.  Finally, the growing demand for computers has led to many jobs being computer - based. Companies allow people to apply for jobs online, and some jobs can only be done using a computer. Workers can complete tasks more easily in one place instead of commuting to a boring office.  In conclusion, with all these benefits, it's clear that computers are highly beneficial to society. I hope you can see this and recognize that computers are not a waste of time.
571	573	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, there has been a debate regarding whether modern computer activities are beneficial or harmful to people. Some argue that computers benefit society as they teach hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about distant places, and facilitate interaction with friends. While these seem to suggest that computers are good for society, in reality, they are not. Excessive computer use can lead to several harmful side - effects, such as obesity, red eyes, and even cyberbullying. People are using computers to an extent that it is detrimental to their health. Obesity is a major problem in @LOCATION1; people are getting fatter every day, and computers are clearly contributing to this issue. People spend too much time on computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. They sit in front of the computer for hours, getting heavier, and often start to eat out of loneliness. This cycle continues until they can barely get out of their chairs. Obesity is not the only health concern; eyesight is also being damaged. More and more people are experiencing eye problems, and computers are the cause. Spending just an hour on the computer can cause significant eye strain, and those who use it for @NUM1 - @DATE1 hours a day are at risk of blindness. Even when I use the computer for only @NUM2 minutes, my eyes start to water. Computers are not only harming people's health but also ruining their lives. Bullying has long been a problem in @LOCATION1. In the past, kids bullied at school could find comfort at home. However, with the advent of video - chat and other online features, cyberbullying has become a new threat. I know of a case where a student was cyberbullied to the point of attempting suicide online to show her depression. Video - chat and similar features give bullies a chance to push their victims to the brink of considering suicide. I understand that you may disagree with my argument, but I sincerely hope you can recognize the importance of this issue. Obesity, eye strain, and cyberbullying are sufficient evidence that computers are causing a variety of problems in people's health and well - being. I truly hope you will consider writing an article about these negative impacts of computers.
572	574	1	2	You seem to be quite mistaken! Computers are extremely important to society. Firstly, they can be used for research. For instance, if your boss wants to find information about products, all you need to do is go to www.google.com and search for it. It's that straightforward. Similarly, if you need to do research on @ORGANIZATION1 for school, instead of poring over books, you can simply type in the name and get the information. In @CAPS1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids and adults use the computer for research. Secondly, computers allow for convenient purchases. Suppose you want to buy a plane ticket to @LOCATION1 to offer help; you can do so at your convenience on the computer. You can also order various items needed for @LOCATION1. It's much simpler than going out to make the purchases yourself. Lastly, computers enable communication through talking and video - chatting. If you and others are in different countries and need to have a video meeting, it can be easily arranged. Also, if you have relatives living far away whom you miss, you can have a video family gathering. These are the reasons why I believe computers are crucial to society. I hope you will take these reasons into account.
573	575	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, computers have a positive impact on people as they teach hand - eye coordination, facilitate learning about people and places, and provide entertainment. Regarding hand - eye coordination, it is highly important in today's world. To play sports and type effectively, one needs good hand - eye coordination. When I was @NUM1 years old, I had poor hand - eye coordination, which affected my sports performance. After a few years of playing online games, my skills in baseball, lacrosse, and basketball have improved. My typing speed has also increased from @NUM2 words - per - minute to @NUM3 words - per - minute, allowing me to write reports faster and have more time for revision. Moreover, the internet helps me search for information for my reports, making the process much quicker. The internet is also a great resource for finding facts to support opinions. It makes school projects easier, helps students learn more, and provides opportunities to assist those in need. When I was working on my position paper this year, I needed @NUM1 pieces of information. Usually, this would be difficult, but with computers, research became much easier. I also learned a lot while researching @CAPS1 @CAPS2. For example, I found out that people don't directly pick the president; their votes elect a special representative to go to the @CAPS2. Additionally, during the earthquake in @LOCATION1, I was able to donate through the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 website. Finally, the internet and computers offer entertainment. My mom often tells me to find ways to entertain myself without involving her. With the internet, I can play online games alone. Watching movies on the computer is also a great way to relax. These examples illustrate why I believe computers are important for improving hand - eye coordination, learning about different people and places, and providing entertainment. Although my opinion is personal, I hope you will emphasize the importance of computers in your future articles.
574	576	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have had a profound and positive impact on society. They enhance knowledge, offer entertainment, and facilitate social interaction. Computers are excellent learning tools. While one can read books, using a computer to search for information is much quicker. You can type in what you want to know, and within seconds, you'll have access to @NUM1 million sites with relevant information. Computers can also show you the exact location and details of places you're interested in. They can even provide step - by - step instructions on how to build or create something. In terms of entertainment, computers are a great source. You can play games, watch movies, and catch up on TV shows you missed due to work or other important tasks. Social interaction is another area where computers shine. Through websites like Facebook, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, etc., you can make new friends or stay in touch with existing ones. Positive social interaction on the computer can help combat depression. If you're happy while using the computer, there's less room for depression. Also, if you have any questions, the computer can provide thorough answers, leaving you satisfied. As is evident, computers can perform many great functions, and what I've mentioned is just a fraction of their capabilities. Computers will become an even more integral part of our lives. If you can't use a computer, you'll likely face difficulties. I hope you'll consider my views even if you have a different opinion. Thank you for your time.
575	577	1	2	You claim that computers are bad and offer no physical or mental help in real life. However, many people use computers to find yoga poses and diet tips, which clearly shows their physical and mental benefits. While it's true that computers can sometimes get kids into trouble, especially when they spend excessive time chatting on platforms like @CAPS1, Facebook, Twitter, etc., without knowing who's on the other end, they also have many positive aspects. You can find useful information on computers and check travel sites. Computers are not all bad; they help a large number of people. Instead of quickly judging their capabilities, we should recognize the many ways they assist in our lives, especially for those with physical needs. In conclusion, we should view computers as valuable tools that, when used properly, can bring numerous benefits to our lives.
576	578	1	2	Computers are widely used by everyone, yet there comes a time when one should step away and engage with real - life experiences. While computers offer benefits such as improving hand - eye coordination, enabling communication with friends and family, and providing opportunities to learn about distant places and people, they also lead to a sedentary lifestyle. People end up spending excessive time on computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with loved ones. Exercise is crucial for maintaining good health, and a significant percentage of obesity cases are attributed to excessive computer use. Sitting for long hours while consuming junk food becomes a habit, and people often lose track of time on the computer. The addictive nature of computers causes individuals to forget about other important activities like shopping or spending time outdoors. I firmly believe that there should be a limit on computer usage to encourage people to exercise more. If people continue to neglect exercise, they will become unhealthier and weaker over time. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, it is essential to strike a balance between virtual and real - life experiences to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
577	579	1	2	I am writing to express my strong belief that the excessive use of computers is extremely harmful to people around the world. When people are engrossed in computers, they neglect exercise, the beauty of the outdoors, and quality time with family and friends. Lack of exercise can significantly shorten one's lifespan, and if this trend continues, more and more children will become overweight and unhealthy. An expert, @PERSON1, pointed out that @PERCENT1 of children in grades @NUM2 in school today are over @NUM1 pounds, while the average should be @NUM3 pounds or less. Moreover, children who spend too much time indoors on computers miss out on sunlight and the vital vitamins it provides. Experts at @ORGANIZATION1 have warned that if children do not reduce their computer time, they will never truly appreciate the beauty of nature. Interacting with family and friends is also of utmost importance. I once experienced the pain of not being there for my great - grandmother when she was in the hospital due to cancer because we rarely talked. We should not let such situations happen to us. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computer use, including a shorter lifespan, childhood obesity, and strained relationships, are undeniable. We must spread awareness to prevent these issues from affecting more people.
578	580	1	2	In today's digital age, a large percentage of people communicate online, and there's nothing wrong with that. The question is whether we should be for or against kids and parents spending too much time online. I wholeheartedly support online use. First of all, many kids have friends they can only communicate with online as they may not be able to text or talk on the phone. A significant number of kids are now communicating online. As @ORGANIZATION1 stated, @NUM1 of @NUM2 kids are online chatting with others. Many parents prefer their kids to be online rather than getting into trouble outside. Secondly, kids often bring home projects and homework. It's much better for them to look up information online than to guess and get it wrong. I have personal experience of getting a better grade on a project when I used the internet for research compared to when I guessed the answers. Lastly, many people have family members on the internet and want to stay in touch with them. Even if someone stays online often, it's usually for a good reason, like talking to family. I used to have limited communication with my family until my son got me an internet connection, and now I can talk to them every day. Although some people may spend too much time on the computer and neglect exercise or going out, the reasons for being online are generally positive. In conclusion, the internet is a great tool as it allows kids to communicate with friends, helps with schoolwork, and enables people to connect with family. We need to decide whether we support or oppose internet access and make the best choice.
579	581	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are not beneficial to society. In modern times, people spend so much time on computers that they get little to no exercise. Exercise is essential for maintaining a fit and healthy body, and the rise of high - tech computers has contributed to an increase in the obesity rate in our country. This is a significant concern in our computer - dominated society. Additionally, while it's possible to communicate with family and friends on social media like Facebook, face - to - face interaction is a basic human need. Building strong relationships with family and friends requires in - person communication. Family will always be there for us, but we need to interact with them face - to - face to strengthen those bonds, and the same goes for friendships. Finally, everyone should experience the beauty of nature. It's a shame that many people choose to stay indoors on their computers instead. Despite the wonders of nature being available to all, a large percentage of people don't take the opportunity to enjoy it. In conclusion, computers are having a negative impact on society as they lead to a lack of exercise, less face - to - face interaction with loved ones, and a missed opportunity to enjoy nature. We should focus more on fulfilling these basic needs rather than being overly reliant on computers.
580	582	1	2	The advent of computers and the internet, a relatively recent innovation, has become a common feature in households. Over the past twenty years, they have evolved and gained popularity. I am convinced that they bring numerous benefits to society. One of the key advantages of computers is in the realm of learning. In the @DATE1, life would have been very different without them. I, for one, couldn't have written a high - quality research paper without the help of a computer. The internet offers a vast array of useful resources such as databases, encyclopedias, and articles. With just a few keyword searches, we can find the information we need, which is much faster than skimming through multiple books. Once we find the information, we can easily copy it into a document and print it. Another significant benefit is communication. I have experienced this firsthand when a close - knit family moved to @LOCATION1 for work. Thanks to the internet, I have been able to stay in touch with them. Countless others have also benefited from this global connectivity, whether through email, @ORGANIZATION1 instant messenger, or Facebook. It's more convenient than coordinating phone calls. Moreover, computers have revolutionized the medical field. Scientists and doctors can make new discoveries and stay updated on the latest advancements. Doctors use computers for surgical planning and procedures, which has improved medical research and diagnosis, saving many lives. A large percentage of disease - related research tests involve the use of computers. In conclusion, computers have had a profound impact on personal lives, global communication, and the medical field. They have enabled people to learn, stay connected, and save lives, and their positive influence on the world today is undeniable.
581	583	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I concur with the experts who believe people spend too much time on the computer. Excessive computer use leads to family and friends growing distant, mood swings, and weight gain. Moreover, computers today can do a great deal, which further contributes to the problem.  When one spends an inordinate amount of time on the computer, family members start to worry. Spending an entire day on the computer can make others view you differently. For instance, if you stay inside on a [DATE1] and turn down your friends' invitation to go out, they will gradually drift away. As a teen, I enjoy texting, talking, and going outside. It disappoints me when I want to hang out with a friend, but they are glued to the computer.  When I was [NUM1] or [NUM2], I used to be on the computer for days or even weeks. It was only after my friends and family advised me that I realized the issue. I had a friend who was a good athlete, funny, and nice. However, after his mom got him a computer, I no longer wanted to be his friend. He would get angry when I asked him to come outside, and when he did, he was always too tired to do anything or run.  I also used to be overweight because I never went outside to exercise. When I was [NUM2], I would get mad at everything if I couldn't use the computer. I was like a brat.  Computers can truly change people in many negative ways. For example, games like [CAPS2] of [CAPS3] can quickly become addictive, leaving you with little time for other activities. Social media platforms like [CAPS4] are also problematic. While they help you stay in touch with friends, excessive use can hook you. Online chat rooms and games where you create a virtual persona can make you think that's your real life. In reality, computers are like drugs; they are addictive, but they can't do everything.  In summary, I agree that excessive computer use causes family and friends to seem distant, leads to mood swings and less exercise, and the capabilities of modern computers are also a concern. Now that you are aware of these dangers, I suggest you reconsider your relationship with computers.
582	584	1	2	Dear newspaper, I disagree with your view on computers. In my opinion, computers are highly beneficial for projects, homework, and letter - writing.  When it comes to projects, if you don't want to go to the library, you can use a computer to look up information on almost anything. You don't have to draw pictures by hand as printers can handle that. For homework, many kids, teenagers, and even adults dislike it. With a computer, you can quickly look up answers online and finish your homework in no time. For example, when writing an essay, typing on a computer allows you to design it in your own style, making it look better than a hand - written one. It also eliminates the hassle of losing a hand - written paper and having to start over, which can be extremely frustrating, especially when the assignment is due the next day. Additionally, you don't have to worry about someone stealing and copying your hand - written work.  Computers are also great for letter - writing. Teachers can use them to write report cards, and you can write letters to friends who have moved away. Whether it's a love letter to your wife or girlfriend, or a letter to a long - lost friend, typing on a computer is fast. If the recipient has a computer, they can receive the letter quickly. Even if they work at a school, since most schools have computers, they can access the letter.  In conclusion, I hope I have convinced you of the importance of having a computer. While it's not always necessary to be on the computer all the time, it is extremely useful for various tasks.
583	585	1	2	Dear Newspaper, Computers seem to be the hot topic this year. Many people think computers are essential for daily life, but I firmly disagree. In my view, we do not need computers, as their effects on kids and adults are astonishingly negative.  Firstly, as we use computers more, our natural environment is being neglected. Pollution is spreading across the planet, and people are becoming addicted to computers. The average person spends about ten hours a day on a computer, which is almost half of a day. This is terrifying as computers are almost brain - washing us. Instead of being glued to the computer, we should go outside to enjoy fresh air and sunlight. Moreover, sitting in front of a computer all day without exercise is a serious health issue. We should appreciate the simple things in life and learn to be thankful for what we have. Banning computers would have a positive impact.  Secondly, many people are losing their ability to write by hand. Writing an essay with a pencil and paper may seem old - fashioned, but it has numerous benefits. Writing things out on paper helps us remember important facts better and for a longer time. It's like writing in our brains. Students, children, and adults would also have better handwriting. English teacher [PERSON1] at [ORGANIZATION1] school, who has witnessed the negative effects of computers on students firsthand, said that students are completely absorbed in computers and have lost their energy and reactivity.  Finally, humans are spending huge amounts of money on the latest computer technology. Most people use a large portion of their paychecks on computers. These fancy but often useless computers are very expensive, and many people are just following a trend. Instead, this money could be spent on schools and addressing global issues like wars.  In summary, computers have a negative impact on people. People are not spending time in nature, they are being brain - washed by computers, and a large amount of money is being wasted on computer technology. We should recognize these problems and reconsider our reliance on computers.
584	586	1	2	Dear newspaper editor, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people. The internet allows people to communicate, learn about various things, places, and even their own families. With appropriate use, it can also benefit our health.  If the internet had never been invented, it would be extremely difficult to talk to people from around the world. For example, if you're a 14 - year - old with no friends, you can join online communities like MySpace or Facebook to make new friends. Also, if a family member or friend goes on vacation to another country and long - distance calls are not convenient, you can communicate with them through platforms like [CAPS2].  The internet is also a great learning tool. When I had a school project on Frederick Douglass, I used the internet to find information about his family, childhood, and his place of origin. It's a powerful search engine, but we should not spend too much time on it as our bodies need other activities.  Regarding health, contrary to the common belief that using the computer makes people fat and unhealthy, I think it can actually improve our well - being. Using the mouse on a computer helps with hand - eye coordination. You can also look up diet plans, find health - related medicine, or discover new exercise methods.  In conclusion, based on these reasons, I firmly believe that the internet has positive effects on people.
585	587	1	2	More and more people are using computers. In fact, about [PERCENT1] of [CAPS1.T] has computers. I think having a computer is extremely beneficial, especially for emailing, jobs, and schoolwork.  Computers are great for communication. For example, if you play baseball and forget the time of your game, you can quickly turn on your computer and email your coach to ask. Instant messaging is also a wonderful way to talk to friends online and meet new people. Emailing is a high - tech method to stay in touch with family members who live thousands of miles away. I once emailed my aunt Lisa in Florida and asked her to send me pictures of the beaches. The pictures she sent were amazing.  For jobs, computers are indispensable. In today's world, many things are computer - controlled, such as cash registers, ATMs, and cars. If your boss asks you to fax a copy, you can do it via the computer in a minute. My dad's job requires him to use a computer, and he keeps all his work on his desktop and laptop. Most jobs rely on computers. Do you have a computer for your job?  Computers are also very useful in school. Teachers use computers to take attendance, assign homework, and manage other tasks. If my teacher didn't have a computer, he would be at a loss. It's also beneficial for students. In social studies, we use our laptops to look up information about presidents every week. There's also a program called Power School where students can check their grades and missing assignments.  In conclusion, I think everyone should have a computer. They are extremely helpful for emailing, working, and schoolwork. Without computers, we wouldn't know as much as we do now. Since about [PERCENT1] of [CAPS1.T] already has them, it's clear that computers will play an important role in our lives. Welcome to the digital age.
586	588	1	2	I'm a regular computer user, and I'm in good health. Just because someone spends more time on the computer than exercising doesn't mean they're unhealthy. In my opinion, computers are extremely helpful in our lives. Let me share some of the ways computers assist us. They can tell us the weather and provide all the information we need. If you have a job, they can also help you manage your time and avoid wasting it. Computers are also a source of entertainment. You can visit various websites and play games. You can communicate with others and receive emails, which is similar to getting real - world mail but from a computer. However, there are some problems. Some people use computers too much and don't get enough exercise. They should get up and be more active. That's my take on computers. I hope people will balance their computer use with more physical exercise.
587	589	1	2	Given that a large number of people around the world use computers, we are all aware of their common uses, such as surfing the internet, playing games, and for work and school. Some individuals believe that computers are beneficial as they can help develop hand - eye coordination, teach about different parts of the world, and enable online communication. I'm a student in the 8th grade at Mystic Middle School, and I firmly believe that computers are not as great as some people think. Have you heard of computer camps? These are places where kids who are addicted to computers are sent. At these camps, kids are separated from their computers and are essentially forced to participate in group activities like fishing or solving mysteries together. These camps are well - known for helping kids overcome their computer addiction. Another reason computers are bad is due to the internet. The internet is a dangerous place. You can chat with strangers, and you never know if they have malicious intentions. They might try to find out where you live and cause harm. So, you always need to be cautious about who you talk to online. Computers also have technical issues. They tend to slow down with use, and a kid or parent typically has to replace a computer every two years or so. If your computer doesn't have proper security, it can get a virus, and fixing it can cost a few hundred dollars. A computer can suddenly stop working, and all your data may be lost forever. After explaining my views on computers, I hope people will think differently. Do you want to end up in a computer camp because of excessive use? Or worse, face unknown dangers on the internet. I already know how expensive it can be to fix a computer, and I don't want you to learn this the hard way. That's why I believe computers bring more trouble to people.
588	590	1	2	Are you really of the opinion that computers don't benefit society? Well, they definitely do. Computers help us reconnect with people. They offer an excellent search engine and the ability to watch videos. They are becoming an integral part of our daily lives. Computers are great for reconnecting. My mom used Facebook and found friends she hadn't seen since the early 1980s! It's an amazing tool for daily communication with friends. You can even use video chat to see them. Clearly, computers are a boon to society in this regard. Computers also have outstanding search engines. If you're doing research for a paper on Africa, all you need is Google and Wikipedia. They can provide you with all the materials to get an A - grade. If you're waiting for a newspaper, the internet can give you the news and more. Additionally, the computer is the only place where you can get millions of free songs for your iPod or phone. It is truly one of the greatest electronic inventions. The computer allows you to watch videos on the internet. If you want a good laugh, YouTube is the place to go. You can also learn about history, current lifestyles, and much more. You can even upload your own videos. It's a wonderful combination of a great website and a great device that benefits society. After writing this essay, I can confidently say that computers benefit society. They help us reconnect with people, offer a top - notch search engine, and let us watch videos. They are evolving every day, providing users with maximum satisfaction. Without a doubt, they are helpful.
589	591	1	2	"Dear newspaper, computers are excellent resources and offer numerous benefits. Since we have this technology, why not make full use of it? Computers provide us with simple yet highly useful programs like Microsoft Word or Photoshop. They also give us the ability to look up any information we need and help us stay in touch with distant relatives through platforms like Facebook or video - chat services like Skype. Imagine finishing a school essay and then misspelling a word, having to start all over again. This was a common occurrence before computers when people used typewriters. In contrast, with programs like Microsoft Word on a computer, if you make a simple mistake, all you need to do is press the backspace key. Such programs make creating essays and flyers extremely easy. There are also other useful programs like PowerPoint, Photoshop, and video - editing software. These programs offer real - time editing. You can simply insert your camera chip into the computer and start editing right away. Downloadable programs simplify our lives and save us a great deal of time. In addition to writing programs, the internet and search engines like Google are invaluable. All you have to do is type in a short phrase, and you'll instantly get thousands of information - packed websites. It's much faster than spending time in a dictionary. A survey shows that 8 out of every 10 kids use the internet at least once a day. For example, if you're planning a party and need new food recipes, just type in ""creative foods for a party"" on the internet, and you'll have hundreds of options to choose from. The internet is an amazing invention that is easy and helpful to use. Another great aspect of using a computer is social networking. Platforms like MySpace, Facebook, or Skype are wonderful for catching up with old high - school or college friends or planning events from the comfort of your home. If you have a night - time soccer practice and can't hang out with friends but still have time for a quick chat, these platforms are perfect. Video - chat services like Skype are especially useful for business. If you need to talk to someone in another country for business and don't want to travel, all you have to do is open a link, and there they are. They're great for businesses and long - distance relationships. I have an uncle and aunt living abroad, and we use Skype to stay in touch. It's a fantastic way to communicate globally. Although computers might make us seem lazy at times, they offer us a lot. They save us time and provide convenience. With amazing programs, easy access to information on the internet, and social - networking tools, computers are one of the most convenient things we have. I strongly believe you'll agree with me."
590	592	1	2	"Dear [unnamed recipient], I believe that using a computer has a positive impact on people. However, it's also true that some people are not getting enough exercise. To address this issue, we should engage in sports or family activities to get out of the house. Everyone needs to stop being lazy and become more active. I think we should establish an ""exercise day"" and turn it into a tradition. It could be held twice a year, more frequently like once a month, or at any interval we choose. The important thing is that there is a dedicated day for people to exercise. In conclusion, while computers bring many benefits, we must also ensure that we maintain a healthy lifestyle by getting enough physical activity. An exercise day can be a great way to achieve this balance."
591	593	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on our lives, and this applies to technological advancements in general. They can contribute to obesity, transform individuals into sedentary beings, and harm social lives. It's not that computers lack utility; rather, people use them excessively. In @LOCATION1, the number of obese individuals has been increasing each decade. A viable solution to reduce the obese population is to encourage people to leave their computer chairs. @CAPS5, if you spend all day sitting on a chair, playing flash games and watching YouTube videos, you're bound to gain weight, and those extra pounds will accumulate over time. Fast - food companies like @ORGANIZATION1 are contributors to obesity, and so are computers. When someone has a big mac burger, should they go upstairs to play a flash game or go to the gym for a workout? Rest assured, clicking a mouse won't burn any calories. People who frequently use computers rarely appreciate the true beauty of nature. They're so engrossed in shooting animated rabbits that they miss out on seeing real ones. Would you prefer to take a walk in the park or stare at a computer screen for @DATE1 and a half hours? The world is a beautiful place, and the more time you spend on the computer, the less you'll realize this. Computer use can also affect social life. The more you socialize with strangers online, the less you'll know how to communicate with real people. I, for one, would rather have a real girlfriend than a virtual one. You might get so caught up in a @CAPS4.V. show on the computer that you neglect spending time with your loved ones. Your family is far more important than a silly computer game. In conclusion, in my opinion, we should use computers less. If people spent a bit less time on the computer and more time in the real world, they could become fit, nature - loving, and popular. I'm sure the @CAPS1 is an adult.
592	594	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I think spending too much time on a computer is bad. One reason is exercise. People should be outside jogging, working out, and enjoying nature. They should also be socializing with friends. Another reason is spending time with family. Being with family is important because it's fun, and they're great to socialize with at home or anywhere else. Sometimes, socializing on a computer isn't as good as socializing in person. It's easier to talk with friends and family than to sit on a chair typing long explanations about a conversation. The last reason is being active. Being active is fun, allows you to socialize, and helps you play sports. It keeps you healthy and can strengthen your lungs and heart. For example, football makes your legs strong, and basketball keeps you quick and constantly moving. Being active gives you a healthier, stronger, and better - shaped body. So, I firmly believe that spending a lot of time on a computer is bad.
593	595	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, it may be true that computers can lead people to exercise less, enjoy nature less, and spend less time with family and friends. However, computers offer numerous benefits to society. They assist students with homework and projects and facilitate communication. Besides the telephone, although computers do have some drawbacks. Students rely on computers to complete homework and class projects. They can help students create excellent presentations and use the internet for research. Having access to computers can improve a student's grades and contribute to a more successful future. Moreover, parents and children can communicate with long - distance friends, relatives, co - workers, bosses, and teachers. Computers enhance communication and help people stay in touch with family members. Nevertheless, computers also have negative aspects. They can expose children to inappropriate websites and even viruses that can crash the computer. Fortunately, most anti - virus programs block access to inappropriate sites such as gambling and pornography. We need computers pre - installed with the latest and best virus - protection systems to safeguard children, teens, and adults from viruses, inappropriate content, and cyber - bullies. With these features, computers would be almost perfect. The ideal computers should aid students in learning, promote communication among people, and be pre - loaded with protective programs. Computers are essential, and without them, our lives would be extremely difficult.
594	596	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe people need to distinguish between the virtual world of computers and the real world. Many people are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time with their families or doing truly important things. When you're on the computer, you're not getting any exercise or getting stronger; you're just sitting still. This is one of the reasons people gain weight, as they're not moving around. When you're glued to the computer all day, you miss out on what's happening with your family. I think people should cut down on their computer time, get some exercise, or call a cousin, brother, or even your mom to find out what's really going on because they're the ones who truly matter. However, you can't really tell people how much time they can spend on the computer. You can only offer an opinion and hope they'll listen.
595	597	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper, technology is truly fascinating, isn't it? Take computers, for example. They can help us check information online, learn about distant places and people, and enable communication. This clearly benefits society and makes life easier and faster. Do you ever forget your homework or the start and end times of an event? You can always check online whenever you forget. This way, you can stay on top of things and get prepared early. For instance, if you want to know the start time of a movie at the theatre, you can check online. Also, if you forget the steps for a project or homework, you can look it up online. So, students don't have to go to school the next day saying, ""@CAPS1 I didn't know what to do"" or ""@CAPS1, I forgot how to do it."" Have you ever wanted to travel to a place but knew nothing about it, its cost, or have you wanted to learn about a famous person like @PERSON1? Instead of going to the library and going through countless books, you can just go online. There are millions of websites about places and people, making it much easier to learn about a specific place, person, or thing. The computer is extremely helpful and useful. You can even plan a vacation and ensure you have enough money by checking prices online, so you won't have to worry about running out of money when you get there. Do you ever want to communicate with your friends all day without using up your phone minutes? On the computer, you can communicate with multiple friends. Chat rooms can have hundreds of people. So, it's easier to communicate with all your friends on the computer than on the phone. You can also communicate with people around the world, including family members and relatives, no matter how far away they are. If you haven't seen or talked to them for a while, you can have a webcam or video chat. Staying in touch with important people and friends is a great thing. The positive effects of computers on people are truly something to be grateful for. You can check information whenever you forget, easily learn about people and places, and communicate with your family and friends."
596	598	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, have you ever wanted to go outside and play a football game with your loved ones? I know I have, @CAPS2. I believe that approximately @PERCENT1 of kids are on the computer @NUM1 either because they have nothing else to do or because it is addictive. The reason I firmly believe in this statement is that people are concerned about how much time individuals spend on the computer instead of with their families. One crucial fact about kids being on the computer is the potential danger it poses. Nowadays, kids often don't realize how dangerous being online can be. For example, I recall a time when my cousin said he went to the movies to meet a girl he had met on MySpace. Instead, he encountered a ballet hewdet (presumably an inappropriate person) and a sex offender who claimed to be the one he had been talking to online. The offender invited my cousin to his house to play Xbox, and my cousin shouted ""hell no"" and headed to my house since the movie theater was closer to my place. Safety is of utmost importance. Would you rather have your children safe with you or with a stranger? Computers can also be useful when needed for school or work. However, some people find it fun to stay home and use the computer for no particular reason. Secondly, don't you want to spend time with your children before they go to college or something? Even a simple activity like playing a football game can strengthen the bond between you and your child. One thing you can do to encourage them to go outside with you is to take away the computer for a week and have fun with your child. Play some of their favorite sports. Without a strong bond between you and your child, just letting them be lazy on the computer won't do any good. So, the time has come to make a choice: let your kids waste time on the computer or go out and have fun with them."
597	599	1	2	"There has been an ongoing debate about whether computers benefit or harm society. Personally, I agree with the view that computers bring benefits to society. I think computers can improve hand - eye coordination. When one can type quickly and accurately, it indicates good hand - eye coordination. I remember as a child, I watched my grandmother type about seventy - five words per minute. Through years of practice, she became very proficient with computers. My own hand - eye coordination has also improved significantly because I have been typing for a long time. Scientists state that @PERCENT2 of people who type for at least four years show enhanced hand - eye coordination. Typing fast keeps fingers quick and agile. I once read a book on computers, and an expert said, ""The invention of the computer keyboard could possibly be the greatest hand - eye coordination practice ever."" Another advantage of computers is that they allow people to learn about distant places without having to travel. In school, students can complete projects on other countries by using a computer instead of traveling. I once did a class project on @LOCATION1 and got a @PERCENT1 just by using a computer. People can also look up information on countries for personal interest. My mom wanted to learn about @LOCATION2, so she simply looked it up on the internet from her computer. One can also research schools on a computer. My older sister went online to look at colleges without having to travel to the actual college states. Finally, computers enable people to communicate with others online. There is @CAPS2 - mail, which allows individuals to write to others over the internet. I remember when my baseball coach informed me that I made the team, he simply @CAPS2 - mailed my parents as it was the easiest way. There is also @CAPS4 (instant messaging), which enables immediate two - way communication. I used to go on @CAPS4 every day to talk to my friends. Additionally, video chatting allows people to see and talk to others directly. I read a news article on video chatting, and an expert said, ""Video chatting is the single best way to communicate with someone without being right in front of them."" Based on these reasons, I firmly believe that computers are a great help in our society."
598	600	1	2	Dear people of the newspaper, I believe that computers have both positive and negative impacts. On the positive side, computers are useful for looking up information about the other side of the world. For instance, when students need to write a paper on a far - off place, a computer can provide up - to - date information, unlike a book. Thus, computers have a beneficial effect on school kids and in the workplace. However, many people spend the whole day chatting with others on computers and don't go outside to get fresh air. This shows that computers have a negative impact on some individuals. While computers are necessary for work and other tasks, I think most people overuse them for chatting and gaming. Some people, though, use computers sparingly and go outside instead. The problem is that too many people spend excessive time on computers, such as on Facebook. They end up sitting around and getting fat because they don't go outside to play and breathe fresh air. Instead of being glued to the computer, they could go outside, sit on a swing, and text while enjoying the fresh air. In conclusion, we should be aware of the appropriate use of computers, balancing their benefits with the need for an active and healthy lifestyle.
599	601	1	2	Technology is advancing at a rapid pace every day. One of the most popular technological devices is the computer. Although more and more people are using computers, not everyone believes that they benefit society. I firmly believe that computers do bring benefits. Firstly, computers allow people to explore various things from the comfort of their homes. Before the advent of computers, one had to go to the library, search for the required book, and then rummage through it to find the necessary information. These steps could take hours, especially if one didn't live near a library. With computers, all one has to do is type the query into a search engine and find the information quickly. This also saves on gas money as there is no need to drive anywhere. Secondly, computers enable free online communication. Without a computer, one would have to either drive to meet someone, talk on the phone, or text, all of which can be costly. On the computer, there are options like e - mail, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, etc. These tools offer different ways of communication. Whether one wants to view pictures, take quizzes, play games, or have a conversation, @CAPS2 provides the means. And with e - mail, one can send letters, videos, or simply have a typed conversation. In conclusion, considering these benefits, it is clear that computers are a valuable asset to society.
600	602	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, as @MONTH1 approaches, it's important to recognize that computers are extremely helpful machines. They offer online education to a large number of people. On the computer, one can learn almost anything. For example, my cousin @PERSON2 earned his accounting degree through an online college program. Now, @PERSON2 has a well - paying job in accounting. Without computers, many people would not be where they are in life today. Just on @DATE1, I was assigned a history paper on @LOCATION2. All I had to do was spend about an hour researching @LOCATION2's culture and history on the computer, and I received a good grade on my paper. Computers are very helpful in assisting people with their studies and work. This leads to my next point: computers teach creativity and improve hand - eye coordination. The computer has @CAPS3 different features. Computer integration, as described by @PERSON1, is sophisticated. It not only allows people to be creative in their own way but also enhances hand - eye coordination. Many people value the creativity that comes from using a computer. @DATE1, research has shown that @PERCENT1 of people say that computers are a great way to communicate without physical contact with @CAPS5. In conclusion, computers are not just useful; they supply people with knowledge, boost creativity and hand - eye coordination, and are a major means of communication. So, to the editors, writers, and readers in @LOCATION1, computers are helpful machines, and those who don't use them are missing out on a lot.
601	603	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are high - tech devices that enable us to connect with friends and family in distant places such as France or @LOCATION2. They also allow us to conduct research for school projects and play addictive games. Undoubtedly, computers have modernized our lives, but their impact on human beings is deplorable. We have over - utilized these simple devices and failed to use them in moderation. It is a well - known fact that at least an hour of exercise is required daily. However, @CAPS3 around the world are not getting enough exercise due to excessive computer use. Parents' hard - earned money is being squandered on these extremely expensive computers, which can cost anywhere from @NUM1. What a waste of money! @PERCENT1 of @MONEY1 kidnappings occur because of the overabundance of information on the internet. Do you want this risk for your child? Computers, once helpful tools, have now transformed into @CAPS4 - warping machines. @PERCENT2 of the world's @CAPS3 are obese today. Why? @CAPS3 are in a stage of rapid growth and are supposed to be active and playful. Without engaging in active sports like dancing or basketball, they will gain weight. Kids spend up to @NUM2 hours a day on a @CAPS2, remaining inactive. @CAPS2 pull kids in like a magnet, leaving no time for them to stay healthy, active, and fit. I recall one instance when my friend @PERSON1 got a new computer. She stopped coming out to play basketball with us and just stayed inside. Eventually, she became obese and developed diabetes. Parents, is this what you want for your @CAPS3? Do you want to spend a large sum of money on a machine that makes your @CAPS3 extremely unhealthy? Times are tough, money is scarce, and electronics are costly. A @CAPS2 can cost anywhere from @MONEY4 to even @MONEY3, which is a huge amount. Parents work long hours, for example, @NUM3 hours a day, and may not earn enough to waste on a @CAPS2. An average household spends @MONEY2 on computers over a lifetime. Do you really want to buy your @CAPS3 a machine that is outrageously expensive and will only make them unhealthy and draw them away from sports? I remember when my mom bought me a new @CAPS2 for @NUM4 dollars, and it broke the next day. What a waste of money! Help your @CAPS3; don't buy a @NUM2,000 - dollar @CAPS2. Keep your @CAPS3 active and healthy, and make sure your money stays in your wallet. Online chatting also poses a great risk. A small window pops up on your screen. “Who are you?” you ask. “@CAPS7, your friend @CAPS8's friend,” the little window replies. You say an @CAPS7 “hi,” and then it says, “Hey, you want to come over? It's the cool thing.” You reply “@CAPS9, ok.” What's wrong with this situation? Well, a lot of things are wrong, and this happens to @PERCENT3 of online chatters. Remember, online, you can be whoever you want. You could be only ten but claim to be @NUM6. Many @CAPS3 are kidnapped because of online chatting. You can talk to your @CAPS3 all you want, but it doesn't guarantee they won't end up in such a situation. The less time your child spends on the @CAPS2, the lower the chance of them being kidnapped. The @CAPS2 is so dangerous; would you ever put your child in harm's way? Computers used to be helpful devices full of information, a source of enjoyment, and a means to talk with aunts, uncles, and friends like @PERSON2. Now, they have turned into persuasive boxes full of harmful side - effects. Do you want your child to feel the wind in their ears, the pounding of their heart, and the smell of grass, or do you want them to experience only the bright screen and the thrill of beating level @NUM7? Do you want to spend money on unhealthy contraptions? And do you want your @CAPS3 to be put in danger just by using a @CAPS2 at home? Computers are @CAPS4 - morphing devices that take away @CAPS3's quality of life. Do you want this for them? In conclusion, it is clear that the negative impacts of excessive computer use far outweigh any potential benefits, and parents should take steps to limit their children's computer time.
602	604	1	2	@ORGANIZATION2, there are numerous reasons why computer technology benefits society. Newspaper companies, for instance, rely on computers to produce the @ORGANIZATION2 paper. In my view, computers offer multiple advantages to society, including aiding in education, career development, and facilitating family connections. Through this letter, I aim to make the benefits of computers more apparent to you. One significant way computers benefit people is in the realm of education. A poll conducted at @ORGANIZATION1 revealed that @PERCENT1 of students believe computers assist them in their academic pursuits. Adults, too, utilize computers for educational purposes. In the class of '@NUM1 at @CAPS2 high school, a large number of students dropped out before completing their senior year. However, @PERCENT2 of those students managed to finish both high school and college through online classes. Computers also play a crucial role in career advancement. At @CAPS3 industries, @PERSON1, the @CAPS4, stated, “I don't know where our business would be if we didn't use computers.” According to a poll of high - ranking industry executives, @PERCENT3 reported that their businesses revolve around the internet. This could very well be the same poll your @CAPS4 participated in. Finally, computers help separated families stay connected. A marine mentioned that he tries to contact his family as often as possible while at sea. If anyone deserves to be able to reach out to their family after two years of separation, it is surely the members of the military. In conclusion, computer technology has brought about significant benefits to many. While a system to regulate people's computer use could be implemented, it would likely not be well - received. Changes can be made, but if something as important as computer technology were to be restricted, would people not resist? Overall, the positive impacts of computer technology on education, careers, and family connections are undeniable, and we should embrace its continued development.
603	605	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I firmly believe that limiting your use of the @CAPS5 to a maximum of @NUM1 minutes per day will provide you with ample time to go outside and exercise. Using the @CAPS5 in moderation is acceptable, but excessive use is detrimental to your health. Unless it is related to your job, you should spend only @NUM1 minutes to an hour a day on the @CAPS5. Some individuals spend so much time on the @CAPS5 that their eyesight deteriorates. Not only does it affect physical health, but it can also cause various eye problems such as blood - shot eyes, pink eye, or even @CAPS4. This is a very serious issue. People who are addicted to the @CAPS5 are referred to as @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Over @PERCENT1 of people claim to know or be someone who is a @CAPS5 addict, and scientists predict that this number will double or even triple in the next year. I understand that people need to use the @CAPS5 for tasks such as sending emails, working on projects, generating ideas, or creating models. However, it is disheartening to see that fewer people are reading books these days. In conclusion, we should be more conscious of our @CAPS5 usage and strive to maintain a healthy balance between digital and real - world activities to safeguard our well - being.
604	606	1	2	Dear newspaper, in my opinion, both kids and adults spend an excessive amount of time on their computers. While I can recognize some of the benefits, the drawbacks are significant. Computer use keeps people away from a healthy lifestyle, outdoor activities, and exercise. It can also have long - term effects on eyesight. When people search on @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS1 search engines, more than half of the results are unreliable. Moreover, as more people use computers, the risk of plagiarism increases, which is a serious issue in the community. People need fresh air, physical exercise, and the experience of exploring the outdoors. Instead of searching for places online, it is far better to visit them in person. For example, searching for @CAPS2 online only provides pictures of food, but visiting @CAPS2 allows you to actually taste the food. Would you rather sit in front of a computer screen or have the real - life experience of visiting new places? Plagiarism not only prevents learning but also leads to negative consequences. Kids often rely too much on computers because they are lazy and used to being indoors. However, I also acknowledge that computers offer certain skills that real - world experiences may not provide. For instance, typing on a computer improves hand - eye coordination, which is essential for writing long papers in college and can contribute to success in school and life. Another benefit of computers is their positive impact on the economy. As more people buy computers, it helps stimulate economic growth. Despite these advantages, my opinion remains that we should reduce our computer use. Whether you already have a computer or not, I recommend getting off the couch, exercising, and visiting new places. In conclusion, while computers have their merits, we should prioritize a healthy and active lifestyle over excessive computer use.
605	607	1	2	Dear newspaper, I read an article in the paper discussing how using computers can be both beneficial and a bad habit. I actually think it's a great idea for people to use computers, and I have several reasons to support this view. When students need information on a particular topic, the internet is a valuable resource. There are numerous online sites that can provide the necessary data. Typing topics into search engines helps in quickly finding relevant information. Teachers can also type assignments on their computers and have them ready the next day. Additionally, the internet offers interesting pictures related to the learning content. Sometimes, it even contains more information than a specific book. However, it's important not to search all night to avoid a high electricity bill, and one should always double - check the information as it may be false. Using computers isn't just for work. People use them to shop online, check movie times, and communicate with friends. Online communication with friends is beneficial because in school, people may not be able to talk freely, and they may not see each other on weekends. Teens usually talk to their best friends online. If friends are in the same town, they can use their laptops to communicate wherever they are. This way, they can learn about things they have in common, which might be happening nearby. Young students can learn to type on computers. This skill is useful in the future for typing school assignments, job applications, or college applications. Learning to type helps students familiarize themselves with the keyboard, allowing them to type quickly without looking at the keys. It can also aid in reading and understanding complex words. In conclusion, I believe that computers don't have an overly negative impact on people. As long as computer use is limited to no more than two hours a day, it's fine. Overall, the advantages of using computers far outweigh the disadvantages, making them a valuable tool in our daily lives.
606	608	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, my name is @CAPS2, and I, along with @PERSON1, believe that the idea regarding why people need computers is a valid one (@CAPS3). In my opinion, some claim that people use computers so extensively that they neglect exercise. However, this is untrue as computers offer programs for weight monitoring, stock tracking, and more. Technology also facilitates global communication through websites and programs like video - chatting platforms and @CAPS5.com for instant messaging. For teenagers, computers are useful for video - chatting, emailing resumes for jobs, and presenting details about recent employment. Additionally, computer technology aids @CAPS6 in saving resources. Most importantly, people rely on tech equipment in fields such as the navy, @CAPS6, and the global shipping industry. In business, it is essential for ordering stocks and other operations. For @CAPS6 in the field, it is used for @CAPS7 - related matters like pregnancy monitoring and pulse radar. Some readers may argue that people become addicted to technology. But in reality, people truly need it. Everything around us is largely the product of technology. I firmly believe that people should recognize that computers assist in communication, @CAPS9, emailing, and enhancing lives. They help in finding family and friends, providing directions, and more. I encourage @CAPS9 to inform the dean @CAPS1 and readers that interacting with technology is a positive way to manage one's computer usage. Technology enables people to discover and create opportunities for making money and achieving positive outcomes. Everyone in the world uses tech equipment these days. Those who read this article should share it with those who view technology negatively to help them develop a positive perspective.
607	609	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I'm of the view that computers have a positive impact on our lives. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, they are excellent for research. Whether you've got a school or work assignment in @MONTH1, a computer is a great source of knowledge. You can type and research on any topic, and it's also useful for checking bills (@CAPS1). Secondly, computers are fun. They offer numerous games and activities. Picture a rainy day when you're stuck at home, bored. Just hop on your computer and either play a game or find activities for the whole family. Finally, computers are ideal for staying in touch with distant family members. All you need is a webcam connected to your computer, and it's as if your grandma, grandpa, cousin, or uncle is right there. You can talk to them just like on the phone, without any cost. In conclusion, as I've described, computers are beneficial for research, playing games or doing activities, and keeping in touch with family. In my house (@CAPS2), we mostly use the computer's webcam to see my grandma in @LOCATION1. I hope this letter changes your opinion about this wonderful invention, the computer.
608	610	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 Times, while some people (@CAPS2) think that computers are beneficial for society, I disagree. In my view, the risks associated with computers outweigh the benefits. Take my father as an example. He has never used a computer in his life, yet his business is thriving. He and his father keep all their records in a safe. One of my father's friends stored everything on his computer. When a virus struck, all his files and records were lost. My father prefers to hand - write all his papers and says that if he needs to type something, he'll buy a typewriter. Moreover, on platforms like Facebook, people's privacy is at risk. Malicious individuals can pose as others, which may lead to kidnapping or even death. Another significant concern is that when people store a large amount of personal information on their computers, a virus can expose all that data. For instance, I saw a show on the Discovery Channel where a man hacked into a MySpace account and attempted to create a cyber - threat to the Pentagon using the account holder's identity. The hacker almost got caught but managed to evade capture. This is why my family doesn't like computers. We're always busy working on the farm or in the barn and have no time for the internet. The only valid use we see for it is for schoolwork. Maybe we should go back to the old - fashioned way; without computers, there would be fewer problems.
609	611	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have @NUM1 reasons to explain the effects of computers on people. First, computers are harmful to your eyes. Second, I'll discuss why people use computers so frequently. Third, there are numerous games and websites like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter. Keep reading to learn about all these reasons. Firstly, computers are bad for your eyes. They are somewhat similar to @CAPS3 but not exactly. Computers contain more information, while @CAPS3 doesn't offer as much for browsing. The more time people spend on computers, the more likely they are to experience vision problems. Even an hour or more of computer use can increase the risk of blindness. Some people with glasses wrongly believe they are immune to vision deterioration, but in fact, they are more likely to become more visually impaired. As you read on, you'll learn my second reason for excessive computer use. People get on computers mainly to pay bills, do taxes, order things, or buy tickets for vacations or business trips. However, this exposes them to a vast amount of information that can be accessed by others in different countries or states without their knowledge. They also use computers to improve their lives, such as meeting someone special. My third reason is that there are many activities on the computer. Popular websites like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter allow people to meet new friends and chat with old ones. In conclusion, people should limit their computer use due to health risks, privacy concerns, and the potential of meeting strangers.
610	612	1	2	In our society, computers play a significant role. Some believe that they enhance society and benefit the people in @LOCATION1, while others think they harm @CAPS1 citizens. I firmly believe that computers can take our society to the next level and bring benefits to people. Computers can improve hand - eye coordination, which is useful in sports. For example, in goal - keeping, fast movements and good hand - eye coordination are essential. A computer can help goalies increase their hand - eye coordination, enabling them to save more goals. Good hand - eye coordination can even save your life. If a knife is coming at you, having this skill allows you to move your body to avoid it, rather than just covering your head. Computers also have mental benefits. They can take you around the world without leaving your room, teaching you about different cultures and lifestyles. People in @CAPS1 who can't afford to travel can experience the world through computers. A student who can't visit a country can use the internet to get a virtual tour. Communication has also been made easier by computers. You can talk and see people via video chat. This is beneficial for society, whether you're communicating with a business partner or a loved one. There are various communication methods available, such as emailing and instant messaging. In conclusion, computers have elevated our society. They enable people to travel the world virtually, communicate easily, and improve physical and mental abilities. As computers continue to grow in @LOCATION2, they will keep us at the forefront. So, what's your choice?
611	613	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 individuals are utilizing technology. Many of them believe it is enhancing their learning capabilities, while others hold a different view. Personally, I think computers present both advantages and disadvantages. They offer an advantage as they provide people with opportunities to experience beyond what they are learning. However, they are also a disadvantage because numerous people spend excessive time on computers and do not engage in sufficient physical activity. There are pros and cons to computers, but the cons seem more prominent. How much time do you spend on the computer? @CAPS2 people find computers more engaging than going outside for exercise. With the advancement of technology, more and more people are purchasing computers. A large number of teenagers are spending increasing amounts of time on computers, playing games and visiting their favorite websites. This is one of the reasons why children aged @NUM1 and above are becoming obese as they do not get enough exercise. It also affects people's time spent with friends and family. I know many people enjoy spending time with their loved ones. But if you are constantly on the computer and never make time to hang out with friends or family, your friends may start to distance themselves from you. You might end up feeling lonely. Constant computer use can ruin your life. If you are choosing the computer over other important things, then there is a problem. Excessive computer use can become an addiction. People may not realize it, but it can take over your life. I say this because once you are addicted to something, it is difficult to stop. It is possible to quit on your own, but it is rare. In most cases, it is best to seek help. I hope you will take all these reasons into consideration.
612	614	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to express my agreement with the points made in the writing prompt. I will discuss three issues: excessive computer use, over - reliance on online communication, and the negative impacts of spending too much time on computers. People use computers excessively. They like to visit platforms such as MySpace and play online games. They also communicate with others online. When you visit someone's home, you often see young children or parents online or playing games. Moreover, people talk online too much. They frequently visit Facebook and MySpace, where there is a risk of identity theft. Kids especially love MySpace. For example, strangers may ask for your email address. Spending too much time on computers is harmful. Kids may encounter problems online and fail to prevent the situation from worsening. They may also argue with friends. Additionally, they may become inactive and prefer online activities over real - world experiences. So, @CAPS1, do you now agree that people should be more active outside and have fun? In conclusion, this is why I believe being active is important. Spending all day on the computer can make it difficult for you to adapt to a real - world lifestyle, especially after @NUM1 hours of continuous use.
613	615	1	2	Computers should be accessible to everyone! I firmly believe so, and I'll explain why to convince you. Computers can be regarded as a gateway to learning. They have several positive effects on people. They help develop hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about distant places and cultures, and allow online communication with others. These features are truly remarkable. Moreover, computers are constantly evolving with time. As you read this introduction, I hope you are open to understanding why computers are positive devices that can benefit everyone. Firstly, as mentioned in the introduction, computers teach hand - eye coordination. This skill is essential as without it, many tasks would be impossible. For instance, flying a plane requires both hand and eye coordination as you need to control the aircraft manually and check the status through multitasking. This is just one example of how computers are beneficial. Secondly, computers provide people with the opportunity to learn about far - off places and people. This enriches our knowledge of different cultures, heritages, and family histories. This knowledge can be valuable in any future job and can help us achieve success in life. Therefore, computers play a significant role in expanding our knowledge. Lastly, computers allow people to communicate with others online. This is also advantageous as it enables us to learn new things and meet new people, as previously mentioned. Don't you think computers can benefit anyone? I do and will always hold a positive view of computers. In conclusion, I hope you enjoyed reading my points and agree with the positive impacts of computers. I truly believe that computers are beneficial to all and should continue to be an important part of our lives. They benefit society, and I enjoy using them. Thank you.
614	616	1	2	Dear Newspaper, there is a common belief that modern technology, especially computers, is making people lazy and preventing them from engaging with the real world. This has several negative consequences. Firstly, people are neglecting their families. Instead of going camping, visiting amusement parks, or attending family gatherings, they choose to be on the computer. As @PERSON1 said, people can learn more effectively from family and friends than from a computer. Secondly, excessive computer use is leading to a sedentary lifestyle. Instead of going for a walk or enjoying the outdoors, people sit in their rooms and view virtual things. Those who spend a lot of time on the computer should consider joining a sports team. Lastly, there are safety risks associated with using the computer. Both children and adults who interact with strangers online are at risk. People on the internet may lie about their identities, and meeting them in person can be dangerous, even life - threatening. Moreover, many teenagers and adults post inappropriate pictures on the internet, which is not acceptable. I hope that if you or your family members are constantly on the computer, you will realize the importance of spending time with family, staying physically active, and avoiding the risks of interacting with unknown people.
615	617	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I do not believe that computers benefit society. I have heard that some experts are worried that people are spending too much time on computers and less time on productive activities. There are three main reasons for my opposition to the widespread use of computers. Firstly, heavy computer users are neglecting their families and friends. Computers are highly addictive, and I understand why people might choose them over loved ones, but I think it is wrong. I have many friends who prefer to be on Facebook or MySpace rather than hang out with me. These websites can make people forget about reality. They will ignore real - world interactions just to be on the computer all day. This is why I believe computers should be restricted due to the issue of neglect. Secondly, computer use is extremely time - consuming. Time is a precious resource, and it should not be wasted. Statistics show that the average teenager spends @NUM1 hours a day on the internet, and the average adult spends about @NUM2 @NUM3 hours on the computer. This indicates that a large amount of time is being wasted. Lastly, excessive computer use is leading to a lack of exercise. I am aware that children are not getting enough exercise, which is crucial for their growth. Statistics show that around @PERCENT1 of children under @NUM4 years of age are obese. This clearly shows that exercise is more important than spending time on the computer. In conclusion, considering these negative impacts, I firmly believe that we need to be more cautious about our computer use.
616	618	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers, regardless of whether they are children or adults. Consider this: anything that can be done on a computer can also be accomplished without one. Moreover, individuals should allocate more time to experiencing nature outdoors. Additionally, there are potential negative aspects associated with being online, such as exposure to inappropriate content and the occurrence of harmful events. I challenge you to name a single task that can only be done on a computer and not without it; it's virtually impossible. For instance, research can be conducted and pictures can be found in books and magazines. Instead of relying on social networking sites, one can visit friends in person, or if they are far away, make a phone call or write a letter. To stay informed about current events, reading the newspaper or watching the news are viable alternatives. If you enjoy using computer design programs, try creating a real - life drawing. And if you frequently download music, you can purchase a CD or, even better, attend a live concert. The fact is, not everything that seems to require a computer truly does. Artificial simulations pale in comparison to the real outdoors. On a computer, all you can do is observe, which is merely a snapshot compared to the real - world experience. Outside, you can feel the gentle breezes, the warmth of the sun on your skin, and the coolness of the grass beneath your feet. You can smell the fresh pine and clean air, and hear the sounds of surrounding creatures. Spending time outside is also beneficial for your health; it provides exercise and vitamin D, while staying indoors can lead to weight gain, laziness, and illness. Can't you recognize the charm of the outdoors? Computers can cause more harm than good. They can expose children to inappropriate pictures and topics, and are even being misused for illegal activities like drug sales. Children often use the internet irresponsibly, which can disrupt friendships and get them into trouble. Additionally, computers have made it easier for kidnappers to target children by pretending to be their peers, using the information they obtain to carry out kidnappings, a problem that is becoming increasingly common. Clearly, computers are not as helpful as one might think. They offer no truly unique benefits that aren't already covered by other means, cannot replace the real outdoors, and can be easily exploited for bad or illegal purposes. As such, the general public should reduce their computer usage.
617	619	1	2	Dear local newspaper, as a society, we have made significant progress in terms of advancements and inventions. One invention that has had a profound impact on the world and continues to amaze is the computer. This technological device offers numerous benefits and positive effects on people. Without it, people would be at a loss. For example, computers enable people to maintain social connections through common social networks. They can also be tailored to meet specific individual needs and help expand one's knowledge. Just think about the people you've communicated with via email or instant messaging in the past week: your dad on a business trip, your aunt and uncle who sent pictures of their newborn, and your friends from camp. The list is endless. Computers like @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 support social networking platforms such as @CAPS4, i - chat, and video chat, allowing you to stay in touch with family and friends. In my own life, I use my @CAPS5 to video chat with my sister, @PERSON3, who is a freshman at a college in @LOCATION1. This is a convenient way for us to keep in touch, avoiding long periods of separation and the high cost of plane tickets. With a computer, connecting with people in different towns, states, or even hemispheres is effortless. Computers also play a crucial role in the medical field. In cases where someone is rushed to the hospital in an emergency, computers are used to monitor the patient's condition. @PERCENT1 of hospitals nationwide consider computers essential in their facilities. When my grandfather, @PERSON2, was being treated at the @CAPS6 hospital, computers were used to monitor his heart rate, oxygen levels, and blood pressure. If any issues arose, the computer would alert the doctors. Thus, computers are a great asset in the medical department. Finally, computers are excellent tools for knowledge expansion. There are countless websites that can teach people a wide range of things. For example, if you're planning a trip to @LOCATION2 and want to learn about its culture beforehand, you can simply search for information on your computer. In my academic life, teachers often assign research papers. When going to the library isn't an option, the internet on a computer is the best way to gather information. Internet research is the preferred method in colleges and universities. Recently, my social studies teacher, @PERSON1, assigned a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 project. I chose the topic of community service and conducted research using the computer, as did all my classmates. In conclusion, computers have a multitude of uses. The main ones include facilitating communication with friends and family, assisting in the medical field, and promoting knowledge expansion. Therefore, I firmly believe that computers represent a positive technological advancement with a great impact on people.
618	620	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I'd like to ask you whether you think computers have a positive or negative impact on people. In my opinion, they have a positive impact, and there are several reasons for this view. Firstly, computers are widely used for educational purposes around the world. Some individuals use them to pursue online college degrees, while others use them to access information about places like Egypt that they may not be able to visit. Secondly, computers help us connect with and make new friends. We can chat with our friends, which is extremely useful. For instance, if we need to know about a homework assignment, we can simply chat with a friend. Lastly, computers are a great source for world news. We can use them to find out about significant events, such as the earthquake in Haiti. These are just a few of the reasons why I believe computers have a positive impact on us. I hope you'll agree with me.
619	621	1	2	Dear @PERSON1, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial for people. They can help individuals find their way in life. For example, having computer skills is an advantage when looking for a job. In today's job market, employers often require candidates to have experience with computers to offer well - paying positions. As we grow older, having computer knowledge can be a great start in life. It can help us lead a more normal life, although what 'normal' means varies from person to person. Computers can also be used to gather information. For example, they can tell us about the ratings of different places. If a place has a low rating, like a @NUM1 star rating, we might want to avoid it. In contrast, a computer can guide us to better options. Many people, including my teachers, use computers regularly. My teachers use computers to manage and organize information, sending data into the computer and giving it labels. Based on my observations and experiences, I am convinced that computers are good for people.
620	622	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, don't you think that spending time in nature is better than spending excessive time on the computer? In my view, it is, and I'll present three key reasons. First, there's the issue of the obesity rate in @LOCATION1. Second, you can spend more quality time with your family. Third, you can enjoy the wonders that nature has to offer. I believe that the great outdoors is the better choice because @LOCATION1 residents need more exercise instead of being glued to computers. The obesity rate in @LOCATION1 is alarmingly high and rising. In @DATE1, @PERCENT1 of the population was obese or overweight. In @DATE2, it was @PERCENT2. The rate has increased by about @PERCENT3 each year, as reported on www.tomatotalks.org. Another important aspect is spending time with family and friends. Statistics show that spending time with family, especially at the dinner table, is an excellent way to discuss a child's school problems, learn from parents' mistakes, share laughter, and plan for the future. Finally, nature offers a wealth of opportunities for discovery. You can encounter important creatures such as insects, reptiles, and mammals, and learn about the trees that provide us with oxygen. For those with a career in science, nature has invaluable benefits. While computers are educational, nature provides a more immersive and beneficial experience. In conclusion, we should prioritize spending time in nature over excessive computer use.
621	623	1	2	Those concerned about the negative impacts of computers are correct on a few points, yet there are indeed positive aspects. For instance, when the military needs to recruit soldiers, they can post recruitment ads on computers, which are visible to a wide audience. Drop - outs seeking a second chance can apply for school online. Also, individuals struggling to find jobs can search for suitable positions on the internet. To learn more about how the internet benefits society, read on. As the military faces continuous losses of soldiers in combat and tries to recruit, posting ads on the internet is a great option. Mailing out ads would take a long time for people to discover. For example, posting an ad on MySpace can attract thousands of views within minutes. In conclusion, the internet is an excellent means for the military to recruit soldiers.
622	624	1	2	Computers offer numerous benefits. If we were to lose them, our lives would change dramatically. Computers can be used for exercise, and it is up to the [@CAPS3] to set limits. Moreover, they can save lives. Without computers, there would be no internet, and we couldn't communicate with friends via [@CAPS1] or email. Cell - phone prices would skyrocket, and we would, in a sense, revert to [@NUM1] - [@NUM2] years ago. Large companies would also face more difficulties. Regarding exercise, we can use the internet to find nearby gyms, quickly determine healthy foods, obtain [@CAPS2] fitness equipment for the computer, and access free workout videos. The [@CAPS3] should have the discretion to limit computer use. If they notice a child spending too much time on the computer and gaining weight, they can require an hour of exercise for every hour of computer use. Computers can save lives as well. Before computers, medications like Tylenol were used for various ailments such as stuffy noses, headaches, and colds. Now, we can check on the computer whether a medication is dangerous and find the nearest hospital. In conclusion, although excessive computer use can lead to an unhealthy lifestyle, computers can do a great deal of good. They can save lives, and with limits set by the [@CAPS3], they can also be used for exercise. So, please don't take away our computers.
623	625	1	2	"I firmly believe that spending excessive time on the computer is a waste of life. It has a negative impact on us. Not using the computer can bring more time for family, outdoor activities, and maintaining good health. When we choose to use the computer instead of exercising, we miss out on opportunities to stay fit. For example, if we spend an hour on the computer, that hour could have been used for a run and burning calories. Statistics show that [@PERCENT1] of people who choose the computer over exercise are at risk of health problems, including obesity. Clearly, using the computer is not the healthiest option. Going for a walk or enjoying nature is far better. A girl named [@PERSON1] from [@LOCATION1] said, ""I love to enjoy the beauty of the outdoors that God gave to me. I wish I had known this years ago when I was a lazy person on the computer."" If we just look out of our windows, we'll be eager to go outside and experience the world. Everyone wants to live life to the fullest, and that means going out and experiencing life, not sitting on a computer. Family should always come first. For example, on a [@DATE1] night, [@PERSON2] ignored her mother's call for dinner to use the computer. We can't sacrifice time with our friends and family for the computer. In conclusion, it's time to decide whether computers benefit society. Without excessive computer use, we'll have more free time for our loved ones. So, get off the computer and spend quality time with your family."
624	626	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They are useful for learning, looking at maps when traveling out - of - state, communicating with others online, and online shopping. I don't think adults spend more time on computers than exercising. It's mostly kids who use computers for games and other activities. Some people use computers for homework, writing papers, or searching for people. Computers are great for learning about people and words. They are not just for playing games and listening to music; they have many practical uses. We can look up restaurants and their prices, and on [@LOCATION1], we can watch episodes of [@CAPS1].V. shows online. I think computers are better than books and dictionaries as they can perform all the functions of these traditional resources. Some people think computers are great because they are fast and easy, while others think they are a waste of time. However, computers are beneficial. When writing a paper, we can type and print it, avoiding messy handwriting. They are also fast when we need to search for something in a hurry. In conclusion, computers are useful for a wide range of activities, including those similar to books, writing papers, accessing websites, chatting with friends, using web maps, listening to music, and playing games. They have a positive impact on both people and kids.
625	627	1	2	Dear local newspaper [@CAPS1], I agree that people should exercise more and spend time with family and friends. The question is whether people should spend less time on computers and more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with loved ones. Firstly, people should focus more on exercise. They need to watch their diet and stay fit. Parents should be responsible for ensuring their children eat well and exercise. Secondly, spending time enjoying nature is better than being on the computer. If people are always on the computer, they'll never know what's happening in the real world. Thirdly, interacting with friends and family is crucial. When we interact with them, we learn new things about them and discover new places. For example, during a vacation, I learned a lot about my family and friends by interacting with them. I realized how fun and interesting they are. There's no real fun in just sitting on the computer. In conclusion, it's time to decide. People should spend more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends rather than being glued to the computer. Don't waste your life; live it to the fullest.
626	628	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1 and @CAPS1, contemplate where the world would stand without computers. Without modern technology, our daily lives would be lackluster and monotonous. Computers empower society to carry out diverse activities that would be unfeasible otherwise. They enable us to learn from home, connect with others, and offer a source of entertainment. Due to these advantages, our lives have become easier and more convenient, which is what @CAPS2 individuals strive to achieve. The learning ability of the average person has significantly improved. It has evolved from being restricted to traditional schooling to a multitude of ways to enhance intelligence via computers. Programs like @ORGANIZATION1, which teaches languages, are accessible on computers. These programs are comparable to attending school but are more accessible to the public. To further assist the public, there are options to earn college degrees online. Even if one attends school, a computer still aids in excelling at work as numerous research sources are available on it. Additionally, the web on a computer is an excellent place for enjoyment. However, some people still claim that computers are not beneficial. They assert that people are losing touch with nature, yet there are @CAPS2 ways to appreciate nature on the computer. They also mention that people are not losing weight, but the computer provides websites to support weight - loss efforts. In conclusion, computers bring substantial benefits and are indeed valuable. New technology is a positive development and should continue to expand as it enables learning, connection with people, and offers entertainment, thus helping the general public. Please consider my points and purchase a computer.
627	629	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, throughout @CAPS2 ages, technology has continuously evolved, revolutionizing our way of thinking. From the first basic telephone in the @DATE1's to today's touch - screen iPhones, and from horse - riding to traveling in high - speed sports cars and bullet trains, technological advancements have shown that there are no limits, as evidenced by the invention of planes and our successful lunar exploration. Computers have only become faster and more advanced. Although an increasing number of people are using computers, one of our greatest technological achievements, some believe it does not offer social benefits. I firmly believe that computers are beneficial. Firstly, they can provide and teach us seemingly infinite information. Secondly, they have made the world a smaller place through communication. Lastly, they can even help locate missing people. Computers are constantly contributing to society, adhering to the technological goal of making life @CAPS3. Firstly, computers benefit society by providing and teaching us a vast amount of information. Nowadays, when someone wants to know something, the first place they usually turn to is a computer. This is because search engines like @ORGANIZATION1 offer extensive information on various topics with few limitations. This has not only made life @CAPS3 but also assisted students in elementary school with test preparation. Computers also offer a wide range of functions for the average person, from online banking to creating PowerPoint presentations. Even older individuals like @PERSON1 may find computers a bit strange. Secondly, computers benefit society by shrinking the world through communication. Sixty years ago, it was difficult to contact a relative overseas. Today, one can easily have a video call with a relative in @LOCATION2 from @LOCATION1 in less than ten seconds. One can not only talk to grandparents but also see their smiles, and children can engage in activities like @CAPS4. During a crisis, people can still communicate with their worried loved ones. Finally, computers benefit society by having the ability to locate missing people. After the record earthquake in @LOCATION3, mothers cried for their missing children. Thanks to computers, families were reunited. On many internet sites, @LOCATION3 set up person locators, allowing people to register their names in case of a disaster. This also helped in finding family members. In conclusion, I strongly believe that computers benefit society because they contain a wealth of information and programs, have proven that the world is a ""small world,"" and have made the world safer. It is no wonder that many people are purchasing computers."
628	630	1	2	"Dear Newspaper, I am writing this letter about computers in the hope that you will publish it. Over @NUM1, many people in @LOCATION1 own a computer, but are they truly healthy? I firmly believe that computers are not a good thing. People spend excessive time on computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and most importantly, computers pose significant risks. I think computers are not good because people no longer exercise as they used to. Some people spend @NUM2 out of @NUM3 hours a day on computers, and for others, it has become their entire life. Spending so much time on computers causes people to lose touch with the outside world. Since the advent of computers, obesity rates have risen. People just sit at the computer, chatting and eating without restraint. This is clearly unhealthy. I also believe computers are not good because people spend less time enjoying nature. In the past, when I had free time, I could call a friend and go for a walk together. Now, they suggest having a ""virtual walk"" on the computer. This is not the same as a real walk with the wind in your face, the fresh scent of nature, and the sight of animals. Nature is a beautiful thing, and if we don't appreciate it, it will lose its charm. Moreover, computers are extremely dangerous. Young children, thinking they are grown - up, use computers and may encounter rapists, murderers, and thieves. People also send hurtful and violent content to each other, and those who use the computer frequently can be tracked down by bad people. Additionally, the military and @ORGANIZATION1 store secrets on computers, which can be hacked by those with sufficient skills. In conclusion, I have presented my @NUM4 main reasons for believing that computers are not beneficial. They are neither physically nor emotionally healthy as they lead to a lack of exercise, a disconnection from nature, and pose high risks. I hope you will publish this letter so that everyone can consider my perspective and make their own decisions."
629	631	1	2	Dear Newspaper People, I am convinced that the impact of computers on us is positive, and I believe you should share this view. Firstly, computers are like teachers. You can access websites that teach various subjects such as math. You can also enroll in cyber - schools or take college courses online. Secondly, computers facilitate communication. You can send emails, use webcams to talk to people, and join social media platforms like Facebook or MySpace to chat and learn more about others. Lastly, computers are a great source of entertainment. There are numerous free games to play, and you can watch movies and listen to music online. You can even create games and other content to share with others. Without computers, we would lose the ability to do all these things. I think life would be much less enjoyable, and many people would agree with me. Therefore, I urge you to agree that computers are a valuable asset to our lives.
630	632	1	2	Using computers is an excellent way for people to communicate with distant relatives or friends, acquire keyboarding skills, and research far - off places. The remarkable technology of computers is truly astonishing. They can surf the web in milliseconds. This is beneficial as when writing a research paper on China, search engines allow for rapid web - surfing, enabling users to gather all the necessary information quickly. Scientists state that @PERCENT1 of computer users have high - speed internet, and they recommend it to first - time buyers. The computer I use is customized to my preferences. Since I enjoy playing games and editing videos, I installed an outstanding graphics card with high - speed video - rendering capabilities. My @NUM1 GB hard drive can store all my programs and projects for future use. Engaging in various activities on the computer can improve hand - eye coordination. Approximately @PERCENT2 of computer users claim that after using a computer for a while, they can type @PERCENT3 quicker than before. While the average person might take @NUM2 minutes to write a certain amount of text, I can type it in about @NUM3 minutes due to my regular typing practice. Computers are an important part of my life, and I still have time to spend with my family and friends. Finally, computers assist us in chatting with friends on platforms like Facebook, MySpace, and @ORGANIZATION1. These platforms allow us to share with friends and, if needed, communicate with distant relatives. For example, my cousin, who graduated from college and is now teaching in @LOCATION1, can be web - chatted with on @ORGANIZATION1 when our family gets together. We haven't seen him in @NUM5 years, and these chats, along with the pictures he sends, help us stay connected. In conclusion, from high - speed web - surfing to connecting with distant relatives, computers offer both fun and the ability to balance time with family and friends.
631	633	1	2	Dear local newspaper, computers have a positive impact on our community. Through computers, people can learn, communicate with those from other states or even other countries, and improve hand - eye coordination. Computers offer numerous learning opportunities. Students can go online to gather information for school projects, which can lead to better grades. They can also use computers as a study tool. There are educational games on the computer that children play while unconsciously learning and preparing for school. Online classes are another option, especially for those who cannot afford traditional classes.  Computers also facilitate communication. They help families stay connected when members live far apart. My cousin @PERSON4 and my aunt @CAPS1 math live in @LOCATION1, and I didn't meet them until @DATE1 when they visited. Now that I've met them, I can keep in touch through the computer. Dr. @PERSON2 says that maintaining close relationships with family and friends is important for one's health, and computers enable us to talk to our relatives, thus benefiting our well - being. Additionally, after college, friends may move to different states, and computers help us stay in touch.  Finally, computers are useful for improving hand - eye coordination. When typing a word and hitting the desired keys, one is learning this skill. I've seen kids with special needs use computers to improve their hand - eye coordination. There's a girl named @PERSON3 in my school. Her helper teacher, Ms @PERSON1, says that computer games have helped her. Overall, the impact of computers on society is positive.
632	634	1	2	There's a concern that excessive computer use might lead to a lack of exercise and a disconnection from the outdoors and social interactions with friends and family. However, computers are essential. With just one click, they can assist many people and even save lives. As technology advances, so do the ways computers can help us.  Computers can aid in job - hunting. They also allow us to chat with friends, whether they're our besties or our grandmothers. For students, computers are great for homework and learning English. They can also be a springboard for starting a new job or business. If a business offers products or services that people like, it can expand, hire more people, and open multiple stores.  Computers are also handy in the kitchen. With a click of the mouse, one can cook food and discover new recipes. In conclusion, despite the potential drawbacks, the benefits of computers in various aspects of our lives are undeniable.
633	635	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, recently, there has been a debate about how computers affect people's lives. I firmly believe that the effects are negative, mainly in terms of a person's health and well - being.  Over @PERCENT1 of kids and teens are obese, and computers can contribute to this statistic. Even if a person eats unhealthily, they can still be fit through exercise. But if they choose to sit at the computer instead, they'll gain weight. Being overweight brings many health risks, such as heart problems, and it can prevent a person from exercising. Simple tasks like climbing stairs can become a challenge for overweight individuals.  Computers can also disrupt family life. My cousin used to be an outgoing person. Now, he spends all his time on the computer. He wakes up, has breakfast, and then plays on the computer until lunch. After a small lunch, he goes back to playing. He continues for several more hours, then takes a break to have dinner and goes on his laptop all night. His family tries to get him off the computer, but he only communicates online. This has a huge impact on his family as he can't interact with them in person.  Regarding a user's well - being, many teens have Facebook accounts. When I have homework that requires using the internet, I often end up on Facebook. Chatting on Facebook while we're supposed to be doing homework affects our grades. If we don't do our homework, we won't get good grades, which can lead to other serious problems. Moreover, computer use can be addictive. There was a case where someone tried to kill himself because he didn't have his computer.  In conclusion, there are many negative effects of computer use on users. These can lead to health problems, family issues, and academic decline. We should spread awareness of these facts to avoid these problems.
634	636	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, I am of the opinion that computers are extremely useful to society. Millions of people, companies, and small businesses rely on computers to operate efficiently. Those who use computers daily can attest to their usefulness. In fact, schools are starting to recognize their value. I highly recommend that everyone becomes familiar with this useful and well - known technology.  Many large and small businesses require the features that computers offer. For example, my mother, a former - district manager of the fast - food company @ORGANIZATION1, was given a laptop for work. This shows that businesses need computers to run smoothly.  Computers have also revolutionized education. Some teachers, including my teacher @PERSON1, have incorporated computer technology into their teaching. Due to the popularity of computers, classes have been created in schools. At my school, there's a computer education class (or ""comp"" for short) that teaches kids the real - world knowledge and skills that come with using a computer.  In my view, it's great that computers are being used in so many places. Corporations like @ORGANIZATION1 are realizing the benefits of using computers. Teachers are also using them in the classroom. I hope others can see the positive impact that computers bring, just as I do."
635	637	1	2	I'm writing to discuss how computers impact society. While I initially thought computers weren't that great, especially considering certain website uses, there are both positive and negative aspects.  Many people use computers to access various websites. For email, they use sites like @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION1L, @CAPS4.mail, etc. They also use well - known websites such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, etc. @CAPS1 messaging is another popular use. It allows people to connect with friends, family, and even strangers, especially when they can't reach them through other means, like when someone doesn't have a phone or lives far away.  However, there are problems. Some people may become addicted to certain websites, visiting them over and over again. Also, kids often use computers for internet access, and many play games that may not be suitable for their age group. Moreover, some websites may be inappropriate for minors.  On the positive side, computers can be a great tool for research. If you know someone but can't find them, you can browse online. And there are appropriate websites that can help with learning and building mental skills.  In conclusion, despite the negative aspects such as addiction and access to inappropriate content, I believe that computers benefit society. They help with brainstorming and allow us to learn about different websites.
636	638	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 Times, I am writing regarding the recent article in your newspaper about computers. I firmly believe that computers are an essential part of the modern world. They offer several advantages: retrieving information for projects or articles takes far less time compared to searching through books, obtaining important news updates is effortless, and entertainment is just a click away. Regarding information access on the internet, consider writing a paper on ancient Egyptians. Looking up the spelling of ""hieroglyphics"" in a dictionary would take a few minutes, while online it would take approximately @NUM1 seconds. Or, if you wanted to know when @ORGANIZATION1 died, scouring textbooks could take hours, but online it might take just over a minute. Another benefit is news updates. You can stay informed about recent natural disasters or track your stock performance. Computers also played a significant role in the recent election and will continue to do so in the future. Additionally, you can always find real - time weather information for any location in the world on the web. This is useful when planning a trip, which you can also do using a computer. Finally, it's hard to get bored on a computer. The web is filled with cool games and funny videos. There are about @NUM2 gaming sites and @NUM3 sites with interesting videos and pictures. Platforms like Facebook allow you to share pictures with friends, family, and relatives, or chat with strangers from around the world. So, the next time you need information, news, or just want to have fun, turn on your computer."
637	639	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I've become aware that people are spending too much time on computers, and I agree with this concern. Excessive computer use can lead to addiction, insufficient exercise, and deteriorating eyesight. Many people become so addicted to computers that they neglect their families and siblings. Some kids come home from school and spend the whole day on the computer instead of studying for tests or doing homework. Moreover, people who spend excessive time on computers often don't exercise or play sports with friends. They end up sitting all day, becoming lazy and overweight. Although we do need computers for tasks like checking @CAPS3 and Facebook, it's important to balance usage. For example, I check my Facebook and then go play basketball. One of the most significant problems is the negative impact on health. Sitting in front of a computer for long periods can cause headaches and damage eyesight. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope you share my concerns about the over - use of computers.
638	640	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are excellent tools. While some people claim that computers have negative effects, such as reducing exercise and family time, I disagree. If you have family in a different town, city, or state, you can use web - cam websites to connect with them. These platforms allow you to have face - to - face conversations with people from all over the world for free, at any time, and if you have a laptop, from anywhere. Computers also provide a window to the world. When planning a vacation to a far - off place, you can use the computer to look up the destination. You can view direct pictures, read about the climate, and see what other people's experiences were like. This helps you make informed decisions about your trip. For students, computers are invaluable for studying. I've sometimes left my textbook at home, but I can still access the study materials on the computer. You can also use various online resources to learn easier ways to solve problems in any subject. Surveys show that @PERCENT1 of kids who study on the computer pass their tests and achieve a higher grade percentage, an increase of +@NUM1. Additionally, if a student encounters an unfamiliar word while studying, they can quickly look up its definition and learn how to use it in a sentence. In conclusion, computers are beneficial for our well - being and personal growth.
639	641	1	2	In my opinion, people spend too much time on computers, which has several negative consequences. Firstly, excessive computer use causes people to neglect their families. They become so engrossed in the computer that they ignore their parents and miss out on quality time with family and friends. I've witnessed this firsthand with my sister, who completely ignores my parents when she's on the computer. A significant @PERCENT1 of children also ignore everything around them when using the computer. Secondly, focusing too much on the computer can lead to poor academic performance. Students may neglect their homework, which can result in bad grades, failing a marking period, and having to repeat a grade. Finally, people who spend too much time on the computer may not enjoy hanging out with their friends. On weekends, instead of going out and having fun, they stay glued to their screens. I urge you to take my advice seriously. Otherwise, your children may end up ignoring you and facing academic and social setbacks.
640	642	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I'm writing in response to the complaint that more people are using computers and getting less exercise. Some experts are concerned and suggest that people should enjoy nature and interact more with family and friends. However, I believe they are wrong. First, heavy computer users can still exercise. Take Twitter as an example. The football player Ocho - Cinco tweets frequently, but that doesn't mean he doesn't exercise. Many sports players on Twitter are in good physical shape. Most kids in my grade, including me, have a Facebook account, and most of us are fit. Just because someone spends a lot of time on the computer doesn't mean they can't stay active. Second, computers are essential in education. Students use Wikipedia for projects and research. Many schools today almost rely on computers. I remember in my home country, I rarely typed unless it was for a project. But when I moved to @CAPS3, I'm constantly typing, even for rough drafts. Schools are also teaching us more about computers, and as we discover new websites, we share them with friends, leading to more computer use. Third, the claim that people are spending too much time on the computer and less time with family and friends is unfounded. Many of my family members, like my grandpa and aunt, have Facebook accounts, which allows me to interact with them. Adults who use computers a lot may not have family over every night and may go out with friends occasionally. Computers are also beneficial for business people, who may need to create PowerPoint presentations. In conclusion, while it's important to enjoy nature, interact with family and friends, and exercise, we can still use computers. A survey in @CAPS3 would show that many people who use computers regularly also exercise.
641	643	1	2	"In today's society, over @PERCENT1 of the population spends a significant amount of time on the computer daily. While having a computer at home can be beneficial at times, in my opinion, the drawbacks of excessive computer use outweigh the advantages. There are several disadvantages, such as cyberbullying, illegal websites, criminals targeting people via the internet, and the negative impact on grades and schoolwork.  I believe that kids are the most affected by excessive computer use. After school, many kids drop their backpacks and immediately sit in front of the computer instead of doing their homework. As a result, homework often goes undone, which can lead to a significant decline in a student's average. Moreover, even in school, kids use the internet on their cell - phones, which is a major distraction and usually results in incomplete tasks.  Another issue is cyberbullying. Many kids are bullied at school, and this bullying can follow them home through the computer. They may receive hurtful emails or instant messages that not only damage their feelings but also their self - esteem.  There are also criminals on the computer who target kids. They can obtain passwords and personal information due to the amount of time kids spend online. Once they gain enough information, they try to gain the kids' trust, and the problem only gets worse.  It's not just kids who are affected; adults are too. Adults are lured by the so - called ""great deals"" on the computer, but many of these deals come from fake or illegal websites selling stolen merchandise. After an adult buys from these sites, the criminals get their personal information, which can lead to an empty bank account or identity theft.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that the disadvantages of computer use clearly outweigh the advantages. People should step away from the computer, focus on getting good grades, avoid bullying and criminals, keep their bank accounts full, and protect their identities. Instead, they should spend time outdoors, with family, and enjoy life."
642	644	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I am of the view that integrating computers into society is a highly positive step. Firstly, without computers, people would miss out on a vast opportunity to learn about the world. Through computers, individuals can communicate with people globally. Regular computer use can help people develop skills that open up job opportunities in a broader market, thus significantly benefiting any community.  Computers offer numerous educational exploration opportunities. They allow people to access a large amount of information in a relatively small digital space, unlike the large physical space required for books. People can easily find almost any information they need on the internet, whether for learning or reference. For example, when students are working on school projects, computers can greatly expand their educational opportunities.  Secondly, the internet serves as a powerful communication tool. Any document or piece of information can be transmitted from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 @CAPS2.C in seconds. Since the advent of social networking, people who have lost touch can easily reconnect and communicate, regardless of the distance between them. Communication is becoming increasingly fast with the help of computers.  Finally, due to the expanding job market, computer use has become a common requirement in many professions. Engineering jobs often require the use of various modeling and drafting programs. Most governments also manage their files through computer networks. Additionally, many business - related jobs require employees to have fast typing skills.  In conclusion, computer experience can bring benefits to both individuals and society as a whole.
643	645	1	2	The computer has a negative impact on people's lives, and there are three main reasons for this. Firstly, excessive computer use makes people oblivious to what is happening outside. They may miss out on important events in their friends' lives, such as a friend winning an important award. They also miss the chance to enjoy nature or hang out with friends. For instance, if a friend invites them to meet up, they might decline because they are too engrossed in the computer.  Secondly, it affects family relationships. People can miss significant family events like family reunions and vacations. If a family member gets hurt and tries to call, they may not answer the phone because they are on the computer. They could even lose their spouse due to forgetting important occasions like birthdays because of computer use. Regarding their children, if the kids want to play, they may be ignored because of the computer, which will make the family frustrated.  Thirdly, it can cost people their jobs. They may miss work because they are on the computer instead of doing their tasks. Once they lose their jobs, they won't be able to afford to use the computer. They may end up in a house with no electricity and no computer because they spent too much time on it and neglected their real - life responsibilities. They may feel lost without the computer, or if the computer breaks down, they may not have enough money to hire an electrician.  In conclusion, these are the reasons why excessive computer use can have a detrimental effect on people's lives, including being unaware of the outside world, straining family relationships, and causing job loss.
644	646	1	2	In today's society, almost everyone uses computers, whether for research, gaming, or social interaction. These are all positive aspects. Schools across America use computers from @NUM1 grade through online colleges. People can benefit greatly from computers as they can accomplish a wide range of tasks with them.  Computers are a positive addition to modern society. They can perform almost any task for users. For work, users can complete their assignments, and for research, they can find information on any subject. Gaming on computers is also beneficial as it improves hand - eye coordination and exercises the brain, especially for young children. Social interaction through the computer helps people learn how to communicate via email for business purposes and make new connections.  The internet serves as a powerful communication tool. Documents and information can be sent from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 @CAPS2.C in seconds. Thanks to social networking, people who have lost touch can easily reconnect. Communication is becoming faster and more efficient with the help of computers.  In conclusion, it is evident that computers are a great asset to society. They offer educational opportunities, enhance communication, and open up job prospects. I strongly encourage everyone to use computers to improve their lives for the better.
645	647	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1, I firmly believe that computers bring significant benefits to society. They assist us in multiple ways, with the three main ones being document storage, language learning, and information acquisition.  First, computers are essential for document storage. Without them, companies involved in auctions and other activities would have to rely on filing cabinets, which would take up a large amount of space and time. For example, you use computers to create, store, and send newspaper articles, and without them, it would be impossible to keep everyone informed.  Second, computers help us learn and improve foreign languages. They allow us to understand what people in other countries are saying. For instance, my grandmother learned Spanish with the help of a computer, and now we can communicate effectively.  Third, computers are a great source of information. They can provide information for school projects, records, directions, etc. In @DATE1, people didn't have computers, but after the invention of the first router, there was a significant improvement. Farmers became wealthy, and even a child graduated from college at the age of @NUM3.  Before criticizing people for spending too much time on computers and not enough time on other activities, we should consider the many benefits computers offer. They are excellent storage devices, help us learn foreign languages, and provide easy access to information.  In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial to us. We should make the right choice and recognize the important role they play in our lives.
646	648	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, it is evident that computers play a significant role in modern society. Therefore, I believe that @CAPS4 should take advantage of the opportunities computers offer. @CAPS4 can engage in numerous activities using computers. For instance, @CAPS4 can utilize them for @CAPS7 - related @CAPS6 tasks, such as homework and projects, to gather information. @CAPS4 can also use computers for @CAPS5 @CAPS6 purposes, like creating holiday and birthday cards, paying mortgage bills online, booking hotels, playing online games, bidding on eBay or Amazon, and paying long - distance calling bills. Additionally, @CAPS4 can watch @ORGANIZATION1 shows, in case they missed any. Moreover, @CAPS4 can engage in online chatting, whether through sending emails or using platforms like ooVoo. In conclusion, @CAPS4 should definitely take full advantage of computers due to the wide range of useful activities they enable.
647	649	1	2	Dear Newspaper, in my view, computers bring substantial benefits to society. Firstly, computers are a great source of learning. People can discover unknown places and stay informed about global events. They are particularly useful for school - going kids eager to learn new things and can help anyone find important information for the future. Secondly, computers simplify life for many. Instead of going out to buy items, one can order them from online websites. This is especially helpful for those without transportation or for those seeking products not yet available in stores. Lastly, computers facilitate meeting new people. For someone who has moved to a new town or state, or a student at a new school, computers can help them connect with others. In conclusion, computers contribute to society in multiple ways. They aid in learning, enable people to meet new individuals, and make life easier. Hence, I firmly believe that computers should remain an integral part of our society.
648	650	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, imagine a world where no information can be stored for global access, where there is no means to communicate with loved ones or friends, or where one has no way of learning about catastrophes on the other side of the globe. Clearly, life without computers would be utter chaos. Computers offer education and the ability to stay in touch with friends and family, and our world greatly benefits from this miracle. Computers have made possible advancements in medicine, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5, revolutionizing our lives. @PERSON1, an old family friend, was involved in the first moon - landing mission. Astronauts were amazed by what they saw, and computers made this experience a reality. @PERSON1 received some of the first moon footage on his computer before it was made public. Johnson, the principal of a private school in @LOCATION1, after winning an award for the best school in @LOCATION1, stated that @PERCENT1 of their education comes from computers. They involve students in technology, and these students go on to develop the best medicine, cars, and computers, benefiting the world. Should @CAPS6 settle for less in children's education? In times of tragedy, when facing difficult decisions, or when feeling lonely, we turn to our loved ones. Thanks to computers, whether they are across the world or just around the corner, we can always stay in touch. @PERSON2's aunt was diagnosed with cancer last year. While @PERSON2 was at a boarding school in @LOCATION2, she supported her aunt via webcam, email, and @CAPS7. She even contacted the doctors. Her aunt conquered cancer with @PERSON2's support. Marcos, a family therapist, says that @NUM2 of happy families stay in touch through the internet after separation. In conclusion, computers provide education and the means to stay connected, making our world a better place.
649	651	1	2	@ORGANIZATION1, on @DATE1, it has been noticed that people are exercising less and spending less time outdoors. Some are also having less time with family and friends, and I believe computers are to blame. Although computers are a great resource, people are becoming addicted to them. Yesterday, at my local library, I found @NUM1 computers, all occupied, and a line of @NUM2 people waiting to use them. When I asked the @NUM2 people why they were there, a teenager said it was for homework, and another said just to play. When I asked how they stay fit, a lady said she didn't like being @CAPS1 fit, and the teenager said it's not easy when always on the computer. If we don't stay fit, we may struggle to fight diseases and cancer. I care about my family and would never choose to spend my life in front of a computer over being with them. Also, projects, homework, and research on the computer can take up half of our time with family. The great outdoors is a wonderful place - it's quiet, amazing, and vast. Looking up the outdoors on a computer is a waste of time that could be spent with family. My father says it's great to know about things, but it's better to experience them. The days are getting shorter, so let's live life to the fullest. In conclusion, we should limit our computer use and spend more time outdoors and with family.
650	652	1	2	Dear Local newspaper, I concur that computers have a profound impact on people. They help develop hand - eye coordination, enable learning about distant places, and allow online communication. Computers are excellent tools for teaching hand - eye coordination. As @CAPS1 grow, they learn the alphabet and spelling, and there are numerous online programs to teach them typing. Once @CAPS1 start learning to type, they can become fast typists. With the plethora of learning websites, computers help @CAPS1 in the future to learn and solve new things. Meeting people from afar is a wonderful experience. It allows us to learn about different cultures, which is a great way to make friends. Online chatting and dating services can also lead to meaningful connections. Maybe one day, we'll meet people who could be more than just friends. We should have a positive attitude towards these online interactions. In conclusion, computers have a significant impact on people. They teach hand - eye coordination, help us learn about distant places and people, and enable online communication. We should stay positive and safe while using computers.
651	653	1	2	@ORGANIZATION1, I firmly believe that computers are highly beneficial. Without computers, our knowledge of other countries would be far more limited than it is today. Moreover, computers serve as an additional means of communication. They also enable kids to complete their work more rapidly. First, computers allow people to stay informed about what is happening in other regions. For instance, if you hear about an event in @LOCATION1 on TV and wish to obtain more information, all you need to do is type it into a search engine, and you will be presented with a wealth of details. It also provides insights into the living conditions of people in other places and how they cope with various situations. Second, computers have revolutionized communication. They allow people to converse without the need for a phone or in - person interaction. This is particularly useful for those who do not want to be on the phone all day. You can communicate with friends through websites like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, or even have pen - pals from other countries. Third, computers are a great aid for getting work done. Instead of looking up definitions in a dictionary, you can simply type the word and get the meaning. For history research, you can find information about historical figures on the computer. In conclusion, I hope that after considering these points, you will share my view that computers are of great value to society.
652	654	1	2	"To whom it may concern, my name is @PERSON1, and I am of the opinion that computers are detrimental to society. The difference in the way people live between the @NUM1 and @NUM2 centuries can largely be attributed to the rise of computers. People have become overly reliant on them. Global communication facilitated by computers has not been entirely beneficial. People spend hours each day on their computers instead of engaging in physical activity. In my view, society would be better off without computers. At the end of @DATE1, before the new millennium, there was widespread fear of what was known as @NUM3. People were worried that all computers would shut down in the year 2000. Since computers were relatively new to society at that time, they were highly valued. People panicked at the thought of their computers failing and even hid in attics and basements, waiting for the world to end. However, the next day, the sun rose as usual, and people logged onto their emails with relief, not only because the world did not end but also because their computers were still functional. Today, people are even more dependent on computers. I recently visited @LOCATION1 and noticed that people carried their laptops everywhere, even to restaurants. In my opinion, society's heavy reliance on computers is a sad state of affairs. When asked why humans need computers, the immediate answer is often ""communication."" But we already have telephones and national television channels. There are also other means of communication, such as writing letters. In fact, excessive computer - based communication has caused more problems than it has solved. Computers and the internet allow for the rapid spread of news, even if it is false or damaging. This can harm someone's career and public image. It also enables excessive communication between countries, which can sometimes lead to conflicts. Normally, a country like @LOCATION3 might be unaware of international issues, but the internet involves them quickly. As a teenager, I am also aware of the problems that computers pose for youths. Kids often prefer to sit in front of the computer rather than go outside and exercise. Obesity is a growing problem in @LOCATION2, and kids need to be more active. They also avoid activities like camping because they do not want to be away from their computers. In conclusion, based on these reasons, I believe that society would be in a better state without the over - reliance on computers."
653	655	1	2	I believe that computers are over - used in our society. People spend more time sitting in front of a computer screen than exercising because they find it more exciting than using a treadmill. Some people in society are aware of the excessive computer use, while others are oblivious to how much time they spend staring at a screen. I am someone who enjoys using the computer, but I have noticed some negative changes. I and many others have become distant from our families because we are too busy chatting with friends online. I never realized how little I talk to my family until I started thinking about it. However, I do not think we should completely get rid of computers. The internet allows us to research almost anything in the world. For example, I can type my name into a search bar and find information about myself and others with the same name. The internet has become more advanced in recent years, and without it, most people would be lost. I think the internet should be used less for blogging and chatting and more for useful purposes, such as @CAPS1.com or @CAPS2.com. I hope you will take this into consideration and encourage a more balanced use of computers in our society.
654	656	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are a great asset to society. There are several reasons to support this view. Firstly, when you encounter something you don't know, you can look it up online. Often, while watching TV or having a conversation, you may wonder about the meaning or nature of something. Instead of ignoring it, you can use a computer to educate yourself and potentially others. Secondly, if you are too sick or too busy to go to the store to buy what you need, you can shop online and have the items delivered to your door. This is extremely helpful for those who are ill. For example, they can order food and other necessities without having to leave their homes. It is also beneficial for busy people. My parents, when my dad was a @CAPS2 and my mom was a vice - president of a drug - producing company, had to have groceries shipped to our house because they worked long hours and had no time to go to the grocery store. Finally, computers can help save trees and paper. In today's world, going green is important. Instead of cutting down more trees for paper, we can store documents on our computers, which requires no paper. In conclusion, these are just some of the many reasons why computers are a great help to society. There are numerous other benefits that could be listed, but these are sufficient to show that computers play a vital role in our lives.
655	657	1	2	Computers are extremely useful for everyone. They offer multiple advantages that enhance our lives in various ways. One of the key benefits of using a computer is the ability to learn about different people from around the world. If you are planning a vacation to @LOCATION2, you can learn about the local customs, what people of your age do for a living, and the clothes they wear. When doing a school project on a place outside of @LOCATION1, the computer can provide detailed information about the local holidays and traditions. It also helps in making friends. For example, if a foreign exchange student comes to your school, you can research their culture and have meaningful conversations with them. Computers also serve as a powerful communication tool. Through platforms like @CAPS1 or A.I.M, you can easily talk to your friends. You can ask about homework if you missed school, or simply greet them and ask about their day. Email is another option. If you make friends on vacation, you can stay in touch with them via email. There are also websites that allow you to communicate with people from other countries. With a webcam, you can have video chats, ask questions about their country, and even chat with all your friends at once. In addition, computers enable us to learn about different places around the world. If you are going to an unfamiliar place, you can look up great restaurants and fun family activities. For a school project, you can find information about the local weather and people's daily lives. If you want to help a country affected by a natural disaster like an earthquake or hurricane, you can search for ways to contribute. In conclusion, computers are essential because they allow us to learn about different people, communicate with friends, and explore various places around the world.
656	658	1	2	@ORGANIZATION1, the dilemma regarding computers demands attention. People should recognize that computers are among the greatest inventions of our era. However, in my view, individuals take this for granted and misuse them for inappropriate purposes. Computers are not intended for endless gaming or constant instant messaging. Their primary functions are for learning, work, or school - related tasks. Why do people use computers for non - essential activities? They use them for amusement, such as instant messaging, listening to music, and visiting @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3. People also use @CAPS4 and play games on untrusted websites. Computers are designed for school and work, like using @ORGANIZATION2, Word, @ORGANIZATION2, and PowerPoint. If people used computers for these legitimate purposes, their situations would be different. In @LOCATION1, computers are extremely popular, yet the users are often unfriendly, mean, sad, and out of shape. I know many individuals who choose to use computers instead of doing homework or getting fresh air. After school, all they do is eat and play on the computer. I struggle to understand this behavior, but perhaps they feel they have no better options. On the other hand, I know people who use computers correctly, and they are happy, knowledgeable, and great conversationalists. They use the computer daily but only for appropriate tasks, and they are smart and get good grades. In essence, those who use computers properly succeed in various aspects as they understand and can utilize them effectively. In contrast, those who misuse computers end up miserable, with limited knowledge, average grades, and poor health.
657	659	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, computers are an excellent means of learning about the world and its diverse populations. They can introduce people to unfamiliar concepts and cultures. Computers enable global connectivity, allowing people to stay in touch across vast distances. Moreover, they are invaluable when immediate information is required. In the realm of learning, computers are highly beneficial. They can teach skills such as hand - eye coordination and provide up - to - date population data of countries and cities, which most books cannot offer. Additionally, computers offer the opportunity to view pictures of places and people that are not easily found in books, photo albums, or newspapers. In educational institutions, computers are essential for projects. Students can quickly gather the necessary information, write essays, or print pictures for their assignments. Undoubtedly, computers are a cornerstone of learning and education. Computers are also outstanding for communication. People can interact on networking platforms like @CAPS1, Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter. On these sites, they can send messages to friends to share news or simply chat to maintain connections. Family members can use email to inform each other about events or news. I once had a personal experience where email was extremely helpful. My family and I were planning a trip to Block Island. Two days before our departure, we received an email from the house owner, stating that the phone lines were down and part of the house was damaged due to a storm. Without computers, we would have been in a difficult situation. Computers are also useful in times of need or confusion. People can check local weather forecasts to adjust their plans. If someone is unsure about a location, they can quickly look it up on the computer. Finally, if an item is unavailable in a store, people can shop online and have the product delivered to their doorstep. Computers have contributed to the growth and prosperity of our country. Given their numerous benefits to society, there is no reason to oppose them. They are making the world a more educated, connected, and informed place.
658	660	1	2	A prevalent question in our country is whether computers are beneficial or harmful to students. @CAPS1 have evolved from desktop computers and typewriters, but have they advanced too far? While the blank screen of a computer in @MONTH1 may distract some, the advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages. The modern computer offers capabilities such as faster research, easier communication, and significant contributions in wartime. Technological advancements have made computers indispensable in our daily lives. Despite existing doubts, computers can overcome them all. In time - pressured situations like college or high school, speed is crucial. Computers allow students to conduct research more quickly and accurately by searching for keywords. Previously, students had to painstakingly search through books, often without success. In the modern era, students can obtain the information they need rapidly. In the classroom, teachers can also use computers to gather information for upcoming classes. If speed is a requirement, computers are the answer. Besides speed, computers enhance communication. Through emails, @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and blogs, it is easy to keep track of friends' activities with just a click. This is more convenient than making phone calls. It also helps when friends move away. If you miss someone, simply search for their name and start a conversation. Having easy access to friends can greatly improve one's quality of life. In @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION1, soldiers rely on computers for vital information, such as radar and robots. Computers performing dangerous tasks can save lives in war. Without these computers, some members of the @LOCATION4 armed forces would face certain death. Computers sometimes replace humans in tasks like @ORGANIZATION1's or unmanned aerial vehicles, saving many lives. Whether it's social networking or military operations, computers play a crucial role. On @DATE1, @PERSON1's communist regime was ruling New @LOCATION2. A man showed great courage by standing in front of a tank, demanding democracy. Fortunately, this event was captured on film and broadcast to the world via the computer and the internet. In many ways, computers have become essential in our daily lives, and most of us would be lost without them.
659	661	1	2	"Nowadays, most people are highly dependent on computers, whether for work or entertainment. A recent study found that the average person spends @NUM1 years of their life on the computer, which I believe is a waste. Many kids spend their days on @CAPS1, Facebook, @CAPS2, and YouTube instead of spending time with family and friends, creating memories. They don't seem to realize how short life is. They should be hiking, camping, and interacting with loved ones. I'm certain that when these kids grow up, they'll regret not making the most of their time and instead will remember some viral YouTube video. Moreover, childhood obesity is on the rise. If we look back to the pre - computer era, overweight children were rare. The computer is largely to blame for this epidemic. Kids should be outdoors, playing sports and breathing fresh air. I'm confident that if computers were removed for @NUM3 year, there would be a significant improvement in children's health. They would become fitter and lose weight. I hope that after reading this, everyone can recognize the harm of excessive computer use and get rid of this ""poisonous"" object."
660	662	1	2	Dear Newspaper, as you @MONTH1 know, many people are constantly on the computer these days, and some consider it a problem. However, I firmly believe that the computer is helpful in numerous ways, including learning, entertainment, and even health - related aspects. There are hundreds of things one can do on a computer. It can help you reconnect with long - lost relatives. For instance, my mom was experiencing dizziness and illness, and her doctor initially said there was nothing wrong. But she used the computer to research her symptoms and discovered she had a disease. When she went back to the doctor, they confirmed the diagnosis and prescribed medicine. In my opinion, the computer is one of the greatest inventions. It has a wide range of uses, including online shopping. I hope you share my view and support the use of computers.
661	663	1	2	Dear Newspaper, owning a computer can have a negative impact on an individual. It can lead to lazy behavior, keep one indoors, and prevent quality time with family and friends. Although computers are popular, one should consider the consequences. Spending excessive time on a computer can result in laziness, which may lead to weight gain and health issues such as diabetes. Exercise is essential for maintaining good health. Instead of sitting in front of a computer, one could go for a walk and enjoy nature. Being outdoors offers numerous opportunities for fun activities like swimming or having a picnic. It also allows one to appreciate the beautiful scenery, wildlife, and plants. Spending at least an hour outside each day can be more rewarding than being glued to a computer. Moreover, excessive computer use can distance one from friends and family. Meeting up with loved ones in person is far more fulfilling than chatting online. Friends and family are important, and neglecting them can cause distress. In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, it is crucial to limit their use. If everyone spends at least an hour a day away from the computer, they can lead happier and healthier lives. So, turn off the computer, get off the couch, and embrace life.
662	664	1	2	Technology has witnessed rapid growth and transformation. Take Apple's new [device] for example, a reasonably - sized touch - screen computer. Computers, too, have evolved significantly. However, I firmly believe that [people] need to reduce their reliance on electronics. Prolonged and excessive computer use can harm eyesight, cause arthritis, and take away time that could be spent on exercise, which many [people] need. Many [people] spend too much time on computers. Although they are useful, they can be extremely damaging to eyesight. Staring at a computer screen for long periods strains the eye lens. The computer's lighting is also harmful, similar to looking at the sun, but the damage accumulates over time. For those with pre - existing vision problems, computer use can worsen the condition. The more time spent on a computer, the greater the damage to vision. Arthritis can be genetic or common among those who crack their knuckles or spend excessive time on the computer. AIM, a popular chatting platform for all ages, involves a lot of typing. Excessive typing can cause fingers to lock up and make joint movement painful. If this occurs frequently, one may be at risk of arthritis. Additionally, due to new technology, fewer [people] go outside to play or exercise at the gym. This may be the reason for the increasing number of overweight [people]. In conclusion, reducing computer use is necessary to protect eyesight, prevent arthritis, and ensure sufficient exercise for a healthier life.
663	665	1	2	I think having a computer is a great idea. When people are online, they can talk to their family and see them via video call. If you don't feel like going out, you can just stay home and go online. For instance, when you're watching a favorite movie, you don't want to be interrupted to clean your room. Computers are the best system for going online, and almost everyone uses them. Without a computer, how can you check your Yahoo [service]? My mom loves being on [the relevant platform]. If computers were out of stock, everyone would try to make one. People at Walmart would notice that others are making more money selling computers. No one can force people to get offline. At the Apple store, people go to buy computers. They spend a lot of time online because they enjoy it. If I like being online, you can't take away my computer and say I'm searching too much. When your mom is always at home being boring, go buy a computer when you have the money. In conclusion, computers offer a lot of convenience and entertainment, making them an essential part of our lives.
664	666	1	2	Dear [Recipient], I am of the opinion that computers have a positive impact on their users. They enhance hand - eye coordination, enable learning about distant people and places, and facilitate online chatting. Firstly, computers teach hand - eye coordination. When typing, we need to use these skills to locate and press the letters on the keyboard. Typing long passages helps us become more familiar with the keyboard layout, increasing our speed and efficiency. A survey by [Person] of [Organization] hospital showed that [Number] people who type essays have better hand - eye coordination than those who write by hand. Secondly, computers allow us to learn about far - off people and places. They make research easier, eliminating the need to visit the library. We can access information about recent events worldwide. Computer - based research is faster and less stressful than searching for books in large libraries. Also, computer information is always available, unlike library books. Finally, computers enable us to chat online with others. This is beneficial as it allows us to communicate with friends and family globally, and even with parents when they are away. We can also make new friends and control our social interactions. In conclusion, computers are one of the greatest technological advancements since the wheel and have helped countless people.
665	667	1	2	Dear [Newspaper], computers bring numerous benefits to society. They make people smarter, serve as a means to communicate with distant individuals, and are useful for doing homework. Having a computer is an excellent way to enhance knowledge. You can visit various websites to overcome learning difficulties. I recall having math problems and using a website recommended by my teacher, [Organization], which provided live tutoring. Computers can even help babies learn to talk; my [Number and a half] - year - old cousin learned through it. Computers are also a great resource for communicating with people far away. You can talk to those across the [Location] without incurring extra cell - phone charges. I once talked to my dad on the computer when I had no phone minutes. It's like having a bigger cellphone, allowing communication even when someone doesn't have a phone. Moreover, computers are ideal for doing homework. I once used my computer to find information about [Person] for a math assignment. You can use it for all subjects, especially language arts, to type papers and look up class - related materials. Typing on a computer is much more comfortable than writing a long essay by hand, which can cause finger cramps. I urge you to reconsider your view on computers. They can improve intelligence, facilitate long - distance communication, and assist with homework. In conclusion, computers are an indispensable part of our lives, offering multiple advantages.
666	668	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing to express my view on the use of computers. While computers are a significant part of modern technology and offer numerous benefits, there are concerns regarding excessive use. Many individuals are spending an inordinate amount of time on computers, which can lead to a lack of real - world interaction. In my opinion, one should prioritize spending time with society, family, and friends.  I speak from personal experience as I was once overly reliant on the computer, and it was not a positive situation. It is easy to become addicted to the computer, much like a drug. Once you start using it, there is a tendency to want to stay on it all day.   Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of the people in my school and @PERCENT2 of those in my community claim to be addicted to the computer. These high percentages are alarming and indicate a growing problem.  Computers are also a potential safety hazard. Whatever is put on the computer can be saved and accessed by others, so one must be cautious about what is shared. There are cases where kids meet strangers online, which is a dangerous practice.  I am not advocating for a complete avoidance of computers. However, it is crucial to ensure that one does not become overly addicted and to use it safely. I hope you will consider these points and encourage people to balance their computer use with real - world interactions. Thank you for your time.
667	669	1	2	Some people may view computers as having a positive impact, but in my opinion, they often do more harm than good. Spending excessive time on computers can rot the brain. Teenagers, in particular, are prone to this problem. When they log onto social media platforms like MySpace and Facebook, they are not learning but instead killing major brain cells. This lack of learning can lead to poor academic performance, as seen when they take the CMTS and fail due to their computer - induced ignorance.  Computers also pose a significant problem for families. Family members often use the computer as an excuse not to spend time together. Parents say things like “I'm on the computer,” leaving their children upset. This can lead to anger problems and a breakdown in communication within the family. For example, my friend on @NUM1 has anger issues and doesn't listen to anyone because her family never spends time together.  Moreover, people are spending most of their time indoors on the computer instead of enjoying the outdoors. My sister is on the computer @NUM2 and rarely goes outside. Doctor @CAPS2 Brown recommends that everyone go outside to relax daily, as staying indoors is not healthy.  On the other hand, computers can be useful. They can provide directions and answer questions, and they allow us to connect with old friends. However, too much computer use is detrimental to our well - being. In conclusion, while the computer has its uses, it often serves as an excuse for us to neglect our families and the outdoors. We should reduce our computer time and increase family time and outdoor activities.
668	670	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I was shocked to learn that some people believe computers do not benefit society. In my view, computers are essential for society as they facilitate communication, enable important tasks, and offer entertainment.  Computers play a crucial role in communication. We can't always be with our friends, but the internet allows us to stay in touch. Whether it's chatting with close friends or reconnecting with those we rarely see, the internet provides an avenue for endless conversations. It also helps us make new friends.  In terms of entertainment, computers offer a plethora of options. Social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace are popular and fun to use. There are also numerous video games, many of which can be played online with friends.  However, computers are not just for fun. They are vital for transferring important information, such as homework and details about after - school activities. Governments also rely on computers to store and manage vast amounts of information, from local building renovation plans to national security data.  In conclusion, computers are indispensable in our daily lives. They have helped us in the past and will continue to do so in the future, from communication to handling important tasks. I hope this convinces you of their necessity.
669	671	1	2	Dear whomever it may concern, my name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on people. There are several reasons for this view.  Firstly, computers are making people lazy. People no longer go out for walks because they are occupied with computer activities. They can order everything online, eliminating the need to visit stores. Many individuals can work from home on their computers, and students can even complete high school and college through online courses.  Secondly, computers are having a detrimental effect on students' penmanship. Since students can type out all their assignments, some schools even provide laptops for the entire year. As a result, students rarely use pens or pencils, and their handwriting deteriorates due to lack of practice. Additionally, the internet has made it so easy to find information that some students don't know how to look up a word in a dictionary or find information in a book. This gives them a false sense of reality, as not all work in the future will be computer - based.  Finally, people are losing their desire to engage in everyday activities. Why go out with friends when you can talk to them online? Why go out to dinner when you can order it online? This trend is concerning as it is making the world a more isolated and controlled place.  In conclusion, based on these reasons, I believe that computers do not have a good effect on people. They are changing our way of life in a negative manner, and we should be aware of these issues.
670	672	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am well - aware of the controversies surrounding the use of computers. Computers are at the heart of modern technology, and it's hard to envision a world without them. Although having a computer in @MONTH1 might lead children to play uneducational games, the educational benefits they offer far outweigh this drawback.  Computers are proven to be the second - best source of education, after schools, and the best source of information. There are millions of educational websites, and there are also platforms with online tutors and various learning materials. They can provide almost anything one needs.  For adults, computers are essential for work. They can be used to sell products, communicate with others, and research new topics. The technological capabilities of computers far exceed those of any other item. Without computers, life would be much more difficult. For example, instead of sending an email, one would have to rely on traditional mail, and most information would have to be obtained from books. Even the internet offers a vast selection of books for purchase and reading.  Some people worry that children spend too much time on the computer chatting with friends. However, children need to be social, and if they're not talking on the computer, they'll likely resort to texting and calling.  Computers also play a crucial role in document management. They are the best tool for typing, and without them, document - related tasks would be a nightmare. Typewriters are no match for computers as they lack the ability to save, delete, and perform many other functions.  In conclusion, computers are a necessity in our lives. They provide education and information to everyone, and their technology makes daily life easier. I'm confident you'll agree with my view, and I hope you'll share this information with others. Thank you for your time.
671	673	1	2	"To the editor of the local newspaper, I firmly believe that people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers. Many individuals seem to neglect physical exercise and the enjoyment of nature. Some may lack a social life and turn to the computer as a substitute, or they may be drawn to addictive websites. For instance, on @CAPS2.com, people, especially kids, often chat with friends or significant others. In my view, people should not devote the majority of their time to computers. Instead, they should have fun, interact with others, and fully embrace life. This is my stance on the issue of ""Computers""."
672	674	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1, in response to your query about whether our engagement in exercise and nature is diminishing, I respectfully disagree. In my opinion, computers have a positive impact. They enable us to connect with people from diverse parts of the world, learn new things, and simplify our lives. Additionally, they help us stay in touch with distant relatives. Computers allow us to communicate with individuals globally, discuss their cultures, traditions, and educational systems. They also serve as a valuable learning tool, offering information and guidance to make daily life more convenient. Moreover, they bridge the gap between us and our far - flung relatives, keeping us informed about their well - being. In conclusion, technology, particularly the remarkable computer, will continue to be beneficial in the future. It will help us maintain strong connections with family and friends. Now is the time to embrace it, as this wonderful technology will endure for years to come.
673	675	1	2	Have you ever wondered if a computer occupies too much of a person's time or prevents them from doing certain things? I don't think a computer messes up one's life. Computers are an integral part of our lives, and most people need or use them in some form. For example, when people miss the news on @CAPS1, they turn to the internet on laptops or smartphones, like the @CAPS2.C. It's a natural part of our lifestyle. A computer doesn't stop us from going outside; it's our choice if we prefer to stay on it. A @CAPS2.C can do many things. We can work on projects, listen to music, and learn skills that will be useful for future jobs. It also helps us stay in touch with family. Since the @CAPS2.C has been around, we've become smarter and more talented. Even @NUM1 - year - olds can use it for research and find numerous applications. Although some people spend long hours on it, they still need to interact with family. Computers have been around for a long time, are used daily, and will continue to be. So, is it that a computer takes up too much time, or is it just a natural necessity for everyone?
674	676	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I believe computers have both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, they can keep kids off the streets and out of trouble. There are many games on computers, and some are educational, related to science, math, reading, and social studies. Microsoft on computers also helps with writing projects. However, computers can be bad for people, especially teens. Many teens like to use Myspace, where they can make friends worldwide, share pictures, and chat. But this poses a risk as strangers may try to find and harm them. Also, @NUM1 - graders in middle school may be exposed to inappropriate websites by @NUM2 - graders, which can get them in trouble. These are my thoughts, and I hope you understand.
675	677	1	2	"Dear @LOCATION1 press, I am convinced that computers have a detrimental impact on society. Firstly, kids can become ""braindead"". Studies indicate that @PERCENT1 of kids who spend more than an hour and a half a day on the computer experience this. If this trend continues, our next generation may lack the intelligence to compete with other countries. Secondly, kids are at risk of becoming obese. They often sit and eat while using the computer, getting addicted and not getting enough exercise. Obesity is already a growing concern, and computer use is exacerbating the problem. Finally, kids are developing poor eyesight from excessive computer use. This can have a domino effect on future generations, potentially leading to a widespread need for glasses. In conclusion, the negative consequences of computer use, including obesity, ""braindead"" states, and poor eyesight, clearly show that computers have a bad impact on society."
676	678	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that people are spending an excessive amount of time on the computer, and here are my reasons. Firstly, it leads to less time for exercising. People are so engrossed in playing games and chatting on the computer that they neglect physical activity. Instead of being indoors in front of the screen, they should be outside running or playing sports. Everyone should aim for at least [@NUM1] of exercise. One can use the computer for a short while, but not for [@NUM2]. Taking a break from the computer to enjoy the outdoors and the weather is highly recommended. It's astonishing that some people can't spare [@NUM1] from their computer time; it's as if the computer has taken over their minds.  Secondly, spending too much time on the computer means less time for enjoying nature. Going outside for a walk in the woods, observing animals and their tracks, climbing trees, or going fruit - picking are all enjoyable activities. People don't need to be inside all day staring at the computer. They should learn to make better use of their time and appreciate the beauty of nature.  Thirdly, it affects interaction with friends and family. Spending quality time with loved ones, catching up on their lives, is crucial. However, people are often too busy on the computer to talk to their family members. Family should be a top priority, but many people put it second, wasting time on the computer with activities like checking emails or using chat platforms such as [@CAPS1], [@CAPS2], or [@CAPS3]. These are often a waste of time, and people could simply call their friends instead.  I, too, have a [@CAPS2], but I make time for exercise, spending time with friends and family, and enjoying nature. In conclusion, people are wasting too much time on the computer. There are more important things in life, such as exercising, enjoying nature, and being with friends and family. I hope you will consider my ideas. Thank you for listening.
677	679	1	2	Can you imagine living a day without a computer? I communicate with my friends daily on [@CAPS1]. A computer is an indispensable part of my life. It helps me stay informed about current events that I otherwise wouldn't know. It also simplifies my daily routine.  When it's raining or snowing outside, I prefer to talk to my friends online rather than going out. Another advantage of online communication is that I can connect with all my friends simultaneously, not just the ones I'm physically with. I've noticed that even when my friends move away, we can still stay in touch because of computers.  Computers are not only for socializing; they are also a great source of information. Every time I log into [@CAPS1] [@CAPS2], my [@ORGANIZATION1] page displays the latest news. Without a computer, I wouldn't know the results of last night's ball game or the progress of the healthcare bill. These are important events that keep me informed about the world beyond my town. Moreover, a computer allows me to understand complex issues like the healthcare bill and how it impacts me.  In my daily life, a computer is my constant companion. In the morning, while having breakfast, I check my email and the weather. At school, I type my essays on it. When I get home, I check my homework and chat with my friends online. All these tasks are made possible by the computer.  I rely so heavily on my computer that I would be lost without it. I believe computers have become a necessity. They enable me to communicate with friends when we can't meet in person, keep me updated on current events, and have become an integral part of our daily lives.
678	680	1	2	Dear [@CAPS1] man, would you like to see people sitting in front of computers all day, doing nothing productive? How would you feel if no one went out for exercise, and playgrounds, parks, and beaches remained empty? Everyone would be at home, glued to their fancy new computers.  The truth is, spending excessive time on computers is not beneficial. It causes physical fatigue and eye strain. When it comes to computers, everyone wants one, but the mention of exercise seems to turn people off. This is because people are increasingly spending long hours on computers. If they work on computers all day and then go home to spend more time on them, it's clearly harmful to their bodies.  I like using computers too, but sometimes when I'm on them, I lose track of time and fail to complete my tasks. This also happens to many people. They may seem to be listening when someone is talking to them, but in reality, they are so engrossed in the computer that they don't actually hear what is being said.  Exercise is extremely important for the body. It doesn't have to be anything strenuous, but people should not waste their time on computers. This problem often occurs in [@NUM1] to [@NUM2] or families. After work or school, they come home and immediately jump on the computers, neglecting exercise and family time.  Computers are like little robots that control people's minds and bodies. They drain the life out of you, strain your eyes, and make you lethargic. If people spent less time on computers and more time with their families and in nature, they wouldn't be so weak and tired.  I know many people don't want computers to be banned, but I believe it would be beneficial in many ways. It would bring families closer and make people more focused on their health. From my experience, computers do have some uses, but in real - life situations, they often offer little help. I hope you understand why I'm saying these things. If you care about health and activities, you'll agree that computers are not as helpful as we think.
679	681	1	2	Dear [@CAPS1], I'd like to point out that more and more people are spending time on computers rather than with their families. However, I also recognize the many benefits of using computers.  Firstly, computers are a valuable source of information. They provide weather reports, details about school openings, delays, and closings. They also keep us informed about the situation in [@LOCATION1] after the earthquake. We can access various websites to find information on a wide range of topics. Additionally, we can have fun by playing games on the internet, and it can assist us with our homework and job searches.  Secondly, computers facilitate interaction with people. We can communicate with individuals we've never met before, learn about their lives, and share information. It can also aid the police in tracking down criminals by providing information about them. Online communication is faster and more convenient than using the phone, and it can be a source of entertainment, which makes people stay on the computer for longer periods.  Thirdly, computers keep us updated on sports. For sports enthusiasts, it provides the latest news about teams and players. We can even watch live games and have the opportunity to interact with players.  In conclusion, computers are essential. They offer a wealth of information from around the world, allow us to interact with new people, and keep us updated on sports. These are the reasons why we should make good use of computers in our daily lives.
680	682	1	2	As more and more people use computers, I believe it does not benefit society. There are several reasons for this.  Online bullying is a serious issue, and computers are often the medium through which it occurs. Nowadays, bullies have found new ways to harass others, such as creating web pages, sending threatening emails, or making online threats. People say things online that they wouldn't say in person because they don't have to face the victims directly. Shockingly, [@PERCENT1] of all teenage suicides are due to online bullying. If fewer people were online, the youth would be better protected from online predators.  Another problem is obesity. When people sit on the computer for long periods, playing games or chatting, they are not exercising. More than [@PERCENT2] of obese people claim they don't exercise because they are either too tired or don't have enough time. However, if they spend hours sitting in front of a computer screen, it's no wonder they are tired. And the time they spend on the computer could be used for physical activity. Obesity is a major concern as it is the main cause of many health problems.  The environment is also affected by computer use. Computers consume energy and release toxins, which contribute to the depletion of the [@CAPS1] layer. This, in turn, increases the risk of skin cancer. Although plants can help protect the [@CAPS1] layer, the demand for paper when printing from computers makes it difficult to maintain a balance. As a result, there may be less wildlife and wilderness in the future, and more people may suffer from skin cancer.  I understand that computers can be useful for quick information searches, but there are also books available. People should stop being lazy and get active. By reducing computer use, we can put a stop to suicides caused by online bullying, combat obesity, and protect the environment. In conclusion, the over - use of computers is causing more harm than good to society.
681	683	1	2	In today's society, the prevalence of computer usage often encroaches upon the time that could be dedicated to more enriching activities. Many individuals find themselves with little time for reading, spending time with family, or going outside, and this can largely be attributed to excessive computer use.  Reading a physical book is a fulfilling experience that offers numerous benefits. Instead of relying solely on the computer for reading, one can visit a library and explore a wide range of books, including fiction, non - fiction, and science books. For instance, when conducting research, while the computer can be a useful tool, it may also contain inaccurate information. I once did a project on a well - known figure in the music industry. The computer research indicated that a man was the culprit in a particular incident, but a library book revealed that it was actually a woman. Clearly, books can provide more accurate facts.  Spending quality time with family is of utmost importance. One can visit cousins on weekends or host family parties. I remember having a party for my baby brother's baptism, where I got to see relatives I hadn't seen in years. Although the computer can be used to communicate with distant relatives, taking a vacation to visit them in person can strengthen family bonds. My family lives in a different location, and I visit them every year for family reunions. Family should not be neglected due to computer use.  Regarding health, going outside is essential. The computer often becomes an obstacle, as people get caught up in checking emails, taking care of virtual pets, and performing daily online tasks. There are numerous outdoor activities such as jumping rope, going to the park, swimming, or playing in the snow. I recall a time when my cousin came over, and we spent the whole day at the park until it closed. It was extremely entertaining. Every citizen should strive to be healthy, and outdoor activities can contribute significantly to this goal.  In conclusion, while computers may seem indispensable, they can also become a bad habit. It is better to engage in traditional activities like reading, spending time with family, and going outside. We should make a conscious choice to balance our computer use and lead a more well - rounded life.
682	684	1	2	I am writing to the newspaper to express my view on the ongoing debate about whether computers benefit society. In my opinion, computers offer numerous opportunities and clearly benefit society.  In the modern business world, communication is crucial. Most businesses rely not only on phones but also on computers for communication. Online communication is a fast, simple, and effective method, whether one is at home or at work. This widespread use of computers for communication has a positive impact on society as a whole.  Another significant advantage of computers is their role in research. In our quest for knowledge, we often need to find information about new things. While books can be a source, online research has become the preferred method for most people. It is not only quicker but also simpler. All one has to do is type a subject, and the information is readily available. This ease of access to information is a major reason why computers benefit society.  Computers also help in developing hand - eye coordination. As people spend more time on the computer, they gradually find that typing becomes easier. It may take some time to get the hang of it, but over time, the computer allows individuals to teach themselves this skill.  Some may argue that people spend too much time on computers. However, this is not a problem because the beneficial aspects of computers, such as communication and research, often require a significant amount of time.  In conclusion, computers offer multiple benefits, including facilitating communication, enabling efficient research, and improving hand - eye coordination. Therefore, it is evident that computers do benefit society.
683	685	1	2	In the modern era, computers have become an integral part of our lives, offering a multitude of benefits in the areas of communication, entertainment, and education.  Communication is one of the most significant advantages of computers. In today's business landscape, nearly all companies rely on effective communication. Computers provide a fast, simple, and efficient way for people to communicate, whether they are at home or in the workplace. For example, businesses can use computers to have conversations with partners across the globe to plan international expansion. Computers enable people to communicate and make plans with ease, making them essential for social and professional interactions.  Computers also offer an endless source of entertainment. Through the internet, users can access a variety of websites that allow them to chat with friends, watch videos, play games, and more. On a late - night or a rainy day, the computer provides a relaxing way to unwind. It helps people stay entertained and relaxed when needed.  However, the most important function of computers is perhaps in the field of education. Computers offer users and students a vast amount of information on every subject imaginable. They are extremely useful for research projects and even for learning new languages. The wide range of information available on computers makes them an invaluable tool in the educational process.  Computers have made daily life simpler by being incorporated into almost every daily task. It would be a mistake to halt the advancement of this technological wonder. In conclusion, computers greatly benefit our communication, entertainment, and education, and we should continue to embrace and develop this technology.
684	686	1	2	I am writing to the local newspaper to discuss the effects of computers on people. In my opinion, computers do have a significant impact on individuals.  One of the main issues is that most people lose track of time while surfing the internet. They may intend to keep an eye on the time, but something interesting on the web can easily distract them. This loss of time management can lead to other problems.  Computers also tend to keep people indoors. When people are engrossed in the web, they often reduce their physical activity. Sitting in front of the computer makes people feel so relaxed that they don't want to get up and exercise. This lack of exercise can then lead to unhealthy eating habits. People may reach for junk food like chips, donuts, and twinkies.  I once saw a commercial that stated that people who are more active are healthier than those who stay on the computer all day. In fact, most people who spend a lot of time on the computer gain weight because they are not physically active. This inactivity can lead to various health problems such as obesity, clogged arteries, and laziness.  Instead of being glued to the computer, people should enjoy nature and engage in physical activities like playing sports. Not only is sports fun, but it is also beneficial for health. The choice is between living a healthy and active life or a sedentary and potentially unhealthy one. There are weight - loss surgeries, but they are expensive and can have serious side effects, including death.  In conclusion, it is up to the people in our community to make the right choice. We should be aware of the negative effects of excessive computer use and strive to lead a healthier lifestyle by spending more time outdoors and with family and friends.
685	687	1	2	Computers are a valuable asset to society, offering several benefits.  Firstly, they enable communication with friends and family. One can chat with friends at any time, regardless of distance. For example, if a friend lives on the other side of the globe, a computer allows for continuous communication. When one is bored, it provides an avenue to see if others want to hang out. Even if someone wants to stay home, they can still interact with people through the computer.  Secondly, computers offer new ideas and share opinions. They allow us to see reviews and comments about products. If someone bought a product that didn't work, we can read about it and avoid making the same mistake. We can also gauge the popularity of a product based on the majority's opinion. Additionally, computers can make us think about things we might not have considered before. For instance, if we have a negative view about something, reading online content can show us what we did wrong or what we missed. This gives us the opportunity to try something new that we might enjoy.  Finally, computers provide the latest updates. They can inform us about schedule changes, such as closures, delays, or openings. We don't have to wait for the news to learn about local crimes or what's happening in our town. They tell us about new developments in our community, like new businesses or upcoming projects.  In conclusion, computers are extremely useful as they allow us to chat with loved ones, offer fresh perspectives, and keep us informed about the latest events. Their benefits make them an important part of our daily lives.
686	688	1	2	Dear newspaper editor, while I respect the views of those who believe the computer does not benefit society, I firmly disagree. It's true that many individuals neglect other activities to use the computer, and it is an invention on which a large number of people rely. However, the computer also offers numerous positive benefits.  For instance, @CAPS1' @PERSON1, a well - known hip - hop artist with millions of fans, was unable to complete high school or attend college due to his career. When he decided to pursue a college degree, he faced difficulties on campus because of constant harassment from his fans. As a result, he switched to online college courses. This allowed him to focus on his studies and earn his degree without the distraction of harassment.  Moreover, the internet has websites that are utilized in schools. These websites provide an engaging way to teach students, enhancing their learning experience by making it enjoyable.  In addition to the positive uses of the internet, computer programs also offer significant benefits. Microsoft @CAPS2, for example, is a program used to create various @CAPS2 documents such as poems, essays, song lyrics, and letters. These documents can be printed for personal use or saved on the computer if not yet completed.  People use computers for a wide range of purposes, including accessing books and movies. Over the years, the computer has brought about substantial benefits to society. What is your opinion on this matter?
687	689	1	2	"Imagine having a family member you haven't seen in ages, but you can't visit because they live far away and you don't have enough money. Or picture being sick or injured, with nothing to do but browse the internet, and then discovering interesting facts like a newly - found organism or a historical event you've never heard of before. The computer is truly a treasure trove of knowledge.  You can communicate with family members you haven't seen in a long time. I have a half - sister whom I see only once a year or once every two years. The only way we interact is through Facebook. There are also other platforms like Twitter, MySpace, Yearbook, AIM, and Skype that people use to stay in touch with loved ones. You can even have webcam chats to see them. Many people use web - chats to catch up with old friends.  While using the computer, you can also learn new things. Just yesterday, when I got bored while on the computer, I did some random searches. In just @NUM1 minutes, I learned about the ""@CAPS1 massacre"" and the tragic event when a teacher died in a spaceship explosion.  If you're interested in nature, you can learn about the diverse natural world across the globe. And if ancient history fascinates you, a few keystrokes can reveal amazing facts about forgotten cities like @PERSON1. You definitely can't learn all this just by stepping outside.  The computer's capabilities are truly amazing. It allows you to connect with family and friends you haven't seen in decades and learn fascinating things. Sometimes, you might even learn things your teacher doesn't know. So, would you rather be taught by your teacher or be the one teaching them?"
688	690	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I am of the opinion that computers bring significant benefits to society. They enable people to read, shop, and play online, making life more convenient for many.  Regarding reading, buying books can be costly. A recent survey showed that people who read books online save an additional @MONEY1 per year compared to those who purchase books. People can also access newspapers online. In case of snow on the ground preventing them from getting a physical newspaper, they can still read it online. This helps them determine if a newspaper is worth continuing to buy, including the @LOCATION1 @CAPS1.  Online shopping is another advantage. Sometimes, an accident may occur, leaving someone injured and confined to home. If it's a child, their parents may be unable to go to the store as they need to care for the child. They can simply use the computer to have food and other necessities delivered. People with busy work or school schedules can also benefit from online shopping. @PERSON1, a physician, informed me that people who shop online experience @PERCENT1 less stress than those who go to the store. This is because they don't have to worry about spending a large amount of time from their schedule on shopping.  The computer is also a great way to play games quietly. Young children can be noisy and full of energy. Parents can let them play games and read on the computer. Little kids enjoy using the computer, and it can keep them quiet and occupied. There are also various games for older kids, such as action, strategy, and puzzle games, and they can play against people worldwide.  In conclusion, the computer is an excellent platform for shopping, reading books, and playing games. It greatly assists modern families in their daily lives.
689	691	1	2	In my opinion, computers have several positive effects on people. Firstly, they help develop good hand - eye coordination. This is particularly beneficial for professionals like doctors who require such skills in their work, enabling them to perform better.  Secondly, computers allow people to stay in touch with family members. For example, if your family goes on a trip to another country, you can use the computer to see how they are doing and what the place is like.  Computers also serve as a great source of knowledge. You can learn about different states and countries around the world. For instance, when I want to learn about Texas, I can look up information on the computer to find out when it was founded, its capital, and its population.  Another advantage is that you can play various games with your friends on the computer. There are all kinds of games available, including shooting games, racing games, sports games, and arcade games.  Overall, computers offer a wide range of benefits, from skill development to social connection and entertainment, making them a valuable tool in our lives.
690	692	1	2	"I don't believe that computers have the most positive impact. Most computers are not as ""smart"" as we might hope. However, they do have their uses. When working on a project and in need of pictures or when you need help with math, you can use the computer's calculator. But it only helps with a few subjects, and this is the main reason I use it.  Sometimes, when I'm doing homework, I let the computer assist me to make the task easier. I also search for useful websites on it, and it often provides good ones. This is why most people use computers. They mainly use them to look for jobs, cars, or houses.  However, not everyone likes using the internet. Some people think it's cheating to rely on the computer for assistance. In conclusion, while computers have some useful functions, their overall positive impact is limited, and there are valid concerns about their over - use in certain contexts."
691	693	1	2	In my view, computers bring numerous benefits to society. Despite the fact that some individuals may spend excessive time on computers, it does not imply that computers are detrimental to society. Instead, it indicates that people should learn to manage their time more effectively. Overall, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on society.  One of the primary reasons I support computers is their status as a significant technological advancement. They simplify daily life by enabling information storage, facilitating learning about various places, and allowing seamless communication with friends and family. The ability of a single device to perform all these functions is truly remarkable. Moreover, the development of computers suggests the vast potential for further technological progress.  Another reason for my positive stance on computers is the entertainment they offer. With a computer, one can watch movies and download engaging games. There are few activities that cannot be accomplished on a computer. Even during inclement weather, a computer can serve as a source of entertainment.  Those who claim that people spend too much time on computers and that computers are harmful to society are misguided. A computer does not compel individuals to spend excessive time on it; it is a matter of personal choice. People always have the option to engage in outdoor activities. Computers are only misused when individuals choose to do so, similar to the saying “guns don't kill people, people do.”  In conclusion, computers are an invaluable asset, especially in modern society. They represent one of the greatest technological advancements and contribute significantly to the well - being of society. Therefore, if you are contemplating purchasing a computer, I highly recommend it.
692	694	1	2	I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. There are three main reasons to support this view.  Firstly, computers are beneficial for students' academic performance. There are numerous homework - helper websites available. I recall in @NUM1 grade, when I was struggling with a math mid - term. I visited a tutoring website, and it helped me understand the difficult concepts. This shows that computers can assist students in achieving better grades.  Secondly, computers are useful for learning about distant places. They are particularly helpful for school projects. In my school, @PERCENT1 of students claim that the computer has been extremely useful for their school projects. It can also aid in vacation planning. Instead of going to an unknown destination, one can use the computer to search for pictures and information about a place, enabling them to make an informed decision.  Lastly, computers facilitate global interaction. I have a brother living in Florida, and I can communicate with him daily through the computer. I can also stay in touch with my friends at any time. This helps in developing better social skills.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people as they contribute to better grades, allow individuals to learn new things, and enable communication with friends.
693	695	1	2	I am writing to express my belief that computers are a great addition to our community. When the library is closed and a student needs information, the internet on a computer can be a valuable resource. Additionally, if a phone is not working, one can still communicate with friends using a computer. Moreover, when the television has pixelation issues, computers can help people stay updated with the latest news.  Computers are highly effective for research. Suppose it is raining heavily, and your car is running out of gas, yet you need to access information from the library before it closes. It is much more convenient to use a computer. You can find a research site on your topic without wasting gas or getting wet. You can simply sit in your robe, sipping hot chocolate, and conduct your research on the computer.  Another advantage of computers is the ability to communicate with friends in other countries without incurring extra long - distance call charges. If you do not have unlimited minutes and want to have a long conversation, using a computer to open a chat window is a cost - effective solution.  Finally, computers can be used to access the latest news and information. For example, if your television breaks and it will take a week to repair, and there is an important event you need to know about, you can use a search program like @ORGANIZATION1 on the computer to look it up.  Thank you for considering my ideas. I hope you will choose to publish my article in your newspaper when the opportunity arises.
694	696	1	2	"The question of whether computers have a negative effect on people is a topic of debate, with many people holding different views. In fact, computers can have a bad influence on people.  One of the main problems is that computers are highly distracting, especially for kids doing homework. The internet, which comes with computers, offers games and social networking sites. Many kids, including me, would rather chat on Facebook than do homework using an online book. I often start using an online textbook for my math class. However, while waiting for it to load, I get bored and start playing online games. After spending @NUM2 hours on an addictive game called ""@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1,"" I realize that I have wasted a lot of time on my math homework. As a result, my math grade has dropped from @CAPS4 to @CAPS5+ since @PERCENT1 of my grade is based on homework.  Moreover, spending time on the computer is a waste. The outdoors can be just as fun as playing games on the computer. I would much rather play football with my friends than be stuck playing a game on the computer.  In addition to wasting time, distracting games on computers can cause stress, which can be dangerous. I once saw on the @ORGANIZATION1 that @NUM4 people died because they played on the computer for over @NUM2 days with little food or water. My parents have also noticed that my brother and I become grumpy after spending too much time on the computer, and I have been feeling stressed lately.  In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on people. Distracting games waste time and cause stress. It is hoped that people will recognize this and limit their computer usage."
695	697	1	2	In my opinion, computers offer significant benefits to society. They are a remarkable technological advancement that simplifies daily life.  Computers enable us to communicate with people worldwide. In @MONTH1, many individuals have friends or family living in other states or countries, and computers allow seamless interaction with them. Moreover, they are a powerful learning tool. We can acquire knowledge that may not be available in books, such as information about population statistics.  The speed of communication is another advantage. With computers, we can send emails and receive instant replies, which was not possible in the past.  Before the advent of computers and printers, typewriters were used. If a mistake was made, one had to start the entire page over, which could take hours. In contrast, modern computers allow us to correct errors easily by pressing the back - space button, saving a great deal of time.  In conclusion, computers have benefited society in numerous ways that we may not fully appreciate. They have enabled us to perform tasks that were previously impossible. The invention of the computer is a great milestone for mankind, and it is relatively easy to set up. It is clear that computers have had a profound and positive impact on society.
696	698	1	2	In my view, computers can be both beneficial and problematic. On one hand, they are highly addictive. Many kids are drawn to platforms like MySpace and Facebook to stay in touch with family and friends. There are also other electronic devices such as PSP Go, Xbox, DS, DSi, PlayStation, etc., which keep kids from exercising. Some kids might get so engrossed in the computer that they don't want to get off even past their bedtime.   On the other hand, computers can have positive effects. There are people who don't like being on the computer for long as it gets boring and strains the eyes. And compared to kids who hang out on the streets and engage in bad behavior, using the computer can keep some of them away from such activities.   Overall, while computers can be an addiction and have an impact on kids, they also offer certain advantages that can steer kids away from potentially worse alternatives.
697	699	1	2	"Dear [Society Name]: Over the past few decades, computers have been one of the most significant contributors to the advancement of knowledge in our society. These technological marvels are like sentient beings, possessing the ability to solve a wide range of problems. They are used globally, from [Location 5] to [Location 4], [Location 2] to [Location 1], by people of all ages, from school - kids to esteemed chemists.   One might wonder if it's wise to remain stagnant and not embrace this technological progress. From the development of rockets, engines, and planes, computers have consistently proven their worth. However, the crucial question remains: will computerized technology elevate our society or lead to its downfall?  Since [Date 1], computers have served as a powerful medium for disseminating new information. Their capacity to receive information at astonishing speeds is truly remarkable. [Engineer's Name], a computer engineer, stated, ""With the technology that we receive from computers, we are able to be in the game."" This highlights one of the most significant benefits of computers: their ability to present the most up - to - date information.   While books are an excellent source of knowledge, the publication process can take years. In contrast, a computer can display information that occurred as recently as [Number 1] hours ago on the internet. This not only enables faster access to information but also helps our society stay competitive.  Hand - eye coordination is an essential aspect of life. Buying a computer can help develop this skill. Research shows that [Number 2] out of [Number 3] people who owned a computer and typed daily could catch all three tennis - balls thrown at them. When typing on a computer, the eyes are focused on the screen, and the hands learn to navigate the keys independently, similar to training in basketball to track the ball's bounce.   I recall when I started typing; my hands soon found the keys instinctively. The next day at basketball practice, I felt as confident as [Point - Guard's Name], with the ball coming straight to my hand.   Investing in a computer is a wise decision. Although the initial cost might seem high, at around [Money 1] each, it can save money in the long run. For instance, not having to purchase books can save [Number 4] per book. Our neighboring society of [Location 3] invested in over [Number 6] computers and recouped their investment in just [Number 7] months by saving on paper and related costs.   In conclusion, computers are indispensable for our society. They not only enhance our hand - eye coordination but also offer cost - effective and up - to - date information. In a world where information is constantly evolving, it is essential to invest in this technology. The decision is ours, and we should act quickly for the betterment of our society."
698	700	1	2	"Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are a valuable addition to our society. There are several reasons for this view. Firstly, computers simplify our lives. They enable us to communicate without relying solely on phones and to spread news efficiently.   For example, if you need a doctor's permission to participate in a sport, it's much easier to send an email. The doctor can then reply via email, and you can show it to the sports team to gain entry.   Secondly, computers help us understand the world around us. We can access news websites to check the weather and plan our day. We can also discover the latest technological innovations like the ""iPhone"" or ""[Product Name]"".   There are people who rely on computers for communication. My uncle, who is in the air force, can only be reached through the computer as phones are not allowed. Additionally, when someone has good news and wants to share it with many, sending an email and forwarding it is a convenient option.   In conclusion, computers make life easier, help us understand our lives better, and facilitate communication with people worldwide. I hope you share my view on the importance of computers in our modern society."
699	701	1	2	[Organization 2], technology has made remarkable progress in recent decades, significantly contributing to human development in various fields, from construction to invention. However, there is a growing debate about whether this technological advancement, particularly in the form of computers, is beneficial.   Some argue that people become lazier due to the numerous tasks that can be accomplished with computers. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that computers offer more advantages. They showcase the capabilities of human ingenuity and allow us to learn about different cultures. Students use computers for studying and enhancing the quality of their projects.   [Name of Person 3] from [Organization 1] believes that computers can expand our knowledge. There is also concern about the large amount of paper wasted each year. Computers offer a solution to this problem by enabling us to create presentations and conduct tests digitally, thus promoting environmental sustainability.   I envision a future where computers are integral to every aspect of our lives. For example, we can use email instead of traditional letters. My friend [Person 2] mentioned that her school has shifted to a paper - less environment, using computers for various tasks. This has not only saved money but also reduced paper consumption.   I also use the computer to stay connected with my family in [Location 1]. I prefer this method to just talking on the phone as it allows for a more immersive interaction. A survey of [Number 1] people revealed that [Number 2] of them preferred using the computer to communicate with their families.   However, computers do have their drawbacks. Computer games can be a major issue. As [Person 1] from [Organization 3] said, there are an overwhelming number of games, and people can get addicted, becoming extremely lazy.   In conclusion, despite the negative aspect of computer games, computers will continue to play a crucial role in our lives. They offer numerous benefits that far outweigh their limitations, and we should embrace this technology while being aware of its potential pitfalls.
700	702	1	2	In my opinion, computers are useful tools, but their overuse should be avoided. There are more important things in life than being glued to a computer screen.   Exercising is crucial for our health. Regular physical activity can prevent us from getting sick frequently. It is far more beneficial for our well - being than spending hours on a computer.   Interacting with family is also of utmost importance. While friends on the computer may not always be genuine, family will always be there to support us. We should cherish these real - life relationships and invest time in them.   Enjoying nature is another vital aspect. Being outdoors can be a lot of fun and can keep us from being bored. When we are in nature, we are less likely to think about the computer.   Computers should be used mainly for practical purposes such as checking mail or learning new things. By using them in a balanced way, we can enjoy their benefits without sacrificing our health, relationships, and connection with the natural world.
701	703	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are a great asset to society. I will elaborate on my thoughts and ideas, hoping that after reading this, you will concur with me. Firstly, regarding communication, computers enable us to interact with people both nearby and across the globe. There are numerous means of communication, such as text, speech, and webcam. With hundreds of communication clients and servers online, usually around @NUM1, you will always be able to connect with someone. Secondly, computers offer excellent creative capabilities. On a computer, one can program, design presentations, documents, drawings, maps, graphs, and virtually create almost anything one can conceive. Information can be gathered from servers, websites, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, allowing for significant creation and learning on an everyday computer. Moreover, there are @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and reading and book sites on the web, providing web searchers with a vast amount of information and facilitating more learning in daily life. Finally, computers offer a wide range of entertainment options. There are various choices, including videos, movies, @CAPS18, @CAPS1, and games, suitable for the computer users. In a game, a user can talk to friends while playing, for example, a (@CAPS8 @CAPS9) like @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 online, a @CAPS13 @CAPS14 game. These games bring great enjoyment to entertainment lovers. Another form of entertainment is videos, where people can watch a vast database of videos and movies on video and other websites. Whatever the user desires is just a text and a click away. The last type of entertainment, @CAPS1 and @CAPS18, allows users to engage in daily life or communicate with friends, family, or relatives. In conclusion, I urge you, the local newspaper, to recognize that computers are beneficial to society. Please reconsider and make the right @CAPS2.
702	704	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I think this is a great idea as you can play games, talk to family or friends, and listen to music. One reason is playing games. When you're bored and have nothing to do, you can simply turn on the computer and play various games like car games, shooting games, and arcade games. Whether you're bored or just want to use the computer, this is an option. Another reason is communicating with friends or family. If your siblings or other family members live in a different state and you want to talk to or see them, all you need to do is ask for their email address. If they have a MySpace or Facebook account, you can chat with them as long as you like. You can also talk to your friends on these websites. The third reason is listening to music. You can listen to music on your computer by going to @CAPS3 or downloading software like FrostWire. You can listen to all kinds of music, such as hip - hop, rap, rock, or heavy rock. To listen to a specific song, you need to know the song's name and possibly the artist's name. I think they should include this @CAPS2 and make the right choice.
703	705	1	2	Which is more enjoyable: staring at a blank computer screen all day or spending the day outdoors in beautiful nature with friends and family? Well, if you're unsure, I know the answer. I conducted a survey at my school with the same question, and @PERCENT2 of the students said that hanging out with friends and family is far better than spending all your time on the computer, and there are three reasons for this. First, it's better to talk to people in person rather than on the computer. Second, it's unhealthy to be on the computer all the time, and third, many bad things can happen on the internet. If you're interested in this topic, keep reading, and I'll prove that the computer is not a good way to spend your spare time. Do you know the original purpose of computers? Computers were meant for people, but have you ever considered that instead of interacting with the virtual world, you should interact with those around you? Instead of going on Facebook or MySpace to talk to friends, just invite them over. This is not only more fun but also healthier. So, next time you think about using the computer, consider other options. In my previous paragraph, I mentioned that hanging out with friends is much healthier than being on the computer. I was absolutely right! Did you know that when you waste your time on the computer, you're only harming yourself? When all you do is sit and stare at a screen, you're getting absolutely no exercise. When you're not on the computer, you can at least walk a little, but typing doesn't do anything for your health. That's why people shouldn't spend all their time on the computer. Have you ever heard of an internet predator? An internet predator is someone who uses the computer to get strangers to do inappropriate things, and it's illegal. So, if you have friends online, be cautious. This is just one of the reasons why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer. Now you know why people shouldn't spend as much time on the computer as they usually do. First, talk to people in person instead of on the computer. Second, it's unhealthy, and third, there are internet predators. So, the next time you open your laptop, think about whether it's more fun to stare at a screen or to spend the day in beautiful nature with friends and family. Always remember the better option.
704	706	1	2	Computers have a positive impact on people. They assist people in learning about world news, places, and people, as well as facilitating communication and teaching hand - eye coordination. Those who support technological advancements believe that computers are beneficial to people. Without computers, learning would be severely limited. On a computer, one can learn about new places. People can locate a place, see where it is, and learn about its characteristics. I recall working on a project about @LOCATION2. I had no idea where to start, so I turned to the computer. It informed me that @LOCATION2 was in @LOCATION1, showed me a picture of it, and provided its history. Without the computer, I wouldn't have learned about this fascinating country. Computers also allow us to learn about historical and famous people. We can read their biographies or watch videos about their achievements. In the past, people read news from newspapers, but now, on computers, we can access news without the cost of buying a newspaper. Computers can also provide a live feed of global events. Without computers, learning would be much more difficult. Moreover, computers enable communication with people who are far away. A scientific study on communication found that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 reported using a computer to communicate. People can use webcams, AIM, or email. I use a webcam to communicate with my family in @LOCATION2 and email or AIM to talk to my friends. Writing letters is slow, while on a computer, the other person can reply immediately, making communication easier. Additionally, computers can teach hand - eye coordination. On a computer, one can click on something on the monitor without looking at the mouse, which is useful in sports and helps develop fast reflexes. In many sports, hand - eye coordination is essential, such as in basketball where one needs to look up while dribbling. In conclusion, computers should be an integral part of society's daily life. They have a positive effect on people, helping them learn about new places, people, and world news, and are highly beneficial to society.
705	707	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper, I'm writing to express my concern that people in @LOCATION1 are overusing computers these days. Instead of sitting at home playing FarmVille and other games on Facebook, people should get out more. They should go to the gym to work out, take a trip to the park, or have a family - fun night with their kids (if they have any). Another good idea is to have some ""@CAPS2"" time, for example, going somewhere nice. Since @DATE1, all some people have done is sit at home playing games, and they probably get tired quickly. Are they eating right? Well, if not, they may have gained weight. Sitting on the computer every day burns no calories or fat; instead, they just gain weight when they eat, which they likely don't want. If you have a family, taking a family trip to the park or going to @ORGANIZATION1 would be a great way to have fun. This allows you to get away from the computer and spend quality time with your kids. You should also set aside a night as a family - fun night to play games like charades or board games (as long as you don't let the computer interfere). The last and my favorite suggestion is ""@CAPS4"" time. During this time, you can go shopping, have lunch or dinner out, or even take a trip. The key is to stay off the computer, relax, and take a break. These are my suggestions. Now, it's time for people to step out of the virtual world and re - engage with reality."
706	708	1	2	In this modern era, computers offer remarkable advantages. They are user - friendly, allowing people to easily learn how to operate them. With a computer, one can reconnect with old friends and even pursue education through online schools or colleges.  Most college students own a computer or laptop. Even those with no prior experience find it simple to learn. Many computers come pre - installed with essential programs such as @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or a version of @CAPS2, virus protection software, and other basic applications.  Moving to a new place can be difficult as it means leaving behind friends. However, computers simplify this process. Through email, Facebook, and MySpace, people can instantly communicate with friends, new acquaintances, and family, eliminating the need to wait for letters. While some claim these platforms are dangerous, the risk only exists when interacting with strangers.  Online education is another significant benefit. It is particularly useful for the injured or those seeking an additional degree for better career prospects. Students receive assignments, and each course typically lasts one or two months. This flexibility allows them to work or enjoy nature as their schedule remains uncluttered. Although they miss out on the campus experience, considering the high cost of gasoline, it is a worthy trade - off.  In conclusion, computers are easy to use, facilitate social connections, and enable online learning. The benefits of this technology far outweigh any potential drawbacks, so it is advisable to embrace it.
707	709	1	2	Dear Newspaper, currently, @NUM1 percent of jobs rely on computers. The invention of computers has had a profoundly positive impact on our world. Our society has a need for @CAPS1. @CAPS1 contributes to our world by educating us about distant places and their cultures, uniting the globe through new communication techniques, and assisting workers in performing their jobs more effectively.  As @CAPS5, a professor at @ORGANIZATION2, puts it, “@CAPS1 is the best electronic tool created by the world.” Today, the world functions with the growth of @CAPS1. In the past, our cultures were losing ground, but over the years, cultures and @CAPS1 have started to co - exist and support each other. A teacher from @CAPS3 states, “@CAPS2 you want to know about a culture, just go to the internet.” In fact, @PERCENT1 of the world's cultures can be found on the internet or in our computers. When @PERCENT2 of people need to conduct research, they turn to @CAPS1 first instead of traveling to the relevant country because they can access information at any time.  @PERCENT3 of people agree that the invention of computers has brought nations closer. Nowadays, one can communicate with someone in @LOCATION2 via @CAPS1 without having to visit @LOCATION2. A young student at @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON1, remarks, “The creation of @CAPS1 has initiated a new revolution in communication.” A mother of a student in @CAPS3 says, “@CAPS4 of my international calls are made using a computer, and there are numerous communication methods, which are also very easy.” Computers are used @PERCENT4 more than cell phones because they are more cost - effective. A professor at @ORGANIZATION1 notes, “@CAPS7 true, you can witness the positive change in our nation; it is the best thing humans have created.”  In the @ORGANIZATION3, @PERCENT4 of jobs primarily involve using computers. Even engineers, like @LOCATION1 @CAPS8, an engineer awarded by President @PERSON3, rely on computers. He states that “@PERCENT5 of his job involves using @CAPS1.” Statistics show that those who know how to use @CAPS1 have a higher chance of earning a wage above the average compared to those with no computer skills. Another statistic indicates that computer users tend to live longer and happier lives. A student at @ORGANIZATION2, @NUM2, observes that his friends with computer skills have better jobs. A teacher at @ORGANIZATION4 says, “Computers have provided young adults with better life opportunities.” A teacher at @CAPS3, @PERSON2, emphasizes, “These days, it is essential to know how to use @CAPS1.”  In conclusion, @CAPS1 is a tool widely used by our nations. It helps us learn about new cultures, enables convenient global communication, and is beneficial when applying for jobs. @CAPS1 has truly made our world a better place. Without computers, we would not be where we are today.
708	710	1	2	Dear local newspaper, computers are not a bad thing at all. Although they can be distracting, it is in an enlightening way.  Computers are a great source of extra knowledge, which is beneficial for the brain. When you're at home with nothing to do, the computer can be your go - to. You can search for anything, and there's a @PERCENT1 guarantee you'll find the answer. If you're interested in a particular culture or an interesting topic, the computer can provide information. You can then impress your friends at school with your new - found knowledge.  Some experts are worried that computers keep people from exercising and enjoying nature. However, there's no need to worry. You can learn about nature by surfing the web. You might even discover more about your backyard than you previously knew. If you're concerned about not getting enough exercise, you can go to youtube.com, type in “exercise,” and find millions of workout routines to do right in front of your computer. You can also search online for tips on staying healthy and exercising.  Another concern from experts is that computers are causing people to have a poor social life and less interaction with family and friends. In reality, we spend more time interacting with our loved ones online than in public. Platforms like Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and others allow us to communicate instantly. We plan our weekends and conduct a large part of our social life online. For long - distance family members, the internet provides an easy way to stay connected.  In summary, computers offer benefits in terms of knowledge acquisition, exercise, and social connection. With just one electronic device, you can multitask effectively. So, experts need not worry about the negative impacts of computers.
709	711	1	2	Dear editor, have you ever pondered which is more important: computers or family, friends, nature, and your own health? I often ask myself this question, and I firmly believe that being with family and friends is far more valuable than sitting in front of a computer.  One major issue is the lack of exercise. Nowadays, kids often get winded just running to the bus stop. This is likely because they spend too much time on computers. Instead of sitting in front of the screen, kids and adults can go to the gym, participate in school sports, or take a walk with their dogs. These activities not only provide exercise but also allow for bonding with friends and pets.  Nature is another aspect that suffers due to excessive computer use. Have you ever been struck by the beauty of nature while looking out of a car window? If not, it might be because you're spending too much time on the computer. There are many ways to appreciate nature, such as sitting on a park bench in the @TIME1 to soak in the fresh air and sunlight, taking a leisurely bike ride on a trail with a cool breeze, or relaxing on the beach listening to music.  Finally, family and friends are the most important things we might miss out on. Without them, we miss out on valuable ethics and experiences, as well as the chance to build long - lasting relationships. How can we turn down the opportunity to be with the people we love?  In conclusion, computers are taking away many things that are essential for a fulfilling life. No one should live without family, friends, the beauty of nature, and good health. Everyone should make the right decision and take responsibility for their lives. So, which is more important?
710	712	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, do you think computers have good or bad effects on people? There has been a debate about @CAPS3 computers, but I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people.  Firstly, computers enable us to learn about far - away places. If you want to learn about @CAPS4, you can simply go to the computer and search for “@CAPS4 @CAPS6” on Google. I've tried this myself, and you can find a wealth of information. This ability to access knowledge about distant locations is extremely beneficial to human society.  Secondly, computers allow people to communicate with others around the world. This is different from just googling facts about other people. It's free, and chatting online with someone is, in my opinion, the best way to make friends and keep in touch with family, especially when they are far away.  Finally, computers can assist with school work. I remember when I had to do a project about the nine planets. I needed to gather a lot of information, which would have meant going through many books and doing a lot of reading. Instead, I used the internet and quickly found all the information I needed. I completed my project and submitted it to my teacher. Although I misspelled my name and only got a @PERCENT1 for the project grade, it shows that computers can help students with school projects.  In conclusion, based on these three arguments - the ability to learn about far - away places, communicate with others online, and assist with school work - it is clear that computers have a positive effect on people. I hope you will share my view that computers are beneficial to human society.
711	713	1	2	"Dear local news time editor, using a computer daily has a positive impact on people. People should use a computer more often. I firmly believe that every household should have at least one or two computers, as they were invented for a purpose. Computers enable interaction with friends and family, assist with schoolwork, and I am certain that one will have a great time playing games and meeting new people on a computer. If there is schoolwork to complete, computers can be of great help. When research is needed, simply go to a website like Google, and the required information will be right in front of you within seconds. There is an icon inside one of your documents. I read an article on a computer about a person stating that ""computer users are most likely to succeed in school."" Interacting with friends and family is always beneficial. Maybe you don't understand something if you've been assigned to a certain class. You can add a friend, and they will tell you what's going on. Talking to family members can do you good in many ways. If you're having trouble in your social life, you can always secretly talk to a family member or friend through the computer. I remember having some difficulties with a few friends, and one of my cousins gave me excellent advice through an instant messaging program named ""@CAPS2"". I guarantee you'll have a good time using a computer. There are many games out there that you can enjoy. Playing these games, as @PERSON2 says, will teach hand - eye coordination. You can meet new people who can also offer good advice. In conclusion, computers have a lot of positive effects on people. You can interact with family and friends, get a lot of help for schoolwork, and meet many new people. Take my advice and buy a computer."
712	714	1	2	How much of your daily free time do you spend on the computer? It's been proven that people aged 10 to 15 spend an average of @NUM1 - @NUM2 hours of their free time on a computer, while those aged 16 to 48 spend @NUM1 - @NUM4 hours daily on their computers. Spending too much time on the computer can interfere with physical activities, social time, and cause health issues. Although computers have some advantages here and there, they mostly have a negative impact. In the past decade, the percentage of people exercising has decreased, while computer bills have increased. Americans now spend most of their time web - surfing, playing online games, and chatting in online chat rooms. After school, kids go home and turn on their computers instead of going outside to run and play. Across the country, more people have gained weight due to unhealthy food and lack of physical exercise. Many local sports teams have lost teammates because of the lack of desire for physical activities caused by computers. The thought that runs through people's minds these days is 'why go out to talk to my friends when I can talk to them online?' I think the opposite. I get out of the gloomy house to see my friends. I don't even go online every day. I only check online for homework and do online shopping for twenty minutes. Computers have a major impact on social lives, such as going out and being confident to meet new people. Lastly, health issues are rising rapidly! The shows on @CAPS2 about people with weight and health problems can be largely attributed to the negative effects of computers. Like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and the obese cases have shown how people gain weight. I think at least @PERCENT1 of these people spend too much time on the computer and don't exercise. Eating junk food and then going home to play online games will definitely increase health issues like weight gain, unhealthy organs, improper muscle function, and eye and brain damage from staring at a mouse and screen non - stop. People should stop spending so much time on the computer and get outside or get active because computer use has a negative effect. It interferes with social time, health, and physical activities. Get up and prevent the negative effects of computers.
713	715	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I support technological advancements. I'll tell you a few reasons. On a rainy day, instead of going out to play in the rain, you can use the computer to play games, talk to friends, or use it for schoolwork or work. Suppose you need to look something up for school but can't get to the library. If you have a computer at home, you can use it to find information. You can also use the computer to learn how to make things and much more. After school, if you can't go out to hang out with friends, you can do something with them online. You can also ask your friends if there's any homework so you don't miss it. That's why I support the advances in technology.
714	716	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, everyone loves computers, right? Computers can assist us with almost everything. They can also provide facts about far - away places. Moreover, if you have someone living far away, you can chat with them online. I can't imagine what the world would be like without computers. First, computers can help us in numerous ways. They can show us pictures of places, let us watch videos, and even watch movies for free. You can check the weather, and if you're going to an airport, you can check the flight time or whether it's been canceled. There are so many things a computer can do for us! Second, it can give us facts, opinions, pictures, videos, and movies about far - away places. For instance, I once planned to visit @LOCATION1, but there was a terrible storm there, and the flight was canceled. I went on the computer and found out about the cancellation. If you're going somewhere far away, you can watch videos about that place. There are also maps to guide you. You can also check the highway for traffic to avoid getting stuck. It's hard to imagine living without a computer! Third, you can chat online with your friends or family. If you miss someone or just want to talk, there are websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 that allow you to do so. If you attach a camera to your computer, you can do video - chatting and see the person. You can do this with anyone, anywhere, at any time. In conclusion, all these things can only be achieved with a computer. It helps us with everything, provides facts about far - away places, and enables online communication. There are many more benefits, but to experience them, you need to go to the store and get yourself a computer.
715	717	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I understand that there are different views on computers. Some people think they're good, some think they're bad, and others just don't care. People often don't understand the present - day society, which is very different from when our parents were kids. I'll tell you the advantages and disadvantages of computers. There are many advantages. You can find information quickly. Communicating with people around the world is a huge plus. Computers keep kids and teens entertained with games on websites. They are an essential part of our lives today. Many tasks are done by computers, and they also save you from spending money on books as you can just search on Google. However, there are also many disadvantages. Computers are expensive. They can break down. There are also useless websites like Facebook and MySpace. If you didn't grow up with computers, they can be complicated to learn. The government stores a lot of information in computers, which helps prevent information theft. Overall, computers are the greatest invention so far. They assist with many tasks, and with the infinite amount of information in the world, computers help us find it. I hope this letter has informed you more about computers. There are both good and bad aspects, but the good outweighs the bad. Without computers, kids and teens would be so bored that they'd drive their parents crazy.
716	718	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, on an average day, an individual with access to a computer spends at least three hours using it. Nowadays, people, particularly teenagers, squander their valuable time on platforms such as Facebook, MySpace, and others. Consider this: instead of sitting in a chair, fixated on the computer screen, one could be engaging in physical activity, spending quality time with loved ones, or enjoying the beauty of nature. Do we truly need to be so reliant on computers?  Obesity is a pressing national concern. However, it is preventable. When children and adults spend a significant portion of their day sitting idle in front of a computer, they are not contributing to the solution. Our town is fortunate to have at least two fitness facilities that anyone can access. Even if going to a gym is not an option, a simple walk around the neighborhood can suffice. There are also running programs at our local beach, @LOCATION1, where one can exercise or participate in friendly competitions.  Exercise is crucial for everyone's well - being, and there are numerous ways to stay active, but using the computer is not one of them. Teachers, parents, children, and writers alike should steer clear of computers and focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Family and friends are the ones who bring true happiness, but if we are constantly glued to the computer, how can we spend time with them?  Increasingly, people are making less effort to meet in person. Instead, they opt for video chats. This habit needs to change as face - to - face socialization is essential. Communicating through a computer can lead to a deterioration of social skills, such as the ability to make eye contact. Instead of chatting online, we could be enjoying the company of others at an amusement park, a restaurant, a park, or even in our own backyard.  The world is full of beautiful places to explore, but society is too preoccupied with computers to notice. Computers consume a significant amount of energy and pose a threat to the environment, @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Instead of seeking entertainment on the computer, we could be taking hikes, walking on the beach, or playing outside. While the computer can show us majestic places like beaches, it cannot provide the same interactive experience. By stepping away from the computer, we can swim at a beach or a pool.  In @LOCATION1, @PERCENT1 of residents own computers and spend a large part of their day using them. By reducing computer usage, we can combat obesity, spend more time with family and friends, and explore nature. Let's make a change and embrace a more active and fulfilling lifestyle.
717	719	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. Firstly, they enhance hand - eye coordination. This skill is of utmost importance as it enables us to interact effectively with the physical world. Whether it's picking up an object or dealing with a real - life situation, hand - eye coordination is essential. When we use a computer, we are constantly required to look at the screen and manipulate the mouse or keyboard, which helps to develop and refine this skill.  Secondly, the internet accessible through computers offers a vast source of knowledge. It allows us to learn about different places and people from all over the world. Instead of being limited to our immediate surroundings, we can explore the far - reaching corners of the earth and gain a better understanding of diverse cultures. In this way, the computer prepares us for life by expanding our horizons and knowledge base.  Finally, computers facilitate communication. In a situation where one does not have a phone but has access to a computer, important messages can be conveyed quickly. It is one of the fastest means of communication available, especially for those who need to reach others promptly.  These are the three main reasons why I am convinced that computers have a positive effect on people. I encourage those who are skeptical to try using a computer and experience its benefits firsthand. I am confident that they will not be disappointed.
718	720	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to express my concerns about the negative impact of computers on society. With people engaging in less exercise, showing less appreciation for nature, and having fewer in - person interactions, computers are doing more harm than good.  Almost everyone owns a computer, and its usage is increasing steadily. This is taking away valuable opportunities for people to be active outdoors. Exercise is a vital part of daily life, yet it is becoming less common as children spend hours sitting in front of their computers. There is a growing concern about our country's high obesity rate, and one of the main culprits is the excessive use of computers. People are often found staring blankly at computer screens instead of engaging in physical activities.  Computers also contribute to laziness. For instance, if one misses a favorite show, they can easily find it online. Similarly, when working on a project, a wealth of information is just a click away. This convenience discourages people from being proactive and seeking alternative sources of information or entertainment.  Enjoying nature has become a rare occurrence. One can find pictures of their front yard or any location online, which reduces the incentive to go outside. People are more likely to stay indoors, chatting with friends or browsing new technology on @ORGANIZATION1. Those who are constantly on the computer are less concerned about the environment as they waste electricity. Moreover, the thrill of traveling to new places and experiencing the world firsthand is being replaced by looking at pictures online.  In addition, there has been a significant decline in personal interactions. Children who text, @CAPS2, or use Facebook to chat more than they talk in person with friends are losing their ability to have meaningful conversations. Online communication allows time for thought, but in face - to - face interactions, they may struggle to express themselves. Friends and family are seeing each other less frequently as they rely on text and computer - based communication. Emotions cannot be accurately conveyed through a computer, which makes it difficult for others to truly understand a person.  In conclusion, computers are having a detrimental effect on society. They prevent people from exercising, cause a lack of appreciation for nature, and reduce personal interactions. People should recognize the importance of stepping away from computers and engaging in more fulfilling activities.
719	721	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, it has come to my attention that there is a debate about whether computers have a beneficial or harmful effect on users. In my opinion, they have a negative impact.  Firstly, excessive computer use leads to less time for exercise. One in every @NUM2 young adults is obese, mainly because most teenagers prefer to sit indoors, watching @CAPS1 or surfing the internet instead of being active. Some students are so addicted to computers that they never go outside. While computers can be useful for schoolwork, kids who are constantly on them may face life - threatening weight problems in the future.  Secondly, many inappropriate websites are accessible to teenagers on the computer. Parents are constantly worried about what their children are doing online to ensure they are not exposed to harmful content. If teenagers used computers less frequently, it would relieve a significant burden from their parents. I recall reading a newspaper article about a girl named @PERSON1 who was chatting with a ""@NUM3 - year - old guy on a website. The guy later found her, and it turned out he was @NUM4. If kids were not so addicted to computers, they would be less likely to access such dangerous websites.  Finally, many teens spend their entire day on the computer, leaving no time for their family and friends. For example, when a friend calls my brother to go skateboarding, he often says he is busy when he is actually just on Facebook. One of my friends once told me, ""Sorry, I can't go to the pool today. I'm going to play RollerCoaster Tycoon."" This attitude towards outdoor activities is why students who waste time on computers have no time for their loved ones.  In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on people. They prevent exercise, expose kids to inappropriate content, and take away valuable time from family and friends. I hope everyone will recognize that computers are not as beneficial as they may seem."
720	722	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 in @CAPS2, computers are one of the most remarkable discoveries of our time. They have a multitude of positive impacts, including enhancing education, facilitating global connections, and advancing scientific research.  In the realm of education, children today face challenges in the educational system. However, computers offer a wealth of knowledge. Teachers cannot cover every aspect of a subject, but computers can provide in - depth information. The hard drive of a computer is like a treasure trove of knowledge waiting to be explored by eager young minds. Learning to type on a computer also gives children better opportunities for success in the future. For example, if a child misses a school day, they can check their homework online and continue with their studies. Computers are an essential tool for both us and our children, as they prepare the future workforce.  Connecting people through computers is another significant advantage. The world is diverse, and interacting with others helps us learn and progress as a society. For businesses, connecting through the internet via platforms like @ORGANIZATION1 is crucial as it enables faster decision - making, which ultimately affects all of us. It is not just for business; it can also be for personal pleasure. For instance, if @CAPS3's son is on a business trip in @LOCATION1, a webcam can be used to stay in touch. In the government, leaders can quickly connect with their advisors while in their offices to address emerging problems. Connecting people through computers is truly amazing and vital for our way of life.  In the field of science, computers have been instrumental in our progress. Today, we are making great strides in cancer research, and chemotherapy may not have been possible without computers. Computers are much faster than humans, which is beneficial as it allows for faster research. While a computer may not directly tell us the cure for a disease, it brings us closer to understanding the mysteries of certain illnesses. Scientists can connect with their peers worldwide through computers to analyze research and make informed decisions, which will likely extend our life expectancy.  Some people argue that people are too attached to their computer screens. However, these are the people who are working hard to find cures for diseases and reduce healthcare costs. When they find a cure for an illness, we should not complain about their computer use but rather be grateful.  In conclusion, computers only bring positive changes. They enhance the educational experience of our youth, connect people globally, and help us find cures for the most severe diseases. We should promote the use of computers in our community to further advance our society.
721	723	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, I am writing to inform your business that computers bring numerous benefits to society. They enable people to communicate with friends and family, serve as crucial resources for various jobs and schoolwork, and facilitate the acquisition and storage of information. Undoubtedly, computers represent one of the most significant technological advancements.  First, computers offer a convenient means of communication. I often use the computer to chat with my friends. It is an excellent way to stay in touch with those we don't see frequently or to have timely conversations. For example, I have a Facebook account, and I regularly discuss school - related events and assignments with my friends. Last month, I sprained my ankle and missed a day of school. Around @TIME1, when my classmates were home from school, I logged onto Facebook, and a friend informed me about the homework for that night. Thanks to computers, I was able to catch up on the missed work. Additionally, for those with family members living far away or studying in college, email is a great way to maintain contact. My cousin is in college, and we often talk on the computer to share updates about our sports activities during the year.  Second, computers are an integral part of many people's lives, both in the workplace and in education. They are highly useful tools for tasks such as paying bills and conducting business. My father, for instance, works in testing computer programs. These programs are developed, refined, and then distributed globally. Without computers, many people would lose their jobs, and numerous families would face financial difficulties. Moreover, children rely on computers for a significant portion of their schoolwork. I take Spanish, and I earn culture points for my class by answering questions on the computer. Studies indicate that over @PERCENT1 of children use computers for some form of school - related tasks.  Finally, computers allow people to explore the world. They store a vast amount of valuable information, including facts and fascinating pictures about different countries. They also provide insights into the culture, style, language, and other aspects of various places around the world. One day, my uncle was researching @LOCATION1 on the computer. After careful consideration, he and his family decided to move there, and they still reside there today. Computers inspire people to learn about new places and may lead them to important opportunities.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a profoundly positive impact on society. I am confident that you will share the same view, given the wide - ranging benefits they offer.
722	724	1	2	@ORGANIZATION1, approximately @PERCENT1 of the world's population uses computers at some point in their lives. People use computers for various purposes, such as looking up information, virtual sightseeing, and socializing. They are employed for work, gaming, and children use them for learning.  Some scientists propose that computers enhance hand - eye coordination, while others believe they make people smarter by exposing them to new things. The staff of the @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 Newspaper uses computers to type the news and likely for many of the other activities mentioned.  In fact, a large number of jobs around the world involve computers. Farmers need to keep records of their income, mechanics use computers to create blueprints, police officers use them to track license plates, and even babysitters may need to use computers for their own homework.  Many people meet friends through computers. There are numerous platforms like @ORGANIZATION2 that match people. There are also @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and many other sites where people can chat with friends.  All these factors demonstrate that computers do benefit society. They assist people in multiple ways. While it is important to spend time outdoors, we should also recognize the value of spending some time using computers.
723	725	1	2	In my opinion, computers have a remarkable impact on people. They are an excellent tool for staying in touch with others, shopping online, performing various jobs, and accessing information on a wide range of facts.  Although computers may not provide physical exercise, they are extremely helpful in daily life and help us stay organized. For businesses, they can manage files efficiently. In the music industry, computers can create beats and record music.  Computers are beneficial to people of all ages. For younger children in school, they are useful for writing reports like @ORGANIZATION1 or working on projects. For the elderly, computers assist with their jobs.  Moreover, computers keep us informed about what is happening in the world, such as news about accidents or the weather. It is truly amazing how technology has evolved. If it weren't for the development of computers, many of us might not be where we are today. In conclusion, computers are incredibly useful for everything they enable us to do, and the progress of technology is truly astonishing.
724	726	1	2	Dear the @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1's research shows that @PERCENT1 of people believe computers have a positive impact on individuals. Computers offer multiple benefits, including the ability to stay in touch with relatives, keep up with friends, and serve as a great source of entertainment.  For those with distant relatives, computers provide a convenient way to maintain contact. Video chatting allows us to see and talk to people face - to - face, even when they are thousands of miles away. If we are feeling down and need someone to talk to, a few clicks on the computer can lift our spirits. For example, soldiers in the army can use video chatting to watch their @ORGANIZATION1 babies take their first steps or say their first words.  In addition to video chatting, there are other communication tools like Aim and @CAPS1. @CAPS1 helps us stay updated on our friends' lives through status updates, whether we see them daily or only once a year at @DATE2 camp. Aim allows us to communicate by typing messages on the keyboard. We can easily make plans with friends, such as going into town, by sending a message via @CAPS1 or Aim.  Computers are not only for staying in touch; they also offer excellent entertainment options during travel. Whether it's a long - distance journey or a short ride, we can watch movies by inserting a disc or renting from iTunes or Netflix. We can download songs in seconds and listen to our favorite music. Additionally, we can play video games by simply purchasing and installing them on the computer.  In conclusion, computers are a wonderful invention. They allow us to maintain relationships with family, keep up with friends, and provide entertainment during long trips or downtime. They are as revolutionary as the lightbulb in the @DATE1.
725	727	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I believe that the effects of computers are generally positive, as long as we remember to take breaks, go outside, meet friends, and get some exercise.  Computers offer a wide range of benefits. They enable us to communicate and challenge each other in games without causing physical harm. In fact, they could potentially reduce real - world conflicts, as countries could engage in virtual war games instead of actual warfare.  We can use computers for practical purposes such as checking our taxes and stocks. They also simplify the process of finding health insurance, car insurance, and house insurance.  In terms of knowledge acquisition, we can look up historical facts on the computer. We can learn how to prevent snake venom from reaching the heart and even how to make bows and arrows.  Computers are also useful for finding service providers like plumbers, technicians, oil companies, and lumber companies. Additionally, we can find dates and information about specific people on the computer.  In conclusion, while we should be mindful of our computer usage, the many advantages they bring make them an important part of our lives.
726	728	1	2	Dear local newspaper, the average person spends @NUM1 hours and @NUM2 minutes a day on the computer. In my view, people are spending far too much time on computers. If they reduced their computer time, they would exercise more, spend more time outdoors, and have more quality time with family and friends.  The issue of obesity in @ORGANIZATION2 is growing, and less computer time could help address this. Tests indicate that the less time spent on computers, the more time is devoted to exercise. With @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 being obese, curbing computer usage would significantly alleviate this problem.  I once had a friend who was always outdoors, exercising and playing. However, after getting a @CAPS1 account, he started staying home on the computer all day and stopped exercising.  Less computer time would also mean more time outdoors. A survey I conducted at my school shows that @PERCENT2 of people would go outside if they couldn't use their computers. Moreover, more people outdoors would lead to a greater appreciation of nature, and it would also reduce household electricity use, as @PERSON1 suggests.  In addition, spending less time on the computer would enhance in - person social interactions. Many people communicate with friends and family on platforms like @CAPS2 and @CAPS1, but it's much better to talk face - to - face. It's easier and more fulfilling.  In conclusion, people are spending too much time on computers, which is negatively impacting their lives. By stepping away from the computer, they can exercise more, contribute to environmental protection, and strengthen social bonds. So, please, @LOCATION1, reduce your computer usage.
727	729	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are a wonderful addition to our lives. They offer entertainment, excellent communication capabilities, and are invaluable for design work.  Computers are highly entertaining. I'm not a fan of nature walks, but I absolutely love playing video games on my computer. I still manage to get exercise, though. I play basketball and then enjoy some computer gaming. Whether it's after a game of basketball, hanging out with friends, or on a rainy day, computer games are a great way to unwind.  Communication is another area where computers shine. I enjoy chatting with my friends on Facebook. With just a login, I can talk to anyone around the world. Video chat allows me to see the person I'm speaking to, no matter how far away they are. Email is also fantastic for work, enabling seamless information transfer between computers.  When it comes to design, computers are indispensable. Every modern car starts as a computer - generated blueprint. People use computers to create detailed designs for various products, including cars.  In conclusion, based on their entertainment value, communication features, and design capabilities, computers are truly a boon to our lives.
728	730	1	2	Dear Newspaper, the invention of the computer has had a profound impact on contemporary society. While some people view computers negatively, they are essential for performing daily tasks.  Although many think that computer applications, such as @CAPS1, distract people from other productive activities, these applications are necessary for most tasks. For example, the calculator app saves time compared to manual calculations on paper. It can handle simple or complex math in less than @NUM1 seconds, which is useful for calculating tips, managing finances, or completing math and science homework.  Note - taking on the computer is another useful application. Typing notes eliminates the need for pencils and paper. These notes are easy to read and can be used for studying, helping students achieve better grades on tests and quizzes.  The internet is the most important and widely used application on computers. It has millions of websites for various purposes. If you plan to go to the movies, the internet can provide movie times, directions, and the movie's duration. It's also great for planning family trips, booking flights, etc.  Computers are also excellent learning tools. They allow users to explore new subjects, such as different places and people. Without the knowledge gained from the internet, our understanding of the world would be severely limited. Teachers assign numerous projects and assignments, and the computer is the best way to conduct research. For example, a project I did last month on the fashion of @NUM2 and @DATE1 was made much easier with the computer. I was able to find information about the garments worn by men and women, the materials used, and how they obtained these materials.  Communication, although sometimes misused, is crucial for the world. Computers are one of the main devices for communication. Email allows for easy messaging to single or multiple recipients without the need for a signal. Blogging provides a platform for expressing thoughts and knowledge. Instant messaging is popular among teens for its quick and convenient communication.  In conclusion, the computer is an essential part of our daily lives. Its applications are useful, it aids in learning, and it facilitates communication. Without computers, our society would struggle to function effectively.
729	731	1	2	Dear Readers, I am convinced that computers have a positive impact on our country and people. They save paper and money when we use them for email, enable us to learn about different countries like @LOCATION1, and allow us to interact with others.  Computers help protect the environment by reducing the need to cut down trees for paper. Every day, around @NUM1 trees are cut down, and many of them end up rotting at logging sites instead of being put to good use. I believe trees have a form of sentience, and cutting them down is like robbing. By using computers, we can save trees and prevent this waste.  In terms of learning, computers are extremely beneficial. At school, I learn a great deal with the help of computers. They enhance our learning efficiency, allowing us to acquire more knowledge in a shorter time compared to searching for books. Although computers can have both positive and negative impacts on children, overall, they help us learn new things.  Finally, technology has advanced to the point where we can communicate and interact with friends easily. For example, a cell phone contains a micro - computer capable of surfing the internet and playing music. Computers have revolutionized the way we view the world and technology. We use technology in various devices like game stations and car radios to interact with one another.  In conclusion, technology, especially computers, has both positive and negative impacts, but the positive aspects far outweigh the negative. It helps us in our daily lives, protects the environment, and enhances our social interactions. Overall, computers are a great asset to our society.
730	732	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I don't agree that people use computers too much. There are valid reasons for their computer usage, including work, school, and communication.  Business people rely heavily on computers. For instance, my mom uses the computer at work for payroll, inventory management, emailing employees about jobs, and sourcing suppliers for concrete, stone, and other materials. They also use computers to plan business trips. So, business people have legitimate reasons to use computers frequently.  Students in school use computers for various educational purposes. They do homework, classwork, research for projects, and access educational resources. There are also interesting educational topics like cell division, body systems, and human development that students can explore on computers.  Most people use computers for communication. @CAPS2 users can talk to people on the other side of the world, and AIM is also a popular communication tool. I have a cell phone for calling and texting distant friends, but I also use AIM to chat with my friends face - to - face.  In conclusion, not all people are on the computer for the wrong reasons or for excessive amounts of time. People use computers to communicate with long - lost friends, handle work - related issues, and complete schoolwork. In today's world, computers are an integral part of our lives, and they bring us many benefits without causing significant negative impacts.
731	733	1	2	I firmly believe that child internet use in the @LOCATION2 should be reduced for several reasons. Firstly, the internet can lead to obesity. For instance, if a friend decides to @CAPS1 you instead of walking to your house, they miss out on exercise. In fact, obesity has replaced cigarettes as the leading @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1. Currently, @NUM1 @CAPS3 are obese, and the number is still rising. Another reason is the presence of bullies, hackers, and terrorists on the internet. Considering these factors, it is clear that child internet use in the @LOCATION2 needs to be curbed.
732	734	1	2	Dear newspaper, this year, a police officer visited my school and informed me and my classmates about the perils of the online world. This experience has made me believe that computers are not beneficial. Computers enforce bad habits, as some websites contain mean remarks about others. Some kids @MONTH1 engage in cyberbullying due to peer pressure, hoping to be accepted by their peers. Additionally, people @MONTH1 agree to meet strangers, which can be dangerous as you can't be sure of their true identity. I read an article in a magazine about people meeting online acquaintances, and most found that the person was not as they expected. Moreover, people @MONTH1 send inappropriate pictures, which can spread and cause a mess. The police officer at our school also warned about this. Computers not only cause bad habits but are also dangerous. News stories often feature child predators, which is a significant problem. Kids @MONTH1 make poor decisions due to a lack of knowledge about internet safety, such as not discussing it with parents or having proper supervision. In conclusion, computers are dangerous as they can hurt feelings through social media, blogs, videos, etc. For example, I heard a news story about a girl who committed suicide due to online harassment. Overall, computers are very dangerous.
733	735	1	2	In today's world, technology is constantly advancing, and new inventions are attracting consumers all the time. One such useful electronic device is the computer. While some think too much time is spent on it, I believe its benefits are substantial. Computers can provide information on almost anything, whether it's about a country's population, density, languages, foods, or holidays. They are the simplest and easiest way to obtain such details. If you're interested in a country or planning to visit, you can research it online, order plane tickets, and plan your trip. Another advantage is communication. Whether it's talking to a distant friend or family member or a nearby best - friend, computers with webcams allow you to see the person you're contacting. This is especially exciting for those who don't see each other often, like many teenagers who like to stay in touch daily. Finally, computers are great for getting directions. Instead of using a map, you can type in your location and destination on websites, and they will provide specific routes. In conclusion, those concerned about people spending too much time online should balance their time, using the computer only when necessary and spending more time outdoors and being active.
734	736	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I understand you're trying to decide whether computers are bad for people. In my opinion, computers are making our society anti - social, contributing to obesity, and causing cyberbullying. A significant portion (@PERCENT1) of our population spends at least @NUM1 hours a week on the computer. While there are chat sites, this form of communication is taking away our social skills. We need face - to - face communication for jobs, but if we only rely on email and @CAPS3, we'll struggle. Also, excessive computer use can lead to poor grades. Many people spend more time on the computer than exercising. Regarding cyberbullying, over @PERCENT2 of @CAPS4 teens will face it in their lives. When teens join social media, they risk depression, lower grades, and may even commit suicide or engage in bad behavior. We can prevent these issues by reducing the time people spend on computers. In conclusion, I believe computers are bad for society. Limiting computer use can improve our lives and make us healthier.
735	737	1	2	I agree with the experts that computers have a negative impact on people. Spending all your time on the computer means no exercise, no fresh air, and no real - world experiences. Obesity is already a major problem in the @LOCATION1, often due to people snacking while sitting at the computer all day. Computer use can also become an obsession. Another issue is that computers keep you away from family and friends, ruining your social life. People will get tired of seeing you glued to the computer. A real life can't be lived in a dark room. You can't meet new people, see new places, or have adventures by just looking at pictures on a computer. Computer use should be limited, and you should spend your free time living your life. In conclusion, excessive computer use restricts you from exercising, getting fresh air, meeting new people, and seeing different places. Life is short, and you can't afford to waste it on a computer screen. Hopefully, these problems related to computer use will be addressed in the future.
736	738	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. They facilitate communication among individuals, provide information on diverse topics, and enhance people's intelligence. To me, these effects clearly indicate a positive influence. Some claim that computers prevent interaction with family members, but this is unfounded. One can interact with both friends and family through chat - rooms like AIM and Meebo, or webcam meetings such as those on Skype.com. So, there's no need to worry about this concern. Secondly, computers offer the opportunity to learn about various things. One can gain knowledge about wild animals like giraffes, cats, or rats, and about different places such as @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, and @LOCATION1. All this information can be accessed from home within a single day. Most importantly, computers teach hand - eye coordination at no cost. They can also provide information about any career or regular job in just minutes. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people as they enable communication with friends and family, offer learning opportunities, and enhance intelligence. After considering all these benefits, I am truly grateful for the invention of computers as they assist us significantly.
737	739	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I'm writing to discuss the advantages of computers. In my view, computers can teach hand - eye coordination and open up job opportunities. They also allow for socialization and studying. Regarding socialization, computers offer numerous options. For example, Facebook is a popular social website used to connect or reconnect with friends. A recent poll showed that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people believe computers have made them more social. Moreover, computers eliminate long - distance fees, enabling communication with people from the @CAPS2.S to Hungary in seconds. In terms of studies, while books are useful, they can be difficult to find. With a computer, one can access multiple sites, from Wikipedia to Google, in a short time. There are endless resources available. I know an accountant who got his job because of good hand - eye coordination. Real estate is another field where good hand - eye coordination can improve work efficiency and potentially increase earnings. Computers offer many benefits, including socialization, academic support, and skill development. These are just @NUM3 of the numerous advantages that computers bring. I hope you consider these points.
738	740	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am deeply concerned that children and teenagers are spending excessive time on the computer for inappropriate reasons. They often prefer to be on @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 all day rather than conducting research. There are three main reasons why I believe this is a problem. Firstly, using the computer for chat rooms can be dangerous. Kidnappers often lie about their information in chat rooms to arrange meetings with unsuspecting individuals, putting them at risk. Instead, users could be accessing the daily news or conducting other meaningful searches. Secondly, excessive computer use takes away from learning time. Many students come home and go straight to the computer instead of doing their homework or reading. Some students seem to prefer the computer over learning, which is not beneficial. There are educational games available, but they are not utilized. Thirdly, the computer can influence young people to be violent. In this generation, frequent exposure to violence in online games and content can give a wrong impression that it is acceptable. When young people see violence on the computer, they may think it's cool. In conclusion, spending too much time on the computer without a proper purpose is not advisable as it poses risks to safety, learning, and behavior.
739	741	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, technology, particularly computers, has a proven positive effect on people. Computers teach hand - eye coordination. As users become familiar with their computers, they can type on the keyboard without looking, developing this important skill. They also allow people to learn about far - away places. Instead of going to the library to find a book about @LOCATION1, one can simply use a search engine and get thousands of sources within seconds, all without leaving their seat. Additionally, computers and technology facilitate communication. They enable people to reconnect with old friends and family and share daily experiences. I always keep my instant messenger open when I'm at my computer to communicate with friends and relatives. In conclusion, computers benefit society in multiple ways, including skill development, knowledge acquisition, and communication. Technology is like a sponge, constantly absorbing and expanding information, and it has a positive impact on people's lives.
740	742	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are not detrimental to society; in fact, they offer many benefits. Computers enable online communication and provide valuable information for school and daily life. Some people may overlook their advantages, but a closer look reveals their worth. <@PERCENT2@NUM1> of the time, people use a @CAPS2 to communicate on the @CAPS3, either through video chat or e - mail. Those who oppose @CAPS2 and e - mail might say, ""@CAPS4 not use a phone or talk in person."" However, e - mail is convenient for sending long messages, like a recipe. A senior citizen, @PERSON1, initially thought learning e - mail would be a waste of time but now uses it daily. The @CAPS3 also helps in various ways. It can provide information on different topics. For example, if you're cooking a stir - fry and don't know the ingredients, you can find a recipe online. Online maps, like Google Maps, are also very useful. Some newspapers have websites, allowing you to read the news for free, saving money and paper. A large percentage (@PERCENT1) of @CAPS2 users are students. They use @CAPS2 for typing reports and e - mailing, as well as for accessing information for assignments. There are many websites that can assist students in their studies. In conclusion, computers can help in communication, information - gathering, and education, showing that they are a valuable asset to our lives."
741	743	1	2	The question of whether to use computers or not is a significant one. Currently, hundreds of millions of people incorporate computers into their daily lives. However, there are those who argue that computer usage does not bring benefits to society. In my firm opinion, computers are indeed beneficial. They offer entertainment, a means of interacting with others, and access to an almost limitless expanse of knowledge. Without computers, life would quickly become more difficult and less enjoyable. On a rainy day, when one is at home and bored with nothing on TV, all one needs to do is turn on the computer. There are endless options available. One can visit game websites and play thousands of different games, which can also enhance hand - eye coordination. Additionally, one can watch missed movies or TV shows, or even visit sites like fanfiction.net to read or write stories. Computers also facilitate interaction with others. Through webcams, email, and chat sites, people can stay in touch with distant family and friends without incurring phone bills. They can also meet new people from different countries, learning about diverse ways of life and cultures. In an emergency, computers allow for quick communication, and students can contact teachers regarding homework. Most importantly, computers are an enormous source of knowledge. For example, if one wants to learn how to start a campfire, a simple Google search will yield numerous results in seconds. When assigned a school project, all research can be easily conducted on the computer, and the project can be typed up in a word document. One can even obtain a college degree online. Moreover, if one wants to find a restaurant specializing in a certain cuisine, the computer can provide details such as location, menu, prices, history, and reviews. In conclusion, computers bring great benefits to society. I firmly believe that life without them would be extremely challenging as they provide entertainment, an easy way to interact with others, and a vast amount of information. To those who still think computers are bad, I invite them to try going a week without using one.
742	744	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1, I firmly believe that using computers is beneficial to the community. This is because computers aid in research, open up a wider range of job opportunities, and facilitate communication with others. Regarding research, computers are invaluable. Most students do not have textbooks on every topic at home, so they rely on the internet. When @PERSON2 gave the class an assignment, I encountered unfamiliar words. I logged into my laptop and used Google. Within seconds, the definitions appeared on the screen. After finding the meanings, I completed my homework in about five minutes. Without the internet, I have no idea how long it would have taken. In terms of jobs, computers are essential. @PERCENT1 of today's jobs in @LOCATION1 require some form of computer work. Some jobs demand fast typers, and there are individuals who can type as quickly as a cheetah runs. Other jobs require skills in @CAPS5 or @CAPS6. To secure a well - paying job, computers are a necessity. Finally, computers offer a gateway for communication. @CAPS7, @CAPS8, @CAPS9, etc., are just a few of the many online communication platforms. If a friend doesn't have a phone, they likely have a @CAPS7. @CAPS7 allows me to talk to friends, share photos, and leave videos. For instance, when @PERSON3, @PERSON4, and I were working on our @PERSON1 project, @PERSON3's phone was taken away, and @CAPS7 was the only way I could communicate with her. It's worth noting that @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 has a @CAPS7, @CAPS8, or @CAPS9. I hope you enjoyed reading about how computers assist with research, job - seeking, and communication. Please publish this in the newspaper so that all residents of @LOCATION1 will share my view.
743	745	1	2	Dear @STATE1's newspaper editors, I recently read an article where experts expressed concerns about people spending excessive time on computers. I wholeheartedly agree with them. In my opinion, computers are taking time away from exercise, the enjoyment of nature, and interaction with family and friends. For teenagers, the over - use of computers is contributing to obesity. In the past, when there were no computers or the internet, fewer people were overweight or obese because they had time to exercise or play sports. Obesity is not a short - term problem; it can lead to diabetes and other health issues in the future, along with the associated costs of medications and treatments. Experts also believe that computer use detracts from enjoying nature. While some may argue that it's good to learn about different places online, I question why one can't experience those places firsthand and take pictures for others to see. Why read about a place when one can be the one having the experience? Moreover, spending time on the computer reduces the opportunity to interact with family and friends. As a teenager, I've learned that such interactions are crucial for our health. Studies show that kids who can have good conversations with their parents tend to do well in school and show more respect for others. For example, those who communicate with their families are more likely to get good grades like A's and @CAPS1's, while those who can't may have trouble concentrating and get @CAPS2's and @CAPS3's. I understand that you, as a newspaper editor, are very busy. However, I hope you will consider these points and remember the importance of exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends.
744	746	1	2	Dear @PERSON1, I'm writing on behalf of those who spend too much time on computers. Some people claim that computers help us learn about different cultures and interact with new people. However, in my view, computers actually cause more harm than good. Spending all day on the computer leads to obesity. @LOCATION1 is known as an obese country, and many of the obese people are glued to their computers. While interacting online, they keep eating without even realizing why. If we want to change @LOCATION1's status as an obese country, we need to get people away from their computer screens. It's our responsibility to make people aware of the negative effects of computers. People on the computer also miss out on the real world. They don't go outside and have no idea what the real world is like. An adult with no knowledge of the outside world is a sad thought. They could also miss out on life - changing experiences and experiments that people @CAPS1. Life is short, and it's a pity for someone to waste it being stuck on a computer screen. Finally, if we get rid of computers, we can become a new nation. We'll be free from the temptation of the computer and become independent individuals. We can rewrite our history by making this change. All we need to do is take away the computer, and many problems will be solved.
745	747	1	2	Dear newspaper journalist, I believe that people should not rely so heavily on computers as they have a negative impact on most individuals. The @LOCATION1 has the highest number of obese citizens in the world. Many people spend their days sitting in front of a computer for work and then continue using their personal computers at home instead of engaging in physical activities like walking or cycling. Some people prefer to look at photos of nature or birds on the internet when there is a whole forest outside. Another major issue with computers is their security. There are many unauthorized individuals on the internet trying to hack into computers. Viruses can infiltrate a computer without the user's knowledge, access all the information on the computer, including personal details, and even monitor keystrokes, which could reveal passwords. Many people pay their taxes online, and if their computer has a virus, their personal and financial information, such as bank account passwords, can be compromised. In conclusion, computers are detrimental to most people. They contribute to poor health and pose a significant risk of personal information being hacked by viruses.
746	748	1	2	@ORGANIZATION1, I wish to inform you that computers are extremely useful in today's society. Have you ever needed to obtain information about a state or a place that was in the news? Where did you turn to? I'm certain you didn't reach for a book but rather used a computer. Without it, how would you have acquired the necessary information? I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to our society as they aid in learning and can inform us about when and where to sign up for activities. People can interact with others from different countries, states, or continents. Computers can contribute to our learning by facilitating research for papers or expanding our general knowledge. For example, today my class and I are going to the @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1 to look up information on seat - belts on buses. Without computers, we wouldn't have been able to complete this task. If we relied on books, there wouldn't have been enough for everyone, and we would have had to share. In the past, some kids in @MONTH1 would hog the books for extended periods, preventing others from getting the information needed for their papers, which could lead to disputes in the classroom. With computers, each student in the class has access. Moreover, computers can help us gain general knowledge more quickly, making us smarter. Computers can also assist in setting up activities. They allow us to sign up for activities such as baseball, football, basketball, or gym memberships. With the help of computers, we don't waste time going to the gym to sign up; we can do it from home. There might be a waiting list, and we can find out about it if we sign up online. For instance, my little brother plays baseball, and my parents signed him up online. All they had to do was take him to the venue and show the registration. I live in the town of @LOCATION1, while others had to sign up, register, and pay in person. All these tasks could have been done online, as my parents understood the benefits of computers in gaining knowledge and signing up for activities. Do you now see why we need computers in our daily lives? Computers are indeed beneficial to our emerging society.
747	749	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, have you ever forgotten the book you needed for homework or missed the latest episode of your favorite show? These issues and more can be resolved by using a computer. The computer provides us with everything we need, including information, games, and online chatting platforms. In today's society, computers are essential. I've often been in urgent need of information. When working on a school report about animals, I can simply search for whatever I want on the computer. There's no longer a need to drive to the town library and search through numerous books and encyclopedias. I believe it's a waste of time when all the information you need is just a short distance away, right in your home. There's also no need to spend hours searching through biographies. If you need to know state capitals, you can find the information instantly. To me, this is a real time - saver. Computers not only help with information but also make school projects much easier. In my experience, I've needed pictures for school projects. Instead of drawing them, I can save time and effort by using the internet to print out the pictures. When it comes to writing an essay, say, a ten - page one, typing it on a computer takes half the time compared to writing it by hand. Once finished, you can print it or send it directly to your teacher. If it's not completed, you can save it on a thumb - drive and use it on any computer. This is a significant advantage. Another reason why computers are great is that they offer instant entertainment. There are millions of free games for kids on computers. Additionally, there are many websites like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 where you can interact with friends. You don't need a phone to communicate with them. If you miss a show or want to watch music videos, there are dedicated websites for that. As a kid, I'm often busy with sports and school activities and not at home. If I miss something on @LOCATION1, I can almost always find it on the computer. There's no need to wait for a replay. In conclusion, I believe that computers benefit people worldwide. There's no need to drive to libraries or buy games. The computer has everything you want for free. It's a huge time and effort saver that every household should have.
748	750	1	2	I agree with the concerns raised by experts. It's true that people can become overly engrossed in computers, neglecting their families, facing significant online dangers, and failing to give their brains the necessary exercise. People can become addicted to computers and forget about spending time with their families. Instead of being on social media platforms like MySpace or Facebook, they should be playing games like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 with their families. I can speak from personal experience. My cousin @PERSON1 became so addicted to the computer that whenever his family tried to do something fun together, they would end up arguing because he didn't want to participate. Online, people can face major risks. For example, in chat sessions where you're supposed to meet people your age, it's not always the case. You often see news stories about older people pretending to be @NUM1 - year - olds with malicious intentions. So, there are many potential dangers online. Finally, being on the computer doesn't allow your brain to get the proper workout it needs. Instead of just sitting in front of the screen, you could be reading a book or doing a word - search puzzle. Recent research shows that people who spend time reading and exercising their brains perform well on tests, while those who spend most of their time on the computer tend to fail. Don't you think I'm right? Spending too much time on the computer means less time with family, exposure to serious online risks, and a lack of brain exercise. I hope I've convinced you of the negative impacts of excessive computer use.
749	751	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are not beneficial for society, and I have three reasons to support this view. Firstly, many people will stop enjoying the outdoors. Some individuals will spend all their time on the computer. When you're having fun on the computer, you tend to stay seated for long periods. Once you start having a good time, you don't want to stop, and you may not pay attention to other things. Eventually, you can get hooked and choose to play on the computer rather than go outside and have fun with friends. Computer activities can consume all your time. When you're bored, instead of looking for other things to do, you might think it's a good idea to go on the computer. And if you're bored, you'll likely stay on it until you have something else planned. My mother always tells me not to stay home when I'm bored because it can make the situation worse. There are always other activities available; you just need to look harder. Secondly, excessive computer use can lead to weight gain due to inactivity. When you sit at a computer, you're not moving much. I read that @NUM1 children each year will become obese, not because of family history but because of a lack of physical activity. Inactivity means not being physically active. If you consume calories without burning them through activity, you will gain weight. Excess weight is unhealthy, and you can avoid this problem by finding other things to do instead of spending your whole life on the computer. In conclusion, you may have mixed thoughts when it comes to using the computer all the time. It doesn't matter if you use it, but don't use it constantly. Remember the reasons I've mentioned: you won't enjoy the outdoors, you should find other activities when bored, and you'll gain weight if you spend all your time on the computer.
750	752	1	2	In my opinion, computers are not to blame for people's lack of exercise or sleep. It's entirely a personal decision how long one spends on the computer. People who choose to stay on the computer clearly don't care about their sleep. When people are on the computer, they may play less and start to gain weight, but this is their choice. Eventually, they will realize that they need to spend less time on the computer and exercise more. However, it's important to set a time limit for computer use, as well as for proper eating and exercise. When people spend too much time on the computer, they often miss the opportunity to interact with their family and friends. They become lazy and prefer to stay on the computer. As a result, family and friends may get angry and stop wanting to hang out. Within a few months, they may find themselves with no friends. Nature is wonderful; it smells good, looks beautiful, but computers make people stay inside all day. I believe we should spend more time outdoors. Additionally, computers can sometimes make kids reluctant to clean their rooms or do chores because they are addicted to the computer. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, we need to be aware of the negative impacts they can have on our lives. We should make a conscious effort to balance our computer use with other important aspects of life, such as social interaction, physical activity, and household responsibilities.
751	753	1	2	In my view, computers bring more harm than good. Just as @CAPS1 pointed out, there are multiple reasons for this. Spending excessive time on computers endangers one's health as it reduces physical exercise. People also tend to focus more on the computer screen than on interacting with their family and friends. Moreover, it can lead to changes in a person's attitude and behavior.  The consequences of excessive computer use are numerous. Many individuals become addicted to watching certain content or even to the computer itself. Nowadays, a large number of people need to wear glasses, and it's highly likely that this is due to over - exposure to computers. Having to wear glasses for a lifetime can be quite a burden.  From a health perspective, too much time on the computer means less time for exercise. Also, neglecting family and friends can cause a rift in relationships, as they are crucial parts of one's life. Lastly, excessive computer use can transform a person's manners, speech, and attitude.  I've presented reasons such as endangering health, changing a person's life, and causing the loss of family and friends to show why I think computers are not good. It's now up to you to consider these points.
752	754	1	2	When you need to gather information for a school project, how can you quickly and easily find out about your topic? Most people turn to the computer, one of the most commonly used technologies. It is used for quick and easy research, interacting with friends, and personal entertainment.  Some people argue that computers take away from enjoying nature, spending time with family and friends, and exercising. However, imagine a world without computers. Research would be far more difficult. For example, computers allow us to learn about almost anything quickly and easily, reducing stress for schoolwork or jobs. They can be accessed right at home, eliminating the need for travel. Computers also have programs for preparing articles, essays, slide - shows, and brochures for presentations. Without them, research would be a struggle and might require travel.  Computers are a popular way to communicate with friends and family. Websites and email help us stay in touch with anyone around the world. We can write emails, use live chat, or even have webcam conversations. Emailing is like sending a letter but is instant and free, with no risk of others reading our messages. Live chat enables text - based communication, and webcam offers face - to - face interaction, similar to talking in person. And communicating via computer costs nothing.  In addition, computers provide games for entertainment, which can relieve boredom. They also improve hand - eye coordination and help with organization. Files, pictures, videos, etc., can be saved on the computer for easy access.  Although computers may detract from some activities, life would be much harder and more stressful without them. I believe that computers have a positive effect on people and are a very helpful technology.
753	755	1	2	I firmly believe that computers have a significant and beneficial impact on society. They offer a wide range of features, options, and capabilities. Would you really prevent your child, friends, and family from using such an amazing invention that helps us daily?  Computers are excellent communication tools. You can set up email or chatting accounts to connect with others. There are times when online communication is better than using a phone. I recall a few years ago when my cousin and I were alone at her house, and the phone wasn't working. She went downstairs to get sodas, and I heard a crashing sound. She had fallen down the stairs. Since the phones weren't functioning, I used the computer in her room to quickly chat with my dad and tell him what happened. He called an ambulance, and my cousin was okay. This shows that computers are not only a great way to communicate but can also save lives.  Computers are also educational. For instance, if a student has to write a paper about a particular topic, the internet browser on the computer can open up a world of knowledge. All you need to do is go to a search engine like @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2 and type in the subject. In no time, millions of websites can provide information on that topic. A high - school teacher, @PERSON1, said that @PERCENT1 of students in the school use computers for homework and research. Clearly, computers are a great resource for information.  Another reason computers are beneficial is that they help prepare for future jobs. In the future, many jobs will require computer skills. A company is unlikely to hire someone without computer experience. However, if you are proficient in using a computer, you have a better chance of getting a job that can support you and your family. Studies show that @PERCENT2 of businesses involve using a computer. As computers become an increasingly important part of society, it's essential to learn about them as soon as possible.  In conclusion, it's evident that computers are crucial in our society. They enhance communication, are a great source of knowledge, and help prepare for jobs. With each passing day, they contribute to the advancement of the future and make the world a better place.
754	756	1	2	I'm writing to inform you that many people are spending too much time on computers instead of enjoying nature. Some people believe that technological advancements, specifically computers, have an impact on people. While computers can be useful, we should also remember the beauty of nature.  Experts are correct in saying that people are spending excessive time on computers and less time on activities like exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Family members and friends may feel neglected when someone is constantly on the computer.  @PERCENT1 of my friends agree that people should reduce their use of electronic devices as it can affect the brain and eyesight. A researcher from Yale University, @PERSON1, has conducted extensive research and proven that excessive computer use can be harmful. I strongly believe that there should be a time limit on computer use, allowing people to have time to enjoy nature and other activities, such as listening to soft music.  I hope you will agree that people should spend less time on computers and more time with their loved ones and in nature. Breaking the habit of excessive computer use is a good start towards a healthier and more fulfilling life.
755	757	1	2	Experts are worried about the current population's computer usage, and I share their concerns. Many children and adults are now obese or overweight. Technology has advanced to the point where machines do many of our daily tasks, making some people lazy.  People sit at home in front of computer screens, forgetting about exercise, spending time with friends and family, and enjoying nature. Computers interfere with real - life interactions. For example, while your friends are having a party, you'll likely be absent because they won't have a webcam at the event.  Another issue is that many people neglect nature. In the digital age, the beauty of the outdoors is often forgotten. Watching videos or looking at pictures of nature can't compare to the real experience of fresh air and unique animal sightings. Being outdoors can inspire a healthy diet and is a great place to exercise.  Obesity is a global problem, and it's currently at an all - time high. It claims lives and causes depression. I believe this is closely related to computer usage, especially when fast food is also a factor. People haven't realized the need to exercise more often.  In conclusion, it's clear that computer usage has had a negative impact on our nation. Computer use can be acceptable in moderation, like consuming sweets or oily foods. It can pass the time, but so can exercise. We should stop relying so much on technology and start engaging in more physical activities.
756	758	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers, and I have @CAPS7 reasons to support this view. The first reason is that it leads to a waste of money. People incur high costs in terms of electricity bills due to the continuous running or charging of computers. Those with computers often have to pay @NUM1 or more dollars on electricity, and they also need to spend @NUM2 and odd dollars on the @CAPS3 bill to maintain the connection, resulting in a total of @NUM3 and odd dollars being squandered.  Secondly, everything one can obtain from a computer can also be found in books. Website makers source their information from books, and reading books enhances knowledge, enabling one to quickly come up with answers. Moreover, some websites may not provide accurate information.  The third and final reason is the ""@CAPS8 crisis."" @CAPS7 people are becoming less physically active each day because of computers. This lack of physical activity makes people less fit and has a negative impact on @LOCATION1. Fewer people are joining the army due to this crisis, and computers are unfortunately contributing to this global issue.  I sincerely hope that this letter has helped you understand my perspective on this matter. People do spend too much time on computers as it is a waste of money, the information from computers can be found in books, and it is contributing to the ""@CAPS8 crisis."
757	759	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I've been informed of the concerns expressed by numerous scientists regarding computers. While computers have ushered us into the @DATE1 and enhanced our society, they are adversely affecting the health and education of our children.  Computers are causing a decline in family communication. With the rise of technology, both children and adults are spending less time with their families. A study at @ORGANIZATION1 indicated that families with more computers in their homes communicate less frequently. Children prefer chatting with friends online or using social networking sites rather than having in - person conversations with family members. Additionally, it has become difficult for families to have meals together as children are reluctant to leave their computers. This obsession with technology is impeding the development of strong family bonds and may hinder children's educational progress.  Athletic activities are also suffering. Instead of participating in sports teams, children spend all day on websites. Moreover, the electricity that powers computers emits radiation. Exposure to this radiation can lead to brain damage or even death. My aunt, for example, experienced persistent and severe headaches after buying a computer for the first time, which were caused by the computer's radiation. Another health risk is obesity. Children who sit in front of a computer for extended periods often have an increased appetite and gain weight due to a lack of exercise, which can lead to obesity and potentially diabetes.  In conclusion, computers are causing less family communication, a lack of exercise, and various health concerns. The consequences of misusing this technology are severe and life - threatening. Therefore, I urge you to take steps to reduce computer usage and avoid these detrimental effects.
758	760	1	2	Computers are truly remarkable as they can assist us with a wide range of tasks, such as shopping, paying bills, and booking vacation flights. However, people are spending an excessive amount of time on them. They should limit their computer use to a certain period each day rather than being on it all the time.  Many individuals often spend hours on the computer without even realizing it. They stay up all @TIME1 working or playing games. Prolonged computer use takes a toll on the body. Since one uses little to no energy while sitting in front of the computer all day, they may find it difficult to sleep at night, tossing and turning in bed. This leads to feeling dreadful in the @TIME2. Repeatedly engaging in such behavior will have a negative impact on one's health.  I am convinced that people who spend all their time on the computer will eventually become overweight. Sitting in a chair all day means no physical exercise. When people eat while on the computer, they do not burn off the calories, leading to weight gain and potential obesity, which can cause various health problems.  Moreover, computer users often miss out on the joys of nature. They forgo the warmth of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, building @CAPS5 and forts in the snow, having a @CAPS6 fight, or simply taking a walk outside. They are glued to their computers inside their houses.  In summary, computer use can cause health problems and other issues. People should allocate a part of their day to computer use and spend the rest of the time outside, engaging in physical activities, and interacting with pets, children, or friends.
759	761	1	2	Dear local newspaper, computers can be useful for school reports and similar tasks. However, we need to question whether we truly need them. When using a computer for a school project, several problems can arise. Freezing is one common issue. When a computer freezes during a project, it can be extremely time - consuming. Pop - ups are another problem. They can cause viruses, and once a computer is infected, it becomes very slow. Slowness is yet another significant problem, making the computer a frustrating digital device to use.  There are also various health problems and risks associated with computer use. One health concern is that people can become recluses, staying inside all day because they are overly attached to the computer. Another is that they can become extremely obese due to a lack of physical exercise. A major risk is the potential of meeting dangerous people online. For example, one could create an account on Facebook, @CAPS1, or MySpace and be lured by someone pretending to be someone else, potentially leading to abduction by a molester.  There are alternatives to using a computer. One can visit the local library and check out books on the desired topic. Another option is to ask a teacher to borrow a class textbook. The most significant alternative is to switch from computers to old - fashioned books.  So, it's your choice. Do we really need computers, or can we live without them?
760	762	1	2	Computers are an incredible scientific achievement that brings numerous benefits to mankind. However, their impact can be either positive or negative depending on how they are used.  On the positive side, computers simplify homework, facilitate communication with others, and provide easy access to entertainment such as @CAPS1 and video games. For instance, the search engine @ORGANIZATION1 is a user - friendly website that can quickly provide answers to various questions. @LOCATION1 is a versatile website that serves as a dictionary, @CAPS2, encyclopedia, and translator. Online textbooks are also very useful. Instead of carrying a heavy @NUM1 - pound textbook, one can use a @NUM1 - megabyte book on the internet, which makes commuting to and from school easier and saves desk space. Studying is also more convenient with online textbooks.  On the other hand, computers can be distracting, addictive, and tiring. Social networking websites like Facebook, game websites like @CAPS3, and websites like @CAPS4 can easily distract users from their homework. Procrastination becomes a common problem, and self - control and time management are essential to avoid it.  Moreover, excessive computer use can keep us from engaging in outdoor activities, exercising, and interacting with real people. We are overly connected as a society, constantly updating our status, feelings, and relationships. Facebook, for example, is highly addictive, and we are often lost in a virtual landscape.  In conclusion, computers are great tools, but we must be aware of when and how long to use them. They offer many benefits in terms of entertainment, communication, and information, but these can also be distractions. I hope that society can carefully consider the pros and cons of computer use and make more rational decisions.
761	763	1	2	To the local newspaper, computers have a significant impact on today's society. While some people disagree, I firmly believe that computers have a positive influence on individuals. Firstly, computers are highly entertaining. There is a vast array of games available, ranging from dress - up games to educational ones, which are particularly beneficial for young children aged five to six as they teach hand - eye coordination. Secondly, computers help in reconnecting with long - lost friends. Websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and Yahoo can assist in finding people and maintaining contact with family, especially when there is no phone access. Lastly, computers are useful for homework. They come with built - in calculators, and a nationwide website, edhelper.com, provides worksheets and helps children according to their academic level. In conclusion, computers have a good impact on people as they are entertaining, aid in communication, and are helpful for educational purposes. I urge you to consider these reasons.
762	764	1	2	Dear local newspaper, in my view, computers have a negative impact on people of all ages. Spending all day on the computer can make one miss out on outdoor activities and lead to a sedentary lifestyle. I've learned from past experiences that computer games can be highly addictive. If one stays on the computer all day, they are likely to miss out on sports. For example, @PERCENT1 of Americans play soccer, but during the beautiful fall when the leaves are changing, computer users may miss the joy of playing soccer and the beauty of nature. Another activity that can be missed is hiking. When reaching the top of a mountain during a hike, one can see people sitting inside on their computers instead of enjoying the outdoors. Moreover, being glued to the computer can cause weight gain. A recent study showed that @PERCENT2 of children are obese because of computer games. I have a friend, @PERSON1, who used to love outdoor sports but became overweight after getting into computer games. He now weighs @NUM1 pounds at the age of @NUM2. Additionally, using the computer for chatting or playing games can lead to procrastination. For instance, chatting with a girlfriend in Spain may cause one to put off schoolwork. Also, spending too much time on the computer can damage eyesight. A scientific study reported that six hours on the computer per day for one week can worsen vision from @NUM4 @NUM4 to @NUM6 @NUM6. In the end, the negative effects of computers are evident, and I hope to spread awareness about these issues.
763	765	1	2	Dear editor, I believe that people should own computers. The reasons are compelling. Firstly, emailing is extremely fast. Sending an email takes just five seconds to reach the recipient, while regular mail can take from one day to a week. This not only saves time but also government resources. Secondly, computers allow us to learn about different countries, both far - away and nearby. Without computers, it would be difficult to learn about events like the earthquake in Chile or about a place like @LOCATION1 from the comfort of our living rooms. They are like a modern - day television for kids. Lastly, there are numerous ways to communicate with people on the computer, such as through Facebook, MySpace, AIM, and video chat. One doesn't have to rely solely on phone calls. In conclusion, computers are excellent tools. They enable fast emailing, provide knowledge about foreign countries, and facilitate online communication. I firmly think computers are a valuable asset, and I wonder if you share the same view.
764	766	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, have you ever used a computer for non - business purposes? If not, I suggest you give it a try when you're free. Computers have a great impact on people. They are a lot of fun to use, helpful in various aspects, and can provide access to a wide range of information, from clothing websites to store location maps. There are three main reasons why you should agree with me. Firstly, people have the right to choose how they use computers as the government is preoccupied with more important matters, and the constitution gives us the power of self - determination. Secondly, when the weather is cold, it's not ideal to go out and enjoy nature. Nature is best experienced in the @DATE1 and @DATE2 when the temperature is moderate. In such situations, it makes sense to take advantage of computer technology. Moreover, modern technology, like generators, has been beneficial to people, unlike in the old days. I hope this letter has changed your opinion on the matter. Thank you for reading.
765	767	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, in my opinion, computers are used constantly. People use them to communicate with friends and family online, for homework, and for entertainment. Using computers to talk to friends and family on platforms like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5 is a good thing as it helps maintain relationships, especially when friends move away. However, it also has a dark side, as some older men may use the computer for child pornography or have inappropriate conversations with younger girls. When it comes to homework, computers are extremely useful. They can provide all the necessary information for various subjects, such as history. For entertainment, computers offer a wide variety of games, from simple matching games for kids like my @NUM1 - year - old sister plays, to games for teenagers. I also find it great as I can check on the performance of @CAPS2 football team and @CAPS7. In conclusion, while computers have some negative aspects, overall, they are used frequently for communication, education, and entertainment, and these are my thoughts on the matter.
766	768	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, I firmly suggest that individuals should allocate more time away from the computer. Instead, they ought to engage in more exercise, participate in outdoor activities, and, most importantly, spend quality time with family and friends.  I believe the most effective way to convince everyone to concur with me is to write a passage elucidating the reasons why people should reduce their computer usage. The primary reason for ceasing to waste time on the computer is to engage in more physical activity. More exercise can significantly benefit one's health, as a lack of exercise is associated with poor health. Regular exercise can also prevent diabetes, which is a prevalent condition often linked to a sedentary lifestyle. Additionally, increasing physical activity can mitigate the risk of various diseases and health problems in old age.  Another alternative to spending time on the computer is to partake in outdoor activities. Outdoor activities can be highly rewarding, especially for those unaccustomed to playing games like football with friends outside. I recall a time when I first started going outdoors; it was incredibly enjoyable. Moreover, spending time in nature is beneficial. Taking a walk on a pleasant @DATE1 day to feel the breeze and inhale the fresh scents can be invigorating.  Lastly, spending more time off the computer allows for more time with family. Family time is far more valuable than online interactions with friends. I remember visiting my cousin's house when we hardly knew each other. Through spending time together, we now have a deep understanding of one another. Additionally, spending time with family provides an opportunity to learn more about them.  In conclusion, there are three compelling reasons to spend less time on the computer: engaging in exercise, participating in outdoor activities, and spending time with family. These activities enhance physical health, provide enjoyment, and strengthen relationships, making them far more worthwhile than excessive computer use.
767	769	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1 newspaper, I am firmly convinced that computers have numerous positive benefits for society. These technological advancements have the potential to significantly enhance people's lives.  Computers offer several advantages in the educational realm. Students can complete their schoolwork online and access their teachers' pages. Online textbooks are also a valuable resource, especially for students who struggle to carry heavy books. Moreover, the internet is replete with educational information and resources, enabling teachers to assign online research projects and educational activities.  In addition to education, computers are well - known information centers. People can obtain information about restaurants, stores, products, and directions to destinations online. The ability to purchase and order items online is another significant advantage. Consumers can research products, compare prices, and even order groceries without leaving their homes.  The internet is also the primary means of communication. For instance, the manager of my soccer team uses email to inform me of game and practice times and locations. Businesses rely on the internet to communicate with clients, and web conferences save time and resources, allowing companies to operate globally. Social networking sites play a crucial role in keeping people connected with friends, updated on the news, and entertained.  In conclusion, computers have a profoundly positive impact on society. They are invaluable educational resources, the best - known information databases, and the most widely used communication tools. While it is important to balance computer use with outdoor activities, computers remain an essential asset in modern life, with no significant negative effects.
768	770	1	2	Dear Readers, I understand that some people are concerned about the excessive time spent on computers and its perceived negative effects. However, I firmly disagree. Computers offer numerous benefits, including facilitating communication with family members, providing access to visual information, and supporting schoolwork.  I know a family whose son is serving in the @LOCATION1. He brought his laptop with him and was able to video - chat with his family. It made it seem as if he was never far away. Without the computer, his family would have been constantly worried about his well - being.  You don't need to have a family member at war to benefit from computer - mediated communication. For example, if you've ever wondered what @LOCATION2 looks like, you can simply search for it on your computer. If you live in a city with limited natural scenery, the computer can show you what the outside world is like. Seeing these sights in @MONTH1 might inspire you to travel with your family, which can strengthen family bonds. A study indicates that @PERCENT1 of families that go on vacations have strong relationships.  Computers are also essential for school. They are excellent research tools. @PERCENT2 of failing students do not use computers for homework. There are also many educational websites for studying. In my school, there was a student who failed most of his classes because he never used a computer. After taking his friend's advice to use one at home, he used it to study for a test and got a @PERCENT1 on it.  In conclusion, computers are one of the most important inventions. Whether you use them for homework, communicating with friends and family, or other purposes, they offer significant benefits. They bring families closer, support education, and open up a world of information.
769	771	1	2	Computers are extremely important, and I can't think of anyone who doesn't need one. However, some people claim that computers distract us from exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I disagree with this view.  Computers are a modern - day technology that plays a crucial role in communication. They are the primary means of connecting with long - distance friends and family. For example, many people use social media platforms like MySpace and Facebook. Nine out of ten people use these platforms to interact. My aunt, whose friends live in @CAPS2, uses Facebook to stay in touch. Although they have phones, computers with webcams allow them to see each other.  Business people rely heavily on computers, especially laptops. Computers store work schedules, notifications from bosses, and much more. People work most of the week, and on weekends, they can visit family. Clearly, a computer is essential for work and earning a living.  Google is the most popular search engine. Whether you want to know the start time of a movie or complete a research paper, you'll likely use a computer. If I ask my dad about the square root of pi, he'll tell me to “Google it.” This shows how integral computers are for research.  In conclusion, computers are not a waste of time. They help us communicate with friends, are essential for business people, and are excellent research engines. However, it's important not to spend all day on the computer. Take a break, go outside, and enjoy the fresh air.
770	772	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, I do not believe that computers, which hold exclusive information, have a positive effect on people.  Most students today are often glued to their computers instead of taking care of their physical health through exercise or spending time outdoors. People should be enjoying the wonders of nature rather than sitting in front of a screen. Moreover, computers not only affect individuals but also have a negative impact on family and friends. Spending too much time on the computer reduces interaction time, which can damage relationships.  In @LOCATION1, a significant number of people are obese. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are not physically healthy, and many obese people own computers. Computers are so enticing that people often sit in front of them for hours, neglecting exercise and outdoor activities.  Computers also have a detrimental effect on the mind. My sister has a computer in her bedroom and rarely comes out. It takes my mom more than five @CAPS2 to get her away from the computer for dinner. This lack of interaction with family and friends is disrespectful and can ruin people's social health. As they ignore their loved ones, these people may stop trying to interact with them.  In addition, there is a significant risk of personal information being exposed. Websites like @CAPS4, MySpace, or Twitter store personal information, and with a single click, it can be made public. This can have a severely negative impact on one's career and education.  In conclusion, computers have an unhealthy effect on those who use them. They negatively impact physical and mental health, social relationships, and personal privacy. People should be more cautious about their computer use to avoid these negative consequences.
771	773	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are making our society smarter and more intelligent. They are the number one - selling electronic device globally. Firstly, computers offer great career prospects. Studies indicate that a significant percentage of people who grew up with home - computers secure high - paying jobs. Most jobs, from doctors to police officers and cashiers, require computer skills. Thus, proficiency in using computers can lead to a well - paying career.  Secondly, computers are an excellent means of staying connected. Have you ever longed to see old high - school friends or far - away family members? Thanks to platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or just regular email, people can keep in touch worldwide. The built - in video cameras in computers allow family, friends, and colleagues to see each other across different parts of the world. A simple message on these platforms can brighten someone's day.  Finally, computers teach hand - eye coordination and other life skills. Skills like a gunman's quick shooting or a baseball player's perfect swing rely on hand - eye coordination, which is best learned through computers. Moreover, people can save lives by typing information about natural disasters like hurricanes or tornadoes, but this is only possible if they know how to operate a computer.  In conclusion, despite the negative comments some people make about computers, it is clear that they will bring numerous benefits to our society. We should think twice before dismissing the importance of computers.
772	774	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I firmly believe that it's beneficial for teenagers to use computers. The web offers a plethora of activities. There are social sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace, as well as video platforms like YouTube. Teenagers can also learn to type quickly.  Social networking sites are highly advantageous for teens. They can communicate with each other, make new friends, and share their thoughts. On Twitter, they can post tweets; on Facebook, they can join groups and become fans of things or people; on MySpace, they can send messages. These platforms help teens relieve stress.  Video sites are a great source of entertainment when teens are bored. By visiting YouTube, they can have a good laugh and become more social. For example, they can learn new dances. Comedy on these video sites also has a positive impact on daily life, especially for those working in an office or in business.  Learning to type is also essential. Typing is like texting or writing a letter electronically, which makes life more convenient.  In conclusion, computers play a significant role in a teen's life. They enhance social interaction, provide entertainment, and teach useful skills. All people should have access to a computer as social sites, video sites, and typing skills truly make life better.
773	775	1	2	I am of the opinion that we should continue using computers as they offer several important benefits. Firstly, computers enable us to stay in contact with other countries around the world. Without them, we wouldn't be able to send emails or have video messages regarding important events.  Secondly, while we need to balance computer use with exercise and face - to - face interaction, computers still help us connect with family and friends. We can use email or video chat to stay in touch, which is very convenient.  Finally, using computers simplifies life. It's much easier to write an email than a letter, and instant messaging is more efficient than making a phone call. For school projects, we can enhance the appearance of our work by adding pictures and different fonts, which is far better than just handwriting.  In conclusion, computers are not a waste of time. They help us stay connected with other countries, create a balance in our lives, and simplify daily tasks. Therefore, their continued use is highly advisable.
774	776	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1, computers are an absolute necessity in life. They bring benefits not only to the community but to the entire world. They offer education, serve as a form of communication, and provide entertainment.  Education is a cornerstone of life, and computers are invaluable in this regard. How often do we use Google or other search engines to find answers to our questions? I often conduct research whenever a random question pops into my head. Without computers, it would be extremely difficult to find answers. There are also online courses for students. College students often look up assignments on their professors' web pages, and students rely on checking their teacher's homepage to know their homework. Without computers, the percentage of students not doing their homework would likely increase.  Communication is another crucial aspect. A large proportion of people in @LOCATION2 have some form of online communication program, whether it's Skype, Facebook, YouTube, or just simple email. It's an efficient way to talk to friends after school, and it also helps deaf people communicate by typing. Teachers and parents use email to discuss academics and children's progress.  Entertainment is also a part of the computer's charm. Almost everyone over the age of @NUM3 has played a computer game at some point, unless they lack internet access. We can also use computers to look up cheats for video games. Additionally, we can use programs to create cover pages for projects or presentations.  In conclusion, computers are highly educational, essential for communication, and a source of entertainment. They are truly a boon to society.
775	777	1	2	The influence of computers on people is concerning. Adults and children are devoting excessive attention to computers. Most individuals spend their time on social networking, while others are engaged in online shopping or gaming. Some computer users are overly focused on being tech - savvy, wasting a great deal of time. There are alternative ways to spend time, such as cycling or taking a brisk walk. People can also improve their learning skills or look for local jobs.  Computers are draining and wasting people's mental energy on a daily basis. It is crucial for those who are overly reliant on computers to seek physical fitness and mental well - being. However, there may be legitimate reasons for spending a lot of time on computers.  Those who abuse computer access should find other activities. I propose that there should be a set time when computers are shut off, perhaps once a week. Internet and cable companies could turn off services for a week to encourage people to exercise. This would motivate lazy individuals to be active and also serve as a wake - up call for those who spend too much time on the computer or watching TV. With effort, everyone could become fit and healthy.  It is understandable that the elderly or senior citizens may need computers for health - related assistance, but others should not be exempt. Disconnecting computers and laptops from the network would prompt people to be more active and engage in beneficial or intellectually stimulating activities.  Currently, people are being increasingly sucked into the digital world, and some seem unable to get enough. The government should enact a law requiring people to engage in activities that are actively beneficial. State or local officials could visit every household, or one person from each street could go door - to - door to ensure compliance.  There will undoubtedly be resistance to this new law, but there should be penalties for non - compliance, such as the loss of internet services. Sometimes, strict laws are necessary to bring about change. In conclusion, taking steps to reduce excessive computer use is essential for the well - being of individuals and society as a whole.
776	778	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to express my concern regarding your potential stance on not advancing technology. This could be the gravest error. Computers offer numerous benefits. They enhance hand - eye coordination, impart valuable knowledge, and help us maintain close relationships with family and friends.  Approximately @PERCENT1 of people use computers daily to increase their knowledge. For instance, accessing @ORGANIZATION1 to get the latest news is far easier than waiting for news on the @CAPS1. A survey I conducted revealed that @NUM1 students use their computers every night to delve deeper into social studies or science units. Halting computer advancement is tantamount to impeding learning progress.  A children's doctor, @PERSON1, states that computers help children develop the hand - eye coordination necessary for sports like baseball, soccer, and basketball. Without this coordination, students may struggle and eventually quit sports, which could lead to an obesity problem among many children.  Moreover, restricting computer advancement means severing connections with family and friends. Platforms like Facebook, MySpace, @CAPS3, and Skype allow us to stay in touch. While it's true that computers can consume time with family, they also enable us to connect with loved ones in @LOCATION1 whom we may not see for over a year. We can set time limits to balance computer use.  I recall chatting and laughing with friends over the computer when I was sick, and it cheered me up. Please don't deprive us of these experiences. Keep enhancing computers so that we can expand our knowledge, improve hand - eye coordination, and stay connected with distant family and friends.
777	779	1	2	Dear local newspaper, it is evident that computers have a negative impact on people and society. Firstly, the issue of overweight in our country is partly due to excessive computer use. People often sit around using computers instead of thinking about maintaining a proper shape. Before the advent of computers, individuals were more physically fit and healthy. We need to shift our focus away from computers, if only for a short time, and engage in exercise to help our country regain its fitness.  Secondly, computers harm not only people but also the environment. We spend too much time indoors with technology and neglect the world around us. In the past, people used to plant gardens and trees, but now this thought rarely occurs to us. The prevalence of electronics is making people forget about nature, and this situation must change.  Finally, computers have a detrimental effect on communication. When we rely too much on technology to communicate, we lose the ability to interact in person. This ruins relationships with family and friends. We should start caring more about the people around us and not always depend on technology.  In conclusion, while we shouldn't get rid of computers, we need to take steps to mitigate their negative effects. We should exercise more, help protect the environment, and improve our in - person communication with friends and family.
778	780	1	2	More and more people are using computers daily, but I firmly believe this does not benefit our society. The overuse of computers leads to a lack of exercise and a decrease in time spent with family and friends.  Professor @PERSON1's study shows that people who use computers for more than @NUM1 hours a day are overweight and do not exercise regularly. If these habits persist, they are at a higher risk of becoming obese and having a heart attack before the age of @NUM2. I've witnessed the impact in my community. A friend of mine was fit and exercised regularly before getting a computer. After that, he stopped exercising and gained over @NUM4 lbs. He became slower and less active. Clearly, excessive computer use promotes an unhealthy lifestyle.  Computers also cause people to spend less time with family and friends. Studies indicate that @PERCENT1 of children who use computers spend less time with their families. This may seem insignificant at first, but @PERCENT2 of these children grow up to be lonely and may even commit suicide due to depression. I remember a new student at our school. He was a normal, friendly kid at first. After a year of heavy computer use, he became withdrawn. Eventually, he ran away from home and has not been found. This shows that relying too much on computers can lead to social isolation.  In conclusion, the increasing use of computers is having a negative impact on society. People are becoming less healthy and more isolated. We need to find a balance and reduce our dependence on computers.
779	781	1	2	Dear @PERSON1, the editor of the @LOCATION1 citizen, I've heard that some people in @LOCATION1 think computers and technology are bad, while others believe in their value. I'm writing to share my view that new technology is negatively affecting our daily exercise, our connection with nature, and our interaction with friends and family.  Regarding exercise, the new technology has made people less active. With computers, people are easily distracted and don't exercise. This is especially concerning for the youth, as it can lead to obesity, poor health, and lethargy. We, as the future, need to be fit. A poll shows that @PERCENT1 of people get headaches and feel tired after using the computer, while exercise has the opposite effect. It gives us energy and makes us happier.  Our new technology has also made us neglect nature. People don't go outside to play and enjoy the natural world as they used to. My mother said that in her time, she was sent outside early in the morning and wouldn't return until late afternoon. Parents should encourage their children to play outside more, which would reduce their reliance on computers and other gadgets for entertainment.  Finally, computers and cellphones are changing the way we interact with others. Friends now communicate through technology instead of spending time together in person. This is unhealthy as it impairs our ability to communicate face - to - face and can damage relationships. Families also suffer as they focus more on their devices and less on each other.  I hope I've convinced you that technology should be used sparingly. It's important to exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with loved ones in person. Thank you for your time.
780	782	1	2	I firmly believe that computers greatly benefit society and are a significant factor in technological advancement. They offer a wealth of knowledge at our fingertips and provide entertainment after a long day at work or school. Additionally, many people have found fulfilling careers through the internet.  Computers have come a long way since their invention in the @NUM1's. You can access thousands of electronic newspapers to stay updated on local news or learn about what's happening in @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1. The internet is also useful for schoolwork, checking the stock market, or using the built - in calculator.  Entertainment is another major aspect of computer use. Approximately @PERCENT1 of people use computers for entertainment every day. Social networking is extremely popular, with @PERCENT2 of internet users frequenting sites like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. These platforms help us stay in touch with old friends and continue conversations. We can also watch live - streaming TV or new movies on our computers. And the vast number of games available on the web provides endless fun.  Many individuals have found their careers through the internet. @PERSON1, @NUM5, was discovered on YouTube when his mother posted videos for the family. There are numerous job listings online, and artists can explore their talents using software like @CAPS6 or @CAPS7. Careers directly related to computers, such as repair and movie special effects, are also on the rise.  In conclusion, whether for job hunting, entertainment, or information, having a computer at home is a great idea. The fact that @PERCENT3 of @CAPS8 use computers is a testament to their value.
781	783	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I truly appreciate the stories and puzzles in your paper, and I believe I have a story that could be of use to you. It's about computer addiction. You might be wondering what I mean by computer addiction. Well, I'll provide three reasons. Firstly, computer - addicted people don't spend enough time with their families. Couples often argue because the person addicted to the internet neglects their responsibilities. For instance, one might forget a turkey in the oven while engrossed in the computer until the fire alarm goes off. Secondly, the numerous online chat rooms contribute to computer addiction. I know people addicted to these chat rooms, and I'm often worried because they frequently don't know who they're talking to; it could even be a pedophile. Lastly, some people simply don't care. They can spend all day and night online chatting instead of doing something useful like writing an essay. I was once addicted to the computer myself. As a result, I almost failed all my classes. Now, I only use it to read emails or write essays. This could be your next top story.
782	784	1	2	It is a fallacy to claim that computers harm society. In fact, computers represent a significant advancement for humanity and bring numerous benefits. They offer knowledge, support business advertising and operations, and provide an easy means of communication. Undoubtedly, computers only serve to benefit society. Firstly, computers are a vast source of knowledge. Many people, when faced with a question they can't answer from books or newspapers, turn to computers and quickly find solutions. Today's computers contain information on every imaginable topic, from history to politics. One can simply visit a site like @ORGANIZATION1, type in their question, and receive millions of answers. They are also useful for research projects, economic statistics, and more, whether for school, business, or personal interest. What was once sought in books and papers can now be found with a click of a button on the internet. Clearly, computers are a major knowledge source for society. Secondly, computers and the internet support businesses. Every time one accesses the internet, businesses can advertise through pop - ups, side - bars, and websites, attracting attention. Moreover, they can sell products online, which is convenient for consumers as they don't have to go to the store. Finally, computers are an excellent and easy way to communicate. Social networking sites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3 allow people to connect with others across the street or the ocean. One can send a message instantly without going to the post office. In conclusion, computers bring great benefits to society without any negative side effects. Everyone should recognize their value.
783	785	1	2	Dear local newspaper, @PERCENT1 of people own a computer, which indicates that computers must have a positive impact on people. I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect because they enable online communication, facilitate learning, and improve hand - eye coordination. With computers, people without phones can still contact others. They are also ideal for keeping in touch with family and friends abroad, without the high cost of long - distance phone calls. Online communication is crucial, so this is a definite positive. Secondly, computers make learning about new things effortless. One can obtain information with a click of a button, eliminating the need to travel to gather knowledge. This saves time and allows more people to learn more. After all, knowledge is power and will benefit people in the future. Thirdly, computers teach hand - eye coordination, which is essential throughout life. It is used in activities like driving, writing, and exercising. In conclusion, computers positively affect people by enabling online communication, facilitating learning, and improving hand - eye coordination. I hope this letter convinces you of their positive impact.
784	786	1	2	It's hard to imagine how difficult life would be without a computer. I firmly believe that computers are extremely helpful. They assist in research, keep us connected with friends and family, and are often required in some @CAPS1. The internet on a computer is a convenient research tool. One can search for information, and millions of articles are available at a mouse click. It's much more efficient than searching through books, which can be time - consuming. The internet can quickly answer questions. Computers also help us stay connected. Almost everyone has an email, and a few typed letters can re - establish contact with old friends. Unlike phone calls, email allows the recipient to reply at their convenience. In many @CAPS1, computers are indispensable. They organize data by storing documents in files and have useful programs like @ORGANIZATION1 word, which can aid in one's career. Some may argue that the internet has misleading information. However, double - checking on other websites still takes less time than finding facts in books. The computer is one of the greatest inventions. It simplifies research, connection with friends, and @CAPS3. Using a computer @DATE1 will surely improve your life.
785	787	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, in my view, excessive online time has a negative impact on society. When people communicate via email, Facebook, and Twitter, they miss out on a full - fledged social experience. Time spent on these sites could be better used with family, friends, or at school. It also prevents people from enjoying the outdoors and exercising. While online activity can be helpful, over - indulgence is harmful. Online interaction is great for staying in touch with distant friends and family. However, in - person interaction is superior as one can see the other person's reactions. A positive social environment is beneficial for both individuals. Excessive computer use can also damage family relationships. For distant family, online interaction is useful, but for close family, one may miss important aspects of their lives. Moreover, when using the computer, people often eat and don't exercise, contributing to the rising obesity level in @LOCATION1. We're also missing out on the beautiful nature that @ORGANIZATION1 offers. In conclusion, excessive online time is detrimental to our social lives, health, and overall well - being. While the internet is useful for adults for tasks like paying taxes and working from home, we should consider more direct forms of communication instead of relying solely on computers.
786	788	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are incredibly useful and can teach us a great deal about the world today. They offer kids the freedom to explore various things without having to travel long distances. For instance, if one desires to see the @LOCATION1's @CAPS1, instead of spending money on plane tickets and traveling far, they can obtain pictures and information right on the computer within minutes. Although computers can be a bit addictive at times, it's essential to learn to limit our usage. They are used by billions of people and are an excellent way to learn about the world. There are information websites like Google or Bing to look up anything. Computers are ubiquitous, found in phones, iPods, and even in some cars like police cars. They are present in almost every building, such as hospitals, fire stations, police stations, and electronic stores. We can learn a lot more from computers than by traveling or going to school. In my view, we should all have computers as they are both fun and educational. Thus, I disagree with what scientists or some people say about the effects of computers on certain individuals in @DATE1.
787	789	1	2	"In my opinion, the issue of computers is becoming a significant problem. People are spending excessive time on computers rather than communicating with friends and family, exercising, or enjoying nature. As the expert Tinker stated in his book @CAPS2, ""Too much time on computers and not the recommended seven hours outside can make you gain weight."" One reason why people should get out more is that they can interact with friends and family. It's astonishing that @PERCENT1 of kids from @NUM1 to @NUM2 are sitting on their couches or playing video games. Another reason is that people need more exercise. A large portion of the country's population will be obese due to lack of exercise, mainly because of excessive computer use. The most important reason is that people can fully enjoy nature. Jack Cup also shares this view, saying that '@PERCENT2 of people who enjoy nature will live @NUM4 years longer, and those who don't are more likely to have a heart problem in their @NUM5's'. That's why I believe computers are bad for people, and I'm not alone in this opinion; @PERSON1, Jackup @CAPS6, scientists, and many others agree."
788	790	1	2	Undoubtedly, having a computer at home is extremely helpful. It provides useful information to everyone and can be used for personal communication, like chatting with friends. If there's a child in the household, they may need to search for school - related information on the internet. For making quick plans, such as going to a movie with friends, one can send an email or a message on @CAPS2. With @CAPS1, you can text people directly from your computer for free. In today's technologically advanced world, schools often require students to look things up on a computer or complete homework assignments posted on the school's webpage. A child without a computer at home may struggle with their homework. Additionally, if a parent wants to start a business from home, a computer is necessary for calculating profits and communicating with customers. It can also create signs and business cards for the business. Whether you need directions to a restaurant, a local gym, or any place on earth, a computer can help. @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS11 is a reliable website for getting directions. You can also learn about specific people and find their phone numbers using @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS12 pages. Clearly, computers have a positive impact on people. They help us stay in touch with friends, save money, assist students in learning, and can even support starting a home - based business. In this age, having a computer can broaden our perspective of everything.
789	791	1	2	I'm @PERSON1, and I believe we should stop overusing computers. People are spending so much time on them that they're neglecting exercise, not going outside to enjoy nature, and failing to communicate with friends and family. Many people aren't exercising because they're on Facebook or playing games. A large number of children are sitting on their couches instead of going out to play. Families are also spending less time together because everyone is glued to their computers. We used to go hiking, camping, and swimming, but now we rarely do those activities because of computers. We need to make a change. Taking away the computer or limiting its use could be a solution. Moreover, if parents and kids weren't so focused on computers, they might notice family members who are sick or ill. They could also go out together, like to a lake or Six Flags. Many people get addicted to computers because they're fun, but it's causing problems. I think everyone should reduce their computer usage. In our society, computers are causing us to miss out on exercise, nature, and quality time with loved ones. So, I firmly believe we should cut down on computer use.
790	792	1	2	In my view, computers are highly beneficial for school, skill - building, and entertainment. They are a great resource, especially for pre - teens and teenagers, while adults mostly use them for business. The fun aspects of computers include popular chat groups like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. Both allow chatting with friends, updating statuses, and uploading pictures and songs. There are also music websites where you can watch music videos or download music. @CAPS3 is a favorite among teenagers for watching music videos, and iTunes lets you download various media onto an iPod. For school purposes, computers offer Microsoft @CAPS5, Publisher, and PowerPoint. @CAPS5 enables you to type up essays, cut and paste pictures, and customize text for projects. Publisher is useful for creating newspapers, flyers, and business cards. PowerPoint helps in making presentations. Computers can also be a great aid for kids with special needs in @MONTH1 to communicate with others. In conclusion, computers are a significant help in the world, and those who disagree don't understand how they assist children and adults in their daily lives.
791	793	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers have a highly positive impact on people. With the continuous advancement of technology, there are numerous educational opportunities available online. People can interact with others without being physically present and play games that enhance their lives.  Computers offer a wide array of educational options. One can view school textbooks on the internet and access additional practice materials that come with online textbooks. Without carrying the physical textbook home, one can study online. Online textbooks also provide a plethora of extra practice and quizzes, which are ideal for learning. Moreover, the internet provides real - time updates on major global events. For instance, I logged onto the internet the other day and saw an article about the earthquake in @LOCATION1, which was not reported in the newspaper yet. Even if one chooses not to use the internet, there are many programs designed to develop children's math and reading skills, giving anyone a head start in education.  Another advantage of computers is the ability to interact with others. Video chatting, @CAPS2, and using social @CAPS3 sites are excellent ways to communicate. Through video chatting, one can have a conversation with classmates remotely. Instant messaging is also a useful way to talk to people far away, allowing one to share news or have a simple chat. Social @CAPS3 sites like Facebook and Twitter are valuable platforms for communication, where one can post messages, play games, or simply talk to others.  There are also many beneficial online games. If one wants to go bowling or drive a stock car but lacks the time, they can play relevant games online. These games not only offer the opportunity to do things one wouldn't normally do but also help sharpen reflexes and quick - thinking skills, which can be useful in real - life situations. They are also a source of fun and enjoyment.  In conclusion, I believe that the computer is a valuable resource for education, interaction, and playing useful games. No one should miss the chance to better prepare themselves for life with the help of computers.
792	794	1	2	"Do you have a passion for technology? In today's world, an increasing number of people are relying heavily on technology, especially computers. However, not everyone believes that this is beneficial to society, but I do. Computers empower people to learn about anything they desire, facilitate better communication with those living far away, and can serve as a means of safeguarding the country.  When I was around @NUM1 years old, I loved playing on the computer, thinking it was just a game. My father advised me not to abuse it but to use it for educational purposes. I discovered that with just a click of a button, there was a wealth of knowledge to be gained. Now, we can use this technology as a tool rather than just a game. Instead of going to the library to find a book, one can simply search for it on the computer.  People enjoy interacting with others, meeting new people, or communicating with those in other countries. The computer is one of the best platforms for this. I'm @NUM2 years old, and I, along with many of my friends, chat on the computer. My family members live in @LOCATION1, and I can't fly there every day to visit them. So, I use the computer to talk to them, which is both fast and enjoyable.  The @ORGANIZATION1 has one of the world's most powerful @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION3. Their technology is truly remarkable. One of their notable assets is the ""@PERSON1"", a plane controlled by a remote - control device. It's like a fighter plane but without a pilot. The operator can relax at the base while the @PERSON1 does all the work.  In conclusion, computers are useful as they enable people to learn about anything they want, provide a means of communication, and offer a way to protect the country. Technology is advancing rapidly and becoming more powerful. So, take my advice: don't abuse it, use it."
793	795	1	2	To whom it may concern: I am of the opinion that computers have a significant impact on people. They are useful for various aspects such as homework, staying in touch with out - of - state family, and obtaining information and directions about a place. They are particularly handy in last - minute situations.  Computers are highly beneficial for homework. When typing a report, it looks more professional. Moreover, one can conduct research on the project simultaneously while typing. There are individuals whose handwriting is so messy that they themselves or their teachers can't read it. For such people, the computer can be used to make their papers neat. If a child or a parent is unable to go to the library for some reason, they can use their home computer. A parent who is busy with kids at home can use the computer to do work without having to go anywhere. If a child is absent from school, they can visit the school's website to find out the homework.  Do you have family members living out of state that you'd like to talk to? Most people would prefer to communicate with them without incurring a high phone bill. Using the computer to keep in touch with family is cost - effective. Examples include AIM, emails, and other networks, which are free of charge.  On days when you have nothing to do and want to go out for some fun, the computer can be of great help in case of a last - minute decision. Before going somewhere, you can go on the computer to learn more about the place and get directions. This way, you can avoid staying home bored.  In conclusion, computers have a great impact on people. They are useful for both adults and children. Teachers can calculate students' averages more easily and quickly, and children can complete their homework more efficiently. They also allow us to stay in touch with friends. Overall, computers are highly useful.
794	796	1	2	Don't you find it refreshing to be outside? Wouldn't you prefer to experience the thrill of jumping into the crashing waves of the @LOCATION1 rather than sitting indoors, looking at pictures of it? Some may think that computers are beneficial to society, but I firmly believe they are wrong.  The human race has survived for hundreds of years without computers and can continue to do so for many more. Computers are causing society to become increasingly lazy. We can obtain just as much information from books if we make an effort. Hand - eye coordination is crucial, and we can develop it through activities like football and tennis. Even activities such as drawing, reading, and playing an instrument can improve hand - eye coordination while allowing us to explore our creative side. While computers can teach hand - eye coordination, there are better and more efficient ways to achieve it.  Many people love to travel around the world, but traveling to a foreign area without proper knowledge is unwise. The internet is often the most convenient source of information, but it's unreliable. Anyone can post anything on the internet, so you might think you're getting information about @LOCATION2 when it's actually about @LOCATION3. Books are a more reliable source. Reading, especially from a good source, is a powerful activity.  Lately, kids have been creating virtual lives on the internet. They communicate mainly through online chat, which can never replace in - person interaction with friends. Online relationships are not real, and we are losing our ability to communicate face - to - face. The internet is not worth the negative impacts it brings.  In conclusion, it's clear that computers are not good for society. We should focus on real - world experiences and reliable sources of information.
795	797	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 post, I believe that computers represent a positive advancement in technology and bring great benefits to society. They help family members stay connected, simplify flight - booking processes, and support children's education.  Computers are an excellent means of keeping in touch. In my personal experience, my brother is at college, and when I miss him or need to talk, I can send him an email or have a video chat. If you have someone you don't see every day, using a computer can strengthen family bonds as you can communicate more frequently with relatives and friends. Friends may move away, but you can always reach out to them when needed. In times of distress, a computer can be a great help when your friends are far away.  Booking flights without a computer can be a hassle. You may have to wait on the phone for hours. With a computer, you can complete the booking process in about five minutes. I once had an experience where my flight was canceled, but I only found out when I checked on the computer. I was able to switch my flight immediately. Imagine going to the airport the next day only to find out your flight was canceled and spending the whole day trying to get on another one, which might not even be possible. With a computer, you can check flight status every hour, and it will also inform you if there are delays, so you don't have to wait at the airport for hours.  Computers also play a significant role in education. At the end of class, when the teacher is trying to announce the homework, most students are not paying attention. As a result, about nine out of ten kids may not know the assignment when they get home. I've experienced this myself. As an eighth - grader, I sometimes just forgot about the homework. But with a computer, it's different. Most schools use some digital platform where teachers post grades, upcoming tests and quizzes, and homework. Everything is just one click away. Teachers will be happier if students come in with their homework, and parents would surely feel the same. From school fund - raisers to the lunch menu, all the information is available on the computer.  In conclusion, computers are useful in our daily lives and special situations. They strengthen family relationships, ensure smooth travel, and assist with schoolwork. They are a great and convenient asset to society.
796	798	1	2	One night, I entered the living room and saw my mom on the computer. I thought to myself, “She's always on that computer. Doesn't she have any work to do?” I told my mom, “I believe we should each have one or two hours on the computer every night, or not use it at all.” I explained to her that I think computers are a poor choice because you can't tell who's on the internet trying to talk to you. Moreover, it interferes with exercise and spending time with family and friends. Nowadays, the internet and computers are extremely dangerous. You never know if someone is a friend or a predator. For instance, you might be chatting with someone you think is your friend, but you can't be certain. It could be an older man or woman trying to get hold of you, perhaps to kidnap or steal from you, or even do worse. I often watch the news and see many cases of kidnapping because kids talk to strangers on the internet without knowing who they are or what they look like. Like that girl who thought she was talking to a friend but ended up in a lot of trouble. If she had met that person, she could have been seriously hurt and haunted by that memory for the rest of her life. Family is very important these days. I've heard that spending time with family can improve your school grades as you learn new things when you talk to them. Unfortunately, this isn't happening because people are so glued to their computers that they don't spend a single minute with their family or friends. I have a friend who is always on the computer. She never spends time with her family or friends and is so focused on the screen that she doesn't notice what's going on around her. Recently, she started getting off the computer and spending more time with her family and friends. Her grades also started to improve because she began studying with her parents instead of wasting time on sites like @CAPS1 or MySpace and not getting any schoolwork done. In other words, she's now very happy in life and has changed for the better. Some people think using your brain for knowledge is exercise, but it's not exercise for your body. People spend so much time with their eyes fixed on the computer screen that they don't go out to play or go to the gym. The obesity rate in our country is increasing for many reasons, and lack of exercise is one of them as people spend too much time watching TV and being on the computer. I have a little cousin who is overweight and should be out playing sports and exercising. But instead, she spends her free time in a stuffy room on the computer, missing out on fresh air. She keeps asking me how I got fit and at what age, and I keep telling her that I exercise and play sports, so I can't tell her a specific age. But she never listens. To this day, she's still the same because she didn't take my advice to get off the computer and go outside. I firmly believe that we should limit our computer use to two hours a night or not use it at all. This is for kids' safety from bad people, for spending time with family and friends, and for exercise and staying fit. I hope people understand what I'm saying and take action in their own lives and convince others to do the same.
797	799	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2, the editor of the local @CAPS4 paper, I am writing this letter to discuss the impact of computers on society. In my view, computers contribute significantly to society's learning and facilitate global communication. Computers enable society to learn about distant parts of the world, the history of various areas, and study animal species and their habitats without the need for physical travel. They make it easier to research hard - to - reach areas such as @PERSON1 and the cliffs of @CAPS5 in @LOCATION1, @CAPS6, and to explore the history of ancient cities like @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION2 of @CAPS5. They also assist in the study of animal species and their habitats, like the @CAPS9 @CAPS10, the hasin in @CAPS9, or the species called the @CAPS12 @CAPS13. In addition to learning, computers help people communicate with others worldwide. You can hold a conference on your computer while at home. It is more convenient to talk and ask questions with others while on vacation, and there is no need to incur travel expenses to have a meeting. You can conduct a meeting from home when you can't physically be present. It is easier to discuss important business matters and ask questions. You can communicate with people around the world via your computer without spending money on travel. In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in helping society learn and communicate globally.
798	800	1	2	Dear Newspaper, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives in @LOCATION1. We use them for research, writing papers, and entertainment, and in these aspects, they are extremely helpful. However, like most good things, excessive computer use can be harmful. While computers offer us knowledge, information about the outside world, and connections with people from all over, some of us become overly attached to the virtual world at the expense of our real lives. Many people don't even realize the negative impact of computers on them. For some, real life can be challenging and stressful, so they turn to the computer for a break, which is fine in moderation. But if this becomes a constant habit, it can turn into an addiction. Instead of relaxing through activities like taking a walk or reading a book, they choose the computer. This is detrimental to both their social life and mental well - being. In my opinion, our minds need exercise, such as solving puzzles or figuring out problems. Although playing challenging computer games does engage the brain to some extent, it can reach its full potential through other activities that don't strain the eyes as much. Regarding social life, computers can be a useful tool, but not if they become a distraction. This can happen when the computer becomes your constant companion. Nowadays, there are online games that allow interaction with others. This isn't necessarily bad, but if your entire social life revolves around these online acquaintances and you neglect real - life interactions with people you meet at school or on the street, it's a problem. Online communication is okay as long as you consider these online friends secondary and prioritize real - life relationships. As I mentioned at the beginning, computers are part of our daily lives, and that's not a bad thing as they can be very helpful. But it's essential to control our computer use in terms of what we do and how much time we spend on them. By doing so, we can achieve a more balanced lifestyle, which will make us, our friends, and our family happier.
799	801	1	2	Dear Newspaper people, as you may have seen on @ORGANIZATION1 news, more and more people believe that computers are having a negative impact on society. I agree with this view. I think they cause people to miss out on new experiences, meeting new people, and getting enough exercise. Time passes quickly, and we might not notice the opportunities slipping by. Have you ever spent an hour on the computer? It might feel like only @NUM1 minutes. Some people spend an entire day on it, missing out on a year's worth of new things. For example, new inventions like the iPod Nano with a camera might go unnoticed. There are also new activities to try, such as skydiving or bungee jumping, and new places to visit around the world, like @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, or even underwater. Just thinking about having a warm, freshly - baked cheese pizza in @LOCATION2 makes my mouth water. How many people do you know? Instead of just having online friends on Facebook or MySpace, you should go to the park and meet new people. Even visiting a family member's house allows for interaction. Everyone needs to interact with others. Even two - year - olds learn how to share by interacting with their peers. As adults, it's still important to know others and understand how they think. You might think your way of thinking is right and others' is wrong, but that's what interaction is all about. You may have seen on the news how many families have members with weight problems. Shows like “The Biggest Loser” are trying to help these people lose weight. What causes this? It could be due to poor diet or lack of exercise, and computers may be part of the problem. Many people spend @NUM2 minutes on the computer and only @NUM3 minutes exercising. A short walk around the block can burn at least @NUM4 calories, while some people would rather stay on the computer and gain those calories. Some deaths are caused by heart attacks, which can be due to plaque buildup or excessive weight. Instead of choosing healthy food like an apple, many Americans reach for junk food. I believe we should still use computers, but we should reduce our usage time, exercise more, and eat healthier. You might think that people won't listen to this advice, but we can at least inspire one person, and that person can inspire another. Little by little, we can help people lead better lives without being overly dependent on computers.
800	802	1	2	Dear local newspaper, the question on everyone's mind is whether computers benefit society. I used to think they didn't, but now I'm convinced they do. There are three main reasons for this. Firstly, they are an excellent source of information. Secondly, we live in a technologically advanced society, and thirdly, they allow us to keep in touch with people on the other side of the world. Computers are a valuable resource when it comes to gathering information. For example, in a recent social studies project, I had to use the computer to find information on the subject. When you can't go to the library, the computer provides the same information. It's also useful for finding maps to a particular place or phone numbers of stores. The computer has always been and will continue to be a great source of information. In the @DATE1, technology is a significant part of society. The first computers were huge and required cardboard cards to operate. Now, we have thin, small, and portable computers. Knowing how to use a computer is essential to keep up with the times. Are you going to let technology pass you by? Computers are one of the best ways to stay in touch with others. Making a call to someone across the world can skyrocket your phone bill, but on websites like Facebook, you can talk for free. A.I.M. is another free way to chat with people. Who wouldn't want to talk to their friends and family around the world for free? The reasons I've presented are valid and detailed. Technology is advancing like a train, and we shouldn't miss out on it. In conclusion, computers clearly offer numerous benefits to society, and we should embrace them.
801	803	1	2	In my view, computers bring more harm than good to society. People often use computers not for research but to check social media platforms like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. This excessive screen - time prevents them from interacting with the real world. They should go outside, spend time with family and friends, and experience life. Many individuals with idle time may create a @CAPS3 account or get addicted to games on it, spending excessive time on the computer. Our society should encourage people to use computers only for essential tasks such as checking emails, adding content to their iPods, and briefly checking @CAPS3 notifications. A fulfilling life cannot be achieved by sitting in front of a computer all day. One should live life to the fullest, like there's no tomorrow. This could involve watching a game with friends, going on a vacation with family, or traveling the world. We need to address this issue in our state. Our country's high inactivity rate is a result of people staying indoors and being glued to their computers. If people reduce computer use, we could become one of the fittest countries.
802	804	1	2	Computers have a negative impact on people. They lead to various problems in life. When using a computer, one is mostly sitting still with little movement, unlike activities like running, dancing, or walking with friends. Prolonged computer use can cause weight gain. Another issue is that computers make people less social. People can get addicted to games or social media platforms like Facebook/@CAPS1 and spend all their time on them. This reduces face - to - face interactions with friends at school and in real - life settings. Moreover, computers can be dangerous. When chatting with strangers online, they may obtain personal information and cause harm. There's also a risk of getting a virus in the system. I know this from personal experience as I was once addicted to a game. Clearly, the negative effects of computers are significant, and people should be cautious about their use.
803	805	1	2	I firmly believe that students today spend too much time on the computer and not enough on family, school, and exercise. Many students, about @PERCENT1, go straight to the computer after school. Firstly, kids rarely spend time with their families. They come home and sit on the computer all day, failing to show appreciation for what their parents do. For example, young kids should thank their parents daily, but often they don't. Secondly, students need to focus more on school. Around @PERCENT2 of students have accounts on Facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Instead of using these platforms, they should use educational websites like @ORGANIZATION1 for research. I often hear students in the school halls talking about computer activities, and it's concerning that many don't complete their homework on time. Finally, students don't exercise enough. A famous baseball player said one should be fit. Approximately @PERCENT3 of students are overweight because they don't exercise. The only exercise they get is in @CAPS6.E. class, and even then, they get tired quickly. Students should get off the computer, spend time with family, focus on schoolwork, and exercise regularly to stay healthy.
804	806	1	2	I agree with @CAPS2's view that computers are beneficial. Computers can assist people in various ways. They help teachers, students, employees, and parents with their work. They also offer amusement through games, music, and videos on the internet. Contacting others is another great advantage. People can use email for business and personal communication, and social media platforms like Myspace, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 allow for easy interaction. When writing for the newspaper, one doesn't hand - write; the computer is used for work. However, people need to limit their computer time. Computers have been around for decades and will continue to be used in the future. Initially, they were mainly for work, but now people of all ages use them for different purposes. Overall, computers can have a positive impact when used appropriately.
805	807	1	2	"I believe that while computers are a great achievement of technology and science, they are ruining our society. Although they allow us to explore the world and chat with friends, there are many negative aspects. Firstly, excessive computer use can lead to obesity. Scientists have found that the more time one spends online, the higher the chance of becoming obese, which is not good for @LOCATION1. People often say they'll be on for a short time but end up spending days on games like ""@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"", and those with important work may not get a chance to use the computer. It's a waste of time that could be spent on outdoor activities. Secondly, when chatting online, you never know who you're really talking to. A study showed that what seems like a conversation with a friend could be a perverted @NUM1 - year - old. There's also a risk of viruses being embedded in the system, which can be costly to fix. Additionally, some people share links to disgusting websites. Finally, computers cause stress. Social media feuds can affect school grades, and @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people who join social pages experience a decline in grades. Long - term computer use by parents can lead to tiredness and reduced work quality. In fact, @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1's population has stress issues related to computers. Computers aren't all bad, but they need to be used correctly."
806	808	1	2	"Hello, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. Do you think computers have a great impact on people? I firmly believe that using a computer does have a significant effect on individuals. People often spend an entire day on platforms like Facebook, MySpace, and other websites, looking up word definitions, directions, and so on. This excessive computer use can harm people's eyesight and social skills. Some individuals spend up to @NUM1 hours on the computer. Staring at a @NUM2 - inch screen for extended periods can damage eyesight, potentially leading to the need for glasses or even blindness. Consider a life where you rarely talk to others, whether it's a romantic interest or your own family. If you waste time on sites like Facebook, you may only communicate via instant messages. Instead, you should go out and engage in enjoyable activities with others. Regarding MapIt.com, don't be lazy and waste @NUM3 minutes each day just getting directions. Use a real map! Also, relying on free online resources for @LOCATION1? It's better to use a proper dictionary. In conclusion, while some may claim computers have a ""great effect,"" in reality, they offer shortcuts that can have negative consequences for people."
807	809	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, computers do not contribute positively to society. They lead people to become antisocial, unhealthy, and engage in negative behaviors. The internet is highly addictive. I used to spend three hours online every day. As a result, I got no exercise at all. Moreover, I was tempted to eat unhealthy snacks while online. This made me extremely unhealthy; I gained nine pounds in just one week. Now, I have dietary restrictions. I can no longer enjoy treats like sweets or physical activities like running. In the future, I may develop arthritis in my hands because I spent hours typing. I also used the computer in the dark, which has led to my need for contacts. Using the computer is one of the most detrimental choices one can make. I spent so much time on the computer that I was unable to socialize. I missed out on numerous activities with my friends and family because I was preoccupied with the online world. I rarely talked to anyone except through email. I lost many friends and close family members. My pets died because I neglected them. I had no interest in doing anything other than going online. I also performed poorly in college and job interviews. To this day, I have no social life and no job because I focused more on interacting with the computer than with people. Computers also encourage illegal activities. Many drugs and weapons are purchased online. People commit violence or suicide due to online gossip. There is also a lack of care for nature, and people may steal to afford new technology. Car robberies often occur when technology is left in vehicles. Online poker leads to gambling, and people hack bank accounts. Prostitution is facilitated through online chats, and sex - offenders use the internet to pose as potential dates. Terrorists use the internet to communicate. In conclusion, computers are a menace to society. They turn people into criminals and have ruined my life. They should be disposed of before they cause irreparable damage to the world.
808	810	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper, I am convinced that computers have a very positive impact on people. Computers can assist children with their homework and enable people to learn new things. They also provide various means of communication with friends. For kids, computers are essential for homework. At @ORGANIZATION1, students receive a project almost every month. These projects require pictures, information, and a neat presentation. Computers are the most effective way to obtain pictures, gather information, and create a tidy output. In science class, students get a packet of homework for each new unit, and completing it without a computer would be extremely difficult. Computers are also a great source of learning. There are numerous educational websites available. For example, if you are traveling to a new place, you can search for information about it on the internet. Even when reading a book and encountering an unfamiliar word, you can look it up. Communication with friends is another important aspect, and computers offer multiple options such as Facebook, @CAPS1, and video - chat. You can use Facebook to chat with friends or video - chat to have a more personal conversation. These are great ways to share vacation pictures or talk to friends in different countries. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They are helpful for projects and homework, learning new knowledge, and communicating with friends. Computers are truly remarkable.
809	811	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, although computers are useful, they have a negative impact on people. With the advancement of computer technology, many people are spending less time outdoors. They are so engrossed in computers that they neglect to spend quality time with their friends and family. Obesity is also a significant problem. Computers are preventing kids from experiencing the joys of the outdoors. Many children, especially in @DATE1, stay inside all day playing video games instead of going to the park or participating in sports. They are missing out on the fun of outdoor camps. Family relationships are also being affected. Due to computers, parents and children are not spending enough time together, leading to a breakdown in family bonds. It is often the case that either the son or daughter becomes so attached to the computer that they lack emotional and physical contact with the family. Health is another major concern. Teenagers and adults sit at the computer for long periods, playing games or surfing the web, while also eating unhealthy food. Over time, their health deteriorates, and they gain weight, eventually becoming obese and unhealthy. This is a widespread problem in America. As technology continues to advance, the youth will become increasingly unhealthy. In conclusion, computers have a very negative impact on people. People are spending less time outdoors, family relationships are being damaged, and people's health is at risk. If this trend continues, America's future will be in jeopardy.
810	812	1	2	"Some people use computers to learn about distant places, stay updated on important news, and make their work look neater. These are some of the positive benefits that computers offer. People around the world use computers to research other locations, and computers can provide photographs of the places they are studying. For instance, I once had a social studies project on the @PERSON1. I had never heard of this place before, but thanks to the computer, I googled ""@PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1"" and got all the necessary information and photos about the mountain @CAPS1. Now, I know where it is and what it looks like. Secondly, computers keep us informed about the latest news from around the world. I remember when the earthquake in Haiti occurred, my grandmother didn't know about it until she checked @ORGANIZATION1 online to find out when, where, and the magnitude of the earthquake on the Richter scale. Also, I wasn't a great hand - writer. When given the choice to write an assignment by hand or on the computer, and knowing that neatness, elaboration, and fluency were part of the grading criteria, I chose the computer. The result was a neat assignment with pictures. In conclusion, computers have a very positive impact on people worldwide, whether it's for obtaining information, staying updated on news, or making work look neater."
811	813	1	2	Dear local newspaper, is there any child or teen aged between eight and seventeen who doesn't love going on the computer? Social media platforms like Myspace, Facebook, and instant messaging services are like online hangouts. Kids everywhere log on and stay on until their parents make them log off. I firmly believe that computers have a major impact on people. Firstly, people don't get enough exercise as they spend too much time sitting in front of the computer. Secondly, they don't interact with others in real - life. Thirdly, kids can be sneaky; they may sneak onto inappropriate websites even when they're supposed to be doing research. Online websites and games seem to hypnotize people, making them stay online for hours. Most parents think it's good for their children to use the computer for an hour of research. However, kids may sneak off to play online games or visit unauthorized websites. Sometimes, the best thing to do is to get some fresh air and interact with others. But with websites that keep people connected for more than two hours, they miss out on fresh air and real - life interactions. Often, people get so used to the computer that they forget what the world outside is like. People grow up fast, and some start to eat, drink, and even sleep at the computer. They stay at the computer, eat there, don't get enough exercise, start to gain weight, and may eventually become so reliant on the computer that they rarely leave it. Clearly, computers have a major negative impact on people in terms of lack of interaction, insufficient exercise, and kids' tendency to access unauthorized websites.
812	814	1	2	Dear [Recipient], I don't think people should use computers as much as they currently do. Computers have an addictive quality. There are people gaining weight because they sit on the computer chatting all day. There are also malicious individuals on the internet who disguise themselves; for example, an adult man may pretend to be a [Number] - year - old boy. Moreover, nowadays, people are using the computer as a source of reading instead of books. I firmly believe that computers are ruining many people's lives. To begin with, most people today are becoming overweight either because they watch too much [TV - related thing] or they sit on the computer and eat all day. Once you start using the computer, it's hard to stop, especially if you're multitasking by eating while using it. The problem is that people think it's better to sit at home than to go out and enjoy nature while exercising. It's really not good that people don't get off the computer and start living life. Secondly, not everyone online is who they claim to be. There are false accounts on platforms like [Platform 1] or [Platform 2]. Men may claim to be something they're not. With all the picture - posting, there are risks. One should always be careful. Finally, people today use the computer to read books instead of going to the library or bookstores. I think these bookstores will go out of business due to current technology. When I was young, when I said I was going to read a book, I meant a physical book, not an online one. People need to cut down on their electronics use. In conclusion, I think computers are a waste of time. There's no reason to be on the computer instead of exercising. Everyone should stay away from the bad people online, and we should start using normal books again. Computers should stop taking over our world and only be used when necessary.
813	815	1	2	Dear Newspaper, computers today have a negative impact on people. The time available for daily exercise is reduced, family time is decreased, and some of the costs associated with computers are extremely high. Owning a computer is not a good idea. Is sitting around all day your definition of a workout? A person who doesn't use the computer for long periods or frequently is healthier than someone who is constantly on the computer. I recall seeing a commercial about [Number] children and how their computer use as “tweens” affected their lives later on. Not only will you become unhealthy, but there's also a high probability of becoming anti - social. Many kids and even adults spend precious family time playing games like The Sims, creating their ideal virtual families. However, this is unacceptable as spending time with family is precious. When asked about computer use, [Person] said, “You could easily become addicted with just [Number] turns!” Once you're addicted, both you and your family suffer. Your family will stop inviting you to places. You don't want to lose the people who will be there for you. Then there's the issue of computer viruses. Your computer might shout, “[Warning]!” You've got a virus that's deleting your hardware, including your school essays, important bookmarked websites, and sentimental photographs. Do you know how much it would cost to try to retrieve this data? It would be a large amount. You may think, “This couldn't happen to me,” but it can. Storing things on a computer is riskier than having a hard copy, and it can also save you money. Additionally, computers use electricity when plugged in. When you get your electric bill, don't be surprised as computers can be very costly. In conclusion, computers are an unnecessary part of life. They harm your overall health, reduce family time, and cost a lot of money. You can survive without a computer, but without good health, you're in trouble. I hope you'll consider my points.
814	816	1	2	Dear [Recipient], I am a student at [Organization 3] Middle School in [Location]. Recently, you published an article about whether computers are good or bad for people. I am writing to say that computers are beneficial to people everywhere. Firstly, computers greatly help with hand - eye coordination. People who play computer games become more skillful at using their hands and eyes together. According to [Organization 1] and others from [Organization 4] in [Location 1], “Computers help hand - eye coordination [Percentage] more than putting your son or daughter on the football team.” Computer games can help kids improve their accuracy in sports - related skills. Clearly, computers contribute to the development of better hand - eye coordination. Secondly, computers help people learn new things. Although some may think this is false, it's true. A recent study at [Organization 2] shows that [Percentage] of schools in [Location] use computers for research. For example, when I needed to write a paper about [Person 2], I used Wikipedia on the internet as it was faster than searching for a book. So, the computer is a useful learning tool. Finally, the computer is an excellent way to communicate online. It's better than [Phone - related thing] because it's faster and more convenient than calling someone. It's also a lot cheaper as you only have [Number] payment a month, unlike the phone bill which can add up. According to [Person 1] or the [Organization 2] in [Location 1], “[Phone - related thing] is obsolete now; with the internet, people can chat at lightning speed.” Using email or social media like Facebook is much better than playing phone tag. In conclusion, computers are necessary as they develop hand - eye coordination, assist people in learning, and are a great means of communication.
815	817	1	2	Dear [Organization 1], there has been a recent concern among experts that computers [Month] have negative effects on society. I disagree. Computers make life easier, teach us about far - away places and people, and allow us to chat with others. I believe computers can only benefit society. To start with, computers simplify life. You can use programs to plan your life. For instance, there are programs that let you enter the places you need to go and remind you when it's time for an event, so you'll never forget your schedule. When doing research, computers save a lot of time. If you're doing a school project on types of cars, you can enter “cars” on [Organization 3] and get millions of results, which is much faster than going to the library and looking for a book. Moreover, there are programs for people with special needs to write. Programs like [Organization 2] Word have voice commands, allowing people who can't write due to blindness or a disability to speak what they want to write, and it will appear on the screen instantly. Clearly, computers significantly ease people's lives. In addition to making life easier, computers teach us about far - away places and people. Computer pictures give us a first - hand view of distant places. According to Time Magazine, a person can learn [Percentage] more by seeing a place than by reading an encyclopedia. Blogs also offer insights into how people live in those places and how they feel about it. E - books on the internet provide a wealth of information, including encyclopedias with statistics and events of far - off places. For example, if you're planning a trip, you can learn about where to eat and be entertained. Lastly, computers enable us to communicate with people around the world. You can talk to friends; for example, I remember when I moved to [Location 1] [Number] years ago, I missed my friends in [Location 2] and used video chat to talk to them. Businesses can also hold meetings around the world without traveling. For example, two companies can make a trading agreement with just a click of a mouse, saving time and money. You can also talk to others online to understand what's happening. In conclusion, computers are beneficial to society as they simplify life, educate us about far - away places and people, and facilitate global communication, opening up new opportunities in the world.
816	818	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, you believe that computers are detrimental to society. In my view, many people share concerns about the negative impacts of computers. However, I firmly think that computers are beneficial. They contribute to the development of typing skills. Moreover, they are highly useful for cropping and editing pictures and facilitate the process of finding information. First, computers are extremely helpful for improving typing skills. Those who do not use computers may take six years to achieve a certain level of proficiency, while younger individuals can acquire typing skills very quickly. In fact, @PERCENT1 of teens can type within a minute, which would take others @NUM1 minutes. Computers have a significant positive impact on people's typing abilities. Secondly, computers enable easy and cost - effective picture editing. Instead of using an expensive digital device for editing, one can perform the same tasks for free on a computer. Finally, computers make information retrieval faster. For example, when working on a project about @CAPS4, instead of going to the library and spending money on a book, one can simply go to google.com and type in @CAPS4 to access a vast amount of information promptly. In conclusion, I am convinced that computers are a remarkable invention. They simplify information - finding, enhance typing skills, and make photo cropping and editing much easier. I sincerely hope you will take my suggestions seriously.
817	819	1	2	Some experts worry that people are spending excessive time on computers and less time on activities like exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with loved ones. However, I hold the opposite view. There are several reasons for my stance. Firstly, there will come a day (@MONTH1) when you need to look something up on the computer. It could be for job - hunting, planning a vacation, or paying a bill. Secondly, many jobs now require online applications. For instance, stores like Stop and Shop, Price Right, and Save - A - Lot accept job applications via computer. This is also beneficial for society as it reduces paper usage and helps save trees. Thirdly, computers allow people to communicate online. Whether you need to contact a family member, an old friend, meet new people, or if you prefer not to talk on the phone, the computer provides a great alternative. I have presented all the reasons why I think using a computer is good: the need to look up information, applying for jobs online, and the ability to communicate online. These are all significant advantages. I hope you will consider my opinion.
818	820	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, my name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and I'd like to share why I'm somewhat opposed to excessive computer use. There are numerous activities in the real world, places to visit, and opportunities to go on cruise ships. There are many engaging activities you can partake in. You can play basketball or handball, hang out with friends. You can also take a morning drive in your car and feel the breeze on your face. There are also many places you can visit. You can drop by your friends' houses, visit your girlfriend or boyfriend, or spend time with your family. Stop being reliant on computers; they won't enhance your life. Cruise ships offer a great way to travel far. You can visit destinations like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1, and many others. It's a lot of fun on a cruise ship. You can enjoy the captain's dinner, meet new people, and see amazing sights. In conclusion, people should stop being lazy and glued to their computers. They should go out and have fun in the world while they can.
819	821	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are extremely important to our society in today's era. Computers play a crucial role in communication. They allow people to stay in touch with family and friends online. In a world where many people travel far for work to support their families, computers enable communication through email and video chat. This not only makes people happy but also keeps them informed about their loved ones' lives. It can even help reunite families, for example, by enabling someone to search for a long - lost brother. Secondly, computers are vital for learning. They support online schooling and provide a wealth of educational resources. Lastly, computers serve as a source of entertainment. You can search for funny videos, download music, or watch full episodes of TV shows and movies. If you're following a TV series and miss an episode, you can easily find it on the computer. Computers are one of the most widely used tools globally. Almost every family has at least one, and some have more than @NUM1. We rely on computers for various purposes, such as maintaining family connections, facilitating learning, and providing entertainment. In conclusion, computers are an indispensable part of our world and contribute significantly to our lives.
820	822	1	2	I firmly believe that one can never spend enough time on the computer because it has numerous positive impacts on our lives. Computers are a great source of knowledge. If you need to find an important fact, date, or time, you can simply look it up. The internet is an endless repository of information, and you can learn almost anything by searching on the computer. They also facilitate communication. You can talk to people via @CAPS1 - mail or @CAPS2, meet new people in chat rooms, or communicate with distant friends and relatives. With a webcam, you can even see the person you're talking to, something a phone can't offer. As a source of entertainment, computers are unparalleled. You can play a variety of online games, download console games, watch full episodes of @CAPS3 shows and movies. If you miss an episode of a TV series, you can easily find it. YouTube is a great platform for watching random videos, following famous YouTubers, or even posting your own videos. There are also countless programs on the computer. Some are for fun, like Paint and Flash, while others are important, such as Word or Notepad. These programs are both useful and enjoyable to use and can assist you in real - life situations. While exercise and nature are important for health, the benefits of computers far outweigh the potential drawbacks. Computers improve our lives in so many ways. Don't you agree that computers are more of a boon than a bane?
821	823	1	2	Some experts worry that people are spending too much time on computers and not enough time enjoying nature and going outdoors. In my view, people should use computers, but in moderation. It can be useful to use the computer to chat with friends or search for new information. However, some people become addicted to computer games or chatting with friends all day. Another reason to go outside is that there are more things to enjoy, such as sports, tag, and other activities. Instead of chatting with a friend on the computer, you could go to the park or invite them over. I also believe that experts are right because being outdoors allows people to learn about nature and how to do practical things. My first reason for advocating less computer use is the risk of addiction to games and other features. While it's okay to use the computer occasionally, excessive use is not advisable. It's better to go outside, where there is fresh air. If you have a dog, take it for a walk, or go for a walk with friends. My second reason is that outdoor activities like playing sports or running around are more beneficial than sitting in front of a computer. You could go to the park to play basketball or baseball. There are countless fun things to do outside. You could also try out for a sport at school. That way, you'll always have something to do when you're bored, rather than staying home all day. The last reason I prefer nature over computers is that real - life learning is more effective. Your dad could teach you how to build a chimney or how to use a lawnmower to earn money. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, we should balance our time between them and the outdoor world to lead a healthier and more fulfilling life.
822	824	1	2	"Dear editor, I've heard that you're seeking citizens' opinions on whether computers are good or bad. In my opinion, computers are bad, and I'd like to explain my reasons in the hope of persuading you to agree with me. The outdoors smells wonderful today. I can smell the flowers, the grass, and so much more. My first reason for believing that computers are bad is that excessive computer use prevents people from fully enjoying nature. Nature is beautiful, with colorful foliage, green grass, and sometimes rainbows. You can take a walk under the moonlight and just be yourself. In other words, nature is extremely pleasant, and we should make an effort to enjoy it. If we don't enjoy nature now, it might be too late. Soon, it will turn rainy, and after fall comes winter. Winter is not pleasant; it's cold. You have to shovel the driveway and your car, which can be very tiring. The upside is that you can get some exercise from these chores. My next reason is that people who spend all their time on computers don't exercise enough. Exercise is a great way to have fun, and it's also essential for staying healthy. If you don't exercise, you can become unhealthy and sick. I have a friend who spends all his time on the computer, and his body has become weaker. There are many ways to exercise, such as biking, running, walking, rowing, climbing a mountain, etc. The possibilities are endless. When you exercise in the park, you might meet new people. For example, you could have a conversation like this: ""Yo, sup man?"" ""Not much, you?"" ""Not much, just looking around for some exercise."" ""Same here."" You never know who you'll meet in the park. I met a friend in the park, and I wouldn't have met him if I was inside on the computer. In conclusion, computers are bad because they keep us from enjoying nature, exercising, and interacting with others."
823	825	1	2	Dear local [CAPS1], I believe that computers are beneficial for people. One reason is that kids may need to write essays for school. Teachers often prefer students to type their essays. When writing an essay, kids need to gather information, and computers can help with that. Another reason is that kids may need to look up important things. For instance, they may have to fill out online applications as they get older. High - school students in grades [NUM1] or [NUM2] often look up colleges they want to attend. Additionally, kids may have emails. When they check their emails, they might be seeing if their parents have written to them. Some kids who don't live near their family use emails to stay in touch. In conclusion, computers offer valuable assistance to kids in their academic and personal lives, such as essay - writing, research, and communication, which is why they are good to have.
824	826	1	2	"Dear [CAPS1], as a student at the local middle school, I've witnessed how technology, especially computers, is fully utilized. Computers have helped us write essays more efficiently and complete research assignments. However, I firmly believe that the constant use of computers has a negative impact on people. Firstly, computers impede interpersonal connections. Although platforms like [ORGANIZATION1] help us stay in touch with old college friends, nothing can replace face - to - face communication. From text alone, we can't pick up on subtle meanings or wit. People are increasingly replacing in - person meetings with online networking. The technological revolution has brought about games like [ORGANIZATION2]. These games are highly addictive. While society often mocks those who spend too much time on these games, it's a serious issue. A recent study by [ORGANIZATION3] students found that ""1 out of 2 teenagers who play computer games do not get the recommended amount of daily exercise."" These games are so absorbing that they consume all of a person's free time. This is dangerous as gaming addiction can lead to delusions, feelings of inadequacy, and obesity. As a society, we're realizing that what was once considered a great invention is actually harmful. Staring at a backlit screen for hours on end will definitely cause eyesight to deteriorate. Loss of eyesight is just one of the negative health impacts of computers. As mentioned, obesity is also a problem. When combined with bad eyesight, vitamin deficiency, and a negative outlook, it creates a significant issue. All the diseases caused by excessive computer use can be mitigated by reducing computer time and exercising. Naturally, as a species, we weren't meant to spend so much time in a fixed position. This sedentary lifestyle is causing major health problems. In conclusion, the overuse of computers robs us of time, damages our health, and hinders our social interactions, making them a negative influence on people and their well - being."
825	827	1	2	I believe that computers have a positive impact on people. They are very important to society. You can interact with your family and friends through online chat or video calls. Computers are also useful for job applications. You can search for jobs you're interested in. They can help with exercises and writing essays. If you have a laptop, you can take it anywhere as it can connect wirelessly to the internet. You can look up information for your homework or other needs on the internet. You can even buy things without having to go to the store. In conclusion, computers offer various benefits such as facilitating communication, aiding in education and work, and providing convenience in shopping, which is why they have a positive effect on people.
826	828	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, computers have significantly assisted numerous individuals in their knowledge acquisition journey. However, many overlook the adverse impacts of these devices. Computers simplify research, enabling quick and efficient data organization. They also facilitate seamless communication. Yet, alongside these benefits, there are notable drawbacks.  Online chat rooms offer a rapid communication channel but can be perilous. An increasing number of children are spending their time on computers instead of engaging in outdoor activities and interacting with friends and family. Both kids and adults frequent chat rooms. Children use them to communicate with friends, make plans, and catch up with relatives. Adults, too, utilize chat rooms; some for legitimate work - related discussions, such as coordinating office tasks and sharing information about paid bills, which helps employees stay informed about office affairs.  Computers have other useful features. They can quickly retrieve information, which is invaluable for school projects. Moreover, they can organize this data into graphs and presentations using software like Microsoft PowerPoint. Typing on a computer can improve hand - eye coordination, and it's a great alternative for those with poor penmanship, making assignments easier to read for both students and teachers.  Nonetheless, there are disadvantages. More kids are spending their free time on computers rather than exercising outdoors, leading to a less active lifestyle. The use of abbreviated language in chat rooms and texting is harming children's reading and writing skills. Chat rooms can also be dangerous as people, including adults pretending to be teenagers, may share false information about themselves and attempt to extract sensitive details like addresses, phone numbers, and school information from kids.  In conclusion, computers have both advantages and disadvantages. I firmly believe that if people can strike a balance, there will be more consensus about the role of computers. In my view, while computers are useful, they can also be dangerous. If children are more cautious online and spend more time outdoors, there will be less controversy, and parents will be less worried about their children's safety and health.
827	829	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are an incredible technological advancement in our lives. They offer substantial assistance to many people and various professions. For instance, school - going kids can use computers to look up information for worksheet questions. In the professional realm, the police, @CAPS1.W.A.T, and @ORGANIZATION1 rely on computers. The police and @CAPS1.W.A.T use them to track the locations of individuals, while @ORGANIZATION1 uses computers to plan attacks or defenses. Without computers, we might not have found @CAPS3 @CAPS4.  However, computers also have their downsides. Hackers pose a threat, and there are individuals who are overly obsessed with computers, to the extent that they seem inseparable from them. This obsession is often a result of parental negligence. Excessive computer use makes people lazy and overweight as they prefer to stay glued to the screen.  On the positive side, computers allow people to reconnect with long - lost family and friends. They also control a vast array of important aspects, including nuclear bombs, security systems, secret files, satellites, and much more. In many ways, they are at the core of modern life.  People shouldn't be overly concerned about children who spend all day on computers. It is primarily the individual's fault for ruining their own life and the parents' fault for not controlling their children's computer use or enrolling them in sports. Spending excessive time on the computer can lead to a lack of friends at school and a one - track focus on the device.  I recall a situation where a father, who was once a lively and popular kid, used to mock nerds and get into fights. But when he saw his son becoming a computer - dependent nerd, he tried to help. This is an example of good parenting. Parents should step in when they notice their children becoming overly attached to the computer. In conclusion, while computers have their merits, proper usage and parental guidance are essential to avoid the negative impacts.
828	830	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, computers have a significant positive influence on people. Despite the fact that they may lead to reduced outdoor activity, their benefits are undeniable.  Computers are effective in teaching hand - eye coordination. There are numerous websites on the internet that offer typing lessons for kids. Typing helps children learn the alphabet, recognize letter shapes, and familiarize themselves with the keyboard layout. Additionally, there are interactive software programs that assist those with dyslexia or letter - jumbling issues by vocalizing the typed letters.  Computers are also extremely convenient. For students, they provide instant answers to any question with just a click. There's no need to spend money on books for research as online resources are available for free. Moreover, it's convenient for both teachers and employees as papers can be sent via email, which is much easier to handle than hand - written documents.  In terms of communication, computers enable video chatting and online conversations. Many families have members living in different locations, and computers allow them to see each other online without leaving their home state. Families with military members can also stay in touch, as they can see each other online even if they haven't met in person for years. Additionally, online teaching and learning are convenient for busy people like students and teachers.  In conclusion, computers have a positive effect. They enhance hand - eye coordination, offer online chat facilities, and are highly convenient. So, the next time you plan to visit the library for research, consider doing it online from the comfort of your home.
829	831	1	2	I am convinced that having a computer in a household is a smart decision. Computers offer a wide range of activities, including gaming, learning, and communication.  Playing games on a computer is a lot of fun. There is a vast variety of games available, from card and board games to @NUM1 games. You can play alone, but it's often more enjoyable to play with friends. However, gaming is just one aspect of what a computer can offer.  Computers are also excellent learning tools. They can transport you to places you've never experienced, whether due to lack of knowledge or financial constraints. You can learn about different climates, such as places that are sunny all year round and others with different weather patterns. They can also teach you about animals. Scientists have dedicated their lives to studying animals, and they've shared their findings on the internet, allowing you to educate yourself. Moreover, typing on a computer can improve hand - eye coordination, which is beneficial for sports like football, baseball, and basketball.  Another great advantage of computers is communication. You can choose to use voice chat or instant messaging. While chatting, you can make new friends who share your interests and hobbies. You can freely express your ideas and feelings, whether it's to relieve stress or to share a potentially famous idea.  In conclusion, computers make gaming, learning, and communication easier. This is why I firmly believe that having a computer at home is a wonderful thing.
830	832	1	2	Dear editor, I am of the opinion that computers are highly beneficial to people. They play a crucial role in assisting with work, homework, and a variety of other tasks. Computers can quickly access information, organize data, and create professional - looking documents. For students, they are a valuable resource for research and project completion. In the workplace, they streamline processes and improve efficiency.  In conclusion, the positive impact of computers on people's work, homework, and other aspects of life is undeniable. Their ability to simplify tasks and enhance productivity makes them an essential tool in modern society.
831	833	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe spending excessive time on the computer is unwise. When one sits at the computer, they often waste time searching aimlessly or playing games. This sedentary behavior is detrimental as it prevents individuals from engaging in more beneficial activities like exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with others.  Exercising is crucial for physical health. Spending too much time on the computer means missing out on opportunities to jog and shed the weight gained from eating. Jogging allows one to experience the real world rather than being confined to the virtual one on the screen. Although computer games can be addictive and seem fun, playing a real - world sport like soccer is far more rewarding. Soccer requires mental and physical exertion, which is much better than sitting in a daze in front of a computer for long periods. Outdoor games like tag or hide - and - seek are more enjoyable and engaging than computer games.  Nature offers beauty and refreshment that computers cannot match. While computers have their uses, they cannot provide the fresh air, warm breeze, or the sight of living animals that nature does. Instead of being on the computer, especially during pleasant weather, one should go outside, play with pets, or take a swim.  Interacting with people in person is also essential. When chatting on the computer, it's impossible to read someone's expressions, which can lead to misunderstandings. People should prioritize spending time with family and friends, having conversations, and making new connections in the real world rather than relying solely on typed words on a screen.  In conclusion, people should not spend most of their precious time on the computer. There are numerous benefits to exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with others in person. I firmly believe that being outside and engaging in real - world activities is far better than being glued to a computer screen. So, get off the computer and start exploring the world!
832	834	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the average teenager spends @NUM1 hours on a computer daily. This excessive computer use has led to several negative consequences. People are exercising less, missing out on the beauty of nature, and neglecting their relationships with family and friends.  The over - reliance on computers has contributed to a decrease in physical activity. A recent poll shows that @NUM2 in every @NUM3 @CAPS5 is overweight. In @DATE5, only @PERCENT2 of the @CAPS6 population was obese, but by @DATE6, this number has skyrocketed to @PERCENT1. In the past, when electronics were less popular, kids regularly played outdoor games. Now, it's rare for kids to put down the computer and go outside to play. Computers have a negative impact on people's health by reducing their exercise levels.  Computers have also made people less involved with nature. Our society no longer takes the time to appreciate the natural world. They miss out on the cool breeze on an @DATE4 @TIME1, the crashing waves on a hot @DATE3 @TIME1, the beautiful foliage in @DATE2, or the feeling of snow on a chilly @DATE1 @TIME1. Instead, they prefer to sit at a computer for @NUM4 hours, ignoring the wonders of nature.  Furthermore, computers are harming people's relationships. For example, @NUM5 - year - old @CAPS7 would rather talk to his girlfriend on the computer than spend time with his @CAPS8. Social networking sites can be filled with drama and misunderstandings, which can easily ruin friendships. Kids often prioritize watching videos on the computer over visiting their grandparents.  In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on people's lives. They contribute to obesity, prevent people from enjoying nature, and damage relationships. People should reduce their computer use and focus on exercising, enjoying nature, and spending time with loved ones.
833	835	1	2	When I was a kid, I often wondered why my parents didn't let me play on the computer all day. I think it's unfair because computers offer numerous benefits. For kids, computers can teach hand - eye coordination. We can also chat with friends through webcams and use computers for school research projects.  As an adult, computers are equally useful. You can keep in touch with others through online chatting, such as webcam conversations or using @CAPS6 (AOL Instant Messaging). You can even work online by setting up your work at home or teaching your boss how to do it. If you're an adult who didn't go to college at @NUM1 because of work, you can now attend school online from the comfort of your bed.  For kids my age, playing online games with friends is a favorite pastime. However, parents usually limit our computer time, only allowing us to use it for school projects. But besides playing games, we also want to learn about places like @LOCATION1 or the @CAPS7 @CAPS8.  Computers also offer practical benefits. You can book a hotel online instead of going to the hotel in person. When going on a vacation, you can watch movies on your laptop during the flight. For example, when I take a @NUM2 - hour flight, watching episodes of @CAPS9 @PERSON1 makes the time pass quickly, and it only seems like @NUM3 hours.  In conclusion, having a computer is a great advantage. You can do a variety of things on it, including schoolwork, entertainment, and online shopping. It also allows you to connect with others and learn about the world. Now, it's up to you to decide whether having a computer is a good thing or not.
834	836	1	2	Dear local newspaper @CAPS1, I firmly believe that kids should be allowed to use computers. Computers have enabled me to connect with my relatives across the globe. I have relatives in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, and @LOCATION2. I communicate with them via email, and through these connections, I learned about my mother's whereabouts in @LOCATION2.  Thanks to the computer, I also discovered that @LOCATION3 has one of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 in The @CAPS5. I asked my mother if I could go to @LOCATION3, and she agreed. My sister and I visited our family there and saw the @CAPS6. It was exactly as I imagined, tall and covered with trees, with birds singing and squirrels climbing. The most surprising thing was a house for sale on top of the mountain. We now rent that house every time we visit, all thanks to the computer.  Moreover, the internet allows you to look up information about people. I heard that Criss Rock almost died, but when I looked it up on my laptop, I found that he was getting a divorce instead. This shows how useful the internet is for fact - checking.  In conclusion, computers are a valuable tool for learning about the world and connecting with others. People should have access to computers to explore new places, learn new things, and stay in touch with loved ones. I hope you make a wise decision regarding the use of computers.
835	837	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, the computer, that big rectangular black or white box with lights and beeps, was a brilliant invention. It offers a multitude of benefits. You can learn a new language on it, use Skype to talk to @CAPS1 either on the web or phone (although you have to pay @MONEY1). You can surf the web, have a laugh on YouTube, and do online shopping on eBay or Amazon, saving you the trouble of going to physical stores (though you have to wait for delivery). You can also rent movies on Netflix, avoiding late fees and long drives to the movie store.  If you own a @CAPS3 or have a built - in camera on your laptop or netbook, you can video - chat with @CAPS1 and family around the world. For those who love video games, @CAPS5 ~~@CAPS6's allow you to download games like The Sims and Spore. MACs also have great features such as the Finder, Safari, and Dashboard.  When it comes to choosing a computer, you have options. You can choose between @CAPS8 and @CAPS6, but the decision is yours, not @CAPS12's. You can also pick between a laptop, a desktop, or a netbook. A laptop is ideal if you're often on the go, especially for business trips. A desktop is suitable if you're mostly at home and do online work. A netbook is great for travel and can be used anywhere, and it usually comes with a built - in @CAPS3.  In conclusion, computers offer a wide range of functions and features. Whether you're interested in learning, communicating, gaming, or working, there's a computer that suits your needs. So, go out and make an investment in a computer today!
836	838	1	2	Dear newspaper writers, I believe that different websites have different effects on people. For example, @ORGANIZATION1 provides news about global events. Other websites with various games may be inappropriate for some individuals as some of the games are not very suitable. Most educational websites are designed to assist people in learning. A person can acquire a great deal of knowledge using a computer. One can buy and sell items and access a wide range of resources on a single website. A computer can serve multiple purposes. In conclusion, the diverse nature of websites and the capabilities of computers offer both benefits and potential drawbacks, highlighting the importance of using them judiciously.
837	839	1	2	Computers are among the most remarkable technological advancements. They are not only entertaining but also highly beneficial to society. Firstly, computers are an excellent means of communication. Whether it's instant - messaging, email, video - messaging, or through services like @ORGANIZATION1, they connect people. On @DATE1, I realized that computers also offer numerous learning opportunities. There are countless websites with information on a vast array of topics, from simple tasks like baking cookies to complex inquiries such as the number of stars in the sky. Lastly, computers simplify daily life. I recall when my father traveled to @LOCATION1 for business. Due to the high cost of international cellphone service, he used @ORGANIZATION1 on the computer to communicate with us. Additionally, a few weeks ago, when our cable went out, we used the computer to get news and weather information. For school research, I've always found computers to be more than sufficient. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people find computers more helpful than library books. My cousin typed her @NUM3 - word essay in @NUM4 hour, while her friend who wrote it by hand took @NUM4 + @NUM4/2 hours. In conclusion, computers are invaluable as they enhance communication, provide learning opportunities, and make daily life easier.
838	840	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. Using a computer helps develop hand - eye coordination. When using a mouse, one can operate it without constantly looking at their hands, and with a keyboard, one can memorize the key positions and type without visual guidance. Moreover, the computer is a powerful learning tool. Through the internet, people can quickly access information about distant places and people. Without a computer, one would have to visit a library, which may not always have the required information. Additionally, computers enable people to stay connected with others. Chat rooms and groups make it easy to communicate with friends and relatives, regardless of the distance. This connection brings joy to many, as it prevents the loss of relationships. In conclusion, the computer's ability to enhance hand - eye coordination, facilitate learning, and enable communication clearly demonstrates its positive effects.
839	841	1	2	Dear local newspaper, computers do not necessarily prevent people from exercising, enjoying nature, or interacting with friends and family. Families can set time limits on computer use. For instance, if a child is overly engrossed in the computer at @NUM1 and won't leave it, time limits can solve this problem. When the set time is up, the computer automatically logs off, preventing the child from using it until the next allowed time. Computers offer various functions, such as playing online games and chatting with friends. Chatting allows communication without the need for phone calls, and online games not only let you talk to friends but also provide a creative outlet with avatars. In conclusion, with proper time management, computers can co - exist with a healthy and social lifestyle.
840	842	1	2	"The computer is a wonderful invention, but it can have negative effects on people. It has a magnetic pull that keeps people glued to it for hours, preventing them from exercising, spending time with loved ones, and potentially putting them in cyber - danger. I spoke with the @CAPS2 of @PERSON2, and he pointed out that excessive computer use leads to a lack of exercise, which in turn causes obesity. The @CAPS2 and I decided that for one week in @DATE1, we will live without electricity. Although computers are useful for spreading information and communicating, they do not help in developing social skills. Typing abbreviations like ""u"" and ""r"" is very different from face - to - face communication. @PERSON1 said that seeing family in person is better than just talking to them online. Moreover, websites like @CAPS6, @CAPS7, @CAPS8 can expose users to cyber - danger, such as posting inappropriate pictures, talking to strangers, or engaging in mean behavior. There's also the issue of cyber - bullying, and conversations can be tracked. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, we should be cautious and balance our time between the virtual and real world."
841	843	1	2	Many people may disagree that computers are beneficial to people. However, in my view, computers are extremely helpful. They offer a great way to learn, are enjoyable to use, and provide an excellent means of communicating with old friends. Although I'm aware that some individuals spend excessive amounts of time on computers, they still bring significant benefits.  Computers are an outstanding learning tool. For instance, you can effortlessly find out who the leader of a particular region is. In contrast, if you were to visit a library without using a computer, it could take hours to locate the relevant information and find its exact position in the book. Additionally, you can keep up with the news more rapidly without waiting for it to be broadcast on the news channel. With just a few clicks, you can obtain the information you need, which is far more efficient than driving to a library.  Computers are also a source of entertainment. You can play small games on the internet during your work break or before school, which can easily fill those extra few minutes. Some games, like solitaire, not only provide fun but also exercise your mind. While there are some games that people may become addicted to, most people either have never played such games or only play them occasionally.  Lastly, computers are an ideal way to stay in touch with old friends. There are numerous online communication methods available. For example, if your high - school best friend moved away, you can still communicate with them through a chat room for text - based conversation or a video chat to see them face - to - face.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are helpful as they enable us to learn, have fun, and communicate with others. They are truly all - around beneficial.
842	844	1	2	"Dear local authority, I am of the opinion that computers have a positive impact on people. Do you think they are beneficial? Well, I'll present three reasons why you should say ""yes"".  The first reason is hand - eye coordination. If you possess hand - eye coordination, you can achieve many things. It can assist you in getting a job and even enhance your performance in sports. In today's world, where everything revolves around computers and cell phones, having hand - eye coordination is crucial.  The second reason is the computer's ability to teach people. The internet offers numerous websites on how to obtain your degree online, and you can take online classes. There is a certain drop - out rate, and a significant percentage of those kids who don't have their degrees turn to online classes. The computer can truly be of great help in this regard.  Finally, people use online chat rooms to talk and meet new people. Meeting new people is a valuable experience as you can learn about their way of life. Chat rooms are also convenient as you can talk to your friends online without using up your phone minutes.  Now, I'm done presenting these reasons. Remember the question I asked you earlier? (Do you think computers have a positive effect on people?) What do you think? I hope you'll say ""yes, they are a positive effect"". These are the reasons why computers are beneficial, and I hope you'll consider going out and buying one after reading this."
843	845	1	2	Dear [LOCATION1], as everyone realizes, technology is advancing at an astonishing pace every day. This is a positive development that can assist people in solving everyday problems, such as getting answers to queries and conducting business. As computers become more advanced, so do people.  Computers facilitate communication. Imagine being able to communicate with someone on the other side of the world by simply typing. Platforms like [ORGANIZATION2] allow you to send live videos across the globe instantly. Without these technologies, we would be limited to using only telephones and would rarely see each other's faces. With a specific application, you can also share content like never before. In the past, when you faced difficulties sharing something, it was a hassle. Now, content can be uploaded within minutes.  Previously, information traveled at a snail's pace. Thanks to computers, we can learn about an event just minutes after it occurs. Computers can relay information at nearly the speed of light. It is also much easier to find information. You only need to move the mouse a few times, and you'll access the largest repository of information ever. There is international news, local news, and more, all at your fingertips. Information travels faster on the internet than through traditional media like newspapers or TV. There are also online news sources like [CAPS16] [CAPS17] [CAPS18] and magazines like Time.  Have you ever been sick and didn't want to leave your house? Well, you can now do all your shopping online. You no longer need to visit a store to buy furniture, clothes, or even groceries. You can log on to a computer and access almost every store. You can purchase a whole set of furniture, a couch, and your groceries in just ten minutes. You can even shop for houses or cars online. Online shopping has truly transformed the world in ways that no one could have imagined fifteen years ago.  In conclusion, computers have made life easier for almost everyone who owns one. As computers become smarter, they may be able to perform incredible tasks, such as working for us and automatically purchasing items when we're running out of supplies. The possibilities are endless.
844	846	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I've heard about the issue of people spending too much time on their computers. In my opinion, people should reduce their computer time and spend more time outdoors for several reasons.  One reason is exercise. When you spend more time outdoors, you can get more exercise, which helps with weight loss. You'll feel lighter and better about yourself and become more active.  Another reason is that if you don't spend enough time outdoors and instead stay glued to the computer, you'll become extremely lazy. Lack of outdoor activity and exercise can make you tired, cranky, and less likely to follow your parents' instructions as your mind will be overly focused on the computer screen.  The last but equally important reason is that you may miss out on family fun. People who spend too much time on the computer often miss parties, social events, family dinners, and movie nights. If you don't want to miss out on these enjoyable moments, I suggest you get out more and stop being a lazy couch potato.  As you can see, there are many benefits to spending more time outdoors, such as going for a bike ride, eating out, or taking a nice stroll while walking the dog. I sincerely hope my opinions matter to you and that you'll agree with me. Thank you for your time.
845	847	1	2	"Why aren't we advancing in technology?"" asks four - year - old [PERSON2]. There are numerous reasons, but one major issue is that people are spending an excessive amount of time on existing technology, particularly computers. By wasting time on this device, people are neglecting exercise, missing out on the beauty of nature, and failing to spend quality time with friends and family.  A study from [ORGANIZATION2], one of the world's top colleges, shows that when you're on the computer for an hour, you only burn [NUM1] calories. To maintain a healthy weight, you need to burn at least [NUM1,000] calories a day. The average citizen in [LOCATION2, LOCATION1] spends [NUM3] hours on the computer, burning only [NUM4] calories. Even if they do aerobic exercise for the rest of the day, they can't burn enough calories as you can only burn [NUM5] calories per hour in an average aerobics class. If people can't maintain a healthy weight, they may become obese, which can lead to heart attacks and even death. A significant percentage ([PERCENT2]) of the obese population in [LOCATION4] die from heart attacks. Undoubtedly, computers can be as harmful as poison; excessive use can have serious consequences.  Imagine the beauty of nature - birds chirping in the trees, deer drinking from a pond, and a fox chasing a butterfly. Unfortunately, only a small percentage ([PERCENT2]) of people have actually witnessed such scenes with their own eyes. Former [CAPS6] [PERSON3] pleaded in an internationally televised speech, ""Fellow citizens, I'm pained to state that the rainforest in [LOCATION3] is being cut down right now. This is because people never go out to smell the fresh air and appreciate the beauty of the rainforest. We must stop them!"" However, only a few out of many people could relate to this message. A large percentage ([PERCENT3]) of people have never been out in nature. As a result, people are becoming indifferent to nature, and the rainforest is being destroyed, causing animals to lose their homes. When a poll was conducted among those who don't go outside, [PERCENT1] of them said it was because they were too busy on the computer.  The computer also takes away time that could be spent with loved ones. An eight - year - old, [PERSON1], sadly said, ""I love my mom. I miss her every day before dinner."" A [NUM5] - year - old cancer patient on his deathbed wished he hadn't used the computer so much and had gotten to know his family and friends better.  In conclusion, computers are like a monster that is harming our health, destroying nature, and taking away precious time with loved ones. While they may have some benefits in terms of coordination, the question is whether we'd rather sacrifice our health, relationship with nature, and time with family for a bit of speed in catching a ball."
846	848	1	2	I firmly believe that computers have a highly beneficial impact on people. They enable individuals to communicate with others online, offer educational opportunities in specific fields, and enhance hand - eye coordination. In the past, letters and phones were the primary means of communication. However, computers provide a fast, easy, and enjoyable alternative. For instance, if you have an urgent question for a friend and the phone is occupied, or if you're a talented singer seeking an agent, the computer can quickly facilitate these connections through email, websites, and other digital platforms.   Computers are also a remarkable source of knowledge. While reading books is a great way to learn, the internet offers an abundance of information from numerous authors. It allows us to explore distant places and learn about important people without having to visit the library. Online colleges, often advertised on TV, offer a comfortable and non - intimidating learning environment.   Moreover, computer games, similar to video games, teach hand - eye coordination. Although some parents may think kids are wasting time playing computer games, they are actually challenging their minds and improving this essential skill. Hand - eye coordination is useful in daily activities like catching a ball or playing sports. In conclusion, computers play a positive and crucial role in people's lives, offering multiple benefits in communication, education, and skill development.
847	849	1	2	In recent years, studies conducted by @ORGANIZATION1 have shown that people of all ages spend @PERCENT1 of their free time on computers, which has become a widespread problem in our state and country. An anonymous source uses the computer to contact old friends, and a study indicates that phone usage has declined as adults and teens prefer emailing or instant messaging. This leads to people sitting in front of a computer screen waiting for a response.   @PERSON1, a student at @ORGANIZATION2, prefers to be out with friends rather than spending excessive time on the computer. Some people believe that using a computer is a way to be more social, but in reality, it often means sitting in front of a screen talking to people one may not know well.   When sitting in front of a computer, people do little physical exercise. @PERCENT2 of those who sit in front of a computer end up obese as they burn few calories and release few endorphins, resulting in unhappiness.   Teens also face issues. They may feel more powerful on the computer, disobey parental rules more easily, and engage in online bullying. At @ORGANIZATION2 middle school, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students have been the targets of malicious online bullying, and @NUM3 out of @NUM2 have been bullied.   In conclusion, adults and teens should be aware that while using a computer is acceptable, they should limit their time. Spending less than @NUM5 minutes a day on email or instant messaging and then going outdoors to spend time with friends and family is a better approach.
848	850	1	2	In today's society, there is a significant controversy regarding computers. Many people hold the view that computers have a positive impact on our society, while others disagree. In my opinion, technology can be both beneficial and detrimental.   On one hand, computers have brought about great advancements. In modern medicine, technology in computers is indispensable, and in the military, computers are the backbone of the armed forces. Our society could continue to make remarkable progress with the help of computers.   On the other hand, when people surround themselves with technology, they experience less of the outside world. It is reported that @CAPS1 individuals spend over @NUM1 hours per week on computers. People are neglecting the parks funded by the state and not getting enough exercise. Excessive computer use also reduces interactions with family.   We need to find a balance. For example, for every hour spent on the computer, one should spend an hour outdoors or with family. Although computers are essential for our daily lives and entire companies rely on them, regular people, especially teens, should not over - use them.   In conclusion, computers have greatly contributed to the improvement and progression of our society. However, we must learn to balance computer use with real - world experiences to lead a more fulfilling life.
849	851	1	2	Computers are extremely helpful in numerous ways. I firmly believe that they can have a highly significant impact on you. They can enable you to @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and obtain cheap @CAPS3.   One way computers can @CAPS1 is by helping others plan @CAPS4 vacations and saving money for them. They can also @CAPS1 by providing knowledge on different things, such as @CAPS6 when you're lost or showing you the way.   Another way is by providing @CAPS2. The computer can offer you a large amount of @CAPS2. I use the computer @CAPS4 @CAPS2 @CAPS7. It also gives me @CAPS2 about a @CAPS8 college that I would @CAPS9 and like to attend.   The last way is related to shopping. If you @CAPS10 online, you can do it through the computer. I @CAPS9 this machine because you don't have to buy newly - released items at a very high price. You can simply @CAPS10 online and @CAPS11 it @CAPS4 a cheaper @CAPS12. For instance, my mom wanted to buy a new @CAPS15 from the dealer, but it was expensive. So, she went online and bought it at a lower price.   In conclusion, computers can be very useful when you need them, which is why I believe they are beneficial to you.
850	852	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a positive influence on society. For students writing a report on Europe, a computer can provide easily accessible information, allowing them to complete their projects at home.   Computers are also an excellent way to stay social. They enable people to interact with others online, which is a fast, easy, and enjoyable alternative to traditional communication methods like letters or phone calls.   In addition, computers are a great educational tool. While reading books is a good way to learn, the internet offers a vast amount of knowledge from multiple sources. It allows students to learn about different places and important figures without having to visit the library. Online colleges, which are often advertised, provide a comfortable learning environment.   Moreover, computer games can teach hand - eye coordination. Although some may think kids are wasting time playing these games, they are actually improving an important skill that is useful in daily activities.   In conclusion, computers play a positive role in society by facilitating communication, education, and skill development, and they should be recognized for their many benefits.
851	853	1	2	My view is that the more time we spend on the computer, the lazier we become. Firstly, the computer can perform many tasks that humans can do, which may lead people to be extremely lazy. Just sitting at home and browsing websites has a significant impact on people's lives. Computer technology has a great influence on a large number of people, causing them to miss out on a large part of their day. Secondly, instead of exercising, people stay at home using the computer. It is very unhealthy for a person to sit in front of a computer all day. Since they need to eat, they usually eat and then sit back down at the computer. This situation can get out of control because the computer allows people to order food online. This is an example of people being lazy and not getting enough exercise. People should exercise daily. Those who don't exercise should start instead of sitting in front of the computer all day. Thirdly, many people around the world have loved ones they care about. However, they don't have time to be with them because they are always on the computer. The computer should not take away our outdoor life. Although we can talk to friends and family over the computer, it is never the same as seeing them in person. We should go outside and create happy memories with our family. In conclusion, spending too much time on the computer is not good. We should take a few hours each day to exercise and go out to have a wonderful time. The computer only makes us lazier. We should ensure that we get enough exercise and spend time with our family, which will make us better people.
852	854	1	2	Dear [Recipient], Computers are powerful tools in our world. While some individuals, typically those over forty and living with their parents, may seem overly consumed by computers, they are predominantly used by teenagers and business workers. Computers are an essential part of daily life. We all recall feigning illness to accompany our parents to the office, where we played while they worked. They conversed with their bosses, made copies, attended meetings, drank coffee, and spent a significant portion of the day working on the computer, such as creating spreadsheets, designing logos, editing content, or acquiring new clients. Approximately ninety percent of workers rely on computers to perform their jobs, whether it involves sending work to overseas companies or to a neighboring floor. In [Location], most jobs require the use of computers. Moreover, modern computers are remarkable due to the internet. The internet enables us to communicate with people worldwide and search for various information, including the news, nearby bridal shops, large shopping malls, race - car tracks, and pizza places. It offers numerous possibilities. In Granby, instead of purchasing a newspaper, one can simply access the news on the computer. We can also look up the weather, celebrity gossip, and details of plane crashes. The computer can provide valuable information, but only if we know how to use it. One of its great features is the ability to watch TV shows and movies, eliminating the need to subscribe to expensive channels. Teenagers often spend a large amount of time on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or MySpace. These platforms allow us to chat with old friends, share family photos, and update others on our lives. Additionally, we can buy music on the computer. Instead of spending [Amount] on an album, we can purchase a single song for a dollar. We can also buy clothes and food online. In conclusion, the computer is a versatile and indispensable tool in our modern lives.
853	855	1	2	Dear [Recipient], Computers have both positive and negative impacts on people. In the past, people lived their daily lives without computers. Although computers have some positive aspects, the negative effects far outweigh them. For example, previous generations lived and died without computers, and it did not affect their lives significantly. In this century, many children and adults are obese because of the increasing use of technology. People who grow up with computers often become lazy as they view computers as a necessity rather than a form of entertainment. They sit in front of the computer for hours, which has a negative impact on their health. While computers help people stay in touch and updated, this is the only major advantage. As a student, I use my computer mainly for schoolwork, such as typing papers and printing research. However, I could achieve the same results using paper and pencil and asking others for information. This shows that people do not need to be overly dependent on computers. Additionally, we have cell phones that can keep us connected without the distractions of computer games, chats, or profiles. Cell phones are also safer as they are less likely to get viruses, and our personal information is more secure. In conclusion, computers are not healthy as they keep us sedentary and are not necessary for our daily lives.
854	856	1	2	When using technology, it is often for work - related purposes. Computers are used for writing essays, creating presentations, and conducting research. However, when people use them for social media platforms like Facebook, MySpace, [CAPS1], and online chat services like Oovoo, it is mainly for entertainment. I only use Facebook to check my hockey schedule, while most kids use it for chatting. Oovoo and other online video - chat services are used to talk to friends, but it would be simpler to just call them. When I think of these platforms, I am concerned about the inappropriate pictures that kids and adults post. Posting such content is unethical and dangerous because once it is online, it can never be completely removed. For example, when the weather is warm, I prefer to be outside. Only in winter can I understand using Facebook, but during [DATE1], there is no reason not to go outside and have fun. Kids often wonder why they gain weight. If they get off the computer and stop eating junk food, they will realize that being active is the key. Some parents don't seem to care what their kids do all day. They don't mind if their kids are [NUM1] pounds at the age of [NUM2] or if they sit in front of the computer and eat all day. I am very active and only use the computer for homework. I once used the computer for [TIME1] to type up my homework, except for math. I didn't play games, check emails, or browse the internet; I just focused on my work. In conclusion, using a computer is not bad, but excessive use without exercise is. Computers are designed to simplify our lives, not for endless entertainment. People spend a lot of money on expensive computers and accessories to make their lives easier, not for playing games. Kids should get off the computer, stop eating junk food, and be more active.
855	857	1	2	Dear [CAPS1] [CAPS2] Newspaper, Have you ever wished to see a [CAPS3] who lives across the country? Computers can make this possible. They have positive effects on people in multiple ways. They allow people to communicate with family and friends around the world. In a world where some people may isolate themselves and have difficulty interacting with loved ones, computers offer a way to chat or type with them. People can now talk to relatives in the comfort of their own homes without worrying about their appearance. Computers can also reduce phone bills. For example, instead of making a long - distance call to your mom in [LOCATION1], you can use a chat function on the computer, and it's as if you're right there with her as you can see each other. Some people think that computers give people too much access to information, but in fact, they provide people with the means to know what they want. This is beneficial for schoolwork as well, as students can search for information. In my opinion, in [fall NUM1], or for [people CAPS6], computers enable you to find the information you need. The time has shown that computers are not a means of isolating people or keeping them away from their families. In conclusion, computers play a positive role in helping people connect with others and access information, and they do not have the negative impacts that some may assume.
856	858	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I firmly believe that we should inform the people of @LOCATION1 about the perils of excessive computer use. Those who are constantly on the computer generally spend less time on other activities. Moreover, the more one uses the computer, the more likely they are to develop an addiction, which can be difficult to overcome. Additionally, individuals who frequently play computer video games may start to lose touch with reality. Computers are transforming this nation into a group of inactive individuals. Consider children. What do you think they spend most of their time doing? They could be outdoors getting exercise, but instead, their attention is often drawn to computer screens. By the age of @NUM1, most kids have already used a computer for over @NUM2 hours. This indicates that children spend more time on computers than on other pursuits. I had a friend named @CAPS1 who was constantly on the computer. As a result, he became extremely weak and thin due to lack of exercise. It seemed as if his arm could break easily. If you don't want your children to end up like @CAPS1, encourage them to get up and play outside. Some may think that daily computer use won't lead to addiction, but in fact, computers can be as addictive as drugs. Scientists have found that using a computer for just one hour a day can be sufficient to form an addiction. If we were to scan the population of @LOCATION2, @PERCENT1 would be found to be addicted to computers. This means that @NUM4 years from now, the global addiction rate to computers could reach @PERCENT2 or higher. Do you want to live in a world where almost everyone is constantly on their computers? I certainly don't. Video games are a remarkable advancement in computer technology, but they can also be very harmful. While occasional gaming is fine, excessive play can lead to serious problems. Due to the fantasy content in many games, players may start to lose sight of reality. For example, a scientific study on kids who played a particular video game found that @PERCENT1 of them started to believe in zombies. As a result, they can no longer play that game as it could cause significant brain damage. To summarize, excessive computer use leads to a lack of exercise and social interaction, makes it easy to develop an addiction, and can cause a loss of touch with reality. I hope you don't want to see your or your children's brilliant minds turn into mush because of computers.
857	859	1	2	The invention of computers was a significant step forward in human discovery. Regrettably, the negative impacts of this remarkable invention overshadow its novelty. The advent of computers has brought about a lack of physical activity and a diminished interest in, or even an inability to appreciate, nature. In addition to the detrimental effects on the mind, computers are also a major cause of the deterioration of relationships. After all, who has time for friends and family when engrossed in an online game? Despite their unique and fascinating nature, computers are gradually eroding the human mind. An increased focus on the computer screen often leads to a decreased concern for physical exercise and a reduction in the amount of daily physical activity. While using the computer, the mind may be active, but the body remains stationary, with little to no physical movement. For some individuals, the addiction is so severe that they only move to eat, use the restroom, go to bed, or when compelled by their parents. All the food consumed throughout the day accumulates in the stomach, and very little of it is burned off. In some extreme cases, individuals are so absorbed in the computer that they stay up late, sacrificing essential sleep. Sleep is crucial for both the body and the mind, and sleep deprivation can be harmful. Nowadays, computers are depriving people of the sleep and exercise their bodies need. The emergence of computers has also had a negative impact on our appreciation of nature. Fewer people are going outside to admire its beauty. Nature is a great teacher, offering insights into the circle of life and the natural order of the world. Often, we can draw parallels between the wild and the domesticated. However, because people are so attached to their computers, they are unable to fully experience the world. Some argue that we can find information about flora and fauna online, but looking at a picture is not the same as being in the presence of the actual plant or animal, where we can study it from all angles. The experience of being in nature is far more enriching than viewing it through a screen. Moreover, computers are typically used indoors, blocking our view of the real world. Even with laptops, when taken outside, users are more likely to focus on the screen rather than their surroundings. Computers have significantly reduced our appreciation of nature. Relationships with family and friends also suffer when computers are involved. Many people pay little attention to conversations while using the computer. They often pretend to listen, but their minds are elsewhere. Even when chatting with friends online, the conversation is often fragmented because their attention is divided between the chat and other online activities. In face - to - face conversations without a computer, people's minds may still be preoccupied with something they saw on the computer earlier. Clearly, relationships are being strained, and computers are to blame. Computers are gradually consuming society. Much of the information we can find on computers, such as the study of distant places, can also be found in books. Computers have led to a lack of exercise, less time spent in nature, strained relationships, and an overall unhealthy lifestyle. In return, they have contributed very little to society. Why does the world continue to tolerate the negative effects of computers on humanity?
858	860	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, the increasing use of computers among people is not necessarily a bad thing. Students often come home from school feeling tired and bored, and they may not want to go outside for exercise. Instead, they prefer to use the computer. On the computer, students can chat with their friends. During winter, when it's cold outside and going out might make them sick and cause them to miss school, they can simply grab their laptops and chat with friends from the comfort of their warm beds. Friends can even help with homework during these chats. Students also like to listen to music on the computer. Music is an important part of a student's life as song lyrics can help them express themselves. They may dance to their favorite songs, which is a form of exercise, and adults always encourage us to get more exercise. Additionally, listening to soft music can even help students do their homework. Furthermore, the computer is a great tool for learning about distant places. For example, I often type in www.google.com to learn about places I want to visit. Other students may also use it to learn about places they've never been to, like Italy, France, and @LOCATION1. People usually want to learn about these places before they actually go. In conclusion, @CAPS1, although more and more people are using computers, it doesn't have to be a negative trend. Of course, students should exercise, but not necessarily all the time. When using the computer, students can chat with friends, listen to music, and learn about distant places. So, it's not a bad thing that students use the computer.
859	861	1	2	Dear Newspaper, the question of whether computers benefit society is a highly debated topic, but to me, the answer is obvious. The internet is an extremely useful invention. It is widely used in schools and is only inconvenient when misused. I'm not saying that every household must have a computer, but it has become a luxury that most people enjoy. The combination of computers and the internet is probably one of the most ingenious ideas ever conceived. With just a click, users can access almost any information. Social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook allow people to connect and reconnect with old and new friends. Moreover, creating a personal web page can be very useful for promoting a business or a company. Online shopping is another advantage. It is especially convenient for parents who dislike driving to the mall. In addition, almost every school in the country has a working computer with internet access. This has been a huge step forward in education. There are numerous educational websites suitable for people of all ages. Many teachers now assign homework that requires internet research, and some important tests, such as the Blue Ribbon test, are taken online. It's safe to say that many teachers would be at a loss without computers. However, we also need to address the downsides of the internet. Although MySpace and Facebook are intended for positive purposes, they also have a dark side. In conclusion, while computers and the internet have brought many benefits to society, we cannot ignore their negative aspects. We should use this technology wisely to maximize its advantages and minimize its disadvantages.
860	862	1	2	Dear @PERSON1 editor, I believe that computers have both positive and negative effects, but the positive ones outweigh the negative. When people return home from work or school, they often immediately turn to the computer to check emails, do work, or play games. I think it's great to connect with friends and learn about distant places and people that we can't see in person. However, excessive computer use can be harmful. It can lead to a lack of exercise and can isolate us from our family and friends. I believe it's best to limit daily computer use and also spend time outdoors with loved ones. Computers are wonderful because of the amazing things they offer and the knowledge we can gain. I personally enjoy playing video games like Bubble Spinner on the computer. At the same time, I use Facebook to stay connected with friends and family. Bubble Spinner helps improve hand - eye coordination, while Facebook allows me to communicate with my loved ones. When working on projects, I do all my research on the computer, gathering information from various websites. I also do all my writing on it, which makes my work look clean and neat. The computer also provides access to videos of almost anything, whether it's on TV or not, such as on YouTube or Google Videos. It allows me to see nature, talk to friends and family, and view things that I would never find in books. These examples show that the positive impact of computers is greater than the negative. We should take advantage of this new technology and not let it go to waste. The computer is a great way to relax after a long day. Some people say that computer use leads to a lack of exercise, but we get enough exercise at school through gym and recess and at work. Computers are a useful device that most people use daily. They can't be all bad just because they may reduce our time in nature and with family, as they also allow us to experience these things in different ways. The knowledge and communication they bring have a positive effect on people. I hope you can understand my viewpoint.
861	863	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 pose a significant threat to modern society and our connections within it. In my view, these abhorrent things should be properly disposed of. With the current environmental breakdown, it is crucial that we get closer to nature while it still exists. Nowadays, our real - world interaction is extremely limited. When it comes to actual face - to - face conversations, computers make @CAPS3 even lazier as they sit around idly. Moreover, @CAPS2 is both harmful and costly, and let's not forget that the environment is already in a state of decline. Given the current state of nature, we will all perish, largely due to the influence of computers.  Currently, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 own computers. In America, only @PERCENT2 of the area is covered by beautiful forests, and as the population grows, more of these natural areas will disappear forever due to expansion. So, be one of the @NUM1 out of @NUM2 who choose to go outside and experience the wonders of the earth.  Computers are like little robots that are gradually taking over the world. It is becoming increasingly dangerous as they are destroying humans' ability to live a normal life. There is a so - called ""hypno disk"" in all computers that keeps us glued to them, suffocating us like a deadly drug. It is a terrible addiction. @PERCENT3 of deaths are caused by @CAPS2 overloads. Imagine how many lives could be saved if people just took a break every @NUM3 minutes. On average, people spend @NUM4 hours a day on @CAPS2. Set a goal to reduce this time to @NUM5 hours. This addiction will kill us, yet no one knows how to address it.  Millions of people in @LOCATION1 spend hours on their computers. You would think they are alone, but in fact, for every @NUM7 people, some are being negatively affected by chatting on @CAPS2 while their lives slip away. Interaction on the internet is not only unhelpful but also harmful. For instance, @NUM8 people a day engage in illegal activities on the internet, such as downloading music without permission. They could be imprisoned for up to @NUM9 years. There are also sexual offenders on platforms like MySpace who could come to your home at any time and kidnap you. In every @NUM10 people, @PERCENT4 are kidnapped due to MySpace alone. Stand up and stay away from this danger.  The government's interference and the presence of malicious people with lawyers who want to cause trouble add to the perils of this digital world. One in every @NUM11 people struggles to keep up with payments. The @PERCENT3 of people without computers are living a more natural life, walking with @CAPS4 on the edge of myth. Unfortunately, those @PERCENT1 of persistent computer users are likely to die within the next @NUM12 years due to a deadly poison that computers seem to deliver to the brain.  In conclusion, this world is fraught with dangers. We should come together, go for a run with a friend, or visit our family instead of engaging in virtual interactions. Keep in mind the risks of the @CAPS2 world and its money - grabbing nature. It's time to fight back against these digital ""robots"", go outside, and save ourselves, our neighbors, and our families."
862	864	1	2	"Dear Readers, I've noticed that there's a debate about whether computers benefit society. In my opinion, they don't contribute positively to the big picture. They are detrimental to our health and social interactions as they keep us indoors when we could be outside enjoying the real world.  Every day after school, I find myself going straight to the computer, logging into @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. My only exercise in the next @NUM1 hours is the movement of my fingers. There's a whole world outside that we could explore if we just got off our computers. Statistics show that @NUM2 kids spend more time inside throughout the year than outside these days. ""@CAPS1 is ridiculous how much things have changed in just @NUM3 years,"" says @PERSON1, a pediatrician in @LOCATION1. ""They all need their exercise.""  It's outrageous how much time people spend on computers. It starts to affect their attitude and control their lives. Sometimes, checking notifications on @CAPS3 becomes more important than spending time with family or friends. A mom of @NUM4 teens said, ""They all go to their rooms, shut their doors, and go on @CAPS3 and @CAPS6 until dinner and then go right back."" In such cases, people become so engrossed in their computers that they forget about others.  I believe that the addiction to computers, especially among teens, has gotten out of hand. One - fourth of moms say they see their kids growing apart from the family because of computers. You might argue that you're talking to someone when on the computer, but it's not the same as being with them in person. During a recent skiing trip to @LOCATION2, I found that my friend's jokes were much funnier when we were together rather than just chatting online. I regret not spending more time with her in person.  Moreover, many arguments these days stem from misunderstandings through the computer. People often misinterpret messages, taking them the wrong way. The truth is, computers are having a negative impact on our society and are even ruining relationships. If we just get off our computers and go outside, we can reverse this trend."
863	865	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to explain why I believe having computers is not a good idea. My three main reasons are that excessive computer use can lead to weight gain and obesity, it reduces the time spent with family, and it results in a lack of real - world friends.  Firstly, if you are constantly on the computer, you are less likely to go outside. When you're excited while using the computer, you may also eat more. Since you don't exercise, you'll start to gain weight and become overweight.  Secondly, you'll spend less time with your family. You might think you'll hang out with them later, but then you get addicted to the computer games or activities. As a result, you and your family will grow apart, and you'll end up feeling lonely because you've sacrificed family time for computer use.  Finally, you won't have real friends. If you're on the computer all the time, you won't bother going to the park or the gym, where you could meet new people and get involved in sports. The only friends you're likely to have are online friends whom you'll probably never meet in real life and won't be able to socialize with in a meaningful way.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that having a computer is not a good idea because it can cause obesity, reduce family time, and lead to a lack of real - world friendships. I hope you will consider my points after reading this letter.
864	866	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, In my view, computers are truly amazing. They offer a wide range of activities, such as playing chess, listening to music, and downloading favorite movies.  Computers are an excellent source of communication. If you have a long - distance relative living in @LOCATION1, you can communicate with them online via email, instant message, or @CAPS1.  They also allow you to search the web. Whether you need directions to a destination or want to learn about far - away places like @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4, or my favorite @CAPS2 @CAPS3, the web provides all the information you need.  In terms of entertainment, computers are unparalleled. You can watch episodes of your favorite @CAPS4 TV shows or music videos. You can also listen to music on your computer for personal enjoyment.  I use computers myself. For example, I love downloading music from my computer to my iPod and then enjoying the music on the go.  Moreover, @CAPS5 computers have a profound impact on the majority of people. I firmly believe that if we didn't have computers, our world would be completely different.  In conclusion, I think computers should stay. They have become an essential part of our lives and complete us in many ways.
865	867	1	2	I am convinced that computers have a negative impact on people, and I'll share several reasons to support this view.  One major reason is the lack of exercise. If you spend all day on the computer, your physical condition will only deteriorate. For instance, if you're @NUM1 years old and start using a computer every day instead of staying fit, you'll gradually gain weight.  Another reason is the improper use of computers. There's no need to be on the computer all day. A valid reason to use it would be for school projects or work - related tasks, rather than just for social media like Facebook or MySpace.  Repeating the same actions on the computer can also lead to certain disorders. If you don't use the computer as often and engage in sports like football or baseball instead, you'll be in a better physical state. Overusing the computer can also cause problems with your hands, and in some cases, you may even need surgery, which will severely limit your ability to do things with that hand.  My final reason is the risk of viruses. If your computer gets infected with a virus, you may lose all your data and have to buy a new computer. Additionally, there's a chance that someone could hack into your computer and steal your personal information. If you don't know who these hackers are, you won't know what they'll do with your data.  In conclusion, computers are only truly useful when used for research or work - related purposes. Excessive use of computers can lead to weight gain, health problems, and security risks. So, we should limit our computer use to avoid these negative consequences.
866	868	1	2	"In today's digital age, an increasing number of people are turning to computers. However, this trend may not necessarily be beneficial. Spending excessive time on computers has several negative impacts. Firstly, it affects one's activity level. The more time a person spends on a computer, the less time they have for physical activities such as exercise. A recent study indicates that @PERCENT1 of people spend more than @NUM1 @NUM2 hours on the computer per day. If @NUM3 or so hours were dedicated to exercise or sports, this percentage would drop to @PERCENT2. Doctors have also noted that at least @PERCENT3 of overweight parents spend most of their time on the computer, thus limiting their exercise time. The amount of time spent on the computer has been shown to decrease activity levels and contribute to the number of overweight and obese individuals. To build a healthier country, we should limit the time spent on computers.  Secondly, kids are staying up later on computers, which is negatively affecting their grades. Spending more time on @CAPS1 or other online platforms means less time for studying, resulting in lower grades. Kids now spend an average of @NUM3 @NUM2 hours on the computer each day, compared to @NUM6 @NUM2 hours previously. A student in @PERSON2 saw their grades improve from a @CAPS3+ to a @CAPS4+ simply by spending less time on the computer and more time studying. This student also felt better as they got more rest. Clearly, computers have a negative impact on grades and schoolwork.  Finally, computers limit the time spent with family and friends. A student, @PERSON1, said that she now spends more time going out with friends since the computer no longer consumes all her time. ""By doing this, I have a better relationship with all my friends than before,"" she explained. A kid who uses the computer during all of their free time spends @PERCENT4 less time with friends than someone who uses it in moderation. Families are also affected. If a family member spends all their time on the computer, the other family members will have a weaker relationship with them as they don't interact or engage in activities together and may not know what's going on in their life.  In conclusion, the overuse of computers does not benefit society. It affects a person's activity level, students' grades, and most importantly, a person's relationships with family and friends. To make our country a better and healthier place, we must limit the time spent on computers."
867	869	1	2	In my opinion, computers bring a lot of benefits to society. There are several reasons for this. First, I can use the computer to talk with my friends and family. I can communicate with them on platforms like Facebook, MySpace, or MSN. The camera on MSN is really helpful. For example, my family is in @LOCATION1, and I chat with them every @DATE1. This is much more convenient than sending pictures and videos or traveling to @LOCATION1 to visit them.  Second, I can do my homework on the computer. It's easy to write a long letter or complete a lot of work. For instance, on my computer, I can type out my assignments quickly. Before I had a computer, I had to write everything by hand, which was time - consuming.  Finally, I can do many other things on the computer, like finding answers to questions or working on projects. There are so many resources available on the computer.  In conclusion, computers are very useful in our lives. They help us communicate, study, and complete various tasks. They are an important part of modern society.
868	870	1	2	Computers are undoubtedly useful tools, but their misuse can lead to serious problems. In today's society, many people fail to get enough exercise, and the lack of healthy individuals is costing taxpayers millions. Moreover, people are not fully enjoying life, and some have even isolated themselves from their families and friends. By the end of this discussion, I am confident that you will be convinced of the negative effects of excessive computer use.  To begin with, many individuals spend too much time on computers instead of engaging in outdoor activities or exercise. This issue needs to be addressed as a large number of people are overweight and do not exercise enough to maintain good health. The high number of overweight individuals is imposing a significant financial burden on taxpayers. For example, @CAPS2 @PERSON1 has discussed the high cost of healthcare, and an easy way to reduce this cost is to encourage people to exercise more regularly. As technology continues to shape our lives, we must remember that physical health is more important than sitting in front of a computer all day.  In addition, people who spend excessive time on computers do not enjoy life to the fullest. Life is precious, and there are countless activities that can bring us joy, rather than just sitting in front of a screen all day. There are so many more fulfilling things to do in life than playing on a computer. Spending all day on a computer will not lead to a satisfying life.  Finally, computers have had a major impact on people's relationships with family and friends. Although computers provide an easy way to communicate, they should not be the sole means of interaction. Too many people rely on computers to the extent that they neglect face - to - face interactions. Many individuals have become so absorbed in their computers that they have distanced themselves from their loved ones.  In conclusion, the overuse of computers is causing us to lead unhealthy lives, preventing us from fully enjoying life, and damaging our relationships with family and friends. To create a better and healthier society, we should limit our computer use. The next time you sit down at a computer, think about all the opportunities for a more fulfilling life that you might be missing.
869	871	1	2	"I firmly believe that computers bring numerous benefits to society. They are a source of entertainment, a valuable educational tool, and play a crucial role in health and safety.  In terms of entertainment, computers are extremely popular. At electronic stores, a wide variety of computer games are available. Most of these games are not only fun but also do not have a negative impact on the brain. My friend @PERSON2 bought a computer game last week. @CAPS4 said that @CAPS3 is very entertaining and not brain - damaging. Watching TV on computers has also become a popular pastime. People can now download TV shows and movies on their computers, saving money and providing a convenient way to enjoy entertainment. @PERSON1 received a new computer for his birthday last week. ""@CAPS3 is so much fun watching TV on my computer, and it's so easy,"" @CAPS4 explained.  Computers are also essential in education. At school, we rely on computers for learning. Without computers, our learning experience would be very different. @PERSON1 can now do all his projects and homework on his new computer. Before he had a computer, he had to write out all his papers by hand, which took a long time and left him with little time for the rest of his homework. Now, he can type out his work quickly and still have time for other tasks. Research by @ORGANIZATION1 has shown that @PERCENT1 of kids with computers are smarter than before they had them. @PERSON1 said, ""I was getting all @CAPS5's when I did not have my computer. Now I get honors on my report card because of my computer.""  In addition, computers have opened up a new field in health and safety. Thanks to computers, we have made significant progress in genetics research. It would have taken about @NUM1 years longer to crack the code of genes without computers. The information obtained from the human genome project can help cure cancer and other diseases. Computers are also useful for ensuring the safety of children. New technology allows us to track kids. For example, a new mother lost her child at a park last @DATE1. She was able to find her child using the chip in the child's body and her laptop.  In conclusion, computers have a wide range of benefits, from entertainment and education to health and safety. They have had a positive impact on society, and without them, we would not be where we are today. I hope more people can recognize the value of computers and make full use of them."
870	872	1	2	I am writing to express my firm belief that computers are one of the greatest inventions of all time and have had a profoundly positive impact on society.  Computers have significantly enhanced education. Since the advent of computers, both teachers and students have reaped the benefits. Students can now explore the internet to learn about different places, historical events, and improve their reading and writing skills. This has expanded the scope of education and made learning more accessible.  In the realm of entertainment, computers play a major role. We can read online news, watch movies, and listen to music, all from the comfort of our own devices. They also help us connect with friends and meet new people, making social interaction more convenient.  Computers have also made life easier. People can earn degrees through online learning and acquire new skills. Research has become much simpler as we can find almost any information with just a few clicks. Some may argue that computers reduce face - to - face interaction with family, but platforms like Facebook still allow us to stay connected.  Moreover, computers have transformed various aspects of our lives. They help small businesses thrive by facilitating order management and global information dissemination.  In conclusion, computers have benefited society in numerous ways, from educating individuals to helping us stay in touch with relatives. They have left an indelible mark on improving the way we live. I hope this letter will convince you that computers are an essential part of the twenty - first century.
871	873	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, I firmly believe that having a computer is highly beneficial. It's well - known that teenagers spend a significant amount of time on computers. If it truly bothers parents, one might wonder why they have computers at home. @CAPS3, I can provide you with a reason. Computers are excellent sources of information. They offer a great way to communicate with friends and can give details about places that you may not be familiar with.  Primarily, computers are an outstanding source of information. They can provide answers to any question! This is extremely useful when you're working on a project and your mom won't let you go to the library to get books. A computer simplifies the process of looking up information. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of parents who bought a computer for their family don't regret their decision? That's almost all parents in @LOCATION2! As you can see, computers can assist kids with their studies.  Secondly, today's teenagers use computers to communicate with friends via @ORGANIZATION1 email. @CAPS3, I believe this is far better than sending @CAPS4. Why wait for a letter from your cousin in @LOCATION1 when you can talk to them instantly? And it doesn't use paper if you just @CAPS5 to buy. For instance, once I was on a trip, and we were searching for a hotel. We ended up finding a great one at a low price. You can also check maps if you @CAPS5 to someone.  In conclusion, I firmly hold that having a computer is crucial for several reasons. They are great substitutes for books, help us communicate with friends, and provide all kinds of information. I leave this opinion with you, hoping you'll learn something and make the right choice.
872	874	1	2	Almost every family now has access to a computer, which has become an integral part of life. It allows people to stay connected to the outside world, even when they have to stay at home. Computers are a vast repository of knowledge from millions of sources and have led to exponential advancement. Overall, their impact on society is positive.  On a rainy day, @NUM1 students will spend time on their computers. Among them, @PERCENT1 will be on sites like A.I.M. (@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3), @CAPS4, @CAPS5, or @ORGANIZATION2. These platforms enable them to communicate with both old and new friends, even when they can't use their phones or leave the house. Teens and adults use the @CAPS6 to reconnect with friends they haven't seen for up to @NUM2 years. This increased communication helps build more relationships and improves conversational skills. Over @NUM3 of the sites used by teens are based on @CAPS8 networking. The ability to easily converse with someone miles away is a sign of great progress.  @ORGANIZATION1 is a multi - million - dollar company. @PERSON1, an employee of @ORGANIZATION1, states that sites like @ORGANIZATION1 have seen a huge surge in popularity over the @DATE1. More people are turning to @LOCATION1 instead of @PERSON2 dictionaries to look up words, as it provides pronunciations and is easier to use.  Students rely on computers for school reports in subjects such as @CAPS7, @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10, or @CAPS11. A survey showed that computers are used far more often than books for information on various subjects. They are quicker and easier to search, and useful websites can be added to favorites.  Computers are also becoming more practical. In scientific laboratories where space shuttles are launched to the moon, computers are a key component. Ads from @ORGANIZATION3 show that computers are getting smaller. There are laptops that can fit in an envelope and handheld touch - screen computers that can almost fit in your pocket. You can type papers and assignments more legibly, and computers can even score tests.  Advancement is centered around computers. Many of the things we do today would have seemed impossible before their invention. Typing can be faster than handwriting, and papers can be saved electronically. If the current rate of advancement continues, it's possible to have computers that can perform household chores like taking out the trash or washing the dishes, or even have real - like conversations. People can learn more and improve their intelligence.  Although there are some drawbacks to computers, overall, they are beneficial to society. They give access to friends and a vast amount of information. Most importantly, they represent progress and advancement, and there is no direct harm from them.
873	875	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, the use of computers brings numerous benefits to society due to their positive impact on people. They enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about distant places and cultures, and facilitate communication with family and friends online.  Research has shown that teenagers who frequently use computers have higher test scores compared to those who don't. This is because they can quickly look up definitions, conduct research, and access any information they need at their fingertips.  Moreover, computers have revolutionized communication. Families and friends living across the country can stay in touch through email, video chats, and social media platforms like Facebook.  The improvement of hand - eye coordination through computer use is quite remarkable. As someone who plays basketball, volleyball, and softball, I understand the importance of this skill. One cold wintery @DATE1 at @TIME1, I spent hours typing a long history paper and @CAPS1 essay on the computer. That evening, I played the best basketball game of my life. However, a week later, when I went straight from church to a game without using the computer beforehand, my performance was poor. This experience convinced me that computer use can improve hand - eye coordination.  Computers also open up a world of knowledge about different cultures and regions. In history class, when researching the world hunger crisis in allied countries, I was able to start a fundraiser at my church. I learned that @PERSON1; @CAPS2 teenagers like me don't eat for @NUM1 hours, and @NUM2 children in African countries die from malnutrition every day. This knowledge has motivated me to work four hours a day to help these children.  In addition, computers help us stay connected with loved ones. My aunt and uncle, who live in @LOCATION3, had a baby boy, @LOCATION4. Since we only see them about once a year, we used to miss them a lot. But now, through Skype, email, and Facebook, we can keep up with @LOCATION4's growth and their travels. Also, @PERCENT1 of the teenage population in the @CAPS3.S spends at least four hours a day @CAPS4, tweeting, or using Facebook to stay in touch with friends. After moving from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1, I rely on computers to stay connected with my childhood friends.  In conclusion, the use of computers benefits society in multiple ways. They improve hand - eye coordination, help us learn about the world, and keep us connected with others. Through the internet, people can discover places to travel, bike, and exercise while enjoying nature. Planning get - togethers with family and friends is also much easier with online communication. I hope you will consider these benefits when discussing the role of computers.
874	876	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I strongly disagree with the letter you published. I believe that people need computers for research, communication, and to obtain various things.  First, computers are essential for research. Instead of searching through books, you can go online, which is faster and easier. You can find information on any place or project. The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 contains a vast amount of information on any topic.  Second, the internet is widely used for communication. Instant messaging is a popular option, and you can also chat on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6. You can even join chat rooms, but it's important to be cautious and know who you're talking to as it could be a stranger. The internet provides an easy way to stay in touch with people.  Finally, the internet is a source for getting anything you want. You can find pictures, games, videos, music, or even directions to a place. It's also a great source of entertainment. I often use it for YouTube, @CAPS5, and searching for pictures. You can find almost anything online.  In conclusion, the web is used for research, communication, and obtaining various things. That's why people should have access to the internet. They can enjoy the benefits of the online world while also spending time outdoors. However, people might need to reduce their TV - watching time. I hope you now understand why I hold this view, and perhaps in the future, we can find ways to use computers while remaining active.
875	877	1	2	"Dear editor, I firmly believe that computers are an indispensable part of modern life. They have seamlessly integrated into our daily routines, and often, we don't even notice when we're using them. We use computers in numerous ways every day, such as staying in touch with distant friends, exploring far - off places, and improving hand - eye coordination.  Computers are extremely beneficial for communication. When a friend or relative moves away, we can still stay connected. Many modern computers come with built - in webcams, allowing for more than just email communication. Even Oprah Winfrey uses the webcam feature to have people ""Skype"" on her show. And for older computers, there are still many social networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter that help us stay in touch. Every morning, when I watch Sportscenter, I often hear about what famous people are posting on their social media pages.  In today's economy, not many people can afford to travel to expensive destinations. But with computers, you can have a virtual experience. For example, if you want to learn about India, you don't have to go to the library to borrow a book. You can simply type in the information you need. This is also very useful for students writing papers about far - away places.  Hand - eye coordination is an important skill that many people lack. A recent study by @LOCATION1 news and report showed that people who use computers have @PERCENT1 better hand - eye coordination than non - computer users. This skill is useful for activities like throwing a baseball, playing video games, or driving a car. In daily life, when you need to operate the car, adjust the radio volume, and take care of your kids at the same time, good hand - eye coordination comes in handy.  In conclusion, computers are beneficial in multiple aspects. They improve hand - eye coordination, facilitate communication, and provide easy access to information. They are one of the most significant inventions and have great value in many ways."
876	878	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are an outstanding technological innovation. They are an excellent means of communication, enabling people to connect with others globally. For instance, my dad moved to Brazil, and we communicate via email, @CAPS2, and Facebook. It's the easiest and most cost - effective way to stay in touch. A study from the University of @LOCATION1 shows that @PERCENT1 of people find it easier to communicate using a computer. Moreover, information can be transmitted instantaneously.  Computers are also invaluable for learning. Many people around the world have learned different languages through websites or programs with great instruction. I learned to play the guitar using numerous online programs and lessons. People rely on computers to access information and learn about various things.  My mom, a secretary at an insurance brokerage company, couldn't do her job effectively without a computer. Customers need computers to learn about different insurance policies and avoid overspending. Scientists also depend on computers for research on plants, rocks, and @LOCATION2. Doctors use computers to learn about different sicknesses and broken bones. @PERSON2 stated that she learned @PERCENT2 of her knowledge from websites about the human body. Even teachers enhance their teaching skills from websites, and builder and modern designer @PERSON1 learned about sturdier building designs from computers.  In conclusion, computers are truly remarkable and play a crucial role in our daily lives, greatly benefiting present - day citizens.
877	879	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are the best technology to date. They are incredibly versatile, allowing users to do almost anything. My friends share this view, especially when it comes to using the internet for tasks like writing research papers. Research has demonstrated that computers have a positive impact on people. My mom considers computers one of the most reliable tools in the world.  @PERCENT1 of my friends think computers are among the best because they can get help with homework from the internet. They also use computers to talk online with others, interact with distant family members, and it has even kept more teens at home instead of on the streets.  Dr. @ORGANIZATION1's extensive research has shown that using computers improves hand - eye coordination. Since the invention of computers, the violence rate has decreased as more people stay home using their computers. School grades have also improved because students can search for information on the internet instead of reading long, boring articles, which saves time.  My mom says that when she was younger, computers allowed her to learn about far - away places and people's customs more effectively than from some books that may not be up - to - date. She believes that computers have a positive effect on the world.  You're doing a great job at your writing. My friends find computers helpful, research has proven their positive impact on reducing violence, and my mom thinks they are beneficial to us. I'm sure you'll agree that computers have had a powerful and positive influence on people, making life easier.
878	880	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I'm certain that @PERCENT2 of people would agree that computers are useful. They enable people to learn about far - away places. For example, my family often uses computers to plan trips. Once, my mom told me we were going to @LOCATION1 to visit our family, and she had already booked the tickets on the computer. It was a wonderful experience, and @LOCATION1 is truly beautiful. Some people love to explore new and beautiful places like @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION4.  Computers also allow people to communicate online. Most kids my age use MySpace and Facebook to stay in touch. I once found my old best friend @PERSON1 on Facebook. I was so happy because I thought I'd never talk to her again after she moved. I'm @PERCENT1 sure that almost everyone has a Yahoo account, which makes it easy to find and talk to people quickly.  Many jobs require the use of computers. Scientists need computers to make their inventions. Secretaries use them to manage their bosses' schedules, like a secretary for a doctor who needs to handle appointments. Students, especially those in college, can't do their homework without computers.  In conclusion, most people would agree that computers have a positive impact on people. They give us the ability to learn about far - away places, allow online communication, and are essential for many jobs.
879	881	1	2	"Dear Newspaper, computers are truly remarkable as they allow us to find information with ease. They benefit society in multiple ways. Firstly, people can communicate online easily. All @ORGANIZATION1 students use computers daily to video - chat with friends or instant - message their parents. @ORGANIZATION2 found that computers help keep families closer by enabling virtual meetings when someone is away. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 use their computers for online communication. Although some might think there are drawbacks, computers benefit many people every day.  Secondly, computers are great for learning about far - away places. As the saying goes, ""Computers are information in a compact form."" @CAPS3 out of @CAPS4 people use computers to learn about distant locations. The @LOCATION1 residents found it more convenient to use computers than multiple books.  Finally, computers improve hand - eye coordination. @PERCENT2 of people noticed an improvement after using the computer for an hour. @PERSON2, @PERSON1, said that computers can help develop stronger reflexes. While some may think computers slow reflexes, they actually enhance them.  In conclusion, computers benefit society significantly. They facilitate online communication, help people learn about far - away places, and strengthen hand - eye coordination."
880	882	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, the question of whether people should use computers more is debatable. In my opinion, they shouldn't because computers have many negative effects on people's lives.  Firstly, people are spending less time exercising. As an athlete who wrestles and plays baseball, I know the importance of staying fit. Olympic athletes work out daily, so it's puzzling why some people sit at home on the computer all day.  Secondly, people are missing out on the beauty of nature. Nature is all around us, whether we're hiking a mountain or by a lake. I love to hunt and fish and make time for it every summer, @DATE1, fall, and sometimes winter. Those who sit on the computer all day can't enjoy this gift.  Thirdly, people aren't spending enough time with family and friends. If you're on the computer all day, you can't be active with your friends or have quality time with your family. You're wasting valuable time that could be spent on activities like fishing trips or walks in the woods.  In conclusion, while computers have their advantages, the negative impacts of excessive use are significant. People should limit their computer time to make room for exercise, enjoying nature, and spending time with loved ones. So, no, people should not use computers more.
881	883	1	2	In @DATE1, @ORGANIZATION1 witnessed the public unveiling of an increasing amount of the latest technology. Computers, @CAPS1 - bars, telephones, and other devices are being equipped with the most high - tech software and machinery, enabling some truly remarkable things to occur. For instance, there is now a cell - phone that allows users to turn off the lights in their houses from thousands of miles away. This technology could be one of the greatest advancements the world has ever seen, though some may hold a different view. I am here to counter the skeptics. With new computers, people can communicate with others worldwide. Dreams that were once out of reach for many can now become a reality, and long - standing questions can finally be answered. I have several cousins in @LOCATION3 whom I rarely get to talk to as I seldom visit. Thanks to programs like @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 @CAPS6, I can now converse with them. Some claim that @ORGANIZATION2 makes kids like me miss out on quality family time. However, my brother is going to @CAPS10 in six months, and I'll want to talk to him. Given the high phone charges, my family won't want to spend @NUM1 hours on the phone and dip into their savings. On @ORGANIZATION2, there's an application called i - chat that allows me to talk to and see my brother as if he were at home. My dad discovered @CAPS4 and decided to try it. Now, he has reconnected with many of his high - school friends and is back in touch. You might also find an old friend you almost forgot or learn what's happening with your sister in @LOCATION1. @ORGANIZATION2 also offers virtual tours of places like @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION4, enabling those who can't afford a plane ticket to explore their dream destinations without leaving home. Moreover, @CAPS15, a website with millions of videos, includes tutorials for dances, sports, tricks, etc., so you don't have to pay for expensive lessons. Another advantage of @ORGANIZATION2 is that it provides mostly reliable information. In conclusion, the latest technology, especially @ORGANIZATION2, brings numerous benefits and has a positive impact on our lives.
882	884	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I heard you're conducting a survey on people's views about computers. I'm a firm believer in their usefulness. Computers allow us to communicate with family and friends through platforms like Facebook, MySpace, and AIM. They also offer exercise opportunities. By visiting YouTube, users can find various workout positions. Currently, over @NUM1 people use computers, with @PERCENT1 adults and @PERCENT2 children among them. This indicates that more kids are engaging in athletic activities. Adults use computers for work and in educational institutions. Newspaper offices rely on computers to type daily papers; without them, the work would be impossible. When people miss the daily paper, they can access it online. For students, computers are essential. We can chat with friends and use the internet for research. Some schools used to have large textbooks that were a burden to carry, but now they offer online versions. Sports enthusiasts can look up their favorite teams' game results and play virtual sports games on the computer. When moving to a new place, one can use Google to find a suitable town and school system. There are countless things one can do online and on computers. In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, and I hope this information helps with your survey.
883	885	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I've heard the claim that people are spending too much time on computers instead of with their families and friends, but I firmly believe this is not true. Here are my reasons. Firstly, computers can help you find people you're looking for. You might be searching for a long - lost family member or a friend. Maybe you've never met a particular family member and want to get to know them, or this person is someone you deeply love and need in your life. These are valid reasons for using computers and don't mean excessive use. Secondly, computers can assist in many areas where you need help. You can do your homework on the computer, and it can provide support when you encounter difficulties. If you come across something really challenging, the computer can offer solutions. Thirdly, you can engage in different activities on the computer. For example, when planning a @CAPS5 party and needing invitations, the computer can help. If you're considering moving to a new state or country, you can explore the place on websites before making a decision. In conclusion, the computer is a very helpful tool, and people are not spending too much time on it. I hope after reading these reasons, you'll agree that the computer plays a positive role in our lives.
884	886	1	2	There has been an ongoing debate about whether computers are beneficial or detrimental to society. In my opinion, computers are only contributing to the growth of society. They enable people to interact with others, discover new places and people, and develop hand - eye coordination, thus having a more positive impact than negative. First, computers facilitate people meeting and interacting with others. There are numerous popular websites that allow for real - time chatting and communication. Before the invention of computers, communicating with someone required a face - to - face meeting or sending a letter and waiting for a long time for a response. Now, one can simply type an email and send it instantly. Additionally, picture - sharing has become easier. All it takes is hooking up a camera, uploading pictures to the computer, and posting them on sites like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 bucket. Any rational person would recognize the usefulness of computers in this regard. Second, computers are crucial as they allow people to learn about and discover new people and places. In the past, if you knew nothing about a movie or someone, it was difficult to find information. However, with internet search engines like @ORGANIZATION1, you can type in any subject and instantly access all relevant information and pictures. These technological advancements have provided people with general knowledge that can be useful in various situations. For example, if you missed the best part of a movie, you can easily look it up on a computer, highlighting the importance of computers in daily life. Finally, computers help develop hand - eye coordination, which is essential in daily life. Typing on a computer in one's free time is a valuable skill. Many employers consider keyboarding skills when hiring, and skilled typists can even type without looking at the keyboard. Although computers cannot replace friends, family, and real - world experiences, they are important tools that offer useful skills. In conclusion, computers are essential in many aspects of life. They help us stay in touch with loved ones, learn about the world, and improve our skills, making them invaluable pieces of equipment.
885	887	1	2	Computers have a significant impact on many people, and I wholeheartedly support technological advancements in this area. They allow us to communicate with friends and family who are far away. For example, if your best friend moves to @LOCATION4, you can still talk to them via the computer. There are numerous chat websites and webcam chat options like Ovoo. I experienced this when I moved from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 in seventh grade. I was initially sad about leaving my old friends, but I was able to stay in touch through Facebook chats. This shows that computers are great for maintaining long - distance relationships. Computers also help build various skills, with hand - eye coordination being one of the most important. When watching an adult type without looking at the keyboard, it's an example of this skill. Hand - eye coordination is also useful in sports, like dribbling a basketball while looking ahead, similar to typing. Moreover, Google, which is accessible on computers, provides answers to any question. If you need to do research on a country like @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION4, you can type it into Google and learn everything about it. For instance, last year, when students had to research a state, most used computers. In conclusion, among all electronics, computers have the greatest impact. They enable global communication, teach hand - eye coordination, and provide knowledge about different countries. Therefore, computer technology should continue to be advanced.
886	888	1	2	Dear residents of @LOCATION1, I've noticed there's been some controversy regarding whether computers are beneficial to society. In my firm opinion, computers are an extremely helpful resource that simplifies daily life. They offer numerous advantages, such as facilitating learning, enabling students to perform better in @CAPS4, and serving as an excellent teaching tool.  One reason I support computers is their ability to make learning easier. You might wonder how a screen and a keyboard can achieve this; it may sound implausible, but it's true. Suppose you're a middle @CAPS4 student tasked with writing a paper on a specific topic. Instead of spending hours searching for relevant information in a library, you can simply conduct a Google search, and within seconds, you'll have all the necessary details at your fingertips.  Still skeptical about the usefulness of computers? Consider this: computers allow students to perform better in @CAPS4. Websites like Edline enable teachers to quickly post students' grades. When you take a quiz, your teacher has to grade over @NUM1 quizzes. With absentees, weekends, and vacations, the time it takes to receive your quiz results can be significantly delayed. Sometimes, students don't get their quizzes back for two weeks after taking them. By the time you receive your results, it's time for a chapter test that accounts for @PERCENT1 of your grade, and you've just discovered you didn't do well on one of the sections. This can negatively impact your performance on the test. However, if your grade is posted online days in advance, you'll have more time to study, know what to focus on, and ultimately perform better on the test.  Are computers also beneficial for teachers? The answer is yes. Have you ever found yourself struggling to understand a concept, no matter how much your teacher explains it? What if they showed you a helpful YouTube video that clarifies the topic? Visual aids can enhance learning. Additionally, computers allow teachers to email colleagues if they encounter problems and stay updated on @CAPS4 - related information.  I hope you now recognize the usefulness of computers. They simplify learning, help students excel in @CAPS4, and are an outstanding teaching resource. These are just a few of the many reasons why computers are valuable, and I encourage you to continue using them in our community.
887	889	1	2	@ORGANIZATION1, computers bring significant benefits to our society. They assist people in completing work, enable communication without relying on telephone numbers, and support students' studies. Regardless of which reason you consider, computers are positively impacting our society.  Have you ever been assigned a paper one day and had it due the next? When you reflect on what helped you finish the paper, it was most likely a computer. A recent survey revealed that @PERCENT1 of college students believe they wouldn't be achieving good grades without a computer.  Computers aren't just beneficial for students; they also help adults in the workforce. I've lost touch with some friends who moved away over the years. With a computer, it's easier to find them and re - establish contact. Using various programs, it's highly likely you can locate anyone, whether they're @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. Nine out of ten adults reported finding many of their high - school friends thanks to computers.  Moreover, computers are a valuable study tool for students. They can use search engines to research papers or play educational games. If a student forgets their homework, they can often use a computer to find out what it is. When I surveyed middle - school students, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 said they would check the computer before asking a friend.  As you can see, computers offer multiple benefits to our society today. They help people work more efficiently, keep us connected with friends, and support students' studies.
888	890	1	2	I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. There are three main reasons for this view.  Firstly, computers keep people informed about important news. In case of a blizzard, people can find out in advance and stock up on food. If there's a burglar in the area, they can lock all doors and windows. Knowing this information also helps in event planning, such as birthday parties. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of people experience fewer inconveniences when they're aware of the news.  Secondly, computers allow people to connect with those they don't see often. Video chat provides an easy way to share events and have face - to - face conversations. You can show off a new purchase or a newborn baby. Experts suggest that friendships last longer when people communicate regularly, and computers make this possible.  Thirdly, computers enable people to order anything in the world online. If you need to send a Japanese gift to someone in Ohio, you can do it online. For the elderly who can't go to the grocery store, online shopping is a great option. I've observed that people who can order everything online save time, money, and gas as they don't have to drive as much. It's also more convenient and less stressful than waiting in lines to purchase an item.  In conclusion, the ability to find important news, connect with distant friends, and order items online are three significant ways computers have positively affected people. That's why I'm convinced that computers have a positive impact on people.
889	891	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I wholeheartedly support technological advancements as computers have an enormous positive impact on people. It's @DATE1, and we should no longer rely solely on books for information or write everything by hand. Computers have made life easier for everyone.  Computers are an excellent means of communication. Having accounts on @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 allows you to chat with people globally. Online communication is more cost - effective as you don't have to pay for phone minutes. Video chats are also available, whether through @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS5. It gives you the feeling of being in the same room as the person you're talking to. If you have a friend who has moved across the country, these communication methods are incredibly useful. Without a computer, these accounts wouldn't be accessible, so computers are essential.  Computers have also made our generation more intelligent. We can easily look up any information on the computer. When we're curious about something, a simple Google search provides the answers. In the past, we might have given up on finding information in a book, but now it's effortless. Kids who are too shy to ask for help with homework can find it online. We can even take online college courses, which is extremely convenient for some.  Adults in the workforce also rely heavily on computers. In the medical field, professionals use computers to manage patient records. Teachers use them to organize lesson plans and print reminders for students. Scientists conduct research on computers for their experiments, and engineers use computer programs to design projects. Computers also offer the opportunity to advertise small businesses globally, which is beneficial for the economy.  Computers benefit us physically, mentally, and socially. Certain computer games can improve hand - eye coordination. We can learn a vast amount of knowledge from computers, making us more intelligent. They also help us maintain social connections. For example, websites like @CAPS7 - @CAPS8 give adults a chance to find a soulmate online.  The positive effects of computers are numerous, but we should not take them for granted.
890	892	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I frequently contemplate the impact of technology on humans. Among our many discoveries, technology stands out as our greatest advancement. New machines and robots are constantly being developed, and our understanding of machines and artificial intelligence is growing rapidly. The computer is the most widely used machine, serving purposes such as communication, awareness, learning, and entertainment. However, I share the concerns of some experts that people are overusing computers.  Adolescents are the biggest computer users. Young adults spend hours on websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 chatting with friends. At their age, exercise is crucial. Due to excessive computer use, childhood obesity is becoming increasingly common as many children and teenagers fail to meet the recommended @NUM1 minutes of daily exercise. I believe computers are useful, but only in moderation. The developing mind and body need physical activity. If children and teenagers don't reduce their internet usage, there may be a surge in health problems in the future.  While the internet enables quick communication, it can sometimes have negative consequences. Kids who spend hours @CAPS4 or emailing their peers spend less time with their families. Parents often complain that they rarely see their children because they're either doing homework or using the computer. Face - to - face conversations are also becoming less common. Instead of getting together to talk, people turn on their computers, which is a waste of energy. It would be better to visit a friend in person rather than typing all day.  Computers have as many disadvantages as advantages. There are numerous risks in @LOCATION1. Online predators are prevalent, and personal information and identities can be easily stolen. The likelihood of these things happening is high, so it's better to be cautious.  In conclusion, while we don't need to completely abandon computers, we should use them sparingly. We should prioritize exercise, spend time with family, and protect our personal information. By doing so, we can maintain our health, strengthen our relationships, and stay safe. So, step away from the keyboard, go outside, have a face - to - face conversation with a friend, and engage with your family.
891	893	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are a valuable asset. People utilize computers for business purposes. They enable interaction with individuals at a distance and facilitate research. Computers are versatile tools. They can be used for business, allowing some people to work from home. They also offer the means to connect with those one doesn't see daily. Moreover, computers are excellent for research, whether it's for a school project or gathering information about business associates. In conclusion, the numerous benefits of computers clearly demonstrate their positive impact.
892	894	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper, I've been tasked with sharing my opinion on the effects of computers on people. While some experts worry that people aren't spending enough time outdoors, most support technological advancements. Currently, computers are increasingly popular and are beneficial in multiple ways. They help us learn new things, are useful for school and work, and keep family and friends connected. Firstly, computers assist in learning. Search engines like @CAPS1 make it easy to find answers. For instance, during a dinner with family friends, when the question of ""who is the @CAPS6 that plays @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4?"" arose, my little sister typed the query and quickly got the answer, @PERSON1. Additionally, learning to use computers develops skills like typing. A recent poll shows that @PERCENT2 of nursing - home residents who learn to use computers have better brain function. Secondly, computers are helpful for work and school. They aid in sending work - related emails, creating presentation slide - shows, and maintaining calendars. @PERCENT1 of people use computers to benefit their work. In conclusion, computers have a positive and helpful effect on people."
893	895	1	2	"To whom it may concern, I am of the opinion that computers bring significant benefits to society. They are wonderful household items that simplify life in many aspects. Computers allow families to explore new places through online photos and connect with people via the internet. They also provide social networking opportunities across communities, states, or even countries. There's a quote saying, ""the largest room in the world is the room for improvement,"" and in my view, computers can reduce this room. Although some experts claim that computers make people spend too much time indoors, the internet, organized by computers, is a vast source of pictures, words, and sounds. You can see almost anything on the internet, from the palm - shaped islands of @LOCATION1 to the frozen @CAPS1 tundra in the @LOCATION3. You can view penguins in the southern ice cap and the rice fields of @LOCATION2 from a bird's - eye view. Moreover, computers enable people to share pictures and memories via email. Social relationships have improved greatly as people can stay in touch with family and friends easily. Storing and sharing memories on social networking platforms like Facebook or Twitter is convenient. Planning vacations is also made easier with computers, as it can be done quickly and at a lower cost. In conclusion, when used correctly, computers are a positive force, allowing people to discover new things, enhance social connections, and save time."
894	896	1	2	Dear local Newspaper, I'm writing to share my thoughts on the effects of computers. I think computers are amazing. They allow us to interact with family and friends, learn about global events, and assist with schoolwork. Firstly, you can interact with loved ones on platforms like Facebook, @CAPS1, or MySpace. You can talk, send pictures, and comment on others' posts. There are also many groups to join, helping you meet new friends. If your family has accounts on these platforms, you can easily stay in touch. Secondly, there are numerous websites where you can find information on various topics such as science, math, and history. You can learn about the weather or trace your family history. Lastly, many kids do their homework on computers. If people claim computers are bad and parents restrict their use for educational purposes, it would be a loss. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people in terms of social interaction, learning, and education.
895	897	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, we are in the age of computers, and they are everywhere. While some dislike the widespread use of computers, I believe they are great for sharing and finding information, communicating with distant family and friends, and providing entertainment. When you want to know the capital of @LOCATION3, a simple click on the computer can give you the answer, @LOCATION4. Sharing information is also easy. If you discover a cure for the common cold, you can post it on the @CAPS1 instead of going through a long media process. Regarding communication, when finances prevent a visit to @LOCATION1 to see @CAPS2 @PERSON1, computers come to the rescue. With webcams, you can talk to someone across the world without flight costs. Without a webcam, you can use email or instant messaging. Computers are not just for work; they are also for fun. After a long day, workaholics can relax by playing games like solitaire on the computer. In conclusion, computers are essential for information exchange, communication, and entertainment. Those who oppose their use should reconsider as they are a valuable and useful tool for society.
896	898	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a significant impact on people. Firstly, they provide individuals with the ability to learn from distant locations. For instance, if one wishes to visit @LOCATION4 on @DATE1 but has no knowledge of the place, they can access the internet to learn about its foods, culture, villages, and landscapes. Moreover, for book reports, instead of relying solely on textbooks, one can search online for comprehensive information about @LOCATION5, including its culture, food, location, economy, schools, and festivals.  Secondly, computers enable people to communicate online with others at any time. There are platforms like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 that allow individuals to connect with friends living far away. My friend lives in @LOCATION1 while I reside in @LOCATION2, and since we don't have cell - phones, we use these platforms to stay in touch. Additionally, it allows communication between people in different locations such as @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION6.  Thirdly, computers offer educational online games for children. These games cover areas like reading, math, and writing. Statistics show that @PERCENT2 to @PERCENT1 of kids learn more on the computer than in school, which is a substantial percentage even for children. Playing computer games is also more enjoyable for kids compared to sitting in class all day.  Lastly, one can watch videos on computers that teach all sorts of exotic things. In conclusion, the influence of computers on people is multi - faceted and positive, enhancing learning, communication, and entertainment.
897	899	1	2	Dear newspaper, I am certain that computers have a positive effect on our society. Many people love using computers as they can get a great deal done on them. There are three main reasons for this positive impact: the ability to chat online with friends and family, assistance in conducting research for projects, and facilitating job - related tasks in daily life.  For staying in touch with loved ones, if you have family or friends living far away, using the computer for email or chat sites like Facebook is a great solution. I have cousins in @LOCATION2, and email is the cost - effective way for my family to communicate with them. My mom and her sister exchange emails regularly, which I consider a positive outcome of computer use.  Regarding research, I once had to research @LOCATION1 for a school project in @CAPS2. I completed all my research on the computer and received an A+. Without the computer, achieving such a grade would have been difficult.  In the workplace, many people rely on computers. My dad, a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 who manages portfolios, uses the computer almost all day at work. He uses @ORGANIZATION1 to check the stock chart. My mom, a teacher, uses the computer to email parents when students need help.  In conclusion, computers clearly have a good effect on our society. They enhance communication, support research, and boost work efficiency. I hope you agree that computers have a positive impact on our lives and support their continued use.
898	900	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, while some people believe that computers have a negative impact on others, I hold the opposite view. In my opinion, computers have transformed the world. They allow people to save work, visually experience new things, and reconnect with old friends.  Computers are excellent for data storage. One can create and save documents, pictures, and movies, which will remain on the computer indefinitely. Consider your newspaper company. It would be nearly impossible to produce hundreds of copies of the newspaper daily without computers. Moreover, in case of a fire, if the work is saved on a computer, it can be retrieved, while hand - written work would be lost forever.  Another advantage is the visual experience provided through the internet. When planning a vacation, one can view pictures, videos, and articles about the destination on the computer, which is more comprehensive than relying on a book. This also applies to shopping for furniture, instruments, or clothing. Computers offer alternative perspectives that books cannot provide.  Computers also facilitate social connections. Instead of searching through phone books, one can easily find old friends or relatives on the internet. Popular websites like @CAPS1 make it extremely convenient. My dad found his childhood friend on @CAPS1 and was able to call him within @NUM1 minutes.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people everywhere. Without them, many modern - day activities would not be possible. I hope more people will share my view.
899	901	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computer manufacturers should implement certain changes for the betterment of society. There are three key opinions I'd like to share.  Firstly, computers should be equipped with timers. When people play games, they often spend hours on them without engaging in other activities. Similarly, when doing homework, they may take excessive time, resulting in poor work. A timer can help regulate the time spent on different tasks and encourage people to be more productive.  Secondly, there should be a law requiring people to exercise before and after using the computer. A large percentage of people are obese because they sit in front of the computer for hours, eating while playing games or watching videos without taking breaks to go outside. Physical activity is essential for maintaining good health.  Thirdly, children should use computers less than adults for health reasons. Prolonged computer use can cause eye problems in children, such as red eyes and poor eyesight, leading to the need for glasses. Additionally, children may be at risk on chatting sites, where they can talk to strangers and potentially face dangerous situations like rape or kidnapping.  I urge the local newspaper to advocate for these changes for the well - being of society, especially children. I sincerely hope that these suggestions can be implemented to create a healthier environment for computer use.
900	902	1	2	I am convinced that computers are extremely helpful in our daily lives. They simplify many tasks and bring numerous benefits.  Computers are a great source of information. All one needs to do is type in the desired query, and within seconds, hundreds of relevant links appear. For students in @CAPS1 school deciding on a college, the computer provides a wealth of information. It is also invaluable for school projects, enabling students to gather comprehensive data on their subjects.  When it comes to booking hotels and buying plane tickets, computers are indispensable. Without them, one would have to visit the hotel in person and might be out of luck if there are no rooms available. On a computer, it clearly shows the availability and allows for easy booking. The same goes for plane tickets; it shows available flights and their prices, so there are no surprises at the airport.  Another significant advantage of computers is that they help us interact with friends and family when we can't see them in person. Platforms like @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and MySpace allow us to stay in touch. There are even options to have video conversations, enabling face - to - face communication. I often chat with my brother, who is in college, on the computer since I don't see him often.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in our lives. They assist in information - gathering, travel arrangements, and maintaining social connections, making our lives more convenient and fulfilling. I firmly believe that computers are an essential and positive part of our modern existence.
901	903	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that people should stay connected with computers. There are three key reasons for this stance, namely @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. These reasons are highly relevant as every individual can engage in these three activities on a computer.  One reason people should use computers is for learning. For example, if a child is interested in animals, they can use the internet to look up relevant information. Children can also learn on the computer by accessing educational resources like first - grade materials stored in the drive.  The second reason is @CAPS2. With computers, people can talk to friends. They can plan fun activities together, such as good exercise. Also, when a friend is explaining something, the computer provides a platform for communication. Moreover, @CAPS2 can be beneficial in other aspects as well.  The final reason is that people can discover different things on computers. Some discoveries can be positive, like learning how to fix a computer problem. This not only helps with the current issue but also enhances one's computer knowledge. However, there are negative aspects too, such as getting a virus that can damage the computer.  In conclusion, we should keep our computers. Many people, including young children, can learn from them and will likely remember what they learn.
902	904	1	2	Dear town of Southington, computers in our town are extremely important. They are used in all banks and in almost every job. Computers are essential for life and do not make us lazy and forgetful; instead, they keep us busy.  The only situation where someone online may seem lazy is when a teenager is playing games. Some kids do this because they prefer to talk to friends, make plans, and interact while playing, rather than exercising or spending time with their family. But if someone chooses to be lazy and ignore their family, it is a personal choice.  I agree that people are becoming overweight, but I think it's because some consider a workout to be just an hour of lifting and running once a week, which is incorrect. I suggest that this newspaper should post ads about gyms. This may help reduce the obesity rate in our town. Alternatively, if people are neglecting their families, they could work fewer hours to spend more time at home.  For teens, parents should set rules, like allowing @NUM1 hours of play per day and @NUM2 hours on @DATE1. If teens don't follow these rules, parents can take away the games for a day or two. This may not immediately make them spend time with their families, but it will encourage them to be more active, rather than watching @CAPS1.V. or playing video games all day. I know this from experience as a teenager; when my parents take away my games, I go outside and run around.  Please take my advice, and your caring family will stay together, active, and not be constantly stressed from work on the computer or overly involved in video games.
903	905	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, as a member of the public, I am writing to share my thoughts on whether people spend too much time on the computer.  Sometimes, people do spend more time on the computer than usual. This is a problem because it can lead to weight gain and a loss of control over eating habits.  Computers are helpful as they can do many things for us. However, there are still numerous tasks that a computer cannot teach us. While computers are useful, they cannot replace the need to find activities outside.  Another issue is that people become overly attached to their computers and lose sight of what truly matters, such as exercise and fitness. When their computers crash, they get angry and may forget how to do things because they are so reliant on the computer.  These are my ideas on the subject of whether people spend too much time on the computer and not enough time with friends and family. In conclusion, it is important to find a balance between computer use and real - life interactions.
904	906	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1, imagine it's a beautiful @DATE1 day. The birds are singing, and the air is filled with the fragrance of flowers. But instead of playing outside with neighbors, some people are inside trying to master the unbeatable game Cubefield on the computer.  Computers have had a negative impact on today's society. When people are engrossed in what they're doing on the computer, they become lazy, lose motivation to exercise, and lose interest in helping the community. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of people would rather stay on the computer than go out and help in their neighborhood.  Computers have made people want to stay glued to their chairs, eyes fixed on the monitors. Although computers have contributed to many technological advances, the cost is high. Many kids are becoming obese and lack the motivation to leave their rooms.  A family friend of mine was very obese. She was lazy and didn't want to exercise. Instead, she spent weeks in her room on Facebook. While the computer didn't directly make her obese, it was used to avoid dealing with real problems. It's sad that @PERCENT2 of teenagers say they'd rather stay on MySpace than go for a jog.  Yes, computers can help you learn, but so can books, newspapers, and magazines. Helping out in the community offers opportunities to meet new people and gives a sense of accomplishment. But the temptation to stay on the computer often clouds better judgment.  I'd rather help the elementary school across the street build a garden than stay inside on Twitter. If you're inside on the computer, you won't know if the old lady across the street needs help with groceries.  In conclusion, computers have had a negative impact on society. Teenagers and adults have become lazy, lacking motivation to exercise and help in the community. Now it's your turn to make the right decision. Go out and be active instead of staring at the computer screen.
905	907	1	2	Dear newspaper and readers of @LOCATION1, I'm @PERSON1, a student from @ORGANIZATION1. I've recently learned about the argument regarding computer use, and I think it's silly.  Computers are essential in life. They are used in jobs; my father relies on a computer for his work, and many people use them to save information or conduct research. While some argue that computer use should be reduced, most people couldn't go through a week without using one, especially those who own a business.  In addition to job - related use, computers are great for chatting with friends who have moved away. If a family member or friend travels constantly and has no cell - phone connection, the computer is the only way to communicate. Everyone has used a computer for business or to talk to a friend, so their usefulness is often underestimated.  As a kid, I know we need computers for homework. Some assignments require making powerpoints or writing papers on historical facts, and we can't do this without computers. Reducing computer use for kids could potentially lower their grades, as teachers always emphasize the importance of grades, and parents would surely agree.  In conclusion, we can't decrease computer use as it would cause harm to people's lives. Consider those who travel a lot, kids with homework, and parents with jobs that rely on computers. Don't upset these people by reducing computer time. Thank you for your time.
906	908	1	2	"In my view, computers are an outstanding invention. The pursuit of knowledge is one of humanity's greatest quests, constantly striving to understand the hows and whys of things. Thanks to our natural curiosity, we've made remarkable technological leaps. What seemed impossible years ago is now achievable. One such feat is the ability to find any information within seconds.  Computers bring numerous benefits to society. Firstly, they enable us to learn about foreign countries instantly. In the past, the only way to learn about distant places was through newspapers, many of which provided limited information. Now, with the internet, we can access real - time information from around the world. As an expert from the university of [CAPS2], [PERSON3], stated, ""Thanks to our modern technology, people are now more informed about the rest of the world than ever before."" Without computers, we might have known little about recent events like the earthquake in [CAPS6].  Secondly, computers allow us to communicate with people globally in an instant. A century ago, instant communication seemed unthinkable, but now it's an ordinary part of our lives. As a reporter for the new [CAPS8] times, [PERSON1], said, ""Many of our advancements and decisions are made during online conversations. Even some of the world's greatest leaders make tough decisions due to these technological advancements. Without this technology, many decisions in [LOCATION1] and [CAPS10] wouldn't have been made, and many soldiers would have died as a result.""  Finally, computers help improve hand - eye coordination. Video games and simulations are effective tools for this. In video games, players need to react quickly to on - screen movements to achieve their goals. In military simulations, soldiers learn how to respond to various combat situations. General [PERSON2] of the [LOCATION2] [CAPS12] said, ""The simulations we've invested in have improved combat effectiveness by over [PERCENT1]. Without these simulations, many more American lives would have been lost in recent wars.""  In conclusion, computers are indispensable. Without them, we couldn't learn about foreign lands, communicate instantly, or develop good hand - eye coordination. I hope more people will recognize the value of computers."
907	909	1	2	"Dear [LOCATION1], as you all know, there has been a debate in our town about computer usage. In my opinion, computers are an excellent technology.  Computers offer access to a vast amount of information, pictures, and news. They also allow us to chat with friends, both old and new. When doing a report on a far - away country, instead of going to the library, we can simply search on engines like [ORGANIZATION1], [CAPS4], [ORGANIZATION2], or [CAPS5]. Currently, [PERCENT1] of households have at least one or two computers, and [PERCENT2] of people can access the web via their cell phones.  Pictures are readily available on the web. We can find almost anything in the picture search engine. For current events, certain websites offer live newsfeeds or articles, such as the recent earthquake in [LOCATION4].  The internet also provides a platform for communication. Chat rooms like Aim allow us to talk to people thousands of miles away. An avid [CAPS6] user from [LOCATION3] said, ""I was on [CAPS6] looking for my friend [CAPS7] and found her page. Before this year, we didn't talk much, but now we chat on Facebook all the time."" Dating sites are also available, where people can meet new friends and develop relationships.  Entertainment is abundant on the internet. We can play various games, watch missed episodes of our favorite shows, stream live movies, and watch videos on [CAPS9]. There are also educational games like [CAPS10], [CAPS11], and [CAPS12]. Moreover, more than [PERCENT3] of shopping for clothes, car parts, and other items is done through online auctions like eBay and Amazon. I remember once when my dad and I wanted to see a movie but didn't know the showtimes. We simply checked the cinema's website.  In conclusion, computers are a great resource. They are an excellent reference, enable us to chat with others, and enhance our daily lives in many ways."
908	910	1	2	"[ORGANIZATION1], since the invention of computers, they have become ubiquitous in schools, homes, and businesses across [CAPS1]. They have greatly benefited society, and I can personally attest to their value.  I've lived for [NUM1] [DATE1] and have moved to [NUM2] different states: [LOCATION3], [LOCATION1], [LOCATION2], and now [CAPS2]. Despite moving around a lot, I've managed to stay in touch with my friends and family through various means, thanks to computers. Moving was difficult, especially leaving my friends and family behind. But technology and computers have allowed me to maintain these relationships. For example, I haven't seen my extended family in [NUM3] [DATE1], and on many birthdays, the only family I can see are my parents.  In schools, computers are also invaluable. Students and teachers use them daily for learning. My friend [PERSON1] said about the Dell computers in the library, ""Whenever I don't understand something from class, I use the computer to gain a better understanding."" I use computers every day for schoolwork, whether it's researching or writing projects. Typing on a computer is fast and easy, which saves a lot of time compared to writing by hand.  Computers also make communication more efficient. Sending a message to my friends in [LOCATION2] via [CAPS7] takes only seconds, while using the [ORGANIZATION2] would take days.  In conclusion, computers have made our lives simpler. They are essential for staying in touch with others, learning, and performing daily tasks. A life without computers would be much more difficult."
909	911	1	2	In my opinion, computers have a positive impact on people. Millions of people use computers every day, and they bring several benefits.  Firstly, computers facilitate learning. Many job - related sites involve learning, and [NUM1] of college students take online courses. If you study in college online, you can see your family more often, avoid the hassle of commuting, and concentrate better when learning alone. There are also popular language - learning programs available on computers.  Secondly, computers are great for communication. [NUM2] of our daily communication occurs online. Social media platforms like Facebook allow us to connect with friends easily. I have a Facebook account, and it has been a great way to stay in touch.  In conclusion, computers have a lot of positive effects on users. Even while using computers, people can still enjoy nature and spend time with their families. If you don't have a computer, I suggest getting one so that you can experience all the fun and useful things it offers.
910	912	1	2	"[ORGANIZATION1], since the invention of computers, their usage has grown significantly. However, not everyone believes that this is beneficial to society. In my opinion, computers have a negative impact on people due to excessive usage, associated dangers, and reduced interaction with family and friends.  One major negative effect is the lack of exercise. Many children and adults spend too much time on the computer. A local [CAPS2] told [CAPS3], ""We have one family computer, and my son is on it from right after school until late at night."" I, too, sometimes lose track of time when using the computer. The hours spent on the computer could be used for exercise, which is crucial for good health.  Another concern is the many dangers associated with computers. Social media platforms like Facebook and video - chat apps like oovoo or Skype can be risky. Many young people are addicted to these platforms, and there is a risk of them engaging in dangerous activities with strangers. Researchers believe that these sites are [PERCENT1] dangerous to young teens.  Lastly, computers reduce face - to - face interaction with family and friends. Instead of having real get - togethers, people often choose to communicate online. I enjoy family parties and the joy of seeing relatives, but for many people, this has become less common. People are spending too much time on the computer, which takes away from the time they could spend interacting with others.  In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on people. They cause people to spend excessive time sitting, expose them to risks, and reduce social interaction. I strongly encourage everyone to consider these negative effects and use computers more responsibly."
911	913	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers do not benefit society. While it's true that computers offer a great avenue to learn about the world, individuals should focus on what is immediately around them. Spending excessive time on the computer reduces opportunities for exercise, limits the enjoyment of nature, and decreases the time spent interacting with family and friends.  Computers do not benefit everyone as they lead to less exercise. When people neglect exercise due to engaging in less important computer - related activities, they tend to feel constantly tired. They become lazy, preferring to sit idle. Without exercise, one's bones weaken, and the body fails to obtain the necessary calories, calcium, and vitamins for strength. This leads to weight gain and being out of shape, as the unburned weight and fat accumulate.  Using the computer also prevents people from experiencing nature as they should. They miss out on the real world and fun activities. When others talk about their enjoyable experiences, those glued to the computer will regret not being part of it. Staying indoors with the computer all the time becomes boring, with no real fun to be had.  Moreover, excessive computer use reduces interaction with family and friends. Family and friends are always there for support, and they are more important than computers. People may miss out on important family occasions because of computer addiction, and friends may stop spending time with them.  In conclusion, computers do not benefit the average person as they cause individuals to miss out on the more significant aspects of life, such as exercise, nature, and time with family and friends. Eventually, people will wish they had spent more time with their loved ones instead of being on the computer.
912	914	1	2	"The question of whether computers truly benefit society has been a complex one for years. Some argue that computers are highly beneficial, allowing us to view the world from different perspectives and facilitating learning through technological advancements. However, others contend that computers are addictive, and they are an unsafe and unsecure device, especially when personal files are stored on them while connected to the internet. Additionally, people are spending more time on computers than ever, missing out on time with family and friends and failing to enjoy nature and the simple pleasures of life.  In my opinion, computers should only be used as tools. As @PERSON2 said, ""Many people treat computers as personal diaries, file - storage devices, or gaming platforms, ignoring the fact that computers are designed to make life easier."" Whether it's a simple @CAPS1 (@ORGANIZATION1) or a complex supercomputer, their primary purpose is to simplify life. Even with upgrades, this purpose remains the same, yet people still view computers as the next big thing in entertainment.  Computers can actually turn against users and ruin their lives. Since @PERSON1 made @ORGANIZATION2 and popularized the @CAPS2 disk @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, computer use has increased significantly. It's not because of the fastest computer but because @ORGANIZATION2 is sold worldwide, being used in businesses, small companies, schools, and entertainment. The Xbox @NUM1 revolutionized gaming, but it also made people more addicted to entertainment. As a result, people become dependent on computers. With the internet on @CAPS2 computers, those who rely on them are at risk of being hacked and having their information stolen.  Another constant issue with computers is that family and friends find it difficult to communicate with those who spend all their time on computers. As @CAPS3 @PERSON3 said, ""@CAPS2 of the people without real friends chat online without knowing the true identities of the people they're talking to."" Making friends online is unsafe, and computers are highly addictive.  In conclusion, while computers have their uses, we need to be cautious of their negative impacts, such as addiction, security risks, and the breakdown of real - life relationships."
913	915	1	2	"Dear @LOCATION2, there is a dilemma regarding whether people support computer technology or not. I strongly believe that computers generally have a positive impact.  Firstly, many jobs rely on computers daily, and they are highly efficient. Jobs like those at @ORGANIZATION1 and in police work provide services to people across the United States and the world. My father always said, ""Computers save people every day."" Schools also use computers extensively. For example, at my school, @LOCATION1 school, my teacher, Mr. @CAPS4, uses his computer every morning in homeroom. Nearly @PERCENT1 of all jobs involve computers, whether for storing information or other purposes. We cannot afford to let people lose their jobs due to a lack of computer - related skills. Computers also contribute to a safe and healthy life for many.  Secondly, computers can perform tasks that other technologies cannot. They enable people to stay in touch with those far away, edit photos, and offer relaxing gaming experiences. @CAPS6 is a great example of staying connected. It was a lifesaver for me as it allowed me to communicate with my brother during his chaotic college life. Nearly @PERCENT2 of people have accounts on public websites like @CAPS7, @CAPS6, or @CAPS9. Computers also store and allow for photo editing, preserving memories that can be admired.  Thirdly, computers provide free access to education for both kids and adults. I remember playing amusing math games at my elementary school, which significantly enhanced my education. These types of educational games are widely used. In a tough economy, many adults are finding jobs online with the help of computers, which saves them from losing their homes.  In conclusion, computer technology has a strong positive effect on people. It is as essential as a pencil to a student. Jobs depend on it, it helps people connect, and it promotes education. That's why computers have a beneficial impact on people."
914	916	1	2	@ORGANIZATION1, I am of the opinion that the effects of computers on people are positive. Computers offer several advantages that contribute to personal development and a broader understanding of the world.  One of the positive effects is that people can learn hand - eye coordination through computer use. Hand - eye coordination is valuable in numerous situations, enhancing physical dexterity and reaction times.  Secondly, computers give people the ability to learn about far - away places and people. This is crucial as it allows individuals to learn about history and important figures, expanding their knowledge and cultural awareness.  Finally, computers enable people to communicate with others from all around the world. This interaction is useful as it allows people to learn about each other's customs, religions, cultures, and heritage, promoting cross - cultural understanding.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people. They facilitate the learning of hand - eye coordination, provide access to knowledge about distant places and people, and enable global communication. All these factors contribute to a more informed, connected, and well - rounded individual.
915	917	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I'm writing to express my view that computers have a positive influence on people. In today's digital age, computers have become an integral part of our lives, offering numerous benefits that enhance our learning, communication, and entertainment experiences.  First, computers are a powerful learning tool. They provide access to a vast amount of information from around the world, allowing us to explore different subjects and expand our knowledge. Whether it's researching a school project, learning a new language, or studying a historical event, computers offer a wealth of resources at our fingertips. For example, online courses and educational platforms have made it possible for people of all ages to learn new skills and gain valuable knowledge from the comfort of their own homes.  Second, computers have revolutionized communication. They enable us to connect with people from different parts of the world in real - time, breaking down geographical barriers and fostering global relationships. Social media platforms, email, and video conferencing tools have made it easier than ever to stay in touch with friends, family, and colleagues, regardless of where they are located. This has not only strengthened our personal relationships but also facilitated collaboration and teamwork in the professional world.  Finally, computers offer a wide range of entertainment options. From playing video games and watching movies to listening to music and reading e - books, computers provide endless hours of entertainment. They also allow us to express our creativity through various digital art forms, such as graphic design, photography, and video editing.  In conclusion, computers have a profound positive impact on people's lives. They enhance our learning, communication, and entertainment experiences, making our lives more convenient, connected, and enjoyable. While it's important to use computers responsibly and balance our screen time with other activities, there's no denying the many benefits they offer.
916	918	1	2	"To the relevant parties, in my view, computers have significantly enhanced our lives. Thus, I firmly believe that owning and using a computer serves the greater good. Three reasons support this stance. Firstly, computers enable us to find information rapidly and effortlessly. This ability allows us to be more productive. For instance, if you're working on a report about @CAPS1 @CAPS2, you could either spend hours at the library searching through numerous books and newspapers or simply sit at your computer, open a web - browser, and type ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" into the search box. In seconds, you'll access a vast amount of information from multiple sources, including libraries, newspapers, and other computers. You can also find information in various forms such as videos, old newscasts, interviews, and documentaries. Secondly, computers facilitate connections with people in distant places. While some might suggest using the phone, computers offer more functionality. You can share photos, videos, and games. Recently, I joined Facebook and reconnected with people I hadn't seen in years. During the @DATE1, I went to my @CAPS3, where my dad introduced me to his uncle who shared my name. Months later, I received a friend request from a @CAPS4 in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4. After chatting, I learned he was my dad's uncle's son. Without my computer, this connection wouldn't have been possible. Additionally, I've been learning new skills, and I can collaborate with friends via the computer, video - taping and posting content without them being physically present. Finally, computers help us learn how to improve our lives and the planet. Contrary to the belief that excessive computer use leads to laziness and weight gain, I've actually enhanced my exercise routine. After a run, I can use the computer to find out how far I ran, how many calories I burned, and discover new and effective exercises. We can also use computers to study weather patterns, stay informed about global news, and learn about different cultures. For example, on the day of the earthquake in @LOCATION2, I learned about it on my computer's homepage. In conclusion, computers have brought about a substantial improvement in human lives. They empower us to acquire knowledge and enhance our daily experiences. I hope this letter aids you in making a decision regarding the impact of computers on people's lives."
917	919	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1, I understand the current situation regarding the impact of computers on our society and people's reactions to them. My question is, who is unaware of their influence? Computers have a highly positive effect on our town. They assist in developing hand - eye coordination. They also provide people with the opportunity to communicate with distant relatives without the need for costly travel. Moreover, computers can perform various tasks electronically, storing a vast amount of data on their hard drives. Let me elaborate on these reasons. Computers are beneficial for our society as they help both kids and adults develop hand - eye coordination. To illustrate, in football, catching a ball teaches this skill, but it may result in players getting knocked down. In baseball, swinging at a pitch can also teach the skill, but there's a risk of getting hit by the ball or hitting others. Computers offer a safer way to develop this skill. Even @CAPS1 @PERSON1 in our town has noticed an improvement in kids' hand - eye coordination due to computer use. Computers allow people to communicate with relatives in far - off places without having to travel. You can have meaningful conversations with them, which is a great advantage. Another reason is that computers can perform many tasks electronically with speed and ease. There is a vast amount of data that can be stored on a computer's hard drive. Before my family had a computer, we had a room dedicated to important papers and files. Now, with the computer, that room is empty as everything is stored digitally. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on our society. They help develop hand - eye coordination, enable long - distance communication, and efficiently store data. I hope this letter convinces you of the positive effects of computers on our community. After reading this, I encourage you to spread the word about the benefits of computers. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.
918	920	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, are you aware of the negative impacts computers are having on the people of @LOCATION1? I am, and I believe we need to address these issues. Firstly, computers are preventing people from getting enough exercise. They are one of the main culprits behind weight gain. Kids often spend all day on the computer, munching on junk food instead of healthy fruits and vegetables. Technology has advanced to the point where almost everything you do in daily life can be done on the computer. This makes it easy for people to become addicted. Computers offer games, internet access, and communication tools that keep people glued to the screen. Secondly, computers are a significant drain on people's finances. When buying a computer, most people are persuaded by salesmen to purchase the most expensive one, even though they may not know what they truly need. They assume that the more expensive the computer, the better it is. Additionally, downloading software, games, and mobile applications all come at a cost. A single download can cost up to one hundred dollars, and many people can't afford these additional expenses after buying a pricey computer. Thirdly, computers are a complete waste of time. People spend hours on the computer doing unproductive things like playing games and chatting, when they should be outside enjoying the fresh air. Going outside is crucial for one's health. The next time you find yourself on the computer doing something unnecessary, step outside. Consider how often you actually go outside. I suspect it's not very often. In conclusion, computers are having a detrimental effect on the people of @LOCATION1. They are making people fat, causing financial strain, and wasting people's time. Instead of spending all day on the computer, we should prioritize outdoor activities and make more informed decisions when it comes to computer use. My advice is that computers are terrible and their negative impacts should not be ignored.
919	921	1	2	I firmly believe that computers bring numerous benefits to society and help people gain a clearer understanding of things. They assist people in studying, learning, and communicating with others. Computers provide access to information that is not readily available in books. People can look up vacation destinations, check their children's school grades, and find healthy food recipes. Without computers, people would be at a loss in many situations. Computers also enable communication with friends. You can discuss various topics such as the weather, share ideas, and even plan exercise days. In case of an important event, if someone doesn't have their phone, they can use the computer to inform their friends. This is much more convenient than driving to their friend's house and back. Moreover, computers help develop hand - eye coordination. They can teach you to type without looking at the keyboard, a skill that can be useful in a career in the carpentry field. They also assist in studying for a new job and understanding its requirements. In conclusion, computers make people's lives easier by providing them with essential information at their fingertips. They support people in various aspects of their lives, whether it's communicating with friends, gathering information, or learning new skills.
920	922	1	2	To whom it may concern, more and more people are embracing computer use. While some oppose this trend, I firmly believe that using a computer is a positive development. Technology is advancing, and computers are the foundation of this progress. They are also safer due to privacy options and virus blockers. Additionally, computers are a vast source of knowledge. As technology evolves, computers are becoming the norm in various fields. In the job market, there is an increasing use of computers and touch - screen devices due to their convenience and advanced technology. In schools, students are required to take computer classes to learn how to create brochures and build websites. The medical field is using more advanced ultrasounds that can generate three - dimensional images. Given these changes, it's unwise to resist progress and stay in the past. Some people worry about internet safety and viruses, but these concerns can be mitigated. On social networking sites, set your profile to be visible only to friends and ensure you know who your friends are. To avoid viruses, avoid suspicious websites and use a virus blocker. Computers are also a great source of knowledge. You can learn about current civilizations and modern - day life without leaving your home. The internet offers virtual simulations that allow you to experience different cultures and time periods. They are especially useful for those without easy access to a library. In conclusion, despite the opposition of some, I firmly believe that computers are the cornerstone of technology, are safe to use, and are filled with knowledge. Although they have some flaws, they are an excellent learning tool.
921	923	1	2	Dear @PERSON1, experts are worried about people's computer usage. They note that individuals spend long hours on computers, reducing time for exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I concur with this view. When people are on computers, they don't interact with new people in person. They stay indoors, get little exercise, and kids may talk to strangers. When using computers, we chat with friends online but don't truly interact with others. We meet new people online and chat without ever meeting them in real - life for socializing, which is a drawback of computers. Another issue is the lack of exercise. While on the computer, we spend a significant amount of time and may even forget to exercise, gradually leading to poor health. A major problem is chatting with strangers. Some may meet random people online and share personal information. Kids might even meet the strangers they've talked to online and get hurt. Thank you for reading my thoughts on computers. I hope you'll consider them. Both kids and adults face problems of reduced social interaction, lack of exercise, and sharing personal info with strangers due to computer use.
922	924	1	2	Dear Newspaper, some people are inquiring about the impact of computers on individuals. Certain experts are concerned that people are spending excessive time on computers, leaving less time for exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. However, in my opinion, computers are excellent and do not prevent people from engaging in other activities. Firstly, computers do not keep people away from other activities because there are 24 hours in a day. It is an individual's responsibility if they do not step away from the computer to engage in other activities. Despite the computer having numerous interesting features, people should have the common sense to take breaks and do other things. Thus, it is their fault if they do not get off the computer. Moreover, there are multiple reasons why people do not engage in other activities, so singling out computers is unjust. Secondly, computers do not keep people from other activities as there are many distractions that have the same effect. For example, television also distracts people from other activities, yet there is no call to stop using it. Additionally, computers can teach people a great deal and show them things they are trying to discover, such as family history. Lastly, if people are truly concerned about their other activities, they should get off the computer and do what needs to be done. For instance, if they need to go to the gym, they should leave the computer and go. The computer does not make a person fat; it is the individual's choice. Similarly, if one wants to spend time with family, the computer should not be an obstacle. In conclusion, computers do not keep people away from other activities. It is an individual's responsibility to remember what they need to do, and there are many distractions other than computers. The fault lies with the person, not the computer.
923	925	1	2	To whom it may concern, I was at home when I realized that this situation had to end. The computer has taken my mother and step - father away from me. When they are on Facebook, they seem to be in another world. Our family spends no time together at all. Moreover, they argue, don't sleep well, and again, we have no family time. Spending time with family is crucial, and social activity is beneficial for everyone. Even if it's not with family, socializing plays a very important role. Arguing, on the other hand, is not good as it reduces the time spent on social interaction. In my family, arguing creates so much friction that we become less social and turn to the computer. If we are arguing about the computer, the problem becomes even bigger, and the arguing seems never - ending. Lack of sleep is my biggest worry. When they stay up all night on the computer, it's clear they have bad days during school. I know this for a fact. Computers cause my parents to sacrifice family time, fight, and lose sleep. They spend more time on the personal computer than with me. @CITY1 @PERSON1, we clearly have a very big problem here.
924	926	1	2	I firmly believe that people spend an excessive amount of time on computers. Spending hours on the computer can lead to poor eyesight. The bright lights of the screen make the eyes unclear, and more people lose their eyesight from looking at a computer than from staring at a light. As people sit in front of the screen for countless hours, their eyesight gradually deteriorates. Additionally, sitting in front of the screen means getting little exercise. One mostly just moves their hands and fingers. If people do not exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, they will become weak. Lastly, teenagers often struggle to complete their homework because of computer use. When they are in their rooms, they are likely on the computer. Spending too much time on the computer increases the likelihood of failing classes and repeating a grade. In conclusion, if people continue to spend so much time on computers, most will lose their eyesight, become unhealthy, and teenagers will fail to do their homework and achieve academic success.
925	927	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I agree with some professionals who believe that computers prevent people from exercising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with friends and family. Some people think it's cool to be on the computer all day. In reality, a computer with internet access is like having a world of distractions at one's fingertips. You can find almost anything on the internet these days. Some people use the internet for homework, and sometimes they can find exact answers to assignments, which makes them more dependent on technology. If the world becomes increasingly reliant on computers, it could lead to various problems. The world is suffering as people neglect to pick up trash and take action against @ORGANIZATION2. Instead of taking action, most people are on the computer. People are becoming lazier as all they need to do for entertainment is sit with minimal movement. As a result, they neglect exercise, proper eating, and spending time with friends and family. Instead of just texting or messaging someone, try calling them. When you're free, make plans to visit your family. I simply ask that you, especially, spend time with family because while you can always make new friends or get a new computer, you can't get a new family.
926	928	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, there is a view among @CAPS2 people that the drawbacks of computers exceed the benefits. However, in my opinion, computers bring far more help than harm. Although there are a few cases where computers have had a negative impact on people, there are many more instances where they have been beneficial to @CAPS2 individuals. For example, some accident victims have recovered with the assistance of computers. Moreover, computers enable close family members or friends to communicate with each other via the @CAPS3. People can also learn about fascinating places through computers. Therefore, computers are extremely important to us.  Computers are vital as they improve our reflexes. As a computer engineer, I have found that using or playing on a computer can aid victims of accidents that have damaged their reflexes. A computer helps the victim by enhancing their perception of the environment. Both the victim and the doctors can clearly see what the victim is doing. Similar to physical treatment, computers can also provide relief, making the patient stronger both physically and mentally. Thus, computers enhance human life by improving reflexes.  In addition to helping with reflexes, computers with the @CAPS3 allow people who are far apart to connect. One such example is the connection between soldiers and their families. During my military service, nothing was more helpful than communication, and the easiest way was through the computer. It brought me great comfort. Therefore, computers are essential to humans.  Furthermore, computers enable us to explore amazing places. For instance, a @NUM1 - year - old boy visited a website about the wonders of the @LOCATION1 rainforest. He then shared this knowledge with his science class, and the news of forest preservation spread. Eventually, the boy grew up to become an explorer of the @LOCATION1, discovering new species. All this was made possible because of the computer. Computers help us uncover the unseen.  In conclusion, computers are excellent when used properly. They assist victims in healing, help soldiers stay connected with their families, and inspire the youth. Computers are a crucial source of knowledge and progress for humanity.
927	929	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers offer significant benefits to society. I own a computer myself, and it is highly important and useful to me. More than @PERCENT1 of the families in our town own at least one computer.  Computers are an outstanding source of information. Unlike books, which require effort to find and purchase, a vast amount of information is just a mouse - click away. Suppose you want to conduct research on @PERSON1. If you were to use books, you would have to go to the library and search for a relevant one. What if there was no book about @PERSON1? With a computer, you can type ""@CAPS2 of @PERSON1"" into a search engine and obtain a wealth of information in less than a minute. I appreciate the time - saving aspect of computers, and they also expand the scope of the information I access.  Another remarkable aspect of computer technology is the ability to communicate with others regardless of their location. Email is much faster than writing a letter and eliminates the need to pay for travel. Who wouldn't like that?  Computers are also very convenient. You can surf the internet, communicate with people, and perform many other tasks from the comfort of your bedroom. There are even jobs that can be done from home using a computer. My uncle, a stockbroker, operates his entire job from the computer in his house. It is a convenient and well - paying job. When I asked him about his job, he said, ""I love my job because I can work at my own pace and from the comfort of my home."" I would definitely like to have such a job.  In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial to us. Did you know that computers were first invented by @ORGANIZATION1 to perform long - term calculations? Look at how they have evolved by @DATE1. They provide information at astonishing speeds, enable global communication, and are extremely convenient. These are significant advantages for society, and everyone should embrace computers."
928	930	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I am of the opinion that computers have a positive influence on people as they facilitate interaction, learning, and coordination.  Regarding interaction, computers allow us to communicate with far - away friends or make new acquaintances. If friends are at a distance, we can exchange photos to keep track of each other's lives. Family is also an important aspect. If we haven't seen a family member, we can learn about their progress. Moreover, we can meet new people through computers, which enriches our social connections and builds trust.  In terms of learning, computers are beneficial for both adults and children. For children, computers can teach them new words, colors, shapes, and sizes. Adults can use computers to learn the meanings of new words. All these learning resources are available on the computer.  Computers also have a positive impact on physical aspects such as coordination. Typing on a computer can strengthen our hands, which are useful in many ways. Sitting upright in front of a computer all day can improve our posture, straightening our backs. Focusing on the computer screen can also enhance our mental concentration.  However, it should be noted that while many people recognize the benefits of computers, there are also those who hold negative views. But overall, the positive effects of computers on people are undeniable.  In conclusion, computers play a positive role in our lives by helping us interact, learn, and improve our physical and mental states, despite the existence of different opinions.
929	931	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have both positive and negative impacts on people. Some individuals spend all day sitting around playing games and being lazy, while others use computers for necessary tasks. Some people even rely on computers for their jobs.  I agree that those who spend excessive time in front of the computer exercise less. For me, I would rather spend quality time with family and friends outdoors, like having a picnic at a park or a lake, instead of playing games all day.  However, for many others, computers and technological advancements are essential for their daily lives. Many jobs today, such as working at a bank, require the use of computers throughout the day. Students also rely on computers for their schoolwork. They type up reports and search for information on the internet, which is a valuable source for them. I have personally found the internet useful for school projects and simple word look - ups.  I can understand why some people are not interested in technological advancements or computers. Some people don't need them, and others think people use them too much.  For me, computers are useful because I can talk to my family in @LOCATION1 online.  In conclusion, computers are useful to some people but not to everyone. Their impact varies depending on how individuals use them. It is important to strike a balance between computer use and other aspects of life such as social interaction and physical activity.
930	932	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, in today's society, people of all ages are overly focused on the latest technology, especially computers. We need to break this habit and engage in other activities. People are spending too much time on computers and less time enjoying nature, exercising, and interacting with friends and family.  Think about it. Are you feeling that time is passing by quickly and you're missing out on the beauty of nature? If so, stop using the computer so much and go outside. Nature is incredibly beautiful, like the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 with pink sand. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 people complain that they rarely experience the outside world. You won't be able to witness the changing seasons if you don't go outdoors. A mother said, ""I want my @CAPS6 to experience nature as she grows up."" But if @CAPS6 doesn't take her eyes off the computer screen, she won't get much exposure to nature.  Computers are indeed very intelligent and offer a lot, but if you want to miss out on the discovery of new trees every day, that's your choice. @PERCENT2 of the population in the @LOCATION2 is overweight due to technology, with the computer having the greatest impact. High - paid physicians advise parents to encourage their children to play sports and exercise instead of staying home and playing video games. Would you rather have a healthy exercise and have plenty of energy or slowly gain weight and develop health issues while surfing the internet?  I remember on @DATE1, I put on my Nike high - tops, took my pink iPod, and started jogging slowly while listening to my favorite song. I felt amazing after the jog. Going for a jog every day is as healthy as having a balanced breakfast.  A parent, @CAPS8 @PERSON1, told the press, ""@CAPS7 since technology became part of our lives, my two daughters haven't visited their grandparents in over @NUM1 years! This has to change."" Although computers have online - talking devices like @CAPS9, it's a bad habit if you never spend quality time with family. On @DATE3, @DATE2, my brother and I were so engrossed in the computer that we missed a family birthday party.  In conclusion, we are addicted to computers and need to spend more time with our loved ones and in nature. It's up to us to make the right choice and ensure that the population of @LOCATION1 stays healthy and happy."
931	933	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers have positive impacts on individuals and society. Firstly, the internet and search engines enable users to learn and obtain information on any topic. One can even pose questions and likely receive answers. Statistics indicate that @PERCENT1 of people doing reports source their facts from the internet. Search platforms like Google and Yahoo have piqued children's interest in learning. Secondly, computers facilitate communication with people from distant locations or those one hasn't seen in a while. Webcamming is also an option. I recall my best friend moving to Florida a few weeks ago, and now we webchat daily. Online communication can reduce telephone bills as it's cost - free, unlike international phone calls. Finally, computers teach skills applicable in later life. Many jobs today involve computer use, and technology is advancing rapidly. One will likely need computer skills in college. Professor @CAPS2 stated that every student in his courses has a computer. In college, students take notes and complete assignments using computers, which simplifies their academic lives. In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial to people and society as they offer access to information, enable long - distance communication, and teach valuable skills. With technology advancing, computer use will become inevitable.
932	934	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, the question of whether computers are truly as great as they seem is a valid one. It appears that computers are overused in people's lives, serving as distractions that prevent individuals from engaging in certain activities. People's lives are increasingly centered around using the computer, checking Facebook, and watching videos on @CAPS2.com. I know from personal experience that Facebook and @CAPS3 can be extremely addictive. I've spent hours commenting on pictures and wall posts, only to realize at @NUM1 pm that I haven't started my homework. This often leads me to stay awake until around @NUM2. The next morning, I wake up at @NUM3 am, exhausted. This isn't just a problem for kids; my mom got a Facebook account and is more hooked than I am. Sometimes, it turns into a competition to have the most pictures or friends, and kids add strangers as friends. Computers are not only distractions but also dangerous. At my school, an assembly showed how easy it is to obtain someone's personal information. Even without listing an address or phone number, there are other ways to track a person. For example, a picture of a student after a soccer championship can reveal their team name, last name, and number, allowing anyone to find out about their next game. As the local newspaper @CAPS1, you should be concerned about the town's safety and your own kids. Some people say ""that would never happen to me,"" but it's possible, especially with constant computer use. I've noticed that many teens are becoming obsessed with the computer, and siblings often fight over computer access. One may need it for homework while the other wants to chat with friends. In conclusion, computers negatively impact people's lives as they are distracting, dangerous, and harmful to family relationships. It's advisable to monitor how much time kids spend on the computer."
933	935	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1 newspaper, I believe computers have both good and bad aspects. On one hand, computers keep some people indoors more than usual. On the other hand, they allow us to communicate with long - lost family members, search for upcoming events and check for cancellations, and look up other information like movie showtimes. Computers are also essential in school. Without them, studying would be difficult, and many teachers assign homework that requires computer use. However, there are drawbacks. My friend used to spend most of the day playing video games on his computer. He would ignore everyone, including his parents, and barely come down for dinner, often having his laptop beside him. His parents got tired of this and took away his TV and laptop, encouraging him to play outside with friends. After a while, he started going outside more often. When they gave his devices back, he only uses them on rainy days. In conclusion, while computers offer many benefits, their overuse can have negative impacts on people's social and physical lives.
934	936	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2, in our proud and courageous country of @LOCATION1, more and more people are using computers. Computers were designed to simplify difficult tasks such as typing, information - finding, and financial record - keeping. However, many @CAPS3 citizens are using computers for non - essential purposes, leading to a loss of time for a healthy, social life. This includes exercise and spending time with family and friends. I hope you, the @CAPS4, can understand why computer use has become excessive and relay this message to your readers. Exercise is crucial for a healthy life, but due to modern computers, many children are suffering from obesity. In my school, I know at least four young students who are victims of this disease. The reason is simple: they overuse computers, starting from the moment they get home until they fall asleep. This excessive computer time takes away the time they should spend exercising, causing their bodies to adopt sedentary habits. As a result, they are picked on for being overweight and have no strength to defend themselves. Another issue is the lack of time spent with family and friends. I used to walk home from school to enjoy the fresh air. However, people who abuse computer use often don't see the importance of social interaction. Around two years ago, I was constantly on the computer, playing video games. This led to me losing time with my family. When I needed to contact friends, I would message them instead of speaking in person. Both my family and friends grew distant because of my computer use. Fortunately, I've changed. In conclusion, computers are having a negative impact on @LOCATION1's youth. I hope you will publish a column in the @CAPS1 newspaper about the importance of limiting computer use to regain time for exercise, nature, and socializing. Thank you for considering my letter, and I look forward to an article on this subject.
935	937	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2, more and more people in our proud and courageous country of @LOCATION1 have been. Computers were mode to simply difficult situations, such as typing, finding, , and keeping a record of financial statuses. Despite the main uses, many @CAPS3 citizens have been using the computer for that are neccessary which result in a loss of to living a healthy, social, life. these are exercisem and spending line with fellow people indicating family and friends. as a result, please read on so that you, the @CAPS4 our can understand why computers have became out of hand and relay my message to the readers of your. One much life is exercise, and due to the of modern computers, exercise is the key to a healthy life. Personally, I know at least poor young children in my very school that are a victim of the cruel disease, known as obesity. The reason for the dese children is quite simple-they over use, and forget the natural bounderies to using something. Practically every day, each of the foor heart- children begin to their computers from the second will home, to the moment they fall asleep. this outrageous number of hours the vital the to exercise, therefore allows their bodies to adopt to the habits of the children sleep, eat, computer. This upselling manor of the foor kids enables others to pick on them for being fat, yet they can't fight back, they have what so ever, thus the over use of computers can result in a over weight child, with no exercise, and no power/ muscle to depend themselves from. Another reason whay computers are thinking such a @LOCATION1's youth, is because of less than medicine usage of. Everyday I chose to walk from school, for the breathly sounds of type of wheather day should I hope you I @CAPS5, spending time with your friend and family yet ones again people who abuse see the importance of this. Around two years ago, I was on the computer non-stop, @CAPS6, playing video games, and all sorts of computer-released activities. every day, constantly, for about a year, I came home, to on the computer, and began my , as I @LOCATION2. This resulted loosing the time I had with my mosue. Furthermore, if I needed is contact @MONTH1 friends, I just @CAPS7 them, rather than speaking in person,. Over line both my family and friends and grow of this electronic device, called the computer luckily, @ORGANIZATION1 nothing like that now however, I hope that you see the side to the computer, and how loosing your family and friends possibly. In conclusion, @ORGANIZATION1 guarantee that with all the information about how are out. Hopefully you will the paper of @CAPS1 of our newspaper and demand a column about computer loose the valuable time for exercise, nature, and family & friends. Thank you for letter, and I will an article relative to this subject.
936	938	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, as a member of the tech - generation, for whom technology has become synonymous with life, our existence orbits around technology just as @LOCATION3 orbits around the sun. Computers, our primary technological preference, offer numerous benefits, contrary to the speculations of many. They are invaluable tools that enable us to survive and thrive in this challenging world. If you wish to criticize computers, you are free to do so. However, without a comprehensive understanding of their multifaceted nature, your stance lacks credibility. Some may claim that computers are a nuisance, yet they may have never truly used one. Others might argue that computers can be used to detonate bombs, but let's be realistic. How many ordinary people wake up, lament the dullness of life, and then type a command to detonate a bomb? One significant advantage that you seem to overlook is the wealth of information computers present on a @NUM1 - inch screen. You can access book reviews, read books, make purchases, and stay updated with the latest news, to name just a few of their capabilities. Moreover, not everything you perceive as negative is necessarily so. When you think of @CAPS3, do you only envision vulgar, inappropriate, or illegal content? In fact, @CAPS3 helps families stay connected, provides entertainment, and allows friends in different states to interact on the same platform. YouTube is not just about swear - words and bad videos. My family casts actors for shows, and they often assess an actor's abilities by viewing their YouTube channels. My mother even contacts actors in the videos to explore professional opportunities, a practice that uncovers hidden talent. Lastly, have you considered that computers are instrumental in starting businesses and saving lives? Astrologists use computers to analyze images of the universe captured by the Hubble Space Telescope, meteorologists track cloud formations via satellite data, surgeons can remotely conduct operations, and seismologists monitor tectonic plate movements to predict earthquake epicenters. In conclusion, computers are undeniably important. You may have used them for your limited research, or perhaps you didn't conduct any research at all and simply blamed the innocent. It's time to recognize the true value of computers.
937	939	1	2	I firmly believe that having a computer is beneficial. You can conduct research and connect with people through chatting. Computers play a crucial role in society as they assist in managing information, such as doctor appointments and criminal records for the police. However, there are drawbacks. Spending excessive time on the computer can harm your eyes. On the positive side, it allows you to stay in touch with friends who have moved away through platforms like MySpace, Facebook, or Yahoo Chat. Computers are useful in various aspects of life. Nevertheless, they can also cause problems. For instance, spending too much time on them may lead to insufficient sleep, especially for students. Prolonged use and sitting too close to the screen can cause eye strain and may even result in the need for glasses. In my view, moderation is key. Spending some time on the computer is good, but over - indulgence can be detrimental. I hope you agree with this balanced perspective.
938	940	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I oppose the widespread availability of computers because they can lead children to engage in negative behaviors. For example, they may become rude, disobedient, loud, and neglect their homework. Let me share my personal experiences. Every @NUM1 minutes, my mom checks what I'm doing on the computer because there is inappropriate content that children might access, and they could potentially learn harmful things. When I'm on the computer, I become rude and disrespectful. My attention is completely focused on the screen, and I ignore my mom's requests. I often turn up the volume so that no one can distract me. I also tend to lie about finishing my homework. I tell my mom I'm using the computer to do schoolwork, but I end up doing other things instead. This shows that computers can disrupt a child's academic focus. In light of these issues, I believe society should reconsider the unrestricted distribution of computers. I hope you understand my reasons and recognize that it's time to take action to limit children's access to computers.
939	941	1	2	"The question of whether @CAPS1 computers benefit our society has sparked a lively debate in our town. I am firmly of the opinion that computers are essential in our modern world. Take @PERSON1, a @NUM1 - year - old from @ORGANIZATION1, who has been working overseas in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 for two years. One of the few ways she can stay in touch with her father is through @ORGANIZATION3. Communication is the lifeblood of society, and computers offer a variety of means to connect people. @ORGANIZATION3 allows for a ""visual phone conversation."" @PERSON2, whose wife has passed away, says that with @ORGANIZATION3, he can not only hear his daughter's voice but also see her face every day, which always brings a smile to his face. @CAPS5 and instant messaging also provide fast and easy communication. Whether it's sending invitations, announcements, or just a simple greeting, these tools are incredibly useful. Thus, computers are vital for maintaining social connections. Computers also play a significant role in education. The look of excitement on a child's face when they learn something new is priceless, and computers contribute to this experience. Programs like @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS6) teach toddlers and children reading, writing, and speaking. @PERSON3, a @LOCATION1 resident, shares that her child's reading and writing skills have impressed teachers after using @CAPS6 programs. Moreover, adults can also learn a great deal from computers, with @PERCENT1 of their knowledge about the environment, politics, and other basic information coming from computer - based sources. Finally, computers teach balance. A @LOCATION1 mom notes that her teenager @PERSON4 has learned to balance computer use with other aspects of life, which also translates into better management of extracurricular activities at school. This shows that students can develop a sense of responsibility through computer use. In conclusion, since computers facilitate communication, offer educational opportunities, and teach balance, it's clear that they are indispensable for our society."
940	942	1	2	"I am writing to express my concerns about the increasing use of computers. Based on my research, computers have both positive and negative aspects, but in my opinion, the negatives far outweigh the positives. Computers are often considered useful for research, but there are alternative sources such as books. The widespread use of computers has reached a critical point because they are highly addictive. For example, @CAPS2, a popular social platform, can distract children from their homework. At an @ORGANIZATION1 on @DATE1, it was found that there is a @PERCENT1 chance that a child doing ""homework"" on the computer will end up on @CAPS2 instead. Online computer games are another source of addiction. They may be entertaining, but they are a waste of electricity and a distraction from a child's educational goals. Computers also have a detrimental impact on health. @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 residents have gained weight due to excessive video - game and computer use. Spending more time on the computer and less time exercising leads to weight gain and is closely related to addiction. In terms of social life, computers can be a disaster. By spending too much time on the computer, people start to think that computers are all they need, and they neglect their friends. This addiction to computers damages one's social environment. In conclusion, I believe that computers are a waste of time and resources. They are addictive, make people unhealthy, and harm their social lives. Given the evidence I've presented, it's clear that relying on computers is not a good choice. I encourage you to consider using books instead."
941	943	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, computers are an essential asset for every household. In today's fast - paced world, having a computer at home simplifies numerous aspects of life. It can be utilized for research, organization, and business operations. I truly cannot envision life without one.  Education holds great significance, especially in the current economic climate. A computer streamlines work and study. When researching a school topic, turning on the computer grants access to an extensive library of information. One can obtain information from books and encyclopedias, but it is often difficult to find the time to visit a local library. Moreover, when there is a school project to type, having a home computer eliminates the need to rush. This allows more time to seek additional guidance from teachers, such as for playing an instrument in the school band. I firmly believe my grades would suffer if I did not have access to the internet at home.  Have you ever written a paper or document and encountered an issue? If you own a computer, you can back up your work. Imagine writing a five - page essay; it is a tedious task, but it would be worth it if it saves you from hours of writing. For some, a computer can be a source of income. Running an online business avoids the hassle and high cost of maintaining a physical space. Additionally, online shopping saves time and money on gas as items are delivered to your doorstep. In today's economy, any means of saving money is valuable.  In conclusion, a computer can enhance education, keep you organized, and save money. Beyond its practical uses, it also offers recreational value. It is perfectly reasonable to go online and chat with friends occasionally.
942	944	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that an increasing number of people are turning to computers because they can be a lifesaver when it comes to finding a job. Currently, some industries are facing difficulties, and parents may struggle to support their families due to unemployment.   Another advantage is that with the rising prices of cars, computers allow you to find great deals on cars and trucks online, which can save a significant amount of money.   Also, a considerable number of people, specifically @NUM1 out of @NUM2, like to travel to far - off places such as @CAPS2 or @LOCATION1, @CAPS3. When traveling, one needs a comfortable place to stay with good food, nice beds, and amenities like pools. A computer can help you find the perfect hotel.   Moreover, if your parents want you to attend a public school but you have reservations, you can search online for excellent schools like @CAPS4, cap pre, classicle, brizzal, and others. These schools can offer a great education and set you up for a successful life.  In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives. They offer solutions to various problems and open up new opportunities. Everyone should embrace technology as it provides us with the means to learn and make the most of our lives.
943	945	1	2	Dear Newspaper, in my opinion, computers have a highly positive impact on people. They enable individuals to learn about distant places, facilitate online communication, and even assist in job - hunting.  Computers are a great tool for learning about far - off destinations. For instance, if someone plans to visit @LOCATION1, they can use the computer to research the local language, purchase tickets, and discover interesting attractions in that country. This makes travel planning much easier and more informed.  Online communication is another significant benefit of computers. It helps families stay connected and allows people to reconnect with old friends, like through Facebook. It also provides an opportunity to make new friends.   Computers are also invaluable in the job market. They can help you find job openings, assist you in performing better at your current job, and even increase your chances of getting a promotion.  In conclusion, computers are an amazing and positive technology. They offer a wealth of information about different places, provide a platform for communication, and support career development. Their positive impact on people's lives is undeniable.
944	946	1	2	According to the @ORGANIZATION1 government, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 spend @NUM1 hours or more on a computer each day. A study indicates that this excessive computer use is causing several problems.  Firstly, people are not getting enough exercise. Since more people are glued to their computers, @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 have become obese. Take the example of @CAPS6. A few years ago, @CAPS6 was fit and healthy. But after a friend introduced @CAPS6 to a website, @CAPS6 started spending @NUM2 minutes on it every day. After @NUM1 months, @CAPS6 became obese due to a sedentary lifestyle and a diet of junk food while on the computer. When @CAPS6 tried out for the school baseball team on @DATE1, @CAPS6 failed because of being out of shape. Fortunately, @CAPS6 then returned to a healthy lifestyle of eating well and exercising, and is now in good shape for sports.  Secondly, people are not spending enough time with their families. Many jobs require long hours on the computer, causing individuals to lose sight of what truly matters. A couple of years ago, there was a @CAPS6 who was about to play in the championship game of his life. @CAPS6 reminded his dad repeatedly, but when the game started, his dad was nowhere to be seen in the crowd. His team lost the game, and since then, his dad has cut down on computer use and now attends all of @CAPS6's games.  Finally, people are not enjoying their lives. They prefer to be on the computer rather than engaging in activities they love. One @CAPS6 used to play basketball with friends but stopped when getting into computers. When @CAPS6 tried out for the school team, @CAPS6 failed because @CAPS6 had forgotten how to play. After that, @CAPS6 quit the computer and returned to basketball, and now @CAPS6 makes the team.  In conclusion, it's a crucial decision whether to waste your life on a computer or live it to the fullest. We should choose to live an active and fulfilling life rather than being trapped by the computer.
945	947	1	2	Dear Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1 has a science essay on plants due tomorrow. Since @ORGANIZATION1 was absent on @DATE1, @ORGANIZATION1 was unaware of the assignment. If @ORGANIZATION1 had a computer, @ORGANIZATION1 could check the school website, but the town has removed computers. Another student, @LOCATION1, is working on the same essay, but her poor handwriting may affect her grade.  Some people argue that computers are not beneficial to society, but in reality, life without them would be a disaster. The town of New @CAPS1 is considering removing computers, which would cause significant problems.  Computers are essential for obtaining information. People rely on search engines like Google and Yahoo to find answers. For example, when I encounter a knowledge gap, I turn to the internet. Without it, my homework would lack the depth and detail. Also, when an earthquake hit @LOCATION2, people were able to access information within seconds, which led to numerous fund - raising activities. And teenagers can catch up on their favorite @CAPS2 shows if they miss them.  Communication is another area where computers shine. In my family, email is crucial. My mom plans everything via email and even emails herself to remember tasks. Facebook is a great platform for friends to discuss daily events, and it is a safe and convenient alternative to phone calls. AIM allows instant messaging and video - chatting, enabling friends to share outfits and other items.  In conclusion, society needs computers for both information - gathering and communication. Whether it's students looking for educational resources, adults coordinating work and family life, or teenagers staying connected with friends, computers play an irreplaceable role. The town of New @CAPS1 should reconsider its decision to remove computers.
946	948	1	2	I am extremely delighted as I've just completed my school report on @PERSON1 without leaving my home. I was able to engage with a classmate online, asking her questions and obtaining all the necessary information from my computer. Additionally, I took an online course to learn how to row a boat, which I'll demonstrate to my class to show how @LOCATION1 crossed the @CAPS1 river.  Computers have remarkable impacts on our daily lives. Local research indicates that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 planning their vacations use the internet to gather information about hotels and vacation sites. This makes computers valuable tools, as busy @CAPS2 can easily prepare for trips by viewing hotel pictures and getting all the required details online.  Doctor @PERSON2 of @CAPS4 university stated that computers now offer programs enabling busy @CAPS2 to learn new skills, and @PERCENT2 of @CAPS2 currently utilize this software. In modern life, @CAPS2 often lack the time to join groups or classes outside. Thanks to computers, they can cook, do yoga, or learn a new language from home.  Computers are also a boon for forgetful students. For instance, if they forget their homework at school, they can communicate with classmates online to get it or access the school website to print it.  In summary, both students and adults can obtain information from the internet for projects or vacations. Busy @CAPS2 can take classes or acquire new skills on the computer. Anyone can use the internet to communicate for schoolwork or with long - distance friends. The influence of computers on people is undoubtedly positive. It's essential that computers remain in our lives as they are helpful, and we've adapted to relying on them. This is beneficial as newspaper houses are organized by computers, which keeps businesses running.
947	949	1	2	In society, many people think computers are bad, but I firmly believe they are excellent. Computers enable us to communicate with friends, family, and relatives. With a computer, we can complete homework much faster without having to visit the library for research. Moreover, computers provide an outlet for our emotions.  Many experts, such as those from @ORGANIZATION1, worry that people might interact with strangers on platforms like Facebook and MySpace. However, if parents set up their children's profiles so that only friends can access them, the risk is significantly reduced. Communications engineer @PERSON1 claims that online communication is better than no communication at all. I whole - heartedly agree, as I have relatives in @LOCATION1 who are @NUM1 miles away. After getting a Facebook account, it's as if they are right next to me.  @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 pointed out that @PERCENT1 of strangers who are potential molesters or thugs target those who don't protect their profiles. So, it's crucial to safeguard our profiles.  Computers are far superior to going to the library. Going to the library requires rounding up the kids, getting in the car, and traveling. With a computer, we can simply enter our office and conduct research, saving money on gas. If we have a project, we can send it directly to the teacher.  Some so - called experts are conducting rigged experiments. They claim that video games cause violence, but they use test subjects who are already problematic. In my experience, video games are a great way to relieve stress. Many of my friends share this view, and video games also stimulate our thinking.  In conclusion, computers are truly excellent. They facilitate communication with friends and offer an emotional outlet. There's so much to love about them. So, go ahead and get a computer!
948	950	1	2	Every year, the world witnesses remarkable technological advancements, and computers, as a part of this positive trend, bring numerous benefits to society.  Computers are powerful tools for expanding knowledge. For example, during the @DATE1 @CAPS1 event, which often lasts late into the night, I couldn't watch the whole competition. But by using the computer, I quickly found out who won the medals. Computers constantly help us look up facts for reports, information about travel destinations, and details about pets. The possibilities for learning are endless.  Computers also play a significant role in bringing families closer. A family member might come across a funny video on YouTube or @ORGANIZATION1 and want the whole family to watch it. Nowadays, online shopping allows mothers and daughters to shop together without leaving home. In my family, we rent movies from @LOCATION1 on the computer. Selecting a movie to rent creates a shared experience and leads to family movie nights, sparking discussions and providing common topics for the family.  Another advantage of computers is that they connect people. There are various communication platforms like Facebook, Twitter, email, and AIM. They all serve the purpose of bringing old and new friends together. My mom joined Facebook to reconnect with her high - school friends, and she was overjoyed to find an old friend she hadn't seen in years.  In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial. They enhance our knowledge, strengthen family bonds, and connect people. Their positive impact on our lives is undeniable, and they will continue to play an important role in our daily lives.
949	951	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I concur with the experts who claim that people are spending excessive time on computers. There are several reasons for this concern.  Firstly, excessive computer use leaves people with little time for exercise. People often think they don't need to go outside, but it's essential for our bodies to move and for blood to circulate. Instead of relying solely on the computer for answers, we should find other ways to have fun, like playing games with friends in person.  Secondly, the computer network has introduced new features such as Facebook. More and more people are using it, which means they are less likely to go out and play or do their homework. Parents should either set time limits on computer use or restrict access. There's only a certain amount of time one can spend on the computer without getting bored.  Thirdly, people are spending more time on the computer than with their families. Family time is precious, and we should be more involved in our daily lives. Instead of playing computer games, we should go outside with our families and play games like wiffle ball.  In conclusion, people are spending too much time on computers instead of exercising, enjoying new websites, and neglecting family time. It's crucial to set time limits on computer use, get up, and be active. We should not be lazy and sit in front of the computer all day. Instead, we should spend quality time with our families and friends. I hope you share my view.
950	952	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I agree with the concerned experts, and I'm sure many others do too. There are several reasons why excessive computer use is a problem.  First, too much online chatting with friends can lead to issues. While it's a great way to stay connected, it can also cause problems like the spread of rumors. When friends get overly excited online, they may start spreading rumors about others, which can be hurtful. Online arguing can also escalate into real - life fights at school. If we turn on our computers and find that someone is talking about us or trying to start a fight, our feelings will surely be hurt.  Second, excessive computer use can have a negative impact on grades. Many students go home and turn on their computers instead of doing homework or studying. At my school, many students' grades have declined due to excessive online use. If this continues, many students may fail the school year and be held back. As parents, we wouldn't be happy to see our children's report cards filled with @CAPS1's or mostly @CAPS2's.  Third, online bullying is a serious problem caused by computers. Many children are being bullied online, which makes them sad and feel unimportant. Bullying can lead to extremely tragic consequences, including death. If a child is bullied online and doesn't talk to an adult, they may even take their own life. The pain that parents feel when their child is bullied to death is immeasurable.  In conclusion, excessive computer use has a detrimental effect on everyone. It can lead to the spread of rumors, a decline in grades, and online bullying. We need to be more aware of these issues and take steps to limit our computer use to avoid these negative consequences.
951	953	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, the world now has a network that enables people to connect, learn, and work efficiently. This remarkable network resides within our computers. Computers offer significant benefits to society as they assist @CAPS3 in connecting with distant places, enhancing hand - eye coordination, and expediting work. Prior to the advent of computers, we were confined to our immediate areas. @CAPS2, we were trapped in our towns, oblivious to the rest of the world, unable to appreciate the beauty of @LOCATION3 or offer aid to the starving in @LOCATION2. @PERCENT1 of the donations to @ORGANIZATION1, an organization that aids in global disasters, come from online sources. Without computers, how could our willing individuals help or even be aware of the rest of the world? Provide our community with computers so they can reach the farthest corners of the globe.  Computers offer games and activities of a more intense nature than anywhere else. Playing baseball, for instance, does not demand a high level of focus. The complex experiences on computers help future engineers or pilots develop the focus and hand - eye coordination that could potentially save lives. @PERSON1, who trains the @CAPS3 air force, comments on the impact of computers: ""They have had a great deal of positive influence."" He states that ""@CAPS4 soldiers have excellent control skills and amazing reflexes, making them natural pilots."" Shouldn't our community also have the opportunity to excel? The computers we own train @CAPS3 to have reflexes and hand - eye coordination on par with the best in the military.  Computers make our lives both enjoyable and meaningful by speeding up our work. Before computers, @CAPS7 and calculations took @PERCENT2 more time, but now they are completed quickly and accurately. @NUM1 - year - old author @PERSON2 says, ""@CAPS4 computer helps me type @CAPS4 writing much faster, and more importantly, it gets the job done right."" @CAPS7 and typing are more efficient when using a computer. Accountants, students, and even journalists at your newspaper need computers to work faster and more effectively. Don't hinder our community's workers; give them the computers they need. Computers are too crucial and beneficial to do without. Our community benefits from computers that help @CAPS3 connect with distant places, enhance hand - eye coordination, and enable quick and accurate work. So, in your next article, explain that we need our computers. They are essential in our community, and we would be at a disadvantage without them."
952	954	1	2	Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, the over - use of computers can have a severe impact on a person's life. People who spend excessive time on computers are likely to exercise less, enjoy nature less, and interact less with family and friends. I firmly believe that the issue of computers overwhelming people's lives should be addressed seriously.  Since the development of the internet forty years ago, the average @CAPS1 (body mass index) of an average person has increased by fifteen percent. This is not a coincidence. Computers are causing more people to forego physical challenges like running an extra mile or swimming an extra lap and instead stay home and play on their computers. This not only affects people's weights but also forces exercise equipment store owners to close their shops as fewer people are engaging in regular workouts.  Our children are also affected. Childhood obesity is one of the main consequences because when children get hooked on computers, they stop exercising and instead play video games. The annual attendance at @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 used to be around @NUM1, but since the invention of the computer, it has dropped to @NUM2. Fewer people are enjoying a fresh @DATE1 outdoors and are spending it indoors.  This trend is harming both people and the wildlife around them. In @DATE2, the year the computer was invented, the ratio of squirrels to people in @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was @NUM3. But just ten years later, the situation has changed, and there are fewer squirrels. This is because with fewer people feeding them, squirrels have to venture out on their own to find food. Tour guides in @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 are being fired as fewer people want tours, so fewer guides are needed.  Families are noticing that the more time a person spends on a computer, the less time they spend talking to @LOCATION1 or @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Scientists conducted an experiment where three people spent an hour reading a book, another spent an hour on a computer, and three hours on a computer to see who could have the longest conversation with their mother. The first person talked to their mother for twenty minutes, the second for ten minutes, and the last for only five minutes. This shows that the more time spent on a computer, the fewer interactions occur between a son and mother, an important relationship in anyone's life. Mothers worry that during the next barbecue, @PERSON1 will be in his room playing on the computer.  In conclusion, the over - use of computers is having a detrimental impact on various aspects of our lives, including health, wildlife, and social relationships. We need to take steps to limit computer use and encourage a more balanced lifestyle.
953	955	1	2	One day, I went outside to get the mail and the newspaper. On the front page, there was an article about computer use. It said that people were using computers too much. At first, I thought computer sales might decline, but then I realized that people were using computers instead of exercising.  I have a friend who didn't know how to use a computer at first. He spent his time playing outside. In @DATE1, he tried out for @CAPS1 baseball. He's a great athlete and also does well in school. On the other hand, there are people without jobs who just sit at the computer all day instead of doing work around the house.  Some kids are also affected. My friend's friend spends all his time on the computer after school. He doesn't do his homework on time and doesn't want to go out to exercise or get some sun. Sometimes, he even forgets to eat. People should give their brains a rest and engage in physical activities.  Computer workers should inform computer users about the addictive nature of computers. Some people start using computers to get information or for college but end up using them too much. For example, a girl started using the computer to chat and stopped going to college.  I believe that computers have a major impact on people. Most of the users are teens and kids. People should go to the gym, build strong muscles, and get some sunlight instead of staying at the computer all the time. Adults should also set a good example. Staying away from computers for a while is the right thing to do. In conclusion, we need to find a balance and not let computers take over our lives.
954	956	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, in my opinion, computers have a positive impact on people. I think this because I know some people who exercise and also use the computer regularly. I don't consider computers to be a bad thing.  Computers are great learning tools. Some people learn how to exercise through them. They can also learn about far - away places and might even go there to explore the beauty and nature. I know @CAPS2's uncle who came from @LOCATION1. He learned to speak English on the computer. He learned a great deal, and we were all very proud.  There are many positive effects of computers on people. People can take classes online. For example, single mothers with kids can get their diplomas and degrees online. @CAPS2's aunts and uncles can take English classes online and work at the same time. I often go on @PERSON1. It teaches me how to type. It's both fun and educational.  I believe that all computers have positive effects on people. There shouldn't be a single computer with negative effects. But this is just my opinion. Computers are like our helpers. We can type reports, learn, read online, play educational games, and access a vast amount of resources. We can search for all kinds of things, like mysteries, animals, nature, and places. The number of search results is astonishing.  Computers also help with various tasks. We can check the weather, read the news, and contact our teachers. For instance, I can find out what the weather will be like tomorrow and see the latest news. I can also communicate with @CAPS2's teachers through the computer. In conclusion, computers are beneficial in every way, and they always have a positive impact on people.
955	957	1	2	"Dear Local @CAPS1, I am delighted to write this letter to you. I agree with those who believe that computers have a positive effect on people. There are three main reasons for this. Firstly, computers allow us to communicate with family and friends. Secondly, they are useful for research. Thirdly, we can get directions from them.  I'll share some personal experiences to illustrate these points. When I was in third grade, my friend amor had to move to @LOCATION1. I was heartbroken on the day he left. But then, I received an email from him the next week. Since then, we've been able to keep in touch. He visits @LOCATION2 every @DATE2, and we hang out. Now that he has moved to @LOCATION3, I might want to visit him, but I'll need to do some research on @LOCATION3 first.  Computers are excellent for research. In our language @CAPS4 class this year, we read a book called ""my brother @CAPS5 is dead,"" which was a true story. We had to do research on the book, and thanks to computers, I could find information on the website, including descriptions and directions. Without computers, it would have been very difficult to conduct such research.  Directions are very important, and we can get them from computers. I remember one year when I had to go to my friend's birthday party, but we didn't know how to get there. I went online on @DATE1, got the directions, printed them out, and we found the place in @NUM1 minutes. Without the computer, we would have had a hard time finding the house.  I understand that some people might disagree with me, as computers can have bad websites and be addictive. However, I firmly believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. In conclusion, computers are very useful for study and various aspects of our lives, and they have a positive impact overall."
956	958	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, are you aware that computers can restrict you from engaging in numerous activities? Instead of spending time on the computer, you could exercise more, play outdoors, and spend quality time with family and friends. This is precisely why you should reduce your computer usage. Exercise is crucial for your physical well - being, while computers are not. You can acquire some weights and work out in your room. A run along the beach also seems like a great option. By doing so, you can shed a significant amount of weight, rather than gaining it while sitting in front of the computer. So, go ahead and exercise to lose weight as it is beneficial for you.  Computers also prevent you from getting fresh air and enjoying outdoor play. When you are outside, you'll find that playing is far more enjoyable than simply pressing buttons and clicking around on the computer. You don't necessarily have to play; you can just take a walk with someone or sit on the grass and have a chat. The computer deprives you of all these enjoyable outdoor activities.  Spending time with your family is a very important activity that the computer keeps you from. Suppose you're on the computer for an hour while your family is having a barbecue. When you finally get off, you'll realize that spending time with them is much more fun than sitting and staring at the screen. This is why computers are a distraction for everyone, as they make you less likely to exercise, play outside, or spend time with family. You can use the computer, but don't stay on it for too long, or you'll miss out on the fun.
957	959	1	2	Dear local newspaper, in my opinion, while computers do offer certain benefits, the negative issues and situations they bring about have a more significant impact on people. There are three main reasons why I believe the negative impacts of computers outweigh the positive and constructive ones.  Firstly, cyber - bullying is a major problem. Cyber - bullying can be defined as rude or nasty teasing over the internet, often occurring on social networking websites such as @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, etc. It can involve teasing, hurtful comments, horrible name - calling, and foul language. It is more harmful than traditional bullying, like demanding lunch money, because once words are posted online, they can never be fully retracted. Cyber - bullying represents the new form of meanness.  Secondly, scamming and cons are prevalent on the internet. When purchasing items online, you can never be certain of what you'll receive. My father was scammed while trying to buy a big boat from what seemed like an official website. He drove all the way to @LOCATION1 to pick it up. When he took it out on the water at our @DATE1 home in @LOCATION2, he found that the engine and motor were broken. This is an example of the risks associated with online shopping.  Lastly, misinformation is another negative impact of computers. When researching a topic, it may seem old - fashioned to go to the library, but it's a reliable option. On the internet, anyone can post misleading or false statements. False information isn't only an issue in research; people can also pretend to be someone else in anonymous chat - rooms and instant messaging, making them dangerous and unreliable.  In conclusion, the internet has stronger negative impacts and consequences than positive ones. Cyber - bullying, scamming, and misinformation are all negative factors that outweigh the positives.
958	960	1	2	Dear Newspaper, computers are not beneficial to us for several reasons. Firstly, people spend an excessive amount of time on them. Not everyone has a computer, partly because of the high cost. A basic computer can cost upwards of @NUM1 @MONEY1, and that's just for the computer itself. Then, there are additional costs such as the monthly internet bill, which can reach @NUM2, and software applications like Windows and Microsoft. Over time, these costs add up, and people often don't realize that when they pay for the internet, they may not be getting what the cable companies claim to offer.  Secondly, not everyone knows how to use a computer. Older adults, for example, may not be familiar with the full potential of a computer because they never learned how to use one.  In light of the time spent, the high costs, and the lack of knowledge required to use computers effectively, they are not a great help to our society.
959	961	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1, have you ever caught yourself thinking about the computer or wishing you were using it? I heard you're looking into whether computers have negative or positive effects on society. In my view, the effects are negative, as they lead to less time for exercise, less time with family and friends, and can easily cause addiction.  Exercise is crucial for a healthy body and mind, yet many people, like @CAPS1, struggle to find time for it. Instead of using their free time to exercise, they're likely to be on Facebook. Moreover, computer maintenance can also take away time from exercise. For instance, on @DATE1, my computer got a virus that took ages to fix. That time could have been used for a valuable workout. Another aspect to consider is obesity. We should be active and moving, not sitting and staring at a computer for @NUM1 hours at a time.  Spending time with friends and family is important, and computers often get in the way. Kids would rather be on Facebook than have a nice meal with their family. My @CAPS2 always told me about the fun things he did with his friends. Nowadays, kids have it too easy and may miss out on these social experiences. I believe it's essential to spend time with family and friends because you never know when you might lose them.  Addiction is a serious issue, and computer addiction is no exception. Our generation is overly dependent on computers. For example, in the car with the @CAPS4, you just plug it in and it tells you where to go. But if it breaks, you won't know where to go because you never learned to read a map. Similarly, if your computer breaks, you'll face difficulties. Kids are typing instead of writing, and this skill could be lost.  As you can see, the negative effects of computers are significant, and we should be more aware of them.
960	962	1	2	To whom it may concern, I firmly believe that computers are a valuable asset. They offer several advantages, including the ability to learn about foreign places, keep in touch with family and friends, and provide entertainment.  Computers are excellent tools for learning about foreign places. You can research a destination and view pictures before you go. For example, if I wanted to visit @LOCATION3, I could use the computer to find the best areas to visit and check the reviews of different hotels. Also, when writing a paper about a place you've never been to, the computer is a great resource. While books can provide similar information, the computer allows you to filter out what you don't need. In my history class, I had to do a report on @LOCATION2. As I had never been there, I used the computer. It offers up - to - date and accurate information, which is an advantage over books.  Secondly, computers help you maintain connections with family and friends. There are numerous websites that enable you to share photos and communicate with loved ones. I recently joined Facebook and can now talk to friends without worrying about exceeding my phone bill. My dad also uses Facebook to talk to people he hasn't seen since he moved from the @LOCATION1 white mountains. Other popular sites include AIM, AOL, and MySpace.  Lastly, computers are a great source of entertainment. They allow you to watch concerts you missed or movies that aren't on TV. For example, after a fun skateboard demo at Skate Lair, I was able to relive the experience by watching it on YouTube. Computers also let you check the news and weather, which is useful when you're on the road.  In conclusion, although some people may spend excessive time on computers, most use them for a reasonable amount of time. Overall, computers are necessary due to their educational, social, and entertainment value.
961	963	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that people, especially many teenagers, spend a significant amount of time on computers. This belief is based on my own experience and a survey I conducted among the @NUM1 - grade @CAPS4 class of @PERSON1.  Many teens use the internet for various purposes. Some use it to do homework or check emails, while others spend hours on @CAPS1 and become addicted. As a result, they are less likely to be outside or engage in sports. I myself used to have a @CAPS1 account and would spend the whole day on it, missing out on time with my family and friends. So, I deleted the account. However, I still feel addicted to the computer, constantly listening to music, chatting with friends, or checking emails, just like most people.  Regarding @PERSON1's @NUM1 - grade @CAPS4 class, @PERCENT1 of the students are on the computer daily, and @PERCENT2 said that @PERCENT3 of them use the computer regularly. This is just one @NUM1 - grade class, and it shows that students of all ages are often addicted to computers.  Therefore, I believe that people spend too much time on computers. Many students spend hours on @CAPS1 at a time. My own experience and the survey results from @PERSON1's class indicate a high percentage of computer - addicted individuals. Parents, please encourage your children to spend less time on the computer.
962	964	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, have you ever pondered the vast offerings of the world wide web? I wholeheartedly agree that computers have a beneficial impact on people. They enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about distant places, and provide opportunities to reconnect with old acquaintances or meet new people.  Studies by @PERSON1, a doctor at @ORGANIZATION1, revealed that @PERCENT1 of people who type on the computer have better hand - eye coordination than those who don't. You could be improving your coordination without even realizing it. Intelligent individuals would concur that using the computer is highly advantageous. There are numerous computer games that demand quick reactions, fast reflexes, and good hand - eye coordination. Personally, since I started using the computer more, I've noticed a remarkable improvement in my reaction time.  Yes, I understand that some people should go outside and exercise. However, you can either exercise or improve your hand - eye coordination, and there's no wrong choice. Through computers, we can explore fascinating worlds, just as we gaze at the vastness of space. The technology of computers allows us to learn about far - off places. Kevin, a scientist, stated that @PERCENT2 of our knowledge about space comes from computers. For instance, Google Earth enables us to view clear pictures of any location in the world. Without computers, we would lack a great deal of knowledge about our wonderful world.  Did you know that @NUM1 of the population uses the computer to communicate and reconnect with friends and family? I do! While people shouldn't be overly reliant on the computer for socializing, it's an excellent way to stay in touch. Websites like Skype and Oovo allow us to chat with others. Friendly and educated people believe this is a great way to catch up with old friends from high school or even grade school. Moreover, long - lasting friendships can be formed through online communication. I go to @DATE1 camp every year and make new friends. Facebook has helped me keep in touch with them.  In conclusion, the choice to use computers is undoubtedly a wise one. They help improve hand - eye coordination, facilitate communication, and allow us to learn about the wonders of the world. We should appreciate and utilize all that computers have to offer.
963	965	1	2	"Dear newspaper, do you want to learn good hand - eye coordination? Do you want to have the ability to learn about far - away places? And do you want to talk online with other people? If you answered yes to all these questions, then using a computer is the ideal solution.  When using a computer, you can achieve many things. You can look up healthy recipes for your family or find a good place to practice your daily yoga. Some people claim that using a computer reduces time for exercise and enjoying nature, but that's not the case. A recent poll at Planet Fitness in Newington @CAPS2 showed that @PERCENT1 of the exercising people discovered the gym through the internet. @PERSON1 from the Department of Health and Wellness said that ""@PERCENT2 of my customers take online exercise courses at home so they don't have to be in public.""  I know it might seem lazy not to go to a gym, but some people are afraid of what others think of them. Who wouldn't want to exercise in the comfort of their own home instead of going to a sweaty, old gym? Any reasonable person would choose to stay home and exercise using their computer.  So, would you rather go to a sweaty old gym or stay in your clean home with the internet? Imagine waking up well - rested. Instead of going to a yucky gym, you can stay home and enjoy a relaxing walk. You surely care about your nose and want to smell nice things. But if you don't mind, that's okay too.  In conclusion, don't go to a gym. Stay at home and enjoy your day with the internet! I firmly believe staying at home and using the internet is the better option."
964	966	1	2	Dear the daily newspaper crew, I've noticed some of you disagree about using computers. In my opinion, using a computer isn't that bad.  Computers are actually beneficial for education. Many people use them to create @NUM1 images for school projects or science fair projects. Like most young teens and children, I use computers to play video games when I'm bored. However, unlike some, I don't spend excessive time on it. I usually play for a couple of hours.  There are, of course, some drawbacks to having a computer at home. The machines consume a large amount of energy, causing the electric bill to rise, especially on @DATE1. Also, on some websites like MySpace and Twitter, there are people who may act like stalkers. But the good news is that these people are usually quickly caught and sent to jail.  On the positive side, computers have a positive impact on the mind and physical movements. For example, children with access to computers can learn to fly a kite with their parents' supervision, and they develop hand - eye coordination. Many children who play sports and have computers can catch a ball faster than usual.  In conclusion, computers are not as bad as some may think. We should consider the consequences for children if computers are banned.
965	967	1	2	"I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Despite being a relatively new invention, computers have gained immense popularity. They enable people to communicate online, assist students in completing homework and projects, and allow people to store important files and pictures safely.  Computers revolutionize communication. Whether it's through email, instant messaging, or video chat, they replace old - fashioned methods. For example, instead of writing a letter, mailing it, and waiting two days for delivery, you can simply obtain an email address, type a message, and click send. The message will be received instantly, and a reply can follow soon. @PERSON1, the president of @ORGANIZATION1, said, ""Computers are an important part of technology. People use them every day."" Using computers daily isn't just for fun; it also aids in work. Three out of four adults who use computers claim that they help with work and social status.  Computers are a crucial part of students' lives. They allow students to complete homework and projects quickly. Instead of hand - writing a four - page essay, students can use the internet to find information. They can also email teachers if they miss classes or assignments. @PERSON3, a student at @ORGANIZATION2 who missed several school days, said, ""All I had to do was email my teachers, and they sent me the homework assignment. It was that easy."" Many kids and adults agree that computers are a great help.  Computers also serve as a reliable storage solution. Everyone dreads losing precious memories when a camera or video camera breaks. By saving pictures and important files to the computer, they are preserved forever. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people who store their pictures on the computer believe this is the best way.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people. They facilitate online communication, assist with homework and projects, and provide a secure storage option. It's evident that computers are an essential part of our daily lives."
966	968	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1, I firmly believe that computers are an excellent tool for everyone when used appropriately. The reasons are as follows. Firstly, computers are beneficial as news spreads rapidly. Through the internet, world - changing news can diffuse like wildfire and inform people within seconds. It is extremely useful for staying informed and learning about important matters. I recall when a massive earthquake struck @LOCATION2, traumatizing its citizens. Immediately after the incident, the news circulated on the internet, attracting widespread attention. This led to many people donating necessary items. Secondly, computers are great for researching school - related topics and things of general interest. For a school project, you can easily search for the required facts using various internet search engines and precisely find what you need. You can also look up information about your favorite sports teams, bands, or famous figures. All this can be done privately at home, as secretive as a @ORGANIZATION1 agent. I remember when one of my idols passed away. As soon as I heard the tragic news, I was able to search for endless information about his death. Finally, you can chat with people from around the world. Using social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace, you can connect with friends and chat for hours. You can also join chatrooms with like - minded people. I often talk to others about a band we all love. Undoubtedly, access to news, research, and the ability to stay in touch with friends are the best reasons to use a computer. So, what are you waiting for? Get a computer!
967	969	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to share my opinion on the effects of computers on people. I disagree with the view that experts are correct in saying people spend too much time on computers, and I will explain my reasons. There are indeed issues associated with computers. Firstly, I oppose those who support technology because there is a lack of safety. Online chatting is enjoyable but dangerous. For example, many kids are at risk, usually online, as they share information with unknown people. This can lead to dangerous situations, such as kidnapping due to the information they disclose and the people they interact with. Secondly, computers can cause addiction. Most people get addicted to certain online activities, which can be dangerous. For instance, some video games involve violence like killing and crime, which we cannot do in the real world. These games can lead people into dangerous situations. There have been cases where students bring violence into the school because they think it is an answer. The addiction to computers is so severe that people lose the ability to interact with the real world. Lastly, excessive computer use can lead to a sedentary lifestyle. Many people who are constantly on the computer are inactive and may face health problems. For example, some people die of related health issues. I hope this letter makes others understand why I disagree with the over - glorification of computer use.
968	970	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, today's society is significantly different from what it was twenty years ago. We now have phones that allow us to browse the web as easily as a computer. Access to this vast network brings people together, broadens our horizons, and helps many hard - working @CAPS5 individuals stay focused for work. While not everyone believes technology is beneficial for our development, I am convinced it keeps us progressing and away from ignorance. Construction workers work hard during busy seasons, building skyscrapers, educational facilities, health - center additions, and homes. However, when the weather is unfavorable, construction can be hazardous. Recently, there has been a technological advancement to help crane operators maintain their skills virtually during the off - season. To an untrained observer, it may seem easy, just sitting, pulling levers, and pushing buttons. But there is a high level of precision required. Pulling a lever too quickly can cause the crane to tip over. One of our field reporters tried the @CAPS1 virtual trainer and developed a new appreciation for the work of our builders. This shows that if skills are not maintained, it can lead to serious malfunctions on a construction site. I personally find it both entertaining and educational to learn a new language. I teach myself @CAPS4 at home. Without a computer, my studies would be nearly impossible. In today's economy, taking classes outside of school or hiring a tutor can be a significant financial burden. The internet offers an efficient, low - cost, or even free way to learn a language. One can find study tips from native speakers or those who have mastered the language. In today's society, not everyone has the time to go to the library to learn about a country of interest. Some may say asking a neighbor is just as effective, but it can be awkward for those uncomfortable in face - to - face interactions. Having comprehensive information at hand makes learning enjoyable. One can find blog posts and videos about a country. Websites dedicated to specific cultures are also helpful. Moreover, if someone is looking for a vacation spot recommended by locals, that information is also available. For those who cannot easily connect with family due to distance, social networks on the web make it easier and more affordable. The speed of instant messaging can make it feel like loved ones are in the same room. I hope this shows that technology serves as a skill - maintenance tool, an educational resource, and a means of connecting with family for foreign - born citizens.
969	971	1	2	Dear Local newspaper, there are heated arguments about whether computers are good or bad. In my opinion, computers have greatly benefited our society. They make socializing easier, offer abundant educational opportunities, and contribute to businesses. It is truly amazing how computers facilitate social interaction. They enable families and friends to communicate with each other. Instead of relying on slow paper - based messages, people can stay in touch instantly. For example, if family members are on vacation, they can still be contacted. Or if a friend cannot get a ride to another's house, they can talk on the computer. Additionally, computers allow us to socialize with people from all over the world. The educational value of computers is also remarkable. Before computers, we mainly learned from books, but many books cannot teach as effectively as a computer. With a computer, we can learn about space, stars, planets, and other nations. We can understand different cultures and landscapes without leaving our homes. Computers have played a crucial role in our education. In the business world, computers have had a profound impact. The computer industry itself has generated significant revenue. Computers help businesses organize work and finances, and they have created numerous jobs. They also provide a quicker and more efficient way for businesses to promote their products. In conclusion, computers have made socializing easier, enhanced our educational opportunities, and supported our businesses, which is why I believe they have benefited our society.
970	972	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, I am writing to share my thoughts on the effects of computers on people. I believe that those who spend excessive time on computers, excluding those whose jobs require it, are letting their lives pass by. Firstly, when people spend all their time on the computer @NUM1, they are essentially doing nothing but sitting in a chair and getting fat. Their lives are slipping away as they are not engaging in meaningful activities. Instead, they should try to find a job on the computer if they are going to be on it so much. Secondly, people using the computer can still interact with their family. Since they live in the same house, they can communicate with their family when they are not on the computer. They can spend quality time with their family, which shows that computer use does not necessarily prevent family interaction. Lastly, I wonder why some people want to spend most of their lives on the computer. These are not the people with computer - related jobs. If you have kids, you should have fun with them, make them feel loved, and be someone they can look up to. Don't waste your life sitting in front of the computer, getting fat and not spending time with your children. I hope you understand my point and that you won't let your life pass you by by spending too much time on the computer doing nothing productive. Again, I am not referring to those who have to work on computers for their jobs, but rather those who don't.
971	973	1	2	In today's digital age, computers have become an integral part of our lives. However, it is concerning to note that a significant number of individuals are spending an excessive amount of time on these devices. This article aims to shed light on how people are utilizing their computers and the potential drawbacks of over - indulgence. Some individuals use computers for work - related purposes, which is a legitimate and necessary use. On the other hand, there are those who use computers primarily for entertainment and social activities. These people often spend the entire day sitting in front of their screens, neglecting the simple pleasures of life. They could be outdoors, breathing in fresh air and engaging with the real world, but instead, they choose to remain indoors. One of the reasons people stay glued to their computers is the allure of social websites such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. These platforms can be highly addictive, causing users to lose track of time. Others simply enjoy looking up random information. It is important to remember that the computer will always be there. We should prioritize spending time with our families and use the computer only when necessary. While it is enjoyable to use the computer for entertainment, everything should be done in moderation. I hope that after reading this, you will agree with my stance on appropriate computer usage. Thank you for your attention.
972	974	1	2	Computers can pose a significant distraction when it comes to completing school homework. Moreover, when one engages in unauthorized activities on the computer, it is easy to get trapped on a website and unable to exit the screen. In essence, I strongly advise limiting computer usage to no more than @NUM1 minutes. By adhering to this time limit, students can ensure that they do not let computers interfere with their academic responsibilities and can maintain a healthy balance between digital and real - life activities.
973	975	1	2	In contemporary society, computers have become a ubiquitous household item. Given the vast capabilities of computers, a large proportion of the population spends an inordinate amount of time on these devices, which has far - reaching implications for our society. Computers offer numerous benefits. They are an excellent resource for information - gathering. For instance, when a history teacher assigns a @NUM1 - page essay on the Civil War and a student has limited knowledge of the topic, the computer can provide valuable insights. Similarly, when a boss asks an employee to find data on teen car - accident deaths due to cellphones, the computer is an ideal tool. However, there are also significant drawbacks. Some individuals have jobs that require extensive computer use. Teenagers often engage in gaming or use instant messengers, which can detract from outdoor activities. Adults may become addicted to online gambling, a harmful activity that is now easily accessible from the comfort of their living rooms. Additionally, excessive computer use can keep people indoors, depriving them of fresh air and sunlight. In conclusion, computers have both positive and negative aspects. If we can limit our computer time, we will be able to engage in more outdoor activities, read books, and lead a more balanced life. Although some people may abuse computer use while others use it responsibly, I firmly believe that limiting computer time would bring about positive changes in our society.
974	976	1	2	Dear Editor, I am aware that there is an ongoing debate about whether computers are beneficial or not. I believe my perspective can contribute to this discussion. In my opinion, computers are a valuable asset for several reasons. Firstly, computers play a crucial role in enhancing the social skills of children worldwide. There are numerous communication channels available through computers, such as instant messaging and web - caming websites. A survey indicated that @PERCENT1 of parents reported a significant improvement in their children's social skills due to computer use. Secondly, computers are a boon for individuals with poor handwriting. Instead of writing a report that is difficult to read, one can use software like Microsoft Word to type it. When I have a school paper where neatness matters, I always type my report. The ability to change fonts and formatting on the computer allows people to present their work in an aesthetically pleasing manner. Finally, computers are an excellent source of information for those who do not have the time or inclination to read newspapers or watch the news. For example, my mother, who is always busy, gets the latest news of the day when she checks her email. Many people around the world rely on computers to stay informed about global events. I hope you will take my opinion into account when making your decision. Consider the diverse groups of people that computers help, including those with social issues, poor handwriting, and busy schedules. Thank you for your time.
975	977	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, In my opinion, people are spending too much time on computers. There are several reasons to support this view. Firstly, excessive computer use leads to a loss of time. People are neglecting their friends, family, and pets. Social media platforms like Facebook, MySpace, and @CAPS2 are highly addictive, causing individuals to waste hours sitting in front of the screen instead of having fun outside. Secondly, people who spend most of their time indoors on the computer often lack energy. Fresh air and physical activity, such as going to the gym or jogging outside, can help boost energy levels. Staying indoors all the time can also lead to weight gain and a lack of social interaction. Finally, spending all day on the computer means sacrificing time for other important aspects of life. While computers are a remarkable technology, there is no need to be on them @NUM2. We should make time for our loved ones and engage in real - world experiences. In conclusion, the over - use of computers is not beneficial for society. People are losing time, energy, and the opportunity to build meaningful relationships. It is time to limit our computer usage and focus on the things that truly matter. Goodbye for now.
976	978	1	2	"Dear Readers, it's hard to imagine a life where you can't talk to distant friends, only know about your town, or even lack a computer. I certainly can't. There are numerous great benefits to having a computer. You can talk online with friends, learn about new places and things all over the world, and study for tests using the internet.  First, communicating with distant friends and relatives has become effortless with the computer. Statistics show that a certain percentage of families in the specific location have distant friends with access to the internet, and now they can all interact with one another. I'll never forget when my close friend moved away, but I could still talk to him thanks to the computer.  Second, the computer allows you to explore new places and things globally. I wouldn't have known about some of the places I've visited if it weren't for the computer. An organization stated that a computer expert said, ""Computers are the reason we know so much. Without them, we wouldn't know about these places.""  Finally, it's now possible to study using the computer. I'll never forget the time I forgot my book, but I could still study using an online book.  In conclusion, the computer offers many benefits, such as interacting with friends online, learning about new places, and facilitating study. Computers truly bring all - around advantages."
977	979	1	2	"To whom it may concern, computers can be an asset to society, but they are a significant hindrance. People are squandering their days on the computer. Hardly anyone goes out to exercise or enjoy nature. The most severe consequence is that hardly anyone interacts with friends and family anymore. You don't want to succumb to the allure of computers. Put down the mouse and go outside!  Obesity in the specific location is at an all - time high. Experts concur that computers and other technologies are to blame. People who spend a lot of time on the computer rarely exercise, which has a negative impact on them. They have a shorter lifespan and may not be around in twenty years to see their grandchildren grow up. They also face many medical problems. An obesity expert, Person1, says, ""I've observed a positive correlation between the obesity rate and computer use."" Computer - related inactivity can be life - threatening. Obesity can cause heart attacks and infertility. If you can avoid these diseases and health risks by getting off the computer, why wouldn't you? Using the computer isn't worth sacrificing your health.  Do you have fond childhood memories involving nature? I do. Most people who spend excessive time on the computer don't get the chance to create such memories. They're too preoccupied with the computer. Many people will never visit our national parks. A park ranger, Drew Person2, says, ""In the past few years, we've had fewer visitors than ever before."" If people can't tear themselves away from the computer for even a moment to see the beauty of our national parks, there's clearly a problem.  I value sharing and spending time with my friends and family. Almost all frequent computer users say that a large percentage of the time, they use the computer as an excuse not to see friends and family. In reality, they're reluctant to leave it. A supervisor says, ""I've noticed a definite decline in family interaction. We hardly ever see kids with their friends and family."" She's right. Now is the time to reduce computer use.  Computers may not be entirely to blame for these problems; perhaps it's the people. However, computers do contribute to the issues. If we didn't rely so much on computers, more people would exercise and enjoy nature. It's time to turn off the computer and go outside."
978	980	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, people spend too much time on the computer. Instead of exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with real people, they sit and play games, watch music, or movies on the computer. Therefore, I disagree with those who claim that computers benefit society.  In many places, people's health is affected by computer use. Their skin may become flabby and they gain weight. Why is this so? People sit in front of their computers all day instead of exercising. My dad became extremely overweight after we got a new computer. All he did was play games like Star Wars or other popular ones. My mom had to tell him to stop, and now he goes to the gym and has lost a significant amount of weight. America is one of the fattest countries because people don't exercise and just play on their laptops and computers. Stopping computer - based gaming and starting to exercise would greatly benefit America.  So many people miss out on the beauty of nature. The cool, relaxing air at the beach is far nicer than a dark, stuffy room with only the glow of a computer. There's so much to discover in nature. You can find information about geysers in Yellowstone online, but it's nothing like seeing them in real life. If computers had existed in the early 1800s, people might never have had the urge to explore new lands. There aren't many great explorers today. If everyone took a break from the computer, new species might be discovered or a cure for cancer might be found.  How many times have you heard a parent say, ""Come down and talk to your grandparents,"" and the child reply, ""Mom, I'm playing on the computer!"" Has your child been on the computer when an important guest, like a great - grandparent, has visited? Their time is limited, while computers will always be around. Hanging out with relatives is much more important than playing on the computer. I know a kid named Person2 who refused an invitation from a friend because he was playing on the computer. His friend was disappointed and angry.  In conclusion, quality time with people, nature, and exercise is more important than the computer. I hope you agree that computers don't always benefit society."
979	981	1	2	Dear newspaper, I don't believe that computers benefit our society. I think they can be dangerous as they make people lazy and one can be easily scammed on them.  Firstly, computers are dangerous. The police in the town of the specific location say that over a certain percentage of kidnappings involve people met on social networks like MySpace and Facebook. The police chief also reports many cases of people being harassed by stalkers or those with malicious intent.  Secondly, it's very easy to be scammed on the computer. A significant percentage of people say they've lost large amounts of money due to credit - card scams. There are websites that pretend to sell something, take your credit - card number and other information, and then use your card to make purchases. Credit - card companies state that most credit - card scams and frauds occur via the computer.  Finally, computers make people lazy. They are filled with fun things like video games, videos, and shopping options. Research shows that a certain percentage of overweight people have accounts on multiple computer sites.  These are the reasons why I don't think computers benefit us. I hope you'll consider my advice.
980	982	1	2	"In my opinion, computers are beneficial. They can help you communicate with family members around the world, teach you new languages, and keep you updated on global events.  Computers enable you to stay in touch with long - lost relatives. If you miss a family member, you can easily search for them on the computer and communicate via chat. This way, you won't feel the sense of loss.  Computers are also great language - learning tools. You can learn languages like Spanish, French, or German. Simply type in the language you want to learn on the computer, and you can start learning.  Moreover, computers keep you informed about what's happening worldwide. They offer more information than TV. You can click on ""locate area"" to find where an incident occurred. You can also watch videos, view images, and find the location of an event on the computer.  In conclusion, these are the three main reasons why computers are good for people: facilitating communication with long - lost relatives, enabling language learning, and providing global updates. Don't you want to enjoy these amazing benefits?"
981	983	1	2	The computer serves as an excellent means to connect with family and friends. People can send messages globally or just locally. They enjoy playing video games or spending time on their favorite websites. Laptops are purchased by people worldwide for easy travel from one place to another. However, not everyone uses a computer as some believe it's not necessary, while others find it useful for sending messages, socializing, and discussing daily experiences. Many desire a computer but lack the financial means. Some computers come with a hefty price tag, such as @MONEY3, @MONEY2, or even more, depending on the model. Globally, people sell their computers to acquire funds for various items like shoes, clothes, or games. They often sell things on eBay to earn money, yet they usually can't return the computer for a refund or a new one. People have an affinity for classic computers, but new models, like touch - screen ones, have emerged. Many are purchasing these new computers at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or @ORGANIZATION1. Since the release of these new computers, sales have soared, and the companies are making substantial profits. Each year, companies introduce new computer models to generate significant revenue. Companies around the world create different computer styles to attract consumers and boost sales. The more innovative the styles, the greater the profit. Some individuals establish their own computer - related companies to make money, though a portion of the earnings goes to the government, which uses it to support the homeless. Computers are used for both learning and entertainment. People either share computers or have their own. Sharing is common, but some are reluctant to take turns. One can't force a server to access a computer if someone else wants to use it. Some may lie about their access rights. People also like to joke around while using computers. Parents often caution that computers aren't toys as they are expensive to repair, especially when water spills on them, causing malfunctions and frustration. When computers first appeared, people bought them out of curiosity. Their popularity spread globally, with people discussing them, and companies continuously produced more until they were available in stores worldwide. The computer became famous, and companies developed newer styles. People eagerly bought computers whenever new styles were released, and many households owned @NUM1 or @NUM2 computers. Some companies' new styles made other companies envious. People started ordering computers online, resulting in high profits for the manufacturing companies. Some companies stopped production until they developed a superior model, which sometimes led to jealousy among competitors. In some cases, companies joined forces to create a new computer.
982	984	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I wholeheartedly agree that computers bring us numerous benefits. They allow people to explore the world and accomplish a wide range of tasks. Computers have diverse applications, and @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 households own at least one computer. With computers, we can do almost anything. They assist most people in their jobs, education at college or school, and even enable online purchases of houses and cars. They are cost - effective and highly useful. One can look up necessary facts or play games during leisure time. Computers keep us connected to the world, and many activities rely on them. For example, to play Xbox Live, a computer with @CAPS1 is required. Xbox Live enables users to play video games with others, including friends. Some homework assignments and certain college courses are computer - based, allowing students to study at home. Virtually anything one needs can be found on the computer. In fact, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 households in @LOCATION1 have computers, or @PERCENT1 of the population in @LOCATION1 does. Admittedly, some people may waste time on computers, but life would be much more difficult without them. For instance, instead of waiting @NUM5 days for mail, one can simply send an @CAPS2 - mail. Most people owe their jobs to computers as they save time and eliminate the need to travel to deliver letters. I firmly believe that computers are of great benefit. As mentioned, they offer endless possibilities, like using @CAPS3 to stay in touch with friends during vacations. They are also used for various purposes, such as downloading music on @CAPS4. Given that almost everyone has a computer, it's ironic that some scientists complain about them while still using them. In my view, computers are truly remarkable. What's your opinion?
983	985	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, many locals in the town of @LOCATION1 have said, ""Computers are great! They do so much for my family and me. I can't live without a computer."" For me, computers are a source of entertainment with a plethora of applications. At the same time, they are powerful tools for researching any topic imaginable. I also recognize the importance of computers in the business world, where businessmen conduct their work. My favorite computer applications include @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and many others. On @CAPS5, one can communicate with friends without a cellphone or those living in different states. @CAPS3 is my absolute favorite. It allows me to chat with friends, view their pictures, learn about their relationships, and engage in countless other activities. Additionally, one can play and download games on the computer, providing enjoyable experiences beyond research. Another significant aspect of computers is research. Research can be either interesting or dull, depending on one's perspective, but it is undeniably educational. I spoke with a mother of a @NUM1 - year - old, a @NUM2 - year - old, and a @NUM3 - year - old, and she said, ""The most important thing to me on the computer is researching. It's fun, enjoyable, and most importantly, educational!"" The beauty of research on the computer lies in the vast number of websites with information for us to explore. People with jobs, especially businessmen and designers, spend a significant amount of time on the computer, often researching while working. They are constantly on the computer, using it mainly for email. My father is a prime example. He is always on the computer, checking emails, typing reports for his boss, and participating in video conferences. For some workers, computers are an integral part of their jobs. In my opinion, computers are one of the greatest inventions. They offer amazing apps for entertainment, provide educational opportunities through research, and are essential for people in the workforce. I can't imagine anyone living without these technological marvels."
984	986	1	2	Dear local newspaper, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students at @ORGANIZATION1 claim to spend most of their time on the computer. I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on people, causing safety, health, and education issues. With the rapid advancement of technology, teenagers are oblivious to their surroundings and the potential harm to themselves. Although adults also use computers, teenagers use them more frequently. It's high time we realized the consequences of computer use on ourselves and the world. Computers pose significant safety risks. Nowadays, people often communicate with friends online, but they may not be aware that the person on the other end may not be who they claim to be. Recent news reports have highlighted cases of teenagers being raped or kidnapped because the online acquaintances were not genuine. Malicious individuals are constantly lurking on the internet, and we must prevent them from contacting children. Moreover, computers can compromise privacy, as it's possible for personal information to be leaked. We need to be extremely vigilant. In addition to safety issues, computers also have adverse effects on health. They play a major role in deteriorating our well - being. Approximately @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 are overweight or obese. While televisions used to be blamed for people's lack of exercise, computers are now having the same effect. There are so many engaging activities on the computer that people find it hard to tear themselves away. This prevents them from getting up and exercising. Prolonged computer use can also cause headaches and eye strain, and it reduces face - to - face communication, which is crucial for building healthy relationships. Computers also have a detrimental impact on education. Students often forget to do their homework and study for tests due to the numerous distractions on the computer. This leads to lower grades. Instead of being a distraction, computers should assist people. It's not entirely the students' fault as the computer offers so many interesting features. For example, websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 are highly distracting. Computers should not be a hindrance but a help. With more and more people getting computers every day, we need to be aware of their negative effects. There are many other activities to enjoy, such as going outside, spending time with friends, or studying. People should reduce their computer use and focus on more productive and healthy activities.
985	987	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to share my view on computer use. In my opinion, some people rely on computers excessively, whether it's for research projects, chatting with friends, or even getting answers for homework. Every day, millions of people spend hours on their computers. However, simply moving fingers on a keyboard is not exercise and it wastes energy. Many people I know would be lost without a computer because they use it to connect with friends and complete schoolwork. These individuals need to learn how to accomplish tasks without relying solely on technology, as it may fail one day. Some students depend so much on their computers that they will fail if the technology malfunctions. These children should be taught alternative ways to do things, such as spending time with friends, reading books, and doing their homework independently. Since students are so attached to their computers, they are constantly on them. I know people who go home and spend the rest of the day on @CAPS2. They rarely engage in outdoor sports. Obesity is a major problem in the @LOCATION1, and the numbers are rising rapidly. While people often attribute it to poor eating habits, overusing computers is also a significant factor. Children in the @LOCATION1 are glued to their computers all day, checking messages and arranging pictures. While on the computer, they mindlessly consume ""@CAPS3"". The issue of excessive computer use is becoming a serious concern in relation to obesity and people's over - reliance on technology for almost everything. We need to be the first to address this problem before it gets worse. This could turn into a huge problem in the future. Therefore, let's start reducing our computer usage time now."
986	988	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers are not beneficial for people. Instead of spending time on computers, individuals could engage in physical exercise, socialize with friends and family, or read books. Firstly, the time spent on computers could be better utilized for exercise. Instead of being glued to the screen, one could go for a bike ride or take the dog for a walk. Although exercise may be challenging, it is far superior to continuously staring at a computer screen. Maintaining a healthy diet alone does not guarantee good health; regular physical activity is also essential. Therefore, choose to run, walk the dog, or visit the gym rather than sitting in front of the computer. Secondly, being on the computer means missing out on valuable time with friends and family. For instance, if your family is going to the beach and you stay home to play games on Facebook, you miss the opportunity to create shared memories. Similarly, on movie night, if you stay home to webcam with your aunt instead of going out with friends, you forfeit quality social experiences. Lastly, computer time should be replaced with reading time. Reading a book is significantly different from reading on a computer screen. Reading books enhances vocabulary and exposes readers to various forms of literature, making them more knowledgeable. In contrast, online reading often involves reading rumors and unsubstantiated information. In conclusion, people should allocate more time to exercise, socializing, and reading, and reduce their computer usage.
987	989	1	2	@ORGANIZATION1, in contemporary society, computers are ubiquitous and have proven to be extremely beneficial. They serve as an information superhighway and facilitate human connections. Technological advancements have positively impacted humanity globally. Firstly, computers provide easy access to a vast amount of information. @PERCENT1 of students at @ORGANIZATION2 claim that when working on papers or projects, they first turn to the internet. As student @PERSON1 stated, the internet is fast, simple, and reliable when used correctly. Children as young as @NUM1 are learning to use various online resources, such as encyclopedias, magazines, and news sites, to gather information. I recall my kindergarten computer class, where we explored dinosaurs and weather patterns on child - friendly websites. Now, in middle school, we rely on websites like @CAPS1 Online for up - to - date and reliable information. Additionally, my mother, a nurse and hospital manager, uses the internet to access videos and articles on medical procedures and hospital management. The internet offers a wealth of information at one's fingertips. Moreover, computers are an effective means of communication. @PERCENT2 of teenagers use platforms like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or @CAPS5 to interact with their peers. This is particularly useful given our busy schedules, as it allows us to stay connected even when we cannot meet in person. In the current economic climate, many families are forced to relocate due to job losses. Last @DATE1, one of my closest friends moved to @LOCATION1. I was heartbroken, thinking our friendship would end, but through @CAPS6 and @CAPS5, we communicate constantly and have grown even closer. Social networking is not limited to young people; adults also use it for business purposes, discussing future deals and problems, and reconnecting with old friends. In conclusion, the internet has had numerous positive effects, from streamlining research to strengthening social bonds, and computers are benefiting people of all ages.
988	990	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I acknowledge that computers have certain advantages, but they also come with significant drawbacks. Spending excessive time on computers leads to a lack of social interaction, a decrease in physical activity, and potential health risks. Firstly, excessive computer use can damage personal relationships. When one spends a large amount of time on the computer, it can strain marital relationships and harm the bond with children. I am not advocating for the complete abandonment of computers, as I use them myself. However, it is crucial not to let computers dominate our lives, as it is detrimental to our well - being. Secondly, statistics show that @PERCENT1 of people who are constantly on computers gain weight more rapidly. As a @NUM1 - year - old, I have personally experienced a slight weight gain due to computer use. People tend to eat more while on the computer, and since it is difficult to move around while using a computer, physical activity decreases. Limiting computer time is essential for reaping the benefits of exercise. Lastly, long - term computer use poses serious health risks. Prolonged periods in front of the computer can damage eyesight. My eyesight deteriorates after just half an hour on the computer, and many people experience headaches from extended computer use. Additionally, extended computer use increases the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome, which is extremely painful. While computers are entertaining and useful, they have undeniable disadvantages. By limiting computer time, we can minimize these negative effects and enjoy the benefits that computers offer.
989	991	1	2	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1, and I am writing to highlight the benefits of computers. I firmly believe that computers are an excellent tool for children like me to learn about the world. They also assist those in need and provide information about distant places. Without computers, our knowledge of the world would be severely limited. Computers enable the rapid transmission of emergency messages across the globe in @NUM1. Some people argue that computers reduce the time people spend on exercise, but I believe the opposite is true. Computers can offer various exercise techniques. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on society, enhancing our learning, communication, and access to information.
990	992	1	2	Computers are highly useful as they provide a wealth of information. For example, if you need the contact number of a restaurant, you can easily obtain it from the computer. When planning a vacation, you can use the computer to check the costs. Additionally, if you are traveling to a new place, you can access maps on the computer and print them out. However, computers also have their drawbacks. When people use chat websites, there is a risk that adults may interact with young children. Overall, while computers offer great convenience, users need to be aware of the potential risks and use them responsibly.
991	993	1	2	"Have you ever pondered what life would be like without computers? Some experts worry that people are spending excessive time on computers. In my view, we should still use them. Undoubtedly, using a computer aids our learning. It allows us to learn about other parts of the world. A certain percentage of people say they'd love to view beautiful places globally. Computers can also teach languages. A person from an organization mentioned that taking Spanish online helped them a great deal in class. Nowadays, computers offer online study groups that can assist us in getting into college. Many would concur that using a computer helps us learn new things. It's a fact that we interact with others on computers. We meet new people when using them, and most people enjoy meeting others online. We also develop social skills on the computer. Another percentage of people say they learn social skills through it. People can also develop a personality because of computer use. A person stated that ""since I started using the computer, I've gained a better sense of self."" As we interact with others on computers, we grow. Did you know that a computer can be a life - teacher? A person said that using a computer helps with typing and hand - eye coordination. Typing numerous essays in college can also benefit from this. Clearly, computers are helpful for our future. Without a doubt, people should continue using computers as they are beneficial in many ways. So, what are you waiting for? Go and use your computer today!"
992	994	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, in @LOCATION1, there's a significant issue where people, especially kids, spend too much time on computers and neglect exercise, time outdoors, and family bonding. In my opinion, to address this, people should be restricted to using the computer for a set amount of time from @ORGANIZATION1. After that, they should engage in a good workout, spend time outside, and most importantly, be with their families. I believe this solution will improve the situation. Instead of coming home from school and immediately going to the computer for the rest of the night, people can have a more fulfilling experience. It will also help students get better grades. If one is constantly on the computer and has no time for exercise, outdoor activities, and family time, they likely won't have time for homework. This can lead to lower grades and a lack of understanding of the class material. The problem of computer over - use is exacerbated by popular websites like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. Kids are highly addicted to them, and when parents ask them to get off, the ""one - minute"" response often turns into an hour or more. By the time they finally get off, it's too late to go outside. I think there should be a time limit on platforms like Facebook and Twitter, logging users off after @NUM1 minutes. This is a national issue, and in my view, there should be a law requiring kids to play outside and spend time with family before using the computer. As evident, while these great websites exist, they cause problems for kids. Thank you for considering my thoughts on this computer - related problem in @ORGANIZATION1."
993	995	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are a great asset. For those without phones, they're an excellent way to connect with known people and meet new ones. When students finish high school and plan to attend college, they can use computers to find suitable colleges, check their prices, and discover ways to get there. Another advantage is shopping. When a holiday approaches, one can search online to find inexpensive yet nice items. If short on time, these items can be ordered online and delivered to one's home. These are the reasons I think using the computer is beneficial. We can chat, find places and prices, look for colleges, and shop online. In conclusion, the computer offers a wide range of useful functions, making it a valuable tool in our lives.
994	996	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I've noticed that many people are spending excessive time on computers and less time on exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. In my opinion, we should keep using computers because they are helpful for schoolwork, communicating with distant family, and making new friends. Firstly, computers are extremely useful for school homework and projects. This is my top reason as they are both helpful and convenient. If your computer isn't working, you can use a friend's and save your work on a hard drive to print at school. Secondly, computers are essential for communicating with family. Without them, it would be difficult to stay in touch. Even if your phone isn't working, you can still use the computer to communicate. Thirdly, computers are great for making new friends and staying connected. You can send messages to family if you're running late. I understand that some people say computer use is excessive and addictive. However, they are crucial for school projects and assignments. They are not just for entertainment but for productive tasks and family communication. In conclusion, we should not get rid of computers as they are valuable for schoolwork and family interaction. We should continue to use them in a balanced way.
995	997	1	2	"Many families around the world, from @LOCATION1 to the deserts of @LOCATION2, use computers. Some believe that computer use can have negative effects like a lack of exercise. However, I firmly believe that if used correctly, computers can have a positive impact on society. On the positive side, there are numerous benefits to having a computer. There are countless activities to do, we can learn from the internet, and it's highly entertaining. If you own a computer, you'll likely agree that there are many great things it can offer. For instance, there are many online colleges. You may have heard the commercial ""@CAPS1 in your @CAPS2's."" Through these, students can obtain their @CAPS3.E.D and have a successful career. Additionally, you can get discounts on many items by shopping online. There are various shopping sites like @ORGANIZATION1, and many shops such as @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have online catalogs. If you have relatives or friends living far away, there are multiple options like @CAPS6 (including @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9). Webcam programs allow you to see and talk to each other, and @CAPS10 helps you find friends and check on their daily lives. These are all good reasons for the success of computers in the economy. Some computers are used for entertainment. There are many @CAPS16 games online, like those from @CAPS11 (e.g., @CAPS12 @CAPS13 Online @CAPS14 - @CAPS15 @CAPS16). I play many of these, including @CAPS17. I love these games because they create an amusing world. You can also watch your favorite movies and funny clips on @CAPS18, a worldwide platform for watching and uploading videos. For example, the @CAPS18 video ""@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21 @CAPS22"" shows a young boy getting bitten by his younger brother. This entertainment system is a great way to pass time when bored. I understand how people can get addicted, but we just need to use the computer wisely, perhaps for an hour a day. Computers also offer many great learning resources, like online websites with fun @CAPS16. In conclusion, computers are a valuable tool with many benefits, as long as we use them responsibly."
996	998	1	2	Envision a life devoid of the advantages computers offer. Would it render life somewhat more arduous? Computers exert positive influences on individuals for educational purposes and as a novel means to develop skills. The role of computers in our society is of great significance.  Computers can fulfill our educational requirements. During a school project, over a certain percentage of students utilize a computer to access the necessary information. It is true that students may rely excessively on computers rather than books, yet computers present more information than the average book. As students, computers enable us to expand our knowledge. An organization stated that a near - certain percentage of students learn new things from a computer that they previously did not know. In specific fields, a student can acquire more information about a particular country from a computer than from a book. It is predicted that due to the information access provided by computers, students' grades will soon increase by at least a certain amount to a certain percentage. A survey conducted by an organization found that a certain percentage of students discovered more relevant information on a selected topic via a computer than in the entire school library.  Moreover, computers can enhance hand - eye coordination in young children. In school, students' coordination development is observed. With a certain percentage of students having poor coordination initially, computer games reduced this percentage. Computers indeed assist students in meeting their educational needs in a particular location.  Computers also serve as an excellent means of socializing with friends. It is a novel and innovative way of communication. Some may claim that there is less in - person interaction, but interacting on the computer still counts as interaction. While a phone only allows chatting, a computer is equipped with a webcam. This device enables us to communicate with others with a certain degree of human interaction. Around a certain number to another number of a particular group have this device for use. It is pre - installed in many laptops of certain organizations, providing us with portable access for communication. The CEO of an organization said that since laptops have come with built - in webcams, one out of every two users with this feature uses it for social chatting and business. Computers can facilitate our communication for personal or business needs.  Computers are also a good way to initiate and develop certain skills. More than a certain percentage of children use a computer to start building the foundations of these skills. Computers allow people to interact with each other in new and effective ways.  In conclusion, the average computer can positively impact our lives. From meeting our educational needs to fulfilling our personal skills development requirements, computers positively affect us in these two crucial aspects.
997	999	1	2	Imagine a life without computers. Writing articles on a typewriter or by hand would undoubtedly be a cumbersome task. In the media, the debate about whether computers are beneficial to society has emerged. Some argue that people spend less time exercising, interacting with nature, and with their families. However, computers represent a significant advancement in modern science and bring benefits to communities.  Computers have significantly contributed to education, both at school and at home. One can hardly imagine the trouble of coming home with an assignment or having to write two essays by hand. The urge to finish quickly might lead to hasty work and a poor grade. Additionally, handwriting can be an issue. Many students have poor handwriting, making it difficult for teachers to grade their work. With programs like an organization's software, users can choose from various fonts, colors, bolding options, add pictures, symbols, etc.  In schools, computers are increasingly being used by teachers to aid learning. Students take tests on computers, visit websites for research, and use programs like PowerPoint for projects. Computers not only assist in schoolwork but also enable students to learn more effectively.  Computers also play a vital role in keeping in touch with friends and family. The era of short letters has been replaced by long emails with attached pictures, which can be sent in seconds via the internet and appear on the recipient's screen. People can save money by storing pictures on their computers instead of having them developed. Communication through computers has advanced significantly. Features such as video chat (vchat), where one can see and talk to the other person, or audio chat, have made it easier to connect. These convenient communication methods encourage people to stay in touch with their loved ones.  Computers also offer a wealth of entertainment on the web. There are websites where one can play games, reconnect with old acquaintances, or watch funny videos. Typing a query into the toolbar instantly provides a page of links to relevant websites. For example, YouTube allows people to upload videos, offering endless possibilities. Another popular website is a particular one where users can 'friend' people from the past, post videos, and write messages.  In conclusion, it is time to recognize the full benefits of computers. They are beneficial to modern society as they support education, promote communication with family and friends, and offer entertainment. We should acknowledge that computers are a major scientific advancement, a great help, and a source of fun.
998	1000	1	2	The impact of computers on humans is undoubtedly positive. The remarkable intelligence they offer should be embraced rather than feared and avoided. Whether we accept it or not, computers will be essential for solving future problems. Moreover, for personal use, computers are highly beneficial.  The main reason people fear computers is the perceived danger of their radiation, which is not reasonable upon closer examination. Not using such a sophisticated and developed system as the computer is completely irrational. The computer is the future, plain and simple. It is inevitable that computers and related technologies will shape the future of our world.  Computers can play a crucial role in solving global problems. They can predict natural disasters, allowing people in the affected areas to be evacuated and potentially saving lives. They can calculate pollution margins and provide solutions to reduce the large amount of pollution released by humans into the air and other environments, thus sparing nature. Making full use of computers can achieve so much more. People must adapt to this technology; otherwise, we will fall behind and witness the deterioration of our environment. This demonstrates that the impact of computers on people is not only positive but also necessary for progress in an ever - evolving world.  On a more personal level, computers also bring benefits. In most cases, computers perform better and make fewer errors than humans. Instead of sending humans to dangerous locations like deep water, computers can be deployed to explore previously inaccessible areas. Faster communication is also extremely useful in certain situations. For example, in a workplace where an area becomes off - limits, an employee can simply email their employer, providing accurate information and avoiding putting themselves in danger or the hassle of a commute. Even across long distances, with just a click, people around the world can be informed of an accident. Foreign communication, especially through instant messaging, can strengthen our ties with other nations in both business and government.  Finding information is incredibly easy with a computer. Without computers, we would still have to go to the library, check out books, and read through numerous pages to find information that could be retrieved in less than a minute on a computer. Even those who are skeptical about computers have to admit their high utility.  Some people, especially parents, have concerns about the safety and reliability of computers. However, these concerns can be easily addressed. By installing one of the many available programs that allow access to 'good' websites and block 'bad' or potentially dangerous ones, the risks associated with online interactions can be eliminated. In fact, computers are generally safe. Only a small fraction of websites contain content considered 'detrimental' to humans, and a large proportion of websites provide reliable and correct information. These statistics dispel the doubts about the safety and reliability of computers.  In conclusion, the positive influence of computers on users far outweighs the negative aspects. Computers are the future and have even proven to save lives. The benefits of personal computers are too significant to ignore. When carefully evaluated, computers are reliable and can be made extremely safe, eliminating the main concerns. We have come a long way in developing such a beneficial and necessary device, and we should put it to good use to improve our own lives and the lives of others.
999	1001	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I believe people should use computers for specific reasons. One important reason is that many people lose contact with their family or others. When both parties have computers, they can see each other. For those who want to play online with classmates or friends, computers are a must - have. Additionally, typing on a computer provides exercise for the fingers.  Many young people think that social media platforms like MySpace and Facebook are bad places, but in fact, most of our family members are on these platforms. Doctors use computers to notify other doctors about a patient's condition or to provide visual information about a patient's breathing. Workers can use computers to check for available jobs. Students can use them to show their work when the teacher is not around.  If I were a carpenter or a real estate agent, I would always carry a computer. This way, my team could know which houses are available or have been sold. I could also offer different houses for clients to choose from and give them good deals. I would also use the computer's GPS function to know my location.  People use computers for various reasons, such as looking for game guides, cheat codes, trading cards, and other things. I use a computer because my work is important to me. If I miss work, I can complete it on the computer.  In conclusion, computers are very important. They can be used in case of emergencies when you don't have a phone. Everyone has things to do, and computers are the best tools to help us achieve our goals.
1000	1002	1	2	Dear Local newspaper, I think computers are great resources. They can quickly help us find information and are easy to use. Once you master using a computer, it seems like you can do almost anything on it. However, computers can also have negative impacts on us. Although I like computers, I have to say I'm against excessive use.  When people are on their computers, it's as if they enter another world. They become less social compared to when they're not using the computer. Many people are addicted to their computers and stay on them for long periods, acting as if it's a daily necessity. I don't need to be on computer websites like a particular one, and here's why.  Computers can be really annoying at times. They are major distractions. The other day, my sister and I planned to go for a walk, but she was so engrossed in the computer that we didn't go. Since it doesn't help us exercise, we shouldn't rely on it so much.  In today's economy, having social skills is crucial. Instant messaging doesn't mean you're developing social skills. You actually need to go out and talk to people face - to - face. When I'm on the computer for too long, I can tell because my eyes start to hurt. Staring at the bright screen for a long time is bad for your eyesight. People just sit in their houses and stare at the screen, not realizing that it can cause harm.  In conclusion, I'm not saying that computers are evil. I'm just suggesting that we use them for information and work rather than for games and other non - essential things. Instead of sitting at home in front of the computer, we should go outside and make real friends in person.
1001	1003	1	2	Dear Newspaper, individuals should engage in activities with their family and friends rather than spending excessive time on the computer. By doing so, people can improve their physical fitness, strengthen family bonds, and achieve better academic performance. Physical exercise facilitates faster fitness improvement compared to a sedentary computer - based lifestyle. Unplugging the computer creates an opportunity for outdoor play. When people go outside to play with friends, they exercise, which aids in weight loss. Some scientists believe that outdoor socialization is more beneficial than sitting in front of a computer watching monotonous videos.   Avoiding excessive computer use and going outside makes people more active, keeping them satisfied with their physical condition and healthy, thus reducing the risk of serious diseases. Family relationships can be strengthened when people are less reliant on the computer. Instead of being fragmented by technology, families can stay close - knit. Family members are always there to comfort and support each other during difficult times. Solving problems within the family through in - person interaction is far more effective than virtual communication, as it allows for physical comfort like hugs.   Moreover, closer family relationships contribute to better academic results for children. Families that limit computer use and have dinners together often have children who perform better in school. Scientists agree that kids who spend quality time with their families are more likely to achieve good grades. If children can get better grades by staying away from computers and spending time with their families, it may lead to the development of great inventions that benefit humanity.   In conclusion, staying off computers is an excellent way to benefit oneself and others. It promotes physical fitness, strengthens family bonds, and may produce more graduates capable of making significant inventions. One can only imagine the positive changes that can occur by reducing computer usage.
1002	1004	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, in many households, @CAPS2 people own computers, yet some doubt the benefits of computers. There are indeed advantages to using computers, such as the ability to search for information, develop hand - eye coordination, and improve organization. However, there are also drawbacks. Children tend to spend more time on the computer instead of going outside, playing with friends, exercising, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  I believe that computers have a positive impact on children. They enable children to stay in touch with distant family members and help them complete projects more efficiently and quickly. It often seems that while we are doing one thing on the computer, we can actually be uploading pictures and movies, downloading music, and playing games simultaneously.   After sharing all this information with you on @DATE1, I hope we share the same view on computers, recognizing their value and positive influence.
1003	1005	1	2	"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, some experts claim that computers are ""taking over people"", but I firmly disagree. People use computers for the amount of time they need and desire, and then they can become active or spend time with family and friends.  Computers offer numerous benefits. They are a powerful learning tool. One can learn about other countries, read news articles, acquire different languages, and gain knowledge about the world. Moreover, online communication is made easy with computers. There are various platforms such as Skype, which allows real - time communication via webcam, instant messengers, and @CAPS3. @CAPS3 provides an experience similar to having a face - to - face conversation. Email is another useful feature for sending letters, photos, and comments.  In addition, computers are essential for many @CAPS5 people in their work. Microsoft @CAPS4 enables users to write stories and letters, and @CAPS5 people often use it to create job reports. The internet also plays a crucial role in work, as websites and search engines offer a wealth of information that working people need.  To sum up, computers allow people to learn, communicate with friends and family, and are widely used by @CAPS5 working people for work - related tasks. I hope this letter has convinced you that computers are not bad but rather beneficial."
1004	1006	1	2	"As I walked into my bedroom, I noticed the computer on a wonderful desk. There is an ongoing debate about whether computers benefit society. In my opinion, computers are extremely useful, and I wholeheartedly support this technology.  Computers are excellent aids for students. This year, I had a science project on how my hobbies related to science. One of my hobbies is reading, and I needed to research its scientific aspects. I simply typed my question on the internet, and within seconds, I got thousands of results, along with some pictures. After submitting the project, I received an A. Without the computer, achieving such a grade would have been much more difficult. Clearly, computers can assist students with school projects.  Computers also help in reconnecting with friends and family. In elementary school, my friend @PERSON1 moved to @LOCATION1 @CAPS2. I lost touch with her until I found an online chatting program. Now, we can talk to each other almost every day, even though we don't see each other as often as before. This shows that computers can re - establish old relationships.  Furthermore, computers can enrich people's minds. In school, we use a program called ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4"". It involves playing games to improve @CAPS3 skills and taking tests. This program has helped us prepare for the @ORGANIZATION1's. After taking multiple tests in various subjects, I feel more confident about the upcoming exams.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on society. They assist students in school, help reconnect with loved ones, and enhance knowledge. I believe more people should own computers as they can expand one's knowledge. I am definitely in favor of using computers."
1005	1007	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, computers have brought about positive changes in our daily lives. They have enabled people to strengthen existing relationships with family and friends and even make new ones. Additionally, computers make work easier and more professional - looking, and they can improve hand - eye coordination. However, the question remains: Is the computer a harmful or helpful device?  With the computer and internet access, it's easy to find and contact long - lost friends and relatives through social networks like @CAPS1. I often hear stories of reunions and reconnections. Making new friends is also as simple as a click of a button.   Modern computers offer excellent software from @ORGANIZATION2, which simplifies the creation of slideshows, projects, and reports. I recall making a @CAPS2 with my best friend in @NUM1 grade. We just took pictures, uploaded them to his laptop, added captions, and ended up with a professional - looking project that earned us an A -.  Although computer use may reduce the time people spend outdoors, it enhances hand - eye coordination. Consider a baseball game: with @NUM2 strikes and @NUM3 balls, the pitcher throws the ball, and you use hand - eye coordination to hit a home run.   When people wonder about the impact of computers, they should remember how easily work can be done, like the project I completed. They should also think about the baseball player using hand - eye coordination to hit a home run. Most importantly, they should recognize how effortlessly computers allow us to stay in touch with our loved ones. In conclusion, the computer is a positive advancement in society, and everyone should be confident in its benefits.
1006	1008	1	2	Dear editor of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, it is evident that an increasing number of individuals are using computers, a fact you are surely aware of. However, the question arises: is such extensive computer use truly necessary? I, too, was once a frequent computer user. But then I took up sports like skateboarding and snowboarding, and gradually distanced myself from it. Nevertheless, there are still numerous people who continue to use computers. I firmly believe that individuals should make an effort to reduce their computer time. Prolonged computer use can lead to weight gain, and there are far more rewarding activities than sitting in front of a computer all day. Moreover, spending time outdoors and breathing fresh air is highly beneficial.  Firstly, excessive computer use can result in significant weight gain. Being overweight is not only aesthetically unappealing but can also be emotionally distressing as individuals often have limited control over it. I have a few friends who struggle with obesity, such as @PERSON1. When @PERSON1 was @NUM2, he weighed approximately @NUM1 lbs. It has been about a year since I last saw him, and we shared some great memories. However, I feel deeply sorry for him as he is severely overweight. He doesn't even know how to ride a bike, and unfortunately, no one is willing to teach him. His father is absent, and his mother and sister are also overweight. Clearly, being overweight is detrimental, and excessive computer use only exacerbates the problem.  Secondly, there are countless more fulfilling activities than spending the entire day on the computer. Wasting time on the computer is akin to squandering one's life. Instead of being glued to the screen, one can engage in social activities with friends, such as shopping or participating in sports. These activities involve physical movement and are far more beneficial than sedentary computer use. Even a simple walk can do wonders for your well - being. There are indeed many enjoyable things to do on the computer, but there are also numerous other options that are more rewarding.  Most importantly, spending time outdoors and breathing fresh air is incredibly beneficial. Whether it's walking, jumping on a trampoline, or skateboarding, any outdoor activity is superior to sitting in front of a computer. Even sitting on a rock outside can be beneficial for your body as it allows you to inhale fresh air. Outdoor activities are not only good for your physical health but also provide a sense of enjoyment.  So, all you computer enthusiasts, step away from the screen and have some fun outdoors with your friends and family. I sincerely hope you take my advice and remember that excessive computer use can lead to weight gain, there are better things to do, and spending time outdoors is highly beneficial.
1007	1009	1	2	Has your child ever requested a computer for school? Were you confused when they mentioned @CAPS2 in school, claiming it can enhance hand - eye coordination, enable learning from distant places, or allow interaction with people worldwide? What was your reaction? Did you agree? If so, you may have focused only on the positive aspects and overlooked the negative ones.  I have several reasons for opposing the idea of students having computers in school. These include safety concerns, financial implications, and health risks. While it is true that interacting with others can be beneficial, it is not without risks. If your child interacts with strangers online, you are likely to be worried. Strangers may ask personal questions such as their identity, address, and may even propose in - person meetings. My friend @PERSON2 shared that after her school introduced these computers, her friend @PERSON3 was invited to meet someone she didn't know and agreed to it, but thankfully, @PERSON3 didn't show up. Would you want such a situation to happen to your child? This is just the beginning.  Once a school provides computers, students may become addicted. @PERSON1 once said that if a child fails to enjoy their childhood and instead focuses solely on homework while constantly being on the computer, they will eventually become obese. It is crucial for children to go outside, have fun, and exercise. Otherwise, they will be glued to the computers @NUM1.  Another significant issue is the cost. Schools will have to bear a substantial financial burden to purchase and maintain these computers. If your child damages a computer, you will also be required to pay a hefty sum. Additionally, school computers may be vulnerable to viruses from inappropriate websites, and you will be responsible for the repair costs. Moreover, the school may run out of funds for essential learning materials. What will you do then? Your child is at school for education, not to become addicted to computers.  Considering all these factors, I firmly believe that students should not be provided with computers in school. There is a @PERCENT1 chance that they may face various problems associated with computer use. I hope you will reconsider your support for school - provided computers.
1008	1010	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I have recently been considering the topic of computer use, and I believe there are strong reasons for people to use computers. My three main arguments are that computers enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about distant places and individuals, and facilitate online communication.  Computers are effective in teaching hand - eye coordination. As people type on the keyboard, the more they practice, the faster and more coordinated their movements become. With increased typing speed, individuals develop better hand - eye coordination.  Using computers also gives people the opportunity to learn about far - off places and people. By using search engines like Google, people can find a wealth of information on various topics. They can enter a person's name and location, and the computer will display relevant websites with detailed information.  In addition, computers allow people to communicate with others from different locations. Platforms such as AIM, MySpace, and Facebook are popular for social interaction. People can play games and chat simultaneously, making computers highly popular in today's world. The functionality of these websites is what makes computers so useful.  In conclusion, based on these three reasons - enhancing hand - eye coordination, enabling learning about distant places and people, and facilitating online communication - I strongly recommend that people make use of computers.
1009	1011	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I'm sure you have a computer at home. Currently, over @PERCENT1 of people have at least one computer in their households. While computers have become ubiquitous, there is an ongoing debate about whether they are truly necessary in our society. In my view, computers have several negative impacts on people, including vision loss, the risk of interacting with strangers online, and a lack of outdoor exercise.  The number of people wearing glasses or contacts is increasing rapidly. Nowadays, one in five people rely on corrective eyewear. This is largely due to the excessive time children and adults spend on computers. Prolonged computer use can cause eye strain, headaches, and ultimately, vision problems. People often ignore these warning signs, either because they need to complete work or are addicted to online games. This clearly demonstrates the harmful effects of computers on society.  When using the internet, there are no restrictions on who a person can interact with. There are countless untrusted websites, and the online world is filled with strangers. Interacting with unknown individuals can be extremely dangerous as they may have malicious intentions. For example, on Facebook, people may think their profiles are private, but in reality, much of the information they post is accessible to the public. Even non - friends can view a person's profile, posing a significant safety risk.  The rate of internet addiction is also on the rise. People who are addicted to the internet tend to stay at home and avoid outdoor activities. This lack of exercise, combined with a diet often consisting of unhealthy fast food, leads to weight gain and other health problems. They miss out on social interactions with people outside and the benefits of being in nature.  In conclusion, computers have a detrimental impact on society. They contribute to an increase in the number of people with vision problems, create an unsafe online environment, and lead to unhealthy lifestyles due to a lack of exercise and unbalanced diets.
1010	1012	1	2	Dear local newspaper writer, I'm writing to discuss the benefits of computers in our communities. I firmly believe that computers offer numerous advantages, primarily in terms of natural disaster warnings, educational opportunities, and online communication.  One of the most significant benefits of computers is their ability to warn us about natural disasters. For instance, during Hurricane Katrina, computers were able to detect the approaching storm, allowing many people to evacuate the city in time. Statistics show that computers can identify @PERCENT1 of natural disasters. They have saved countless lives. Another example is the recent earthquakes in @LOCATION1. Thanks to computers, many people were informed in advance, which helped them take necessary precautions.  Computers are also excellent educational tools. They provide access to a vast amount of information on any topic. For a school project, all I had to do was type a person's name into a search engine, and I was presented with numerous pages of detailed information. The amount of knowledge available on computers is truly astonishing. Whether it's learning about distant places, new words, or current events in our own country, computers have everything one needs.  Online communication is another area where computers shine. There are numerous social media platforms such as MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter, which allow people to connect with friends, family, and even strangers from around the world. While there are some risks associated with online communication, such as interacting with strangers, it also offers a great deal of fun. If you can't meet a friend in person, you can use video - calling services like @ORGANIZATION1 or ooVoo to stay in touch.  In conclusion, computers make our lives much easier. They warn us about natural disasters, educate us on a wide range of topics, and facilitate online communication. I firmly believe that computers are an invaluable asset to our communities.
1011	1013	1	2	I firmly believe that people should not devote excessive time to using computers. There are three primary reasons for this view. Firstly, prolonged computer use can have a detrimental impact on one's eyesight. Staring at a computer screen for extended periods can cause eye strain and other vision problems. I recommend that individuals limit their computer usage to no more than an hour at a time. One can tell they have been on the computer too long when their eyes start to hurt.  Secondly, spending excessive time on the computer means missing out on valuable opportunities to spend time with family and friends. While some people prefer to sit in front of a computer screen all day, this can lead to a lack of social interaction and a reduced ability to enjoy real - world experiences. Some individuals may even become less inclined to go out and socialize.  Lastly, sitting in front of a computer all day and eating can result in weight gain. This sedentary lifestyle is unhealthy and can have a negative impact on one's overall well - being. Instead of sitting idly, people should go outside and engage in physical activities.  In conclusion, the negative effects of excessive computer use on eyesight, social life, and physical health are significant. Therefore, people should reduce their computer time and focus on more beneficial activities.
1012	1014	1	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, have you ever considered people's perspectives on certain technologies? While some claim that people waste time on computers, I am of the opinion that computers offer numerous benefits. They can assist with homework, facilitate interaction with others, and even support exercise.  For many students, computers are essential for academic success. There are online learning platforms that provide lessons and access to digital books. In case students forget their physical textbooks, they can still complete their homework using these online resources. My math teacher, @PERSON2, often encourages us to ""@CAPS1 into the online sight,"" and I have found it extremely helpful when struggling with my studies. Additionally, we can seek help from friends if we still have difficulties understanding the material.  Computers also enable us to interact with others through platforms like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. These platforms are useful when friends are out of town without a cell - phone or when the landline is in use. We can use them to help friends with their homework or just have a chat. In @LOCATION1, over a million people use these platforms.  Contrary to the belief that computers take time away from exercise, there are many websites that offer weight - loss tips, dieting plans such as those by @PERSON3 or @PERSON1, and exercise programs. It is not the computer's fault if people do not stick to an exercise routine. Moreover, computers can recommend great gyms like @LOCATION2 fitness.  In conclusion, computers are a valuable asset for everyone. They offer a wide range of benefits in education, social interaction, and health. I cannot imagine life without them, and I hope you will also recognize their positive impact."
1013	1015	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I strongly disagree with those who advocate for the excessive use of computers. I believe that there are far more rewarding activities than spending time in front of a computer screen.  People who love to travel would much rather explore new places than waste time on a computer. Although looking at interesting places on the internet can be appealing, there is no substitute for actually visiting those places. Taking a trip to a far - away destination may seem daunting, but it is definitely worth the try.  If traveling is not an option, exercise is another great alternative. For example, my mother used exercise to fit into a size @NUM1. Instead of relying on computers that may give incorrect advice, one can seek advice from a real friend. Losing weight can boost confidence, as @PERSON1 from @CAPS2 lower said, one must have the desire to achieve their goals.  Furthermore, spending too much time chatting online can prevent us from interacting with friends and family in real life. Just because one can communicate online does not mean they can easily engage in face - to - face conversations.  In conclusion, it is time to make a choice. We should step away from the computer and embrace the real world. Whether it is traveling, exercising, or spending time with loved ones, there are countless opportunities waiting for us outside of the digital realm.
1014	1016	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, the increasing use of computers is a phenomenon that not everyone believes benefits society, and I am among those who disagree with the view that it is entirely positive.  One major issue is that excessive computer use can cause people to neglect important aspects of life. For instance, they may forget to exercise. Exercise is crucial for physical growth and strength. If one spends all day on the computer, they will not develop properly through physical activity.  Another drawback is the lack of appreciation for nature. When sitting in front of a computer, one cannot go on a hike in the woods, take a camping trip, or enjoy the fresh air and beauty of the natural world.  Lastly, computer use can lead to a decrease in interaction with friends and family. While a computer can teach many things, it cannot replace the emotional connection and support that only real - life relationships can provide.  In conclusion, the negative impacts of excessive computer use on exercise, nature appreciation, and social interaction are significant. People should reduce their computer time and focus on these important aspects of life. Thank you for considering my perspective.
1015	1017	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that people should not spend excessive time on computers. There are several reasons for this stance.  Firstly, spending too much time on a computer is detrimental to health. Staring at the screen for long periods can strain the eyes, and for some people, including those prone to seizures, it can trigger an attack. It can also cause vision problems and damage the body, which is clearly an unhealthy habit.  Secondly, excessive computer use leads to a lack of interaction with friends and family. Becoming addicted to the computer can make people forget to greet their family members and spend time with friends. This can cause friends to feel ignored and think that we don't care about them, thus disrupting our social activities.  Lastly, being on the computer all the time means missing out on the joys of nature. Although computers can provide knowledge, there is no substitute for experiencing nature firsthand. Excessive computer use can make people reluctant to exercise, which is bad for their physical well - being. They may forget to go for a jog or explore new things.  In conclusion, the negative effects of spending too much time on the computer are evident. It is not healthy, it isolates us from our loved ones, and it prevents us from enjoying nature. Therefore, we should get off the computer and embrace the real world.
1016	1018	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper, a couple of decades ago, before the advent of computers, children were outside, engaging in physical activities, playing with friends, and leading relatively safe lives. Then, computers emerged. They are leading the next generation towards a perilous existence of spending all day staring at screens, and are also ruining civilized relationships. I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on society.  It is a known fact that since computers entered our lives, as the number of computers sold has increased, the obesity rate has gone up by @PERCENT1. Why? Because people spend excessive time on computers and not enough time exercising. Another consequence of spending long hours in front of a screen is a decline in eyesight. My family friend, @PERSON2, had to get glasses because his eyes were damaged by the computer. A concerned parent at @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON3, said, ""I'm worried about my daughter's eyes... she stares at that screen for hours on end!""   The internet is extremely unsafe. Predators roam the web, seeking out young and innocent individuals, and there is a high likelihood of abuse. @PERCENT2 of parents have been monitoring their children's computer usage, but many are unaware that the internet makes it easy to communicate with anyone in the world, from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2. Monitoring is also crucial to avoid inappropriate videos, pictures, and discussions on the internet. It is very easy to stumble upon such content while surfing the web.  Moreover, people often hide behind their computers and say mean and hurtful things that they would never say in person. These unfortunate circumstances cause many of the current interpersonal issues. Computers also have a very negative impact on relationships today. As mentioned earlier, numerous conflicts occur through computer communications. Even friendly online conversations make people accustomed to interacting with others ""@CAPS3"" through a computer rather than face - to - face. After being in a computer - oriented friendship, people tend to forget how to behave in person and find personal meetings awkward. An eighth - grader at @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1, @CAPS4, ""I can't @CAPS5 only talking through computers, never being civilized with other human beings! Unfortunately, that is where computers are leading us to..."" @CAPS5 never seeing your best friend in person, only through technology! It @MONTH1 not even be your friend; it could be a dangerous imposter. Through the internet, you @MONTH1 not even know who you are in a relationship with; it could be fake, and you'd have no idea.  Spending all day in front of a computer, putting oneself and relationships at risk, is, unfortunately, the consequence of computer use. The terrible consequences that civilization must face are not worth the so - called benefits of computers. I @CAPS6 urge you to halt the technological advancements before it's too late. Make the change today."
1017	1019	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, I sincerely thank you in advance for taking the time to read this letter. It holds great significance to me. I am writing today because I've noticed that some people claim computers do not benefit society. Those individuals are completely wrong! Computers are truly remarkable.  They facilitate easier research. I can explore other countries and communicate with people online on an almost daily basis. Currently, we're wrapping up a substantial research assignment for English and Social Studies. This task involved collecting note - cards from various sources. Fortunately, I was able to use the computer's card catalog. By simply typing a keyword, I found numerous books on my topic. The ability to narrow down options is incredibly easy as we can search for highly specific information. After finding the topic, we can check the reliability of the information by reading a summary. All of this can be accomplished in approximately @NUM1 minutes or less. This would be nearly impossible without a computer.  I have relatives in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. Some time ago, my family and I were planning a trip to @LOCATION2 to visit them. We used a search engine to obtain directions from the airport to their house. It provided the directions and an estimated travel time. I've also been able to conduct extensive research on foreign countries with just a click of a button. It's both simple and convenient.  Two of my uncles live in @LOCATION1. On Thanksgiving, my mother was sad because she missed them. I set them up in a video chatroom so that my mom could talk to them. Instant messaging is wonderful. I can communicate with people worldwide at no cost.  In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial as they enable us to learn about foreign countries, conduct research easily, and communicate online. There are many other reasons why computers are great, but listing them all would take too much time. Thank you again for your attention.
1018	1020	1	2	Dear local Newspaper, I am of the opinion that computers have a positive impact on people.   My first reason is related to long - distance communication. Some college students, like my sister, are far from home. My family can talk to her through the computer. Additionally, many people receive emails about sales at grocery or clothing stores. Using the coupons from these emails helps people save money. Statistics show that adults who use the computer at night feel more awake in the @TIME1.  My second reason is about information - gathering for travel or relocation. If someone is going on vacation or moving, they can use the internet to determine if the destination is safe, if there are good schools, and to learn about the place and see what it looks like. They can also research colleges, find out if they are small or large, and how many students attend.  My third and final reason pertains to the improvement of hand - eye coordination. When people use the computer, especially when typing, they move their fingers. This not only gives them a better feel for the keyboard but also makes them faster typists. They are actively using their fingers and their brains. According to Scholastic kids, kids who use the computer and the keyboard can increase their @CAPS1 by @NUM1 points.  In conclusion, I do not believe that computers have a negative impact. After reading this, I hope you will agree with me.
1019	1021	1	2	I firmly believe that it's acceptable for people to spend a significant amount of time on the computer instead of exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends because it's an individual's choice whether to stay on the computer all day or go outside. Computers have both positive and negative impacts on people's lives.  On the negative side, some people stay indoors all day, doing nothing but sitting and clicking buttons. However, computers also have positive aspects. They are educational in many ways. When you're on the computer, watching or reading interesting things, you might learn something before you learn it in school. It's fine to use the computer for a short period, but if you're on it all day, you may not exercise and could become lazy and overweight. On the other hand, if you go outside occasionally, you'll get the exercise your body needs.  I think computers are a great source of entertainment. You can chat with friends, and if you have a webcam, you can have video chats. They are an excellent means of communication. Millions of people use computers for work at their @CAPS2. Without computers, life would be much more difficult for people in the world. For example, accountants rely on computers for their jobs. They store data in computers, which is impossible to do on a piece of paper. People also create websites on the internet to educate others. For instance, when you type in a word, you can get its definition. There are also @CAPS4 engines on websites that search for the information you type in.  Ultimately, it's up to individuals to decide how much time they want to spend on the computer. Computers and internet connections are not free, and they don't harm your brain; in fact, they mostly educate you. Some people even attend online schools, learning and studying from internet - based materials. You can also get @CAPS2 at places for working with computers, create programs, and do whatever you want.  So, I maintain that it's okay to spend a lot of time on the computer instead of exercising, visiting friends and family, and enjoying nature. Computers are fine, and it doesn't matter how long you're on them, as long as you're learning and not just playing games all day and becoming lazy and overweight.
1020	1022	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper: The question of whether computers positively affect society is an important one. As technology progresses, humans are relying on computers more and more, with most people using them daily. I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people as they assist with writing papers, serve as a social tool, and simplify research. After reading this letter, there should be no doubt about the positive influence of computers on society.  Firstly, computers are extremely helpful in writing papers. Whether it's a resume, a science report, or a spreadsheet, these are rarely written by hand nowadays. Everyone expects to see neatly typed letters on printer paper. Writing a paper often requires multiple drafts to make it perfect, and it's very cumbersome to write each draft by hand. Moreover, typed text is easier to read, especially when the writer has poor handwriting.  Secondly, computers act as a powerful social tool. Many online websites, such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace, have social networks. On these and other sites, people can meet others through friends and games. The advantage of meeting people online is that there's no need to schedule a meeting time. As long as both parties are online, they can start chatting. This is particularly useful for long - distance relationships, whether it's with friends, partners, or family. Online chatting helps people stay in touch with those they may not see every day, which is a great boost to everyone's social life. Online dating sites like eHarmony or Match.com also help people with busy schedules find their perfect partners. This is beneficial for shy people who want to get married and start a family, leading to happier lives.  Finally, computers make research much easier. My dad often says, ""You kids got it easy. When I was growing up, we had to go to the library and spend hours researching before we could write our papers."" Nowadays, it's simple. Using the internet and a search engine, you just need to type a topic, and you can get all the latest articles in seconds. Libraries may not have the most recent books, or the book on your topic may be checked out. The internet is especially useful for very specific research topics, such as a certain bacteria or species that a book may only briefly mention. With the internet having a wider range of articles, it's much easier to find information on any topic. This means people can spend more time enjoying their day, like playing outside, instead of stressing in the library because they can't find a relevant book.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on society. They assist with writing papers, serve as a social tool, and simplify research. Imagine if we had to handwrite everything, how many fewer friends and relationships we would have without social websites, and how difficult research would be without the internet. Computers have improved our lives, and we should be grateful for all they do."
1021	1023	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to express my views on how computers impact people. Computers have a significant influence on individuals. They can lead to weight gain, cause eye problems, and disrupt bill - paying abilities. We all experience weight fluctuations in our lives, and weight loss is possible. However, spending six hours a day on a computer leaves little time for cooking a proper meal. As a result, people often consume large amounts of junk food. Is it acceptable to be a contributing factor to someone's weight gain? Imagine looking at a bright computer screen for six continuous hours. It's unrealistic to think that your eyes will remain unaffected. I struggle to keep my eyes open under such circumstances, and I'm certain that prolonged exposure to a bright screen in the dark will harm your eyes. Some people decide to work from home but end up not doing their work and getting fired. Without an income, how can they pay their bills? Once the power goes out, they are left with nothing to do, all because of their over - reliance on the computer. In conclusion, considering the issues of weight gain, eye problems, and bill - paying difficulties, it's clear that the impact of computers on people can be quite negative. I hope you understand my concerns. Thank you for your time.
1022	1024	1	2	"You are the @NUM1 visitor. Click here to claim your prize! Pop - up ads are common on computers. They can introduce viruses and allow others to access personal information, which is one reason computers can be problematic. According to the missing child agency, more than @NUM2 kids are abducted each day, and many of these abductions occur when children enter chat rooms and get into trouble. We rely too heavily on computers, which is unhealthy. As @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 @CAPS5 states, ""Pop - up ads cause numerous problems."" A worldwide poll in @DATE1 revealed that more than @PERCENT1 of people in the world own computers, and over @PERCENT2 of them are kids. Kids often click on pop - up ads, which can lead to catastrophic issues such as computer viruses, identity theft, and credit card information being compromised. When this happens, parents may get angry at their kids, but it's unfair to blame them as they may have thought they were getting a free Xbox @NUM3. Chatting on computers is also risky. Chat rooms are a major source of danger. Moreover, a significant portion (@PERCENT3) of information on the internet is false, as reported by Technology @CAPS7. I once checked my flight status on Google and was wrongly informed that my flight to @LOCATION1 was cancelled. When I called the airport to confirm, I found that the flight had taken off as scheduled. We should not want our kids to be abducted due to chat rooms or miss our vacations because of incorrect online information. Identity theft from pop - up ads is also unacceptable. We need to be more self - reliant and reduce our dependence on computers."
1023	1025	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. They enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about distant places and individuals, and facilitate online communication. Computers are an excellent technological invention that benefits society. For example, when typing a long essay in a hurry, one cannot constantly look back and forth between the paper, keyboard, and screen. This requires knowledge of the keyboard layout, thereby improving hand - eye coordination. Without computer skills, such tasks would be much more difficult. Computers also allow people to learn about far - off destinations. Suppose someone wants to take a relaxing vacation or honeymoon with their spouse. They can use the computer to check the weather forecast, find out about local restaurants and stores, and estimate the cost of the trip. This helps in planning and deciding whether the trip is feasible. Online communication is another great advantage. On cold days when going outside is not an option or when there is no phone, people can use platforms like MySpace or Facebook to stay in touch with others, as long as they have a @NUM1 and a unique email address. In conclusion, computers are beneficial for society. They teach hand - eye coordination, provide knowledge about distant places and people, and offer a means of online communication. We should continue to embrace this valuable technology.
1024	1026	1	2	Dear trained @ORGANIZATION1 reader, @CAPS1! I love the sound of my computer powering on in the morning. Some people may argue that computers are bad, but I believe they are a magnificent invention. They improve hand - eye coordination, offer a wealth of information, and help people connect with others. Typing a paper on a computer is much faster than writing it by hand. Studies show that typing is @PERCENT1 faster. Even @PERSON1, a handwriting enthusiast, says that typing is easier. Officials note that many handwriting lovers are switching to typing for better hand - eye coordination. If those who oppose typing are using it, it must have its merits. When it comes to information, if you're working on a project about panda bears and know nothing about them, you can search on @CAPS4.com. It's a treasure trove of information. I once had a report to write but was clueless about the topic. @CAPS4.com solved my problem. It's been proven that @PERCENT2 of the information on @CAPS4 is true. Computers also help with communication. You can reconnect with a friend who has moved away or meet new people. For example, @LOCATION1 is a dating site. In conclusion, if you don't like computers, you're missing out on great hand - eye coordination, access to vast information, and the opportunity to meet interesting people. The world is just a click away with computers.
1025	1027	1	2	"Dear readers, many people use computers, yet not everyone believes they benefit society. I firmly believe they do. Social networking sites like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are great tools for connection. They allow you to chat, find people, play games, take quizzes, and have fun with friends. They are an excellent way to locate someone in another town. This is one reason why computers are a valuable resource. Online shopping is another advantage. When you can't go to a store, you can shop online. You simply enter the website address, browse the items, and make a purchase. There are even online grocery stores. As the saying goes, ""It might take a while to receive your purchased items, but it's worth the wait."" If you don't have a @CAPS1 system, you can get directions online from websites like www.mapquest.com. Just enter your starting and destination addresses, and you can print out the directions to avoid getting lost. In conclusion, computers offer multiple benefits. They help you find people, enable online shopping, and provide easy access to directions. Almost everyone can benefit from using a computer."
1026	1028	1	2	Dear Newspaper, it is a known fact that two out of three @CAPS2 own a computer. Computers are an extremely helpful tool that bring benefits to all members of society. They enable people to communicate, learn, and develop hand - eye coordination, which is beneficial for school. The advancement of technology has enhanced computers, allowing people to communicate through them. For example, new webcams enable people to see and talk to each other via the computer screen. This means that regardless of the distance, people can stay in touch. With my webcam, I can keep in contact with my cousins in @LOCATION1. Another communication method is email. Through the internet, people can quickly and easily exchange typed messages, facilitating more frequent communication. In addition to webcams and email, computers provide access to communication websites such as @CAPS3 (instant messaging) or @CAPS4. These platforms allow for rapid and effortless message - sending, much easier than writing a letter, thus enabling more efficient communication. Computers are also very useful for learning. People can learn about foreign places by simply going online, typing in what they want to know, and getting relevant information on the screen. They can view pictures of places, animals, people, and various environments. New websites even offer the opportunity to see the Earth from space, view houses, and explore the wonders of the world. @CAPS6 more would greatly assist people, especially students, in achieving a better education. In school, computers are a highly useful tool. They allow students to type projects and papers more quickly and neatly. Moreover, computers teach students hand - eye coordination through typing and mouse - clicking. If students need help, they can ask their friends via the computer, which helps them better understand the content and get better grades. In conclusion, computers play a significant role in society today. They serve as a means of communication, a learning tool, and help students perform better in school. Overall, they are a highly beneficial tool in our society.
1027	1029	1	2	Dear Newspaper editor, do you have a computer at home? Do you use Facebook, @CAPS2, or other social networking sites? If you are like most respectable, caring @CAPS3 in this country, you probably answered yes to both questions. You likely also believe that the computer is an excellent tool for teaching hand - eye coordination and a great way to communicate with others online. Hand - eye coordination is crucial. Without it, we would struggle to perform basic tasks. For instance, we wouldn't be able to pick up objects as our hands wouldn't reach where our eyes are looking. Although the computer is not the only way to develop hand - eye coordination, it is an important and effortless method. If you are sociable, owning a computer is a must. Computers, cell phones, and PDAs are all forms of computers. These devices have been instrumental in the industrialization and growth of our country. Imagine having to drive to someone's house just to talk to them. With computers, messages can reach people across the world in seconds. They are a remarkable technological innovation. Consider a situation where you have a college paper or a work assignment due tomorrow and have messy handwriting. It would be nearly impossible to complete it on time and legibly. In such cases, the computer comes to the rescue. It improves handwriting, speed, and research capabilities with just a few clicks. In conclusion, the time has come for you to decide whether you appreciate this time - saving, educational invention that allows for social interaction or if you prefer to go back to the old - fashioned way.
1028	1030	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, computers are a remarkable invention. Some people worry that people spend too much time on computers and less time with friends and family. While I understand this concern, spending time on the computer can actually be beneficial. Every minute spent on the computer offers an opportunity to learn something new. For example, when playing games on gaming sites, advertisements can provide useful knowledge. Studies show that spending at least @NUM1 minutes on the computer can lead to new learning. Computers also serve as a means of communication. People can communicate via the internet, making arrangements easily. Although excessive computer use has its drawbacks, these are some of the benefits. Please take them into consideration. In conclusion, despite the potential negative aspects, the positive contributions of computers in terms of learning and communication should not be overlooked.
1029	1031	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have both positive and negative effects on people. However, I think the positive effects outweigh the negative ones. The internet gives people the opportunity to learn about other places, communicate with distant family members, and make new friends. I support technological advancements because they allow people to stay in touch with family they can't see regularly. I have three cousins in @LOCATION1 whom I rarely see, but with computers, we can communicate via email and @CAPS2. My aunt enjoys sharing pictures to see how they've changed. Computers also help in learning about other countries. Through the internet, we can find information about a country's appearance, cuisine, language, etc. Recently, I had to do a project in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 about a place in @LOCATION2. With the help of computers, I learned a great deal about @LOCATION4, @LOCATION3, which made me want to visit someday. Another advantage of new technology is the ability to make new friends. According to the @CAPS5 @CAPS6, at least @PERCENT1 of kids have MySpace or Facebook accounts to interact with people worldwide. However, there are risks when talking to strangers. One should be cautious and not disclose personal information. In conclusion, I support technological advancements to a certain extent. Computers help us communicate with family, learn about new places, and make new friends. Thank you for your time.
1030	1032	1	2	Computers and other devices are beneficial for humans, especially young people. They are useful for communication, maintaining attention, and providing information. Communication is essential, and technology offers the best and fastest means. Cell phones allow for calling and texting. For example, if you're late for dinner with friends, you can quickly send a text. Email enables longer - message communication. Video chat is also great, as it's like talking to someone in person, especially for long - distance relatives. Keeping a person's attention is important. Technology achieves this through games, music from @NUM1's, game systems, iPods, and on - screen instructions. While teachers and parents can also do this, on - screen instructions are more exciting. Information is the most common reason for using technology. When a child has a school project, they either use the computer or ask their parents. If parents don't know the answer, they tell the child to look it up on the computer. The internet, which is part of computers, cell phones, iPods, and game systems, has evolved from slow to high - speed. It can provide directions, recipes, job offers, and much more. However, technology can also slow down the human race. We spend too much time on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 @CAPS4 instead of exercising or having face - to - face communication with family. In conclusion, while computers and other devices are useful, we need to be aware of their potential negative impacts and find a balance in our use of them.
1031	1033	1	2	"Dear Newspaper, the @CAPS1 technology has witnessed exponential growth in the past few years. The utilization of computers, in particular, has soared. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that this is not a cause for celebration. The constant use of computers can have detrimental effects on people's health, relationships with family and friends, and their appreciation of nature.  Excessive computer use is a significant problem. Have you ever sat in front of a computer screen for hours? If so, you are familiar with the feelings of sleepiness and irritability. The lack of physical activity while using a computer impacts individuals more than they may realize. Prolonged computer use has been associated with obesity and high blood pressure; the more time people spend on the computer, the higher their blood pressure tends to be. Simply sitting in front of a screen is extremely harmful to the body. To maintain good health, computers should only be used when absolutely necessary.  Constant computer use can also isolate people from others. In this generation, especially adolescents, rely more on computers to communicate with others rather than engaging in face - to - face conversations. Communicating solely through the computer can lead to social isolation. Moreover, rumors and secrets spread rapidly on the internet. Overusing the computer can damage relationships, even those with family members. Neglecting family by being constantly on the computer can drive people apart, and family may no longer be a top priority. It is difficult for people to focus on their families when they are engrossed in the computer screen.  Computers are also replacing our connection with nature. Humans originally lived in the wild, gathering food and interacting closely with the natural world. However, instead of listening to the sounds of nature, such as rain and dry leaves, people now prefer the artificial beeping of computers and the ""You've got mail"" notification. People no longer appreciate nature as they once did. The beauty of nature is often overlooked, yet without it, life would not be possible. We can either look at pictures of nature on @ORGANIZATION1.com or go outside and experience it firsthand. It is impossible to truly experience the grandeur of nature while sitting in front of a computer. One cannot feel the coolness of lake water or the heat of a @DATE1 day while sending an email.  In conclusion, computers are extremely harmful to people. They can affect health, relationships, and our appreciation of nature. We must use computers only when necessary to stay healthy. Instead of staying online, we should go outside."
1032	1034	1	2	I am in favor of technological advancements because, in the future, our world will be computer - driven. Through computers, people can learn about places and individuals they could never afford to visit or meet in person. Additionally, computers facilitate communication without the need for direct face - to - face interaction.  I often contemplate the future. When we think about the future, we usually envision a world filled with automated systems. In fact, our world is becoming increasingly technology - dependent. As humans become more intelligent, technology also evolves. If we lack the basic skills to operate a simple device like a computer, how will we be able to handle more complex technologies? It is predicted that within @NUM1 years, our world will be entirely computer - run.  Without computers, our knowledge would be severely limited. How would we know what Egypt looked like @NUM2 years ago? We can simply search for information on the computer and gain as much knowledge as if we had visited the place. Computers also allow us to learn about historical figures and events. For instance, if we want to know more about a particular president, we can easily find information on the computer instead of going to a library.  Computers also play a crucial role in communication. For some people, computers are the only means to stay in touch with family and friends. Consider a family member living in a different country; how would we communicate with them without computers? I have friends living out of state, and I enjoy chatting with them online. It would be time - consuming and pointless to drive across the country to have a conversation.  I understand that some experts are concerned about the negative impacts of computers, such as the lack of exercise among kids. However, many kids who use computers are also involved in sports.  In conclusion, I hope you agree that keeping technology in our lives is essential. It enables us to learn new things about different places and people and helps us communicate with friends and family. Although there are valid concerns, the benefits of technology outweigh the drawbacks.
1033	1035	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 -in-@CAPS2, computers are highly valuable tools in contemporary society and culture. They contribute to the development of cognitive skills and offer a vast reservoir of knowledge. I aim to convey to you all the advantages that computers provide.  Firstly, computers enhance our hand - eye coordination. When using a computer, typing is inevitable. Whether it is a short password or a @NUM1 - page essay, typing is required. Over time, this repetitive action becomes almost instinctive, clearly demonstrating its positive impact on this cognitive skill. Good hand - eye coordination is essential for activities such as driving and many other daily tasks.  Secondly, the internet accessible through computers offers an almost limitless amount of knowledge, much of which is available for free. On websites like @CAPS3, one can find web pages dedicated to just about any topic.  Contrary to some counter - arguments, computers can actually enhance our social lives. Instant messaging platforms like @CAPS4 and @ORGANIZATION1 enable real - time communication with people around the world. Social networks such as @CAPS5 allow us to keep our friends informed about our activities.  I kindly request that you take this letter into consideration and publish it in your editorial. I firmly believe that computers assist us in developing cognitive skills, acquiring knowledge, and socializing. Thank you for your time.
1034	1036	1	2	Dear the @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, while some people claim that computers have a negative impact on society, in my opinion, they bring about positive changes to the world. I believe that computers enhance hand - eye coordination and provide a means of organization. Moreover, they still allow people to interact with others. If you do not share my view now, please read on, and I am confident you will come to agree with me.  When it comes to hand - eye coordination, using a computer is inseparable from typing. Whether it is a brief password or a long @NUM1 - page essay, typing is a necessary part of computer use. This process improves the movement of our hands, which can be beneficial in sports and physical activities. As computers have become ubiquitous, I predict that in the future, typing or using a computer will be a standard skill, perhaps even included in the @CAPS2, due to the hand - eye coordination it offers. The concept is that whatever we think, we type.  In addition to hand - eye coordination, computers offer excellent organization, which is a significant concern in modern life. Do you have picture files scattered around your house? With computers, you can store all your files neatly. Everything becomes easily accessible, and even doctors use computers to manage medical records efficiently and save time.  Furthermore, computers continue to facilitate social interaction. I can communicate with friends and family who are far away. While I acknowledge that face - to - face interaction is essential, computers are a great alternative when direct contact is not possible.  In conclusion, computers have a positive influence on our lives. They improve hand - eye coordination, help us stay organized, and bring people together. Although some may hold a different view, I am certain that computers benefit society.
1035	1037	1	2	Dear editor of @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter because I believe people are not getting enough exercise due to excessive computer use. Here are some issues I hope you will write about to raise public awareness.  Firstly, when people spend too much time on the computer, they tend to be sedentary. They do not walk or engage in physical activity. As a result, they gain @CAPS2 and put stress on their hearts. This can lead to various health problems and limit their physical capabilities.  Secondly, some websites are not suitable for kids. When children have free access to the computer, they may come across inappropriate content such as @CAPS10, @CAPS11, gun - related sites, and other harmful materials. This exposure can have a negative impact on their mental and moral development. Kids may try to imitate what they see on these websites, which can lead to dangerous behavior and potentially harm themselves or others.  Thirdly, chat sites can be a source of inappropriate attention - seeking behavior. Some individuals may post or do things they are not supposed to. For example, a @NUM2 - year - old man may engage in improper activities. I hope you can write about these issues and monitor such platforms as much as possible to prevent these problems.  In conclusion, the negative impacts of excessive computer use, including lack of exercise, exposure to inappropriate content, and improper behavior on chat sites, are significant. It is crucial to address these issues to protect people's health and well - being, especially that of children.
1036	1038	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, I envision a world without computers as a better place. Why wouldn't one want to improve the world? While computers can be useful for work and business, young children are sacrificing time for exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Do you prefer a world with or without computers? In my view, people would be better off without them.  The issue of lack of exercise is frequently discussed in society. Computers are one of the factors contributing to this problem, especially in @LOCATION1, which is already one of the most obese countries in the world. No one wants to exacerbate this situation. If the number of computers in each household increases, so will the number of obese people in @LOCATION2. When computers take away time from exercise, health issues become more frequent and occur at a younger age. Dr. @PERSON1 states that ""if kids spend more of their free time on the computer, their risk of diabetes will increase."" @CAPS3 is also a possible consequence of less exercise. Older citizens are at a higher risk of heart attacks. It is said that five out of six people could prevent a heart attack by simply taking some time each day to go to the gym or take a walk. No one should forgo exercise for the sake of playing virtual games and instant messaging on the internet.  When people are on the computer all day, they have less opportunity to enjoy nature. If more people cared about nature, global warming would not be such a significant issue. I believe that the citizens of @LOCATION2 would like to keep their environment cleaner and be more in tune with nature. If more people appreciated and protected nature, wildlife would not be threatened. People would put an end to the harmful actions of some individuals and companies towards nature. Moreover, when you're glued to your computer all day, you miss out on the fresh air, animals, and endless canyons that nature has to offer. People need to spend more time enjoying nature, and computers should not stand in the way.  Most people would agree that their relationships with family members and friends would be stronger if they interacted and spent more time with them instead of being on the computer. @CAPS2, think about how much better dinner conversations and family parties would be if people were more engaged with their families. Additionally, people need the support of their families. A computer cannot help you through the emotional pain of losing a loved one. @PERCENT1 of people can overcome difficult and stressful times with the support of their families.  Last but not least, your social life would improve if you weren't constantly on the computer. Lack of interaction with others can make you antisocial and unappealing to be around. No one wants to be like that. Also, your computer may not always work, but your family and friends will always be there for you.  In conclusion, the world would be a better place without computers. I believe that everyone who spends hours in their room on the computer could improve their exercise habits, appreciation for nature, and relationships with family and friends by stepping away from the computer and engaging in activities that truly benefit them. There is no essential need for a computer in life, but this may not apply to everyone. The question then remains: should we stop using computers or turn them off for good?"
1037	1039	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, some parents are worried about their children spending too much time on the computer. Now, I'll discuss @NUM1 positive aspects of computers, @NUM1 negative aspects, and @NUM1 suggestions on what you should do.  One advantage of computers is the ability to communicate with others. You can talk to your friends online about school - related matters or anything else. This is beneficial because if you forget your homework or need help with something, you can go online and ask your friends. Another benefit is the opportunity to meet @ORGANIZATION1 people. For example, through platforms like @CAPS1 or Facebook. When you meet @ORGANIZATION1 people online, they often come from countries you've never heard of before, and you get to learn something new and make friends from @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2, or @LOCATION1. Additionally, you can learn @ORGANIZATION1 things online about any topic. It could be a @ORGANIZATION1 website that you've never discovered, and the information you find can be useful in the future. For instance, @ORGANIZATION2 can be very helpful.  Now, let's talk about the @NUM1 negative aspects of computers. Firstly, computers can be addictive. For example, I used to be addicted to my computer, but after we got rid of it, I now play with my sisters. Secondly, there are viruses. My grandmother's computer got a virus from a website called @CAPS1. When your computer gets a virus, it's frustrating because you can't do anything or look up information for school. It takes about a week or so to fix a virus - infected computer. Lastly, spending too much time on the computer makes you reluctant to spend time with your family. I know some people who do this, and it's not appropriate, especially when there are guests at home.  Since my time is limited, I'll mention one thing you should do. You should set a specific amount of time for using the computer and then go out and have fun doing other things instead of being on the computer. That's my suggestion for now.  In conclusion, computers have both their pros and cons. By setting limits on computer use, we can enjoy the benefits while minimizing the negative impacts. It's important to find a balance between computer time and other activities in our lives.
1038	1040	1	2	Dear @PERSON1, my name is @PERSON2, and I'd like to share my opinions about computers. Computers are both fun and educational. There are numerous websites offering games, such as Portaportal and @NUM1.com. These websites have safe and enjoyable games for kids under @NUM2. There are also educational websites that can assist you with your work, like Google and AskYourQuestion.com. These sites contain all the information you need when you're stuck on something.  In addition, there are platforms like @CAPS2 and Facebook. I'm aware that there have been rumors about people threatening others during chats. However, aside from that, you can chat with your friends online instead of waiting for your mom to finish using the phone. @CAPS2 allows you to meet new people without revealing your identity.  In my opinion, computers are safe in many situations and are also extremely fun and educational. They offer a wide range of opportunities for entertainment and learning, and with proper precautions, they can be a valuable tool in our lives.  In conclusion, computers have a lot to offer in terms of fun and education. As long as we use them responsibly, they can enhance our daily experiences.
1039	1041	1	2	I believe that people should not use computers as much as they do because it can be addictive. Yes, you can play games and talk to people on the computer, and I understand that. But people who spend all day on the computer miss out on spending time with their family and friends. Instead of just chatting or using a webcam to see people on the computer, you could visit them in person, even if they live in another state.  People who are constantly on the computer need to get out more. If they're always glued to the screen, they'll never get around to doing other things. For example, @CAPS1 might spend an hour or so on the computer and then do things with family and friends, but it shouldn't be all the time. I understand that some people need to work on the computer for their jobs and may have to finish some work at home. But once in a while, they should set aside time for their loved ones, not be on the computer non - stop.  Some people come home and immediately go on the computer. This is how people become lazy and start to gain weight. They sit at the computer, maybe stop to eat, and then go back to it. When they finally get off, they're too tired to go anywhere and just want to sleep. If they have something to do later, they're too lazy to do it.  That's why people should spend more time with their family and friends, have fun, and enjoy life. By reducing computer use, they can improve their relationships, stay active, and have a more fulfilling life.  In conclusion, while computers have their uses, excessive use can have a negative impact on our lives. We should take control of our computer time and make room for the important things like family, friends, and physical activity.
1040	1042	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I conducted a poll among @NUM1 people, and @PERCENT1 of them believe that computers have a positive impact on people. Computers enable people to communicate with those in far - away places, teach hand - eye coordination, and provide the means to learn about different people and places.  Using computers is an excellent way to stay in touch with others. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION2. I keep in touch with them through email, video chatting, and instant messaging. Communicating online is also useful when you're talking to multiple people at once or when your parents are using the phone.  Another advantage of computers is that they are effective in teaching hand - eye coordination. Typing and clicking on the screen are two ways to develop this skill. Initially, many people look at the keyboard while typing, but with practice, they can type while looking at the screen. When clicking on something, you need to move the mouse while keeping your eyes on the screen, which is an example of hand - eye coordination.  Computers are also helpful for students. If a student needs to research a person or place for a school report, they can easily go to Google.com and type in the relevant information. Similarly, if someone is planning a vacation to @LOCATION1 and knows nothing about it, they can quickly obtain information about @LOCATION1 with just a few clicks of the mouse. Also, if someone wants to learn about @ORGANIZATION2 for fun, they can simply type @ORGANIZATION2 into a search engine, browse through the websites, select the best one, and start reading.  In conclusion, based on the reasons stated above, I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They allow us to communicate with others, develop important skills, and access a wealth of information. This is my opinion on computers, and I hope you share the same view.
1041	1043	1	2	Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1, and I am writing to discuss how computers benefit society. It is well - known that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 homes have at least @NUM3 computer. Computers are excellent tools for learning. They allow for extensive research, which is much faster than using a library. With platforms like @CAPS3 and Facebook, one can communicate with people who are not frequently seen in person.  The internet on computers provides access to websites such as Google, @LOCATION1, and @LOCATION2. Searching on these platforms yields valuable information that can enhance one's life. For instance, looking up a chocolate - chip recipe, modifying it, and selling the product can be a life - changing step with just a click. Also, when working on a history project, one can quickly find the necessary information on a computer, as I did, and achieve a good grade.  Computers are incredibly fast. I can create @NUM4 powerpoint slides filled with useful information in the time it would take to go to the library, find a suitable book, and write enough content for one slide. On average, @PERCENT1 of people rely on computers to find useful information. When I was working on a social studies project @TIME1 and needed to know what the @CAPS4 flag looked like, I simply used Google Images and had a plethora of pictures in seconds.  Social media platforms like Facebook, MySpace, @CAPS3, and Twitter are great ways to communicate. I can talk to friends I don't see often, like a friend from camp who lives in @CAPS10. Without computers, these platforms wouldn't exist, and I might have lost touch with her. Additionally, options like @CAPS3 and email on computers allow for easy communication and receiving interesting emails.  In conclusion, computers make information research easier and faster and enable easier communication with friends. We should strive to have @NUM2 out of @NUM2 homes equipped with computers to benefit society and enjoy life by saving time.
1042	1044	1	2	Do you truly believe that @CAPS1 need computers to live? I firmly believe that we should spend less time on computers and more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends. This stance is based on my own experiences with @CAPS1 and my family.   @CAPS1 don't necessarily need computers. When @CAPS1 are using computers, @CAPS1 can get lost and disoriented. If @CAPS1 need to look for something, @CAPS1 often use iPods. For chatting, cell phones are a popular choice.   When it comes to school projects, libraries are readily available. @PERCENT1 of kids enjoy reading, which is an excellent way to improve literacy. If students don't get the right ideas from reading, they can consult their teachers at appropriate times, such as afternoons or during lunch.   I remember one day in class when there was a project due. A student admitted to copying all the words from the computer, which is plagiarism. Parents should be vigilant to prevent their children from engaging in such behavior.   The internet isn't always suitable for children. Sometimes, it's necessary to take a break and slow down. One can take a trip to visit family or simply enjoy nature. Activities like exercise, hiking, swimming, and biking are far more beneficial than sitting in front of a computer. Computers won't encourage exercise; instead, they can make people lazy.   In light of the availability of electronics, libraries, and family, it's time to stop excessive computer use. There's nothing to lose by making this change right now.
1043	1045	1	2	"What's your take on computers? In my opinion, computers have a highly positive impact on people, and all kids should have access to one.   Computers offer numerous benefits to kids. They teach life skills such as hand - eye coordination and a great deal about technology. Expert @PERSON1 points out that ""@PERCENT1 of successful jobs involve some form of interaction with computers. If kids learn these skills at an early age, they can become experts."" Technology is an integral part of modern life and will continue to grow in importance over the years. It's a terrible idea to isolate our kids from technology.  My sister is a prime example. As a child, she grew up with computers and was proficient in using them by age @NUM2. When she went to college, she had outstanding computer skills. Now, she works as a presidential secretary in a law firm and earns a substantial income. She is always trying to get me to learn about technology.  As parents, we only want the best for our kids' present and future. People say kids are the future, but they won't be successful without proper skills. Computers are an excellent way for kids of all ages to learn and communicate with each other and others. We all want our kids to be happy. @NUM4 out of @NUM5 kids use the internet to research for @CAPS2 and projects.   Kid therapist @PERSON2 states that ""kids who chat with other kids through the internet, like on Facebook, @CAPS3, and MySpace, are usually more socially interactive."" I understand concerns about inappropriate content on the internet, but parents can set limits and use child - blocking features. Also, to prevent obesity due to lack of exercise, time limits can be set. My cousins spend @NUM6 hours a day on the computer. They do their @CAPS2 and chat with friends in their free time.  In conclusion, computers can be viewed very positively. I urge you to take my advice and give your kids the freedom to use the internet. They will be happier, and you can trust me on this."
1044	1046	1	2	Do you like your computer? Does it benefit you and those around you? Some people claim that computers don't benefit people, but I'm here to prove them wrong. Computers offer advantages in learning, communication, and even in dealing with economic problems.  In terms of learning, computers are invaluable. They help develop hand - eye coordination, which is useful in sports like tennis, golf, and hacky - sack. I remember last @DATE1 when I went to play tennis with my mom. Since she rarely uses a computer, she missed every ball. Through computers, we can explore the world. We can visit virtual places like @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION3. Overall, @LOCATION has the fewest computers globally. Moreover, computers teach typing. In America, there are typing jobs. If you can type well, you can get a good job and achieve success in life. Clearly, computers enhance learning.  Regarding communication, computers open doors to new friendships. At school, students interact more with each other through computers. According to Facebook Magazine, @PERCENT1 of students in a school chat online. Computers also help in communicating with family. For example, if your grandma gets hurt, you can email the news. Additionally, computers are beneficial for those in special circumstances. Kids with cancer or other conditions can use computers to communicate.  Finally, computers assist in economic matters. In today's tough job market, computers are a great help. Online job websites offer actual work opportunities.  In conclusion, computers significantly benefit learning, communication, and economic aspects of our lives. They are essential tools in modern society.
1045	1047	1	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, computers are having a detrimental effect on modern youth. The rapid progress of technology is not a positive development. Popular social networks like Facebook and Twitter expose youth to the risks of @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 and child predators. Moreover, children are becoming addicted to computers, which is taking a toll on their physical health. While we may be becoming a more intelligent species, we are harming the future leaders of the world. This excessive use of computers must stop.  Although computers allow children to socialize, they also put them at emotional and physical risk. @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1, said, ""I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but every time I logged onto Facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live."" @PERSON1 is a victim of @CAPS1 - @CAPS2. Thousands of students face similar harassment. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1 - bully victims have committed suicide. These are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved and @NUM1 families that could still be together. We cannot let this computer - related tragedy continue.  Computers also pose a physical threat. The average teenager spends one to four hours on the computer, making the recommended one - hour of exercise seem insignificant. A large number of obese children can be attributed to computer use. Features like instant messaging, music, and games on computers attract kids, causing them to spend less time exercising. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 of their free time on a computer, while only five percent of their day is dedicated to exercise and play. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years, these numbers have worsened due to technological advancements.  In conclusion, I hope this letter persuades you to take a stand and halt this technological trend. Computers are causing emotional distress and contributing to obesity. We must act to change these statistics for the better and prevent further damage to the lives of our youth."
1046	1048	1	2	Dear readers, what if I told you that every time you sit in front of a computer, you're getting closer to death? What if I said that computers are ruining your lives? It might not seem that serious at first, but it's truly shocking, and you can't deny it. In my view, humans should either stop using computers or use them extremely sparingly.  Computers lead to less exercise. Many young people today are obese and lazy, and one major reason is that they spend all day sitting in front of computers. Sure, computers might improve reflexes, but you can achieve the same through exercise. When you sit at a computer, time flies. Ten minutes can turn into an hour in no time, which means one less hour for physical activity. Virtual sports might be fun, but they keep you from real - world sports. Without exercise, you're at risk of becoming obese, developing diabetes, heart problems, or muscle troubles, which can be life - threatening.  Moreover, computers don't exercise your mind properly. While they do have information to teach you, there are consequences. Scientists from the @ORGANIZATION1 foundation have discovered that staring at the computer screen kills brain cells. These cells don't reproduce easily, and sometimes not at all. Reading a book is a much better option. It's cheaper, more accurate, and won't harm your cells.  Finally, computers destroy your lifestyle. Virtual friends aren't real friends and family. Online interaction can't compare to in - person or phone conversations. You might end up losing your real friends. Also, a lot of the so - called knowledge on the computer isn't real, and you can't trust certain sites or people. Being with loved ones is far more beneficial.  We should all take a stand against computers. They take away opportunities for exercise, cause brain cell death, and ruin our lifestyles. No one wants to be a lonely outcast. Read a book, go outside, and stay away from the screen. There are better alternatives. Make the right choice and lay off the computers to live a healthy, happy life.
1047	1049	1	2	Dear editor of my local newspaper, in my opinion, computers have a positive impact on people, and I wholeheartedly support technological advancements. I believe that computers are a great asset because they teach hand - eye coordination, enable us to learn about distant places and people, and allow us to communicate online with others.  Hand - eye coordination is crucial in our lives, especially for those who engage in sports. Sports are not just about being the best; it's about continuous improvement. Computer games are an excellent way to develop hand - eye coordination. Defeating monsters in games helps with the catching and throwing skills that are essential in many sports. So, the next time you're on the computer, play some games; it's like practicing for sports.  Secondly, computers give us the opportunity to learn about the world. Before computers, if you wanted to know something, you might have to search everywhere for a relevant book, which could take a long time. Now, with just a few clicks on Google or Bing, you can find the answer. This quick access to information gives you more freedom to learn and do other things you enjoy.  Lastly, computers are a fantastic means of communication. They allow us to talk to people all over the world, whether they've moved, are on a business trip, or on vacation. If you can't reach someone by phone, you can email or instant - message them. Both email and instant - messaging accounts are private, protected by passwords.  In conclusion, computers are more of a positive force than a negative one. They help us develop hand - eye coordination, learn new things, and communicate effectively. I hope my opinions are heard, and I believe everyone should recognize the great benefits of computers.
1048	1050	1	2	Dear @PERSON2 ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1"", if you've ever walked into an office, a local library, a doctor's office, or a school in our district, you've surely heard the sounds of a mouse clicking or people typing. The reality is that computers and the internet are ubiquitous. Without a computer, how could we access our emails, interact with family overseas, or complete the research papers assigned by our teachers?  In my opinion, computers have a remarkable impact on people and their lives. They help develop hand - eye coordination, allow us to learn about specific subjects, and enable us to interact with others. Therefore, we should keep using this wonderful technology to get our jobs done.  I remember last month when my class was assigned a five - page essay. After writing two pages, my hands were in a lot of pain. But not only was I finishing my essay, I was also exercising my hands. Computers not only let you exercise but also help develop hand - eye coordination. Games like catching fish or fast - paced pinball games require this crucial skill, and computers can assist in its development.  The computer and the internet are useful in many other ways. The internet allows us to learn about subjects for which we may not have a book. My best friend, @PERSON1, was on the train one day, frantic because she had to give a speech and didn't know the statistics for type @CAPS5 diabetes. She simply went on her laptop and found all the information she needed. This is a clear example of how quick access to a computer benefits us.  The internet has also revolutionized communication. Besides traditional letters and phone calls, we can now communicate quickly and privately through email and instant messaging. Both accounts are password - protected. With four out of five households having a computer, it has become an essential tool for completing assignments, checking emails, and learning about the world.  The computer is one of the best technologies in history. It has helped students, teachers, doctors, police officers, and bank agents serve our community better. We should continue to embrace this amazing technology to lead more productive and fulfilling lives."
1049	1051	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that our society should embrace computers. They offer knowledge that schools and jobs may not provide, and they enable us to stay in touch with friends and family we don't see often.  Computers are a great source of learning. If you're interested in learning more about @LOCATION1 but your school or job doesn't cover it in depth, you can simply search on the internet. A large number of people prefer using computers to look up information rather than remaining ignorant about a subject.  Another important aspect is communication. If you haven't spoken to a friend or family member in a while, the computer provides a means to connect. Even if they don't have a phone, or if it's a long - distance call that you can't make, you can chat online or email each other. For instance, if your phone isn't working, the computer can be your lifeline to stay in touch.  In conclusion, computers are a must - have in our society. They enhance our knowledge and facilitate communication. I hope you understand and appreciate my concerns about integrating computers into our society for a better, more informed, and connected life.
1050	1052	1	2	Did you know that @PERCENT2 out of @PERCENT1 children today prefer computer games over other activities? In my opinion, it's far more important for children to engage in activities other than sitting in front of the computer all day.  One of the main reasons is the lack of exercise. Obesity is a major problem today, and if children spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, this issue could be alleviated. Exercise is not just about physical health; it also involves getting fresh air, which is scarce when you're glued to the computer. Those who understand the importance of exercise often participate in sports, which are both fun and keep them active.  Another concern is computer addiction. In today's society, children of all ages can become addicted to computers. Addicted children often ignore their surroundings, and some of the games might be inappropriate for younger players. Moreover, addicted children may refuse to do their homework and perform poorly in school.  Constant computer use also means children might not be prepared for the ""real world."" In real life, you can't rely on computer games. Games don't teach the knowledge and skills you gain in school. When it comes to getting a job or applying to college, employers and colleges look at your sports and activity records. If you've spent all your time on the computer, you'll have a poor record, which could lead to rejection.  So, when you're sitting in front of the computer screen, think about all the other possibilities. Exercise is crucial, computer addiction is a real threat, and you need to be prepared for the real world. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this matter."
1051	1053	1	2	Dear newspaper, @CAPS1. My name is @PERSON1, and I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on people. When individuals spend all day on computers, they have less time for exercise. This not only puts them at greater risk but also reduces the time they can spend with their families. These are just some of the reasons why computers do not benefit society.  Spending more time on computers means less time for physical activity. With the obesity rate on the rise, no one wants to be unable to perform regular activities. Sitting in front of a computer all day can lead to weight gain and poor health, and it can also make people feel self - conscious. If they don't exercise enough and continue to eat, this self - consciousness will only increase.  Moreover, using computers brings more danger to you and your family. There are many places on the internet where you can meet new people, but it's difficult to know if they are who they claim to be. Spending more time on the computer increases your risk by @PERCENT3 of experiencing a personal assault or giving away personal information. Even if you don't encounter an internet assailant, being glued to the computer makes you more likely to be harassed. I definitely don't want this for my family.  The last reason is of utmost importance to @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 families. If you spend all your time on the computer, you'll miss out on valuable family time. This time is precious because you never know when your family members might be gone. A survey shows that @PERCENT2 of children who spend time with their families and less than @NUM1 minutes on the computer have grades higher than @NUM2 in all classes.  In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people. Spending most of your time on the computer can lead to less exercise, more danger, and less family time. Wouldn't you rather spend less time on it? Thank you for your time.
1052	1054	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are extremely beneficial. They have a multitude of uses, ranging from learning and gaming to watching videos, and they serve as an incredibly useful tool. Without computers, we would be in a primitive state, similar to the @CAPS1 (apologies to any @CAPS1 people). We would have to wait for a newspaper or for the news to come on @CAPS4.V. to get the latest information.  There are numerous activities one can engage in on a computer. You can play both online and offline games, surf the web, chat with others, and watch videos. Without the internet, I might have lost interest in @ORGANIZATION1. I am now a member of the online community www.MOCpages.com, where I post my creations, view others' work, and engage in discussions.  Computers are also invaluable for school projects. Currently, I am researching @CAPS5 @CAPS6 during the @CAPS7 @CAPS8. In the past, I would have had to laboriously search through books, but now, with keyword matching, the process is much easier.  Finally, computers are essential in various fields. The military relies on them to store information, conduct attacks, keep records, and pilot certain planes. I use a computer to type my homework because my handwriting is not very neat. Additionally, I stay in touch with my dad, who works in @ORGANIZATION2.  I hope I have convinced you of the importance of computers. They offer a wide range of functions, aid in learning, and are an outstanding tool. Thanks for reading.
1053	1055	1	2	To whom it may concern, many people find computers highly entertaining, but excessive use can lead to the loss of many things they cherish. In my view, computers can cause financial problems, weight gain, and sleep deprivation.  My father is particularly concerned about the financial aspect. With five children and one laptop, it's hard to be content. When people sit and stare at computer games all day, the bills pile up, and they may end up losing everything, including their homes, families, and money. But when one is obsessed with the computer, these consequences seem unimportant.  My personal concern is the weight - gain issue. It's indeed comfortable to sit in a cushy chair with a computer, munching on chips and pizza. However, all that fatty food will catch up with you. When it does, are you likely to get up and exercise? Probably not, especially when a game is running. The weight will keep increasing until you can hardly move.  Sitting at a computer for long hours also takes a toll on your eyes, brain, muscles, and other important body parts due to lack of sleep. I can relate this to my brother. He gets home and immediately jumps on the computer, staying on it until @NUM3 or @NUM4 o'clock in the @TIME1. Eventually, he will get sick, and I won't be to blame.  As a teenager, I enjoy using the computer, but I don't spend every hour watching movies or playing games. I go outside and run to avoid the weight, financial, and health problems that many people face. So, don't waste your life on games or chat rooms. Get out and do something, like play sports or just breathe in some fresh air.
1054	1056	1	2	Many people claim that computers are helpful in their daily lives. For instance, you can learn about unknown places by searching on Google. You can obtain facts and reviews about these places. Using a computer also exercises your fingers.  Computers facilitate communication with others. They can help you find long - lost family members and reunite you with friends. They also improve hand - eye coordination.  Going online is another great feature of computers. You can browse through the products available in a store without having to drive there, which saves gas and reduces air pollution. Instant messaging (IM) allows you to stay updated on global news and breaking events. You can interact with family and friends through email, instant messaging, and other means. If someone doesn't have an account, signing up is easy.  If you're planning to visit a natural area, you can look up what it has to offer on a computer. This way, you'll know what to expect.  In conclusion, computers are useful in many diverse ways, and they greatly enhance our daily lives.
1055	1057	1	2	Dear local newspaper, on @DATE1, I am writing to express my view on whether computers are a good idea. I firmly believe that computers are an excellent idea.  Firstly, computers are indispensable for school projects. From personal experience, my social studies teacher always requires us to type our final drafts. Using a computer makes projects easier because @CAPS3 @CAPS4 corrects mistakes, and @ORGANIZATION1 provides all the necessary information. My friends and I all find it much more convenient to use computers for projects.  Secondly, computers are a great way to make friends. Parents are usually happy when their children make new friends. With a computer, you can easily go online, find people you want to get to know better, and chat with them (while ensuring their identities). The other day, my friend @PERSON1 introduced me to her online friend @CAPS6. This made me realize how helpful computers can be in making friends.  Finally, computers are an easy way to get educated. You can search for anything on @ORGANIZATION1. If you're curious about something, a simple search on @ORGANIZATION1 can provide the answers. Moreover, when you're typing on @CAPS3 @CAPS4, it corrects your mistakes, helping you learn from them.  In conclusion, I was asked to write about whether I want to keep using computers, and by now, it should be clear that I do. To summarize, computers are essential for projects, help you make friends, and are a great tool for education. If you're still unsure, I encourage you to keep using computers and see the benefits for yourself.
1056	1058	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. They offer the ability to communicate with others online, facilitate faster research, and are highly efficient and user - friendly. I will elaborate on these reasons.  Firstly, computers enable online communication. Engaging in online conversations can enhance communication skills and allow individuals to interact with diverse people. I often chat with my friends online, using webcams, instant messaging, or social platforms like Facebook. This way, I can stay in touch with friends who have moved away and relatives.  Secondly, computers expedite the research process. Studies indicate that @PERCENT1 of people prefer using a computer over an encyclopedia or other books when gathering information for any type of paper. Computers are far more efficient and easier to handle than traditional books. I find them extremely useful; when I use a computer for research, I can complete it much faster.  Finally, computers are highly efficient and user - friendly. Given a choice between a computer and a set of encyclopedias, most people would opt for the computer. On a computer, one simply types the query into the search bar, and within a fraction of a second, results appear. Conversely, using a book or encyclopedia may take several minutes to find the required information, and the amount of data provided is relatively limited compared to the millions of results a computer can offer on a single topic.  In conclusion, I am convinced that computers have a positive effect on people. They provide the means for online communication, faster research, and are both efficient and easy to use. I sincerely hope you will concur with my view on the merits of computers.
1057	1059	1	2	I'm of the opinion that computers bring a positive effect on people. They teach hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn more, and allow online communication.  When it comes to hand - eye coordination, it's a great advantage. In the workplace, good hand - eye coordination from using computers can help people stay more focused and work faster. If their jobs involve computer work, it will be easier and more enjoyable for them.  Secondly, computers give people the opportunity to expand their knowledge. There are numerous information - rich websites available. People can explore various topics and enhance their knowledge base. With more knowledge, they have better chances of getting well - paying jobs. They can search for anything they're interested in. Through extensive research and education, they can land their dream jobs because well - informed individuals are more likely to succeed.  Lastly, online communication via computers is highly beneficial. When people don't have phone access to reach someone, they can use a computer to send emails or use a webcam to see the person.  All in all, I think having a computer is advantageous due to the development of hand - eye coordination, the ability to learn more, and the opportunity for online communication.
1058	1060	1	2	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 is a place where people are constantly on computers every day. I do not believe that computers are beneficial to society. They lead to less time for exercise, less time spent enjoying nature, and less time with family and friends.  To start with, computers reduce the amount of time available for exercise. Wouldn't it be better to go out and lose weight rather than sitting in front of a computer, having one's brain drained? @PERSON1 reported that @PERCENT1 of people who get a new computer spend @NUM1 more minutes on it than they usually do.  Secondly, the time that could be spent outdoors enjoying nature is being consumed by computers. The New @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Newspaper expressed concern that if too many people own good computers, no one will be outside enjoying what little of nature remains. Eventually, there may be no trees left in the world, and humans could become extinct.  Finally, computers cause people to spend less time with family and friends. I remember when I got Xbox Live, I was addicted and couldn't stop using it. Similarly, when my family got a new computer, my older sister spent all day and night on it.  If parents take the computers away from kids, they will have more time for exercise, more time to enjoy nature, and more time to be with family and friends. In conclusion, computers are not good for society.
1059	1061	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, do you think that computers have a negative effect on people? I do. People spend too much time on the computer. When they should be working, they get distracted and start doing their own thing.  Some people sit at their computers and get angry at the software. When they don't know what to do, they turn to the computer. While working on the computer, distractions are everywhere. The internet is a major distraction. People often see the internet button out of the corner of their eye and click on it, then they end up surfing the web instead of doing their job.  Games are also a distraction. Solitaire, Minesweeper, and Hearts are all games that come pre - installed on the computer.  People get mad at their computers because the software doesn't have enough features, deletes files they need, or simply won't turn on when it's out of power. For example, if the software doesn't load fast enough, a person might say, ""Come on, why are you being so slow? I need to get my work paper done!"" If the computer deletes a saved paper, they might exclaim, ""Where is the paper I saved? Are you playing a game with me?"" And when the computer is dead and won't turn on, they might shout, ""Why aren't you turning on, you stupid computer!""  Moreover, people waste a lot of time on the computer. When they have nothing to do, they just use the computer. In my opinion, this is not a good idea. People in the @ORGANIZATION1 have access to a computer at work, at home, and even on their phones. Spending too much time on the computer can lead to weight gain as people choose to be on the computer rather than going out with friends.  In conclusion, I believe that computers have a bad effect on people. They cause distractions at work, are blamed for various issues, and over - usage can lead to health problems like weight gain. So, do computers have a bad effect on people? Yes, they do."
1060	1062	1	2	"Do you have a computer at home? Most people use computers for various reasons, such as communicating with friends or working on projects. Computers can be both beneficial and not so beneficial, but I personally think they are a great tool.  Computers are useful for learning. For instance, if we have a big project in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 about @LOCATION2 and we're not well - informed, the computer can help us explore different aspects and view pictures. It can also uncover the history of a place that we may not know. I remember my sister sharing how she had a question that had to be answered using a computer. The question was about World War @CAPS3, and she got a @PERCENT1 score.  We can also keep track of what's happening in @LOCATION1 and other places. All we need to do is go on the computer and look it up. My teacher once said, ""Okay class, today we will be going to the computer lab to do some research."" When a student asked what they were going to research, the teacher replied that it was about the events in @LOCATION1. All these events can assist us in our research projects and many other tasks.  Computers have different functions. There are programs that allow us to look up information, play games, and help with homework. You can pretty much do anything you want on a computer. @CAPS2 shows that @PERCENT2 of people in @LOCATION1 use the computer for assistance. My friend once told me that she always types her essays on the computer because it's easier for her teacher to read and for her to type.  In conclusion, computers are extremely useful. They can help with learning, research, and various tasks. Given their wide range of functions and the fact that they are widely used for assistance, it's clear that computers are a valuable asset. People in @LOCATION1 should make the most of this technology."
1061	1063	1	2	Computers are highly useful to individuals. They facilitate contacting friends and family globally. One may need a computer for typing school or work papers and accessing the internet. If a friend or family member moves away, computers offer an easy means of contact, unlike phones which may not allow for worldwide calls. For instance, if a best - friend moves abroad, one can email or instant - message them via a computer. Even in extreme weather like a blizzard with four - foot snow, computers are a simple way to chat with neighbors. When my friend went to @LOCATION1 on @DATE1, I used instant messaging to communicate with her. Typing on a computer is also a practical solution. Consider being at work or school and being tasked with writing a five - page essay. Manually writing it would be laborious and time - consuming. Typing is quicker, requires less effort, and makes the work neater and more legible. Libraries do not always have all the necessary information. If one needs to write an article about a newly discovered animal for a newspaper, a library may not have up - to - date books on it. The internet provides information instantaneously. Whether it's a celebrity getting hit by a bus or a successful rocket landing in space, the internet can offer details without the need to travel. The internet also enables students to take online courses. My oldest brother took an online @CAPS1 class at home when he couldn't take it in high school but needed it for college. Additionally, when planning a vacation, the internet helps find vacation spots and purchase plane, train, boat tickets, or rent a car without having to visit a store or airport. People often turn to the internet when they don't know an answer, like when my friend told me about a new dog breed I'd never heard of, and I researched it online. In conclusion, computers are a valuable tool that allows people to communicate, type, and access the internet, making life easier and more enjoyable, and are very useful for newspaper writing.
1062	1064	1	2	It is a well - known fact that computers have a significant impact on people, and the positive effects outweigh the negative ones. Computers have become essential tools in society, enabling people to learn about far - away places safely, facilitating communication, and simplifying everyday tasks. Regarding learning about distant locations, individuals can gain knowledge from the safety of their homes. A study by @ORGANIZATION1 revealed that without computers, @PERCENT1 of people would be unaware of the one - child policy dilemma in @LOCATION3. Moreover, due to the @PERCENT2 crime rate in @LOCATION1, an American might be hesitant to visit for a business project but can use a computer to gather all the necessary information. Computers are also excellent for communication. In @DATE1, a study showed that @PERCENT3 of computer users had social networking or instant messaging programs such as @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. It has become incredibly easy to contact others. On average, out of every @NUM1 Americans, they spend a certain number of hours online each day. The average IQ has increased in the last @NUM2 years, and students can get help from peers, teachers, and experts online. Computer users can receive feedback on essays, support for learning new things, and a boost in self - confidence. In terms of everyday tasks, computers have made life much simpler. My mother used to spend hours grocery shopping, but after discovering @LOCATION2, she can now buy food online and have it delivered. Additionally, @PERCENT4 of Americans with computers pay their taxes online. What was once a complex task has become as simple as a click of a button. In summary, computers are highly beneficial to society. They have multiple functions, including increasing knowledge of far - away places, facilitating communication, and simplifying daily tasks. It is hard to imagine how people managed without this device in the past.
1063	1065	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, my name is @CAPS3, and I'm writing to express my view that not everyone should use a computer frequently. One major reason is that people can get so distracted by the computer that they neglect their schoolwork. They get caught up in writing, chatting, or playing @CAPS4, causing them to forget about school. As a result, their grades decline, and they often don't do their homework. Another issue is that computer use can lead to a lack of time spent with parents. People are so engrossed in the computer that they don't interact with their family members. Finally, excessive computer use can have negative health effects. Spending too much time on the computer can lead to various health problems, and it can also prevent people from getting a proper education as they are constantly occupied with the device. In conclusion, using a computer too often has many drawbacks. I hope you can understand my concerns and recognize the negative impacts of excessive computer use.
1064	1066	1	2	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, there is a great deal of debate about computers. Some believe they are beneficial to society, while others hold the opposite view. I firmly stand on the side that advocates for the use of computers, as I believe the benefits far outweigh the harms. Firstly, using a computer can improve a user's hand - eye coordination over time. This skill is particularly useful when learning musical instruments. For example, when learning to play a new guitar song, one must coordinate finger movements with the notes on the screen. Hand - eye coordination is also crucial in sports, such as football, where a wide receiver needs to watch the ball and position their hands to catch it. Secondly, computers offer a vast world of learning opportunities. If someone is asked about the @NUM1 president of the @ORGANIZATION2, they can quickly look it up on the internet, like Google. Schools can also demand more from students because they have easy access to a wealth of information. Finally, computers are excellent for communication. Suppose a close friend moves out of state. Using a phone for long - distance communication can be expensive, with long - distance fees having skyrocketed in the past @NUM2 years. For instance, talking long - distance for @NUM3 minutes a day can cost over @NUM4 a month. In contrast, the internet allows for chatting without additional fees, regardless of the distance. In conclusion, I hope this letter can gain some attention, similar to how it would be if it could surpass ""@CAPS2'bama's failed health care bill"" in getting into the paper. People should understand the facts about computers before engaging in arguments about their use."
1065	1067	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, many people own and use computers. The government is concerned about excessive computer use, but I believe one can never use a computer too much. Computers offer numerous benefits, including access to information, communication, and the development of life skills. Information is vital to humans, and in schools and jobs, one often needs to know a variety of unusual facts. Computers are the ideal source. When my teacher, @PERSON1, assigned a research paper on Walt Disney, we used computers to gather information. Without the computer, I wouldn't have known that Walt Disney died before Disney World opened. Communication is another important aspect. Computers provide multiple ways to communicate. Although some methods can be dangerous, many are safe. In @NUM1 grade, my teacher, Ms. Casserelle, set up a class - wide email, allowing us to communicate with another school safely. As long as users are semi - responsible, online communication can be risk - free. Computers also help develop life skills. Approximately @PERCENT1 of life skills can be learned on computers. For example, typing is a crucial skill, especially when writing research papers. Most jobs in today's world require the use of a computer. It's difficult to think of a job that doesn't involve a computer at all. In conclusion, information, communication, and life skills are essential to human nature, and computers play a vital role in providing these. Whether we admit it or not, computers are involved in almost everything we do, and spending time on them is necessary.
1066	1068	1	2	Computers have a significant impact on society, but are they truly beneficial in every aspect? People tend to spend an excessive amount of time on computers. In fact, computers do not enhance brain function; instead, they can lead to weight gain and often cause conflicts for many individuals. Excessive computer use is detrimental to one's health and social life. There are numerous risks associated with spending too much time on the computer. The internet is accessible to everyone, exposing children to various harmful elements that will not contribute to their future development. It is a well - established fact that students who spend less time watching TV or using the computer tend to achieve better academic grades. I recall my mother scolding me for getting poor grades due to excessive computer use. She took the computer away for a while, and subsequently, my grades improved significantly. This clearly shows that being on the computer does not make one smarter. Moreover, computers can cause weight gain. When people spend a lot of time on the computer, they usually sit still for long periods, and many of them eat while using it. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to weight gain. I know from personal experience that being active, such as going outside or exercising, makes one feel good. Once weight is gained, it is extremely difficult to lose. Prolonged sitting is not only unhealthy but can also lead to obesity, which has been a cause of death for many. Finally, computers often cause drama. Most people use platforms like Facebook, AIM, or other similar services. It is very common for people to get into fights through these platforms. There is also a new platform called Formspring, which allows users to remain anonymous and say hurtful things. One of my friends was a victim of such abuse, and it had a devastating impact. Additionally, many people on Facebook lie about their identities, and in today's digital age, it is easy for hackers to access personal information. In conclusion, computers do not help the brain, can cause weight gain, and create a lot of drama. Therefore, people should limit their computer use.
1067	1069	1	2	A large number of people use computers daily for various purposes. Despite some individuals spending excessive time on computers, the overall benefits they bring to society are undeniable. Computers contribute to the smooth operation of society, facilitate communication with distant friends and family, and enable the rapid acquisition of valuable information. Without computers, society would not function as efficiently as it does currently. One of the key benefits of computers is their ability to complete tasks such as writing papers and researching information much more quickly. For instance, if an organization needed to print an article about a devastating earthquake in a specific location, computers would be invaluable as they allow for faster typing compared to handwriting. This efficiency in task - completion is a significant advantage for society. Another important aspect is that computers help maintain long - distance relationships. They enable people to stay in touch with old friends and family members. Since a certain date, computers have played a crucial role, especially for those who have moved to different parts of the country. A recent survey indicated that a high percentage of college graduates use computers to keep in touch with friends from their hometowns. Video - conferencing features even allow people to see each other, strengthening these relationships. Computers also have a positive impact on society by providing access to a vast amount of knowledge. Search engines like Google, Bing, and others allow people to quickly find information on any topic. This rapid access to knowledge has a profound effect on individuals, making them more intellectual and enabling them to achieve more in life. As a computer scientist at a well - known organization stated, the knowledge obtained from computer search engines helps people perform tasks better and achieve more. In conclusion, when used in balance with other important activities such as exercise and socializing, computers are highly beneficial to society. They offer quick and efficient task - completion, help maintain relationships, and provide access to knowledge. Society would be less efficient and more isolated without the use of computers.
1068	1070	1	2	I firmly believe that spending excessive time on the computer is a bad idea. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, the internet is filled with dangerous content, such as information related to kidnappings. I've seen many videos and movies where an older person befriends a young child online, arranges a meeting, and the child never returns. This is a real - life threat that children are exposed to when using the computer. Secondly, the computer can make a person less intelligent. I used to spend all day on the computer, and sometimes when I got up to get something to eat, I would even go into the bathroom looking for food. It was as if I was in a daze, and when I finally got off the computer, it felt like I was just waking up. Lastly, the computer makes people lazy. When you sit in front of the computer all day, you get no sunlight and no exercise. This lack of physical activity is harmful to both the mind and the body. The more time you spend on the computer, the more you'll want to stay. In conclusion, the computer has negative impacts on our lives. It exposes us to danger, makes us less intelligent, and turns us into lazy individuals. Therefore, we should limit our time on the computer to avoid these problems.
1069	1071	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I believe that using a computer has both positive and negative effects on people. On the positive side, it can help people gain knowledge and meet new people. On the negative side, it may lead to weight gain and a lack of social skills. Gaining knowledge through computer use is extremely important. If your computer crashes or breaks, having knowledge about computers can help you fix it without having to pay for potentially ineffective anti - software. Moreover, if you aspire to become a computer engineer, the time spent on the computer can be very beneficial for your future career. Computers also provide an opportunity to meet new people from different parts of the world. You don't necessarily have to meet them in person; a friendly online conversation can be a great way to expand your social circle. However, there are also drawbacks. Excessive computer use often leads to weight gain. Many people spend too much time sitting in front of the computer, eating unhealthy snacks and playing games or watching videos, without getting enough physical activity. This sedentary lifestyle is harmful to health. In conclusion, moderate computer use is far better than excessive use. It can offer benefits such as knowledge acquisition and social interaction, but if not controlled, it can lead to weight gain and a lack of social skills. Therefore, we should use computers in a balanced way.
1070	1072	1	2	Dear editor, while some may think that spending a lot of time on the computer is good, I strongly disagree. People who spend excessive time on the computer often lack sufficient exercise, fresh air, and quality time with family and friends. Those who are glued to their computers could be engaging in various outdoor activities. Parents should encourage their children to go outside instead of being hooked on computer games all day. Kids can ride bikes, scooters, play basketball, wiffle ball, swim, or visit the playground. Adults can also take a long walk on the beach. Fresh air is essential for good health. People should step outside, whether it's to sit on the beach, watch their kids' games, or simply enjoy the outdoors. They can also sit on their porch and wait for their kids to come home from school. Moreover, computer enthusiasts often neglect their relationships with family and friends. They could visit their family more often, go out for lunch with friends, and spend more quality time with their children. Although online chat is available, there is no substitute for face - to - face communication. It is time to decide whether spending a lot of time on the computer is a bad thing. The evidence clearly shows that it leads to insufficient exercise, a lack of fresh air, and less time with loved ones. I encourage you to write to your local newspaper and share your stance on this issue.
1071	1073	1	2	In my view, computers have a negative impact on people. This is because they lead to less physical activity, reduced interaction with family and friends, and act as a distraction from getting things done. Firstly, computers cause people to exercise less. For instance, instead of practicing football, soccer, or baseball, many individuals spend the whole night in front of their computer webcams. Moreover, with the ability to work, shop, and even attend college online without leaving home, people tend to become lazy and avoid going out. Secondly, computers reduce interpersonal interaction. I once visited a friend, and she was so engrossed in computer games that she didn't even look at me. A magazine reported that @PERCENT1 of parents interacted with their kids less after getting a computer. Lastly, computers are a major distraction. When people are using the computer, it's difficult for them to engage in conversations as they are absorbed in what they're doing. They also distract kids from their homework. I've experienced this myself; when I need to type up assignments, I often end up browsing different websites instead of finishing my work. Additionally, some kids neglect household chores because they're busy playing games or surfing the web. In conclusion, due to these reasons, I firmly believe that computers have a negative effect on people. So, unless you want these negative consequences to happen to you, it's advisable to reduce your computer usage.
1072	1074	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, some people in @CAPS2 have been complaining about computers in our society. They claim that computers keep children indoors doing nothing, but in fact, computers are extremely helpful. The internet is a vast source where you can research anything, and countless useful ideas emerge. Moreover, using a computer can improve hand - eye coordination. Additionally, computers enable us to stay in touch with people who are far away. For example, last year my friend went to Poland, and we were able to communicate through our computers. First, the computer is an excellent source of information. Imagine if you still had to read ancient scrolls instead of looking up information online. When you need to know something urgently, like before a big meeting, all you have to do is type in your query, and you'll get the answer right away. Dr. @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1 conducted a study on high - school teenagers and found that students with access to computers scored significantly better on standard tests because of the background information they acquired online. Second, using the mouse and keys on a computer can enhance hand - eye coordination. My parents always say that typing at @NUM1 words per minute is a good rate. Out of @NUM2 kids, many improve their hand - eye coordination after becoming proficient on the computer. Most importantly, computers help us stay connected with people far away. As I mentioned before, I stayed in touch with my Polish friend. Many people who don't have cell phones use platforms like @CAPS4, Gmail, Facebook, MySpace, or Twitter to keep in touch with friends. This is crucial as it allows us to be social, go out with friends, and engage in activities, which is beneficial for our well - being. In conclusion, having computers in our lives is beneficial for our society. Computers will assist us in the future, help us get good grades on projects due to the available sources, keep us healthy through improved hand - eye coordination, and enable us to have many friends. Therefore, we should embrace computers.
1073	1075	1	2	Dear readers, I'm writing to you today to discuss the effects of computer usage. In my opinion, there are both positive and negative aspects to using computers. On one hand, you can communicate with others and get work done. On the other hand, excessive computer use can lead to poor health and cause you to miss out on other aspects of life. One of the positive aspects of computers is the various ways they allow us to communicate. Whether it's through online games, typing, or real - time chatting, it's much easier than going out to talk to people face - to - face. For example, in the past, people used to write letters to their pen - pals, but now, with email, you can send a letter by simply typing it up and clicking a button, and it doesn't cost a thing. Another advantage is that computers are great for getting work done. Whether it's business work or schoolwork, computers have become the go - to tool. You often hear about people using computers for work, which is why there are computer labs in schools and desks with computers in offices. You can create presentations, write essays, and make graphs with ease. However, I'm concerned that people are becoming too addicted to computers. Many young people overuse computers, which can lead to poor health. Sitting in front of a computer screen all day, only getting up to eat, can make people obese. To stay healthy, people need to go outside and exercise. We should establish rules to encourage people to be more active and ensure a healthy life for the next generation. In conclusion, I have mixed feelings about computers. They can be very useful, but only in moderation. We need to be aware of the potential negative effects and use computers responsibly.
1074	1076	1	2	To the editor of the @ORGANIZATION2, I am writing to express my opinion on whether computers benefit or harm society. I firmly believe that computers are highly beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, computers serve as a valuable learning resource and a means to stay updated with the world. Secondly, they help us maintain connections with friends and family. Today, if you need information, whether for @ORGANIZATION1 or personal reasons, you can quickly access it from multiple sources online. This helps people become more educated and well - informed about the world. Dr. @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1 conducted a study on high - school teenagers and found that students with access to computers scored significantly better on standard tests due to the background information they acquired online. In addition to the internet, programs like @ORGANIZATION4 and @ORGANIZATION3 assist people in learning new languages or improving their writing skills on the computer. Computers also keep us informed about global events. For example, when the earthquake hit @LOCATION1, the news provided limited details, but by searching online, I immediately learned about the death toll, the aid being provided, and ways to donate. Without computers, I would have been unaware of these important details. Another significant benefit of computers is their role in facilitating communication. Platforms like Facebook and @CAPS2 allow us to chat with others, invite friends, and plan parties. Instead of calling each person individually, we can send a single message to multiple people at once, saving time that can be spent on activities like playing outside and exercising. Social networking platforms also help us stay in touch with old and distant friends. A study by @ORGANIZATION5 showed that @PERCENT1 of people with social networking accounts have a more active social life. According to Dr. @PERSON1, this means these people are better at adapting to different social situations. In conclusion, the advantages of computers far outweigh the disadvantages. They enable people to stay educated, updated, and connected. They make information accessible, save time, and promote social interaction. Undoubtedly, computers are a great asset to society.
1075	1077	1	2	I believe that computers have a negative impact on people's lives, especially when it comes to children and adults who spend excessive time on them. Many children spend their after - school time playing games, using MySpace, Facebook, or checking their emails instead of going outside. There's nothing wrong with using the computer occasionally, but spending all day on it is harmful. Adults should not let their children spend all day on the computer, and they themselves should also avoid such excessive use because it doesn't contribute positively to life. Computers can ruin your life through the choices you make, the pictures you post, and the things you write. For example, if you have a MySpace or Facebook account and post inappropriate pictures, it could affect your future job prospects. Employers might look at those pictures and decide not to hire you. Instead of being on the computer all the time, people can go outside, engage in sports to keep their bodies healthy, explore the world, learn new things, or plan family trips. By doing so, they can avoid the risks associated with computer use, such as losing a job or ruining their future. Children are also at risk. The things they write or the pictures they post on the computer can be seen by other kids, which may lead to bullying, fights, or other negative social situations. Moreover, there are sex offenders on the internet. Parents may not always be aware when their children are interacting with such dangerous individuals. Sex offenders may use fake pictures to lure people into meeting them. In conclusion, we should not let computers mess up our lives. By reducing computer usage and engaging in more real - world activities, we can ensure a healthier and more promising future for ourselves and our children.
1076	1078	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, you recently posed a question in your newspaper, @CAPS2 York @CAPS3, asking readers whether they were for or against technology. I firmly support computers as they offer the opportunity to learn about diverse people and cultures worldwide, save a significant amount of time in today's fast - paced society, and enable online communication through specific programs. With a computer, one can access a vast amount of information about foreign countries and their cultures. I read an article in the @CAPS4 @CAPS3 about a man, @PERSON1, involved in a church program. In this program, a foreign citizen would visit @LOCATION2 to make friends and learn about the @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 was assigned a woman from the farms of @CAPS6 who had never left the fields. Wanting to welcome her in a familiar setting, @PERSON1, who knew nothing about @CAPS6, quickly turned to his computer to learn everything about her home. When the woman entered his house, she was overjoyed, feeling as if she was home again. Eventually, she stayed with @PERSON1 and they got married. Had @PERSON1 not impressed her with his computer - acquired knowledge, she might not have stayed and had a wonderful life with him. Moreover, @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION2 states that language students, such as those learning Spanish and French, have a @PERCENT1 higher success rate when using a computer to learn about the countries. He notes that the average grade for students with a computer is an A, while the average grade for those without is a @CAPS9+. Clearly, having a computer to learn about distant places and people can lead to future happiness and success. Computers also save a great deal of time. In the school newspaper, @PERSON6 shared her homework problem. She said, ""One night, I had a large amount of homework, especially dealing with a multitude of vocabulary words. I had to look up each word in a huge dictionary, and I was failing the subject because I didn't have enough time for my homework. Then my family bought me a computer. Using the online dictionary was so convenient. I could finish my homework in @NUM1 minutes compared to @NUM2 hours! I finally started doing well in the subject."" Without her computer, @PERSON6 would have continued to struggle and likely failed. Additionally, @PERSON3 reports that @PERCENT2 of people reach work faster when they check traffic reports on the computer instead of listening to the radio, and @PERCENT3 of people receive praise from their bosses due to their consistent punctuality. Finally, computers allow online communication. A student, @PERSON5, unfortunately broke a vertebra. The doctor told him he couldn't attend school for a while. @PERSON5 came up with a plan to communicate with his teachers via his laptop and webcam. Every day, the teachers updated him over the computer. When he returned to school, he had very little work to make up because of the computer - mediated interaction. Without his computer, @PERSON5 would have faced a month's worth of overwhelming work and learning. @PERSON4 of @ORGANIZATION1 also claims that students who communicate with their families during college have better post - college relationships. In conclusion, having a family computer is highly beneficial. It not only allows people to learn about places beyond their home but also gives us more time and enables us to communicate with others without leaving the comfort of home. I recommend that everyone seeking an easier life invest in a computer."
1077	1079	1	2	Dear newspapers, in my opinion, computers have a positive impact on people. Firstly, you can chat online. There are electronic devices for children that can be connected to a computer, allowing them to learn various things. You can also pay your bills on the computer. People who don't have a phone or don't want to leave home at a particular moment can use a computer to enter chat rooms or local websites to talk with friends and family. Moreover, many people with social media websites like Facebook, MySpace, etc., can find new people with whom they have a lot in common. Some even find that special @CAPS1 person they've been searching for. Recently, a new electronic device for little kids, like the Leaf Frog, has been introduced. It can be plugged into a computer or laptop, and kids can learn the alphabet, counting, and spelling. This is an excellent product for young children as they can use it during the @DATE1 or after school to stay sharp and learn both in and out of school. One day, I asked my mother how she was paying the light bill. She said she was using a website (I forget the name), and you can pay your bills right there. Instead of going to a local place to pay bills, with a computer, you can do it at home. I hope you, the newspaper publishers, agree that this shows the many positive aspects of computers. I sincerely hope computers will remain an important part of our lives for a long time.
1078	1080	1	2	"People often ask me, ""Do you think we should spend more or less time on computers?"" I firmly believe we should spend less time on them. One major reason is that children spend excessive time on online games such as @CAPS2 of Warcraft, @CAPS3, and Soldier Front. These games are highly addictive, and kids often play for hours on end. Instead of being outside, building strong muscles and bones, they are ruining their lives by constantly sitting in front of the computer. Another reason is that both children and adults spend too much time on social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, AIM, and MSN. These online pages are mainly used to connect with friends, but they can also lead to a lot of drama, fights, and rumors. Approximately @PERCENT1 of kids and adults visit these sites every day. It's time they spent more time outside or hanging out with friends in person. Finally, children should be outside playing sports or games with their friends instead of being glued to the computer. Physical activities that don't involve a computer are essential for their growth and well - being. In conclusion, people should spend less time on computers. Kids are overly engrossed in online games, adults and kids waste too much time on social media, and children should be playing outside. It's high time we set a time limit on our computer use and spend more time enjoying the outdoors."
1079	1081	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I am of the strong opinion that computers have negative effects on people in the world. Although they have their advantages, they are also somewhat dangerous. Some people use computers for inappropriate purposes. They search for porn sites and attempt to hack into servers. Computers are meant to be used for positive things, not for such negative activities. Online interactions can also be dangerous. Many people think they are talking to one person, but in reality, it could be anyone. Nowadays, people are too quick to share personal information with strangers online. This is one of the reasons for kidnappings and murders in our society. @CAPS3 - @CAPS2, which means @CAPS2 someone over the computer, is also a significant problem. The consequence is that someone may get hurt, and the crime may go unsolved. Furthermore, people spend an excessive amount of time on computers. Instead of going outside and enjoying nature, they waste their time in front of the screen. This is a major cause of obesity as people don't get enough exercise. In conclusion, the world is misusing computers, and this situation needs to change. We should be more cautious about how we use computers and ensure that they are used for positive and beneficial purposes.
1080	1082	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, I assume you use a computer frequently. Have you ever wondered why experts question the heavy use of computers by people? In my view, people need computers because they are a crucial source of information about what's happening in the world. They also help us know the weather conditions, which can prevent accidents. Sure, you can turn on the TV, but then you have to wait for the information you want. So, @ORGANIZATION1, do you think people should be outside more? But don't they also need to know what's going on? Of course, everyone does. It's extremely important for people to know if a meteor is about to strike the world. President @PERSON2 even says that @PERCENT2 of the world gets information about current events from the computer. Are you going to ignore the president of the @LOCATION1? I don't think so. I'm @PERCENT1 certain that @ORGANIZATION1 doesn't want to be known as the ""accident state."" That's exactly why people need computers. Whether it's to find out if it will snow, sleet, or if there is bad traffic, people can go to the internet to get timely and specific information about when, where, and what's happening. The CEO of @CAPS3, @PERSON1, says, ""When someone hears that there might be snow or rain, they usually go straight to the internet."" You can turn on the TV to get information, but you may not get all the information you need or want, and you'll have to wait. The internet provides information instantly (unless you have a poor connection). Do you think these reasons make a strong argument? I do. If you use your computer to find out what's happening, the weather conditions, and as an alternative to the @LOCATION2, I believe you'll agree with me."
1081	1083	1	2	"I firmly believe that computers are an excellent tool for people. First, they are helpful in various ways. For instance, I often use my computer to check my homework. When we don't know something, we can simply search for it on the internet. As long as we don't use computers for extended periods, they won't harm our health. Moreover, they can assist students in making projects with software like Word, Excel, and other Microsoft products. So, I think computers are a great asset for people.  Second, computers can facilitate social interaction. Many students, including me, use Facebook. Even when we're not physically together, we can still communicate. They can also be used to make new friends. However, as our health teacher, @PERSON1, said, ""There are people we don't know, and we shouldn't give out our information."" Computers are also useful for staying in touch with friends who live far away. If a friend moves to another state, we can use the computer to chat with them. There are numerous ways to socialize using computers.  Finally, while exercise is crucial for everyone, using computers doesn't mean we can't go outside and exercise. Although computers can be addictive, if we manage our time and use them for only half - an hour at a time, we can still get the exercise we need. Exercise is easy, especially for children. For example, my neighbor often comes over to my house and asks if I want to play football when I'm on the computer. I still go outside and play. So, computers aren't overly addictive, and parents don't need to worry about their children's exercise. In conclusion, I think computers have a great impact on people. They are useful for online research, socializing with friends, and even for adults at work. Therefore, computers are truly a great machine."
1082	1084	1	2	Over the past years, computers have significantly benefited people. Scientists have found cures for diseases with the help of computers, jobs have become more manageable, and communication with friends and family has become affordable. I am of the opinion that computers have a positive influence on people. They educate us about different places in the world, assist us with our jobs, and allow us to communicate without incurring costs.  If someone is planning a trip to a particular country, they can use the computer to learn about its culture. They can also visit websites to find affordable flights and hotels. Students can use computers to gather facts for reports about countries in @LOCATION1. Computers also keep us informed about current events through websites with videos and short clips.  In terms of communication, if we can't afford to travel to see a friend on her birthday, we can video - chat with her. This way, computers help us save money when communicating with friends, family, and colleagues.  Since their invention, computers have been extremely helpful. They enable us to learn about the world and anything we want to know. They simplify jobs and work and save us a lot of money by replacing phone calls.  Computers have improved dramatically over the years. Previously, their screens were small, and we had to press multiple buttons to start them. Now, they can be as large as a flat - screen @CAPS1 and can be turned on with a single button. It's exciting to wonder what computers will be like @NUM1 years from now. In conclusion, computers have been and will continue to be an essential part of our lives, constantly evolving to offer more benefits.
1083	1085	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 post, I've been contemplating how computers affect our lives. I agree with experts who claim that people are spending too much time on computers and less time on other activities. I believe that everyone, including myself, spends a significant amount of time online. For example, when doing research, wouldn't it be better to read a book instead of relying solely on the computer? The same goes for computer games. Why not play virtual kickball outside?  Computers hold us back. The more time we spend on them, the less time we have for other things. Instead of going outside, we prefer to stare at a screen, play games, or chat with friends. Online chat, in particular, has a significant impact on most people. We trade a fun day outdoors for a day of online chatting. If we set a time limit on computer use, it would encourage us to be more social and go out. Unfortunately, computers prevent us from doing so, and we often end up doing nothing.  Another issue is that computers can't physically assist us or make us active. As a cheerleader, I often watch YouTube videos to learn new stretches and skills. However, even though I learn from the videos, I sometimes get hurt because I lack physical guidance. It would be better to have a gymnastics teacher who can physically help me.  Finally, I believe that spending less time on the computer is beneficial. After an hour or more online, I feel lazy and unmotivated. On the other hand, when I go outside, I feel energetic and active. Being away from the computer is both physically and mentally better.  In conclusion, while computers are useful, excessive use is detrimental. It holds us back and is harmful to our health. Spending too much time on computers also makes us less active. Thank you for reading.
1084	1086	1	2	You claim that computers are bad for today's society? @CAPS1, I'm here to prove you wrong and show that they actually benefit it. Some kids may not have phones, but they can log onto Facebook to access all the features a phone offers and more.  Facebook, www.facebook.com, is one of the most visited websites by people of all ages. It allows us to see our friends' profile updates, including pictures, videos, and life events. If we don't have a phone, we can use Facebook's chat system to communicate with friends and relatives. We can also receive information about family parties via inbox and visit relatives' homepages to see how they're doing. If you haven't logged into Facebook yet, @CAPS3, you definitely should!  In school, teachers often assign projects to be done on the computer. Windows and @ORGANIZATION1 programs are extremely helpful. For example, in a computer class project to create a product commercial, we can use Windows Movie Maker to create a professional - looking project. PowerPoint is a great program for presentations. In my history class, when we were assigned to do a presentation on a famous person from the @DATE1's, I used PowerPoint and got a great grade. @ORGANIZATION1 Word is also useful for various projects, homework, and writing papers. With spell - check, we're more likely to get good grades.  Google is another well - known and beloved web tool. It can be used for almost anything, from searching for pictures and information for school projects to watching videos of our favorite songs, friends, or TV shows. It can also show us videos of special workouts, websites on healthy eating, or information about exercise groups and fitness clubs.  Some people think the @CAPS2 keeps people from exercising, but as we can see, the internet, with the help of tools like Google, actually benefits us in many ways.  In conclusion, by using Facebook for social interaction, @ORGANIZATION1 and Windows programs for school, and Google for various aspects of life and health, our lives have become much easier. I hope you've changed your mind about the benefits of computers and modern technology.
1085	1087	1	2	I think using a computer is a great idea. If you have family members living far away, instead of just hearing their voices on the phone, you can talk to them and, most importantly, see them. You can even show them new and cool things you have. When you're missing a loved one who's on a trip, you can still see them through the computer.  Computers are also very helpful when your car breaks down or you don't have a car. You can comfortably shop from home. Most things in stores are available online and can be mailed to you. You can even buy food on the internet. Moreover, computers can help you save money by showing you where to get good prices.  There are many dating sites where you can meet different people and share your comments. Texting on Facebook is free, which helps you save money. You can play free online games with your friends, create websites, and watch movies and shows online. There are countless things you can do on a computer.  I'm aware that many people don't go outside to exercise because of computers. I agree with some experts who say that a lot of people need to lose weight and spend more time in the real world. Technology has made some people less active and they tend to eat more.  However, despite these drawbacks, computers are very helpful and fun. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are great and should be used more, as long as we balance their use with outdoor activities and a healthy lifestyle.
1086	1088	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, the possibility of exploring the entire world with just a button - click is as straightforward as purchasing a computer. Computers are increasingly popular these days. Although some people claim that people over - use computers, I firmly believe this is a baseless accusation. First, computers are invaluable for schoolwork. For an essay that requires at least @NUM1 words, the word count feature ensures you meet the requirement precisely. When researching a topic, simply typing in keywords provides millions of relevant results. If you're confused about a homework assignment, the internet can offer solutions. Second, computers allow you to interact with people globally and learn about their cultures. Joining a free chatroom might connect you with someone from @LOCATION1, offering insights into their way of life and even a chance to learn a new language. You can observe how an @CAPS2 household operates and compare it with your own. Lastly, computers help you understand the world around you. Many websites offer live satellite feeds of locations worldwide. You can conduct research on the planet, learn about environmental conservation, nature, plants, animals, and even space, including details about planets, potential life, and water. In summary, computers assist with schoolwork, enable global interaction, and enhance your understanding of the world. These are just a fraction of what computers can do. However, it's important not to spend the whole day on them. Make sure to go outside and enjoy yourself.
1087	1089	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I have some questions and hope you can answer them. I'm wondering if you have computers at home and, if so, how many? Also, do you enjoy using the computer? I'm trying to understand how some people manage without computers because I'm curious about how they survive in this digital age. Computers are essential in our modern lives. Virtually everything in the world can be accessed through a computer. You can communicate, send emails, and even have face - to - face conversations via video cameras attached to most computers today. Computers simplify our lives in numerous ways. For instance, if your phone is dead and you need to tell a friend the meeting time, you can easily text them from the computer. You can use your screen - name or visit the websites of carriers like Verizon, AT&T, Sprint to send texts. This prevents you from disappointing your friend. There have been times when I couldn't find my telephone book, but I simply go to yellowpages.com on the computer to look up a restaurant or a place. You can search for almost anything on the computer, such as prices, locations, and facts, and most of the time, the information is accurate. Computers are also helpful for historical, scientific, and @CAPS2 facts. They are indispensable for daily communication, looking up phone numbers, and obtaining information. You can type up papers neatly if you have bad handwriting. As I've said, computers are essential in our present - day lives. I'm sure you'll agree after reading this.
1088	1090	1	2	Dear local newspaper, in my opinion, computers are highly beneficial to people. They offer assistance when needed and provide entertainment, which are the reasons for their benefits. Computers are useful for getting help. For example, when writing a paper and in need of research, you can use the computer. If there's a complex equation, you can look up the relevant formula. This clearly shows how computers benefit people. Computers also serve as a source of entertainment. Social networks like MySpace and Twitter are popular. If you like watching TV or listening to music, there are dedicated websites. Thus, computers can offer entertainment. Moreover, computers facilitate communication. If you're in different countries from your loved ones, you can communicate with them via instant messaging or webcam. Home - schooled children can interact with peers of the same age on the computer. This demonstrates the importance of computers in communication. In conclusion, computers are extremely beneficial as they provide entertainment, enable communication, and offer assistance.
1089	1091	1	2	Dear editor of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, it is often said that technology is having a far - reaching impact on people. Computers play an active and crucial role in our daily lives. They aid in school projects, help us understand global cultures, and allow us to connect with friends and family worldwide. In school, we are required to complete numerous projects, and the computer is our primary tool. When planning a trip to a distant place, we usually research it on the computer first. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and @CAPS3 are used to communicate with friends. As eighth - graders preparing for high school, we frequently use computers for projects, reports, and research. The computer helps us find information for projects, create diagrams, and data tables. Many people also use it for work - related reports. When books can't provide the information we need, we can find hundreds of websites with detailed information and photos of a person by searching their name on the computer. Computers also offer practical functions. We can book flights, check tax rates, and buy cars online. Instead of driving to a local dealership, we can browse car features, prices, and mileage on websites. The only way to get tickets for various events or flights is through the internet. We can book flights to destinations like Florida or @LOCATION1. We can also monitor the economy by looking up tax rates and the national debt, as well as the average family's annual tax payments. Most importantly, computers have revolutionized global communication. Facebook and Twitter are the leading platforms of this century. They allow us to chat with friends, share photos, and discuss our personal lives. There are also lifestyle games available. @CAPS3 is less popular now as it lacks the same features. In summary, computers enable us to communicate with friends and family, conduct research, complete projects, book flights, and buy cars. They are an essential part of our school curriculum and daily lives, having a positive influence on us.
1090	1092	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, are you constantly telling your kids to stop using the computer and do their homework? I think I can offer some insights on this issue. In my view, computers do not benefit our society as much as we might think. People are spending too much time on computers, neglecting the outdoors and the time they could spend with friends and family. I believe setting a daily limit on computer use can help solve these problems. Computers can be very distracting. Staring at the screen can damage your eyes and kill brain cells, which are essential for school, sports, and other activities. They can also prevent you from completing your work on time, forcing you to stay up late to finish homework. For example, I have a busy after - school schedule. I try to finish my work first and then use the computer briefly before dance practice. This way, I can still socialize with friends and relax. As @DATE1 approaches, the weather will be beautiful. You don't want to waste such a nice day on the computer. Our bodies need oxygen, which computers can't provide. Going outside for exercise is a great way to get oxygen. You can swim, jump, or play sports, which offer more than a computer can. My doctor once advised that everyone should exercise for at least an hour a day, and this can't be achieved by sitting at the computer. Spending time with friends and family is also important. They are there for you when you're down and can make you laugh. When relatives visit or during family holidays, we should put away the computers and focus on each other. In conclusion, we should limit our computer use, go outside for fresh air and exercise, and cherish the time spent with friends and family.
1091	1093	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I've noticed that there's a concern among some people about excessive computer use. However, I firmly disagree with this view. I believe that computers enhance hand - eye coordination. When you're writing school papers or work documents, you're unconsciously improving this skill. Once you get the hang of typing, your speed increases significantly.  Computers also open up a world of distant places and people. They allow us to learn about different cultures and far - off locations without the need for expensive travel. Moreover, they are a vital tool for communication. A researcher has shown that computers enable easy online chatting.   In conclusion, computers are incredibly useful. They teach hand - eye coordination, offer insights into far - off places, and facilitate online communication with friends. I hope you can see the value of computers as I do.
1092	1094	1	2	Dear Newspaper, in today's society, the majority of people own computers, which have significantly advanced both society and technology. Some claim that computers have negative effects, but this is unfounded. Computers have had numerous beneficial impacts on people.   Although some experts advocate for less computer use, schools rely on this technology. Students are required to type their papers, which speeds up the completion process. This means they don't have to stay up late doing homework, which is beneficial for their health. Additionally, using computers helps develop hand - eye coordination, an essential skill for the future.  Computers have also made significant contributions to technology. They allow us to explore places that humans have never or could never physically reach. We can produce and distribute items more quickly. They also enable us to learn about different cultures, far - away places, and diverse people, expanding our horizons.  Social networking sites like Facebook are popular. More than @PERCENT1 of students in an average school use it. These platforms facilitate communication, and contrary to the belief that computers make people anti - social, they actually enable more interaction. People can communicate daily with others around the world without worrying about cellphone minutes.  In conclusion, computers are more of a benefit than a burden. They help us broaden our horizons and gain knowledge of new things. They truly are a remarkable advancement in our lives.
1093	1095	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I am deeply concerned about the increasing dependence on computers. People need to spend more time outdoors and be physically active. Some people in @MONTH1 think they're not wasting time on the computer, but I strongly disagree. Computer use should be limited to what is necessary.  Game developers are constantly coming up with new gaming ideas to attract users. However, these games not only waste people's time but also their money, as electricity bills soar. Instead of going out to meet new people, individuals are staying home and chatting on social networking sites, which makes them less social.  Children are also affected. They're not enrolling in sports, losing the opportunity to build physical strength. Moreover, lack of physical activity can lead to weight gain. While useful software like Microsoft Word has its merits, excessive daily gaming is not.  Teachers, parents, and everyone need to show people that the computer is not the only thing in life. Although computers can provide us with knowledge at our fingertips, they can also take away family and friend time. The impact of computer use is not limited to the user but affects everyone around them.  In conclusion, we need to come together. We should go outside more, exercise, and limit computer use. By doing so, we can make our lives and our community better.
1094	1096	1	2	I firmly believe that we should have computers. They are incredibly useful tools. For instance, they can help us find people we never knew existed. I could discover a long - lost brother with the help of a computer.  Computers also enable us to communicate with friends online. Platforms like MySpace and @CAPS1 allow us to have friends from all over, even in @MONTH1. Through searching on the computer, we can find new things. We can look up information such as the weather in a different country or state. For example, I can find out how cold it is in Texas. We can also search for the age of things.  In conclusion, computers are valuable assets that offer us the ability to connect with others and gain knowledge easily. They are an essential part of our modern lives.
1095	1097	1	2	Dear fellow citizens, imagine having to get a book for every question you have. It would take ages just to obtain the book, let alone read it. Computers have been a great help in the modern world, assisting with answering questions, maintaining long - distance friendships, and providing entertainment.  Computers have far - reaching benefits that are hard to fully enumerate. Firstly, they help us stay in touch with friends who are far away without relying solely on phone calls. Social media sites like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 allow us to communicate and play with friends from different places. If the only way to talk to a friend from afar was to call them on the phone, our friendships would likely fade quickly because people rarely have the time for dedicated phone conversations. On the computer, we can multitask. For example, we can talk to someone while cleaning our room.  Secondly, computers offer a variety of entertainment options. We can play games, watch funny videos, or even catch up on missed TV shows. If we miss a show, we can watch it online, saving time and effort.  Finally, computers are much more efficient for information - seeking. They are faster than searching through a library, and we can do it from the comfort of our homes. Some people claim that computers are taking away time from reading, but this is not true. We can read anything online, and if we want, the computer can even read to us.  @NUM1 of Americans believe that computers are a great help, giving them more time to do other things. Computers are constantly being upgraded and getting better.  In conclusion, computers are a boon to us. They are especially useful for busy people. So, go ahead and get a computer.
1096	1098	1	2	Dear local newspaper, there are several reasons regarding how computers have an impact on people. My intention is to convince the local newspaper as to why certain individuals should not and should use computers. Some people get overly engrossed in the internet, or they lack the financial means to explore the world, so they simply stay online. In fact, people should not waste their time on the internet because they will get caught up. For example, my friend, [PERSON1], spends more than [NUM1] hours on the computer. He tells me that he is on a chat line, connecting with other people. He forgets about everyone else. He is so focused on the internet that he stopped going to school and is gaining weight. Now he is a nobody, just sitting in front of his computer doing nothing. I feel that he has thrown his life away for some stupid chat line. It is not difficult to find other opportunities in our city. There are many beautiful young ladies to meet. Similarly, people should not waste their time on the internet because they start losing time. For instance, they spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. People lose their focus on important matters and start paying attention to other things like the internet. There was a great and successful person who made tons of money. However, she lost her job because she was so fixated on Facebook. Facebook is like a place where you can meet friends and people from different places and even find dates. It turned her life upside - down. I remember her telling my mom how messed up her life is now, how she got fired, how she can't pay her bills, and how she is moving into a smaller place. Sometimes, websites make people lose focus on important things in life. Nevertheless, certain people should use computers because the internet can help with certain things. In summary, the internet can help you find hotels or plan trips with your friends or family. I love being online. One time, I signed up for a website called MySpace and for a moment, I did get caught up in it. In conclusion, while the internet has its benefits, people need to be cautious not to let it consume their lives.
1097	1099	1	2	Dear local newspaper, my opinion on the effects of computers on people is that an increasing number of individuals are becoming obese, people tend to be moody, and computers can be addictive. I firmly believe that computers have a significant impact on people. Firstly, more people are becoming obese each year because they spend most of the day sitting in a chair and rarely leave it. They become so lazy that they order food to be delivered rather than going out to get it. Moreover, they do not get enough exercise as they sit still all day and only move to get food or their phones. This is why both kids and adults should limit their computer time to [NUM1] hours or less per day. Another reason is that people who use computers tend to be moody. One moment they are happy, but once they get off the computer, they become sad. They stay cooped up indoors all day and do not get enough exposure to the outside world. Limiting computer time to an hour per day could improve their mood. People need a lot of exercise to maintain a healthy weight and muscle mass. The last reason is that people can become addicted to computers. For example, if they are playing a game all day without realizing it, they will get addicted and not stop. People should leave the computer and engage in other activities like riding a bike or playing a sport. In conclusion, it is not good for people to stay indoors all day playing on the computer as it is harmful to their health and increases the risk of obesity. I hope you can consider my ideas.
1098	1100	1	2	"Dear newspaper, I have been following the debate about computers. Some people claim that computers are teaching important skills, while others argue that ""people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising."" In my view, people should be able to use computers as they were designed to assist us. Consider how much computers have helped the human race, from communicating with friends and family in other countries to checking the departure time of a plane to [LOCATION1]. It is reported that over one million people use their computers more than once a day. Without computers, there would be no worldwide web, which is connected to everything in the world. Without computers, we would not be able to control any robots, and many jobs would be lost. Additionally, the cost of food would increase significantly. In hospitals, computers are essential as they can save lives by storing important information. Without them, we would have to go back to using typewriters. However, another major issue is that some people overuse computers. Once people learn to moderate their computer usage, this problem can be resolved. Some people also say that computers are too expensive. But there are ways to make down - payments on computers, and setting up the internet is as easy as [NUM1]. In conclusion, although there are both good and bad aspects of computers, without them, we would not have a modern era. We can control robots, save lives, and enjoy many other benefits. Therefore, I am grateful for computers and hope people can make good use of them."
1099	1101	1	2	Dear [CAPS1], I am writing this article about computers to share my views on their positive and negative effects. Computers are highly successful because they provide a wealth of useful information, such as directions to a destination or details about a subject or a person. However, since anyone can post information on the internet, not all of it is accurate. One of the reasons computers can be bad is the presence of unsafe links that can expose personal information to others, which may cause problems in the future. Also, some websites and pop - up icons are not suitable for younger children as they expose them to content that is too mature. On the other hand, online communication has become an integral part of our daily lives. For example, almost every American with a computer uses email. Additionally, the new form of web communication that allows us to see and interact with people through computers is rapidly growing in [LOCATION1]. In conclusion, this is my perspective on computers, highlighting both their advantages and disadvantages.
1100	1102	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I believe that the computer is not a bad thing for three reasons. Firstly, we can learn about far - away places. If we are doing a report or are simply curious, the computer can tell us what kind of plants grow in a particular area for food. For example, tropical places grow bananas and coconuts. We can also learn about the local cuisine, like in [LOCATION1] where people eat many beans and even include them in salads. We can discover the local language, such as Spanish in [LOCATION2]. Secondly, computers can teach hand - eye coordination. Using a computer involves using our fingers and eyes to see what we are typing. Whether we are typing on the keyboard or using the mouse, our hands are constantly engaged. Thirdly, computers are great for socializing. There are numerous social sites like MySpace, Facebook, AIM, and WebChat. The possibilities are endless, and we can even play games. If we don't know someone on Facebook or MySpace, it is a great way to meet new friends. Moreover, if we are having trouble finding friends, we can check if they are online. It is useful for arranging to meet up. For those who think that computers are taking away family time, one can simply set limits and have a conversation with family members. In conclusion, computers are beneficial as they allow us to learn about different places, improve hand - eye coordination, and communicate with new and old friends.
1101	1103	1	2	In my view, household computers are incredibly useful. They can assist with daily tasks such as research, development, homework, and artwork. They function as a constantly updated travel dictionary, a 24 - hour super - store with an endless array of items, a platform for video games, and a highly sophisticated calculator. New programs are constantly emerging. However, computer addiction is extremely detrimental. If one becomes addicted, they may start to lose friends and girlfriends, neglect their family. Typing for long periods can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome, and staring at a bright screen all day can cause focus - related eye problems. Sitting all day in a chair, kneeling, or reclining in a chaise lounge may seem comfortable but can result in a bad back. In conclusion, computers are very helpful and fun, but they are also addictive. We should have fun with them but avoid getting addicted. Moderation is key for a healthy relationship with computers.
1102	1104	1	2	Dear Readers, one of the most significant inventions of the past few decades is the computer, which has both advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, people, especially teenagers, spend too much time on computers. They devote excessive time to social media and online gaming, and not enough time outdoors enjoying nature, playing sports, or exercising. While they can chat with friends online, it is not the same as going to the park and playing baseball with them. Families also become distant when they sit around on their computers. Teenagers spend too much time on the internet instead of engaging in more beneficial activities like reading. We all probably know at least one obese person or teenager. My neighbor is extremely overweight and spends hours sitting in front of the computer, glazed - eyed. I'm sure everyone reading this knows someone like my neighbor. The statistic that [PERCENT1] of [LOCATION2] is obese is very real. In my view, it is the fault of the internet and computers. Instead of going to the gym or the soccer field with friends, they sit at the computer, talk, and eat junk food. They waste time watching pointless online videos instead of playing sports. Some may claim that computers help with hand - eye coordination, but sports can do it better. Computers are a major factor in obesity as they encourage people to be sedentary instead of getting the standard [NUM1] minutes of exercise a day. Another pressing issue is the lack of reading among teenagers and [CAPS9]. I'd say the average teenager gets only about [NUM2] minutes of reading a day because they are too busy chatting with friends online. I have a cousin who reads very little, fails tests, and has repeated grades. Instead of reading and learning, he chats and texts. There are people in underdeveloped countries like [LOCATION3] who are lucky to own a single book, while teenagers here waste educational opportunities. More than [PERCENT2] of the kids in my class only read the required material due to excessive computer use. The average reading level of [CAPS10] is [NUM5] and is decreasing because of less reading and more computer time. Surveys show that [NUM6] out of [NUM7] people spend more than [NUM6] hours a day on computers. These statistics make me wonder how much time we really need to spend on computers instead of reading. Otherwise, we'll turn into unfit individuals with poor reading skills. Computers and the internet are not only harming our health but also taking away valuable experiences in the real world. They are robbing us of the beauty of nature, such as [ORGANIZATION1], [CAPS11] [CAPS12], and [CAPS13] [CAPS14]. Skiing down a slope or climbing [LOCATION1] is far more rewarding than sitting in front of a computer. Unfortunately, most [CAPS15] choose the latter. They sit on old chairs, staring at screens instead of exploring nature. Instead of taking steps to protect the environment, they are mesmerized by the screen. We should be preserving what's left on the planet and learning, but the internet and computers are preventing us from doing so. I've presented a strong case against excessive computer use, and I strongly urge you to take action to reduce screen time. Set up programs at home or in the community to limit computer use. We need to act now!
1103	1105	1	2	"Dear editor, last week, I was surprised to read an article in the paper titled ""Get off the computer and go exercise."" There are numerous benefits to using computers. They enhance education, allow us to learn about foreign countries, and enable us to communicate with others. Every school has computers, which are easily accessible and very useful. Last year, when a student asked a question and the teacher wasn't sure of the answer, we would immediately turn to the computer. It also helps us perform better on projects. I once had to complete a project, and without the computer, I wouldn't have been able to finish it. We also utilize the programs on computers. In art class, we used Photoshop to create a realistic - looking cartoon. Using a computer for research is easy and fast. We can learn about far - away places. For example, we can find out about a country's geographical features, population, and historical facts about its leaders and government. Websites like [CAPS2].com provide up - to - the - minute information. Additionally, we can communicate with others through email, instant messaging, and social media platforms like Facebook. Email is useful for business communication and sharing links and information. Instant messaging is like texting but much faster. Facebook has millions of users, and it allows us to connect with old and current friends. My mom uses Facebook to stay in touch with her old friends after moving. In my opinion, computers are a great asset. They not only improve our education but also teach us about foreign cultures and help us reconnect with old friends. Remember your ""best - friend - for - life"" from school? With Facebook, you can catch up with them instead of just reminiscing."
1104	1106	1	2	Dear [CAPS1] of [ORGANIZATION1], did you know that eight out of ten homes in [LOCATION1] have at least one computer? Computers offer numerous benefits to our society. They are excellent tools for education, allowing us to learn about distant countries and cultures with just a click. They also facilitate communication, especially for families with members in the military or those separated by long distances. It is a convenient and cost - effective way to stay in touch without incurring high phone bills. For parents, it can be an alternative to buying expensive cell phones for their children. Moreover, computers make many tasks easier. For instance, typing a [NUM1] - page essay on a computer is neater and faster than writing it by hand. Businesses rely on computers to organize data, as seen with programs like Excel developed by [ORGANIZATION2]. This is far more efficient than traditional methods. The most significant advantage of computers is the vast amount of information they provide. If we are curious about an event like the recent earthquake in [LOCATION2], we can quickly access detailed information on the internet. In conclusion, computers are wonderful tools that can assist in communication, organization, and satisfying our curiosity. This technological advancement is a great way to improve our daily lives, benefiting not just [LOCATION1] but the entire society.
1105	1107	1	2	"Computers have both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, they are an effective means of communicating with people in different states. They can also keep us out of trouble and entertained. They can perform many functions that other objects cannot. However, the negative side is that some people can become computer - obsessed. They may turn into ""computer freaks"" and become hyper - focused on computers, which can have a negative impact on their lives. In conclusion, while computers offer many benefits, we need to be aware of the potential for addiction and use them in a balanced way."
1106	1108	1	2	In recent times, the prevalence of computer usage has become a topic of significant discussion. While some individuals over - utilize computers, spending excessive time sitting in front of screens, it's important to recognize both the positive and negative aspects. Approximately @PERCENT1 of the population overuses computers, which means they miss out on fresh air and quality time with family and friends. However, computers also offer numerous benefits. For those with family and friends living at a distance, computers are an excellent tool for staying in touch. For instance, my cousin, who went abroad for college, maintains a blog on the computer to keep everyone updated.   Computers are also great educational resources. They allow us to learn about far - off places like @LOCATION1. Online, we can explore the history of specific locations, view pictures of towns, and gain in - depth knowledge. In the academic realm, computers are indispensable. Students can type essays and easily correct mistakes, and projects can be readily adjusted.   On the flip side, the increasing rate of obesity in America is, to some extent, related to computer use. Many people come home and spend the evening sitting in front of the computer, unaware of its negative impact. In conclusion, computers can be both beneficial and harmful. We should use them when necessary, such as for staying in touch, learning, and academic work, while also making sure to balance our time with outdoor activities and social interactions.
1107	1109	1	2	Dear Newspaper, computers have proven to be a valuable asset to society. They serve multiple functions, including education, problem - solving, and entertainment. Regarding education, computers are a powerful tool. They can teach people a wide range of things. For tourists, @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 tourists research their travel destinations on computers. They also help students. I once had trouble with fractions in math, and by using the computer to look up the solution, I was able to catch up with my class. Additionally, according to culture digest.com, @PERCENT1 of people visiting a new country first learn about the local culture through computers.   In terms of problem - solving, computers are highly efficient. They have built - in calculators that can easily solve math problems, and @NUM3 out of @NUM4 computer users have used this feature. Geographic problems can also be solved with live satellite maps, and Map tools claims its system has never had a flaw.   When it comes to entertainment, computers offer a vast array of options. @PERCENT2 of teens get their music from computers rather than CDs. On a rainy day, I once played Minesweeper on my computer, which kept me entertained.   In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in our lives, offering educational, problem - solving, and entertainment benefits. I hope this letter will be taken into consideration. Thank you for your time.
1108	1110	1	2	In my opinion, computers bring numerous benefits to society. More and more people are using computers, and this trend is positive. Online learning is one of the most significant advantages. You can practice math, reading, and writing, and it's a great resource for studying. If you're at home and need to prepare for a test, you can go online to study. You can also learn how to solve math problems or catch up on reading.   When you're bored at home, the computer can be a source of fun. You can play games and trivia, which is especially useful for kids who often get bored. These games can also be educational.   Computers also facilitate interaction with family and friends. You can use email or webcam to communicate. If you haven't talked to someone for a long time, you can easily connect with them through the computer. You can even find old @CAPS1 school classmates you haven't spoken to in years.   If parents are concerned about their children accessing inappropriate websites, they can block them. In conclusion, I firmly believe that we need computers in our society. They are essential and can greatly assist us in various aspects of our lives.
1109	1111	1	2	As a teen, I can't imagine my life without a computer. However, I've come to realize that it might be holding me back from more important things. I believe that a world without computers could, in some ways, be more educational. When writing school research papers, we often turn to computers immediately instead of using books and magazines. As a result, many people lack the skills to properly use and find information in books.   Computers are also having a negative impact on family life. In my family, every member uses a computer daily, and it's hard to go through a day without it. This over - reliance on computers has led to less family time and communication. Teens often prefer chatting with friends on the computer over spending time with their families. If a poll were taken on how much family time has been lost due to computers, I'm sure the result would be significant. The only true family time some families have without computers is during dinner, which is far from enough.   Moreover, computers are disconnecting us from nature. Although there are many ads on the computer about environmental protection, people tend to ignore them and stay inside playing on the computer. This means we're not getting enough fresh air and are missing out on the opportunity to contribute to making the world a better place.   In conclusion, while computers have become an integral part of our lives, their negative impacts on education, family, and our connection with nature cannot be ignored. We should try to find a balance and reduce our over - dependence on them.
1110	1112	1	2	Dear local Newspaper, in my view, computers have been a great help to our society over the past decade. Firstly, using a computer improves hand - eye coordination. When you have better hand - eye coordination, you can type faster and more accurately, which is a valuable skill.   Secondly, computers enhance social skills. Nowadays, many people use platforms like Facebook to make and chat with friends. On a cold and rainy day, you can play games on the computer or check the news and weather forecast.   Finally, learning to type on a computer increases your chances of getting a good job. Most well - paying jobs require typing and computer operation skills.   However, I understand that not everyone shares my opinion. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have been beneficial to our society, but I also recognize that others may have different perspectives. Now, I'm interested in hearing what you think.
1111	1113	1	2	In today's digital age, the rhythmic clicking of a computer mouse is a common sound as people search the vast expanse of the internet. In my view, computers have a highly positive impact on individuals. They can teach kids social skills, enhance people's intelligence, and assist with homework.  Computers are like online communication hubs, enabling interaction in numerous ways such as Facebook chat, AIM, MySpace, Twitter, and Skype. For teens, kids, or even adults who are too nervous to talk on the phone or in person, online chatting can be a starting point. They can gradually build confidence and then transition to phone or in - person conversations. For instance, I once met a very sweet but extremely shy girl. She decided to create an AIM account and talk to people. Eventually, she proved to be one of the nicest and funniest people I've hung out with.  I also believe that computers can make people more intelligent. In my opinion, they are more helpful than books. To obtain information, one simply needs to type a few keys and click a button. A computer is like a personal handbook of the world. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 more people claim that computers are more helpful than books and can boost intelligence because the internet offers more detailed facts. @PERCENT2 of kids with computers use them for homework. When doing homework, a computer is an excellent tool. For example, if you need to write a report about @CAPS1 @PERSON1 and find out where he was born, you just type in the relevant query, and the exact information appears. Also, for writing a rough draft, using a word document is much more convenient than writing neatly by hand.  In conclusion, computers have a definite positive effect on people. They are a great way to teach kids social skills, make people more intelligent, and assist with homework. Although I understand that some people spend excessive time on computers and less time exercising, the internet also provides resources for exercise. Computers are not a waste of time; they bring many benefits.
1112	1114	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I aim to persuade you that the use of computers benefits society. There are three main reasons: facilitating schoolwork, enhancing business operations, and enabling comprehensive research.  Regarding schoolwork, computers are widely used. Students use them for projects and research. The growing popularity of online classes, whether for college or self - learning, is a significant factor. This clearly shows that computers play a vital role in education and should be recognized as a valuable asset to society.  In the business realm, many people now work from home, establishing their own offices and even companies. A large number of workers in public businesses (@PERCENT1) use tools like ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" or Publisher, often for creating ads. Moreover, online bill - paying is a convenient feature. I recall helping my mother pay a bill online. She found it easy and said she'd do it more often now that she knows how. The business applications of computers are substantial enough to convince you of their value.  Finally, computers are essential for overall research. Online catalogs offer a wider variety of products compared to physical stores. I love shopping at my favorite store ""@CAPS8"" through its online catalog. The news can be accessed conveniently, which is important for many people, like my parents. Additionally, job openings are easily searchable online. This is crucial, especially for those seeking employment.  In summary, the reasons for the positive impact of computers on society are clear: schoolwork, business, and research. If these reasons don't convince you, I'm not sure what will."
1113	1115	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I'd like to share my concerns about the negative impacts of computer use. I've seen a family whose lives have been negatively affected by excessive computer use. They've become overweight, fatigued, lonely, disconnected from nature, and lazy. Had they reduced their computer time, they could have been healthy, fit, energetic, and more engaged with the world.  Computers can damage our social connections. By spending more time on computers rather than interacting with friends and family, we weaken these relationships. They can lead to self - isolation. A friend of mine, @CAPS2, said that long hours on the computer made them feel lonely. Friendships can suffer as a result of this isolation.  Computers also keep us away from nature. Instead of going outside to play sports or engage in other activities, we're likely to be sitting in front of the screen. Playing sports can improve hand - eye coordination, which is far more beneficial than computer use. I'd much rather play volleyball, basketball, swim, or go on an outing with friends than sit in front of a computer.  The obesity rate in our country is likely to increase if people continue to rely heavily on computers. Lack of exercise due to computer use can lead to a @PERCENT1 rise in weight. This not only affects physical health but also overall well - being.  In conclusion, the negative impacts of computers are significant. We should consider reducing our computer time to avoid being lonely, overweight, and disconnected from nature. It's time to raise awareness about these issues and take action.
1114	1116	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I'm here to explain why I'm against the usage of computers.  One major issue is the negativity associated with computer use. There are numerous pop - ups and small advertisements like ""@CAPS1 on me"" and ""free trial"" on websites. These are not suitable for children to see when they're using the computer.  Another concern is the safety of online interactions. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people use the computer daily, and @NUM3 out of @NUM5 people are chatting with young boys and girls. There are individuals known as ""@CAPS2"" who roam the internet, trying to target children. This is not the intended purpose of computer use, which should be for information - seeking or gaming.  Parental monitoring is also a problem. Many parents don't watch their kids when they're on the computer. As a result, kids often access inappropriate sites. Parents should implement parental controls to prevent this.  In conclusion, computers can be dangerous. You never know what you're clicking on, and you might end up on an unwanted site. I hope my opinions help you understand the potential risks of computer use. Thank you."
1115	1117	1	2	Statistics indicate that an increasing number of people each year are not getting enough exercise and are instead spending time on the computer, chatting on platforms like Facebook or MySpace. As more people embrace computer use, there is a debate about whether this benefits society. Supporters of technological advancement believe that computers have a positive impact on people's lives. However, I firmly believe otherwise.  One reason is the rise in obesity. In the @LOCATION1, obesity has increased by at least @PERCENT1 because people are spending too much time on the computer and not getting enough exercise. As Nothinka said, ""There are too many people who don't get the exercise they need.""  Another concern is safety. When you share your name and address online, there is a slight @CAPS3 of being kidnapped or murdered. The @ORGANIZATION1 warns that there are bad people on the internet who want to access your personal information.  Finally, computer use reduces the time we spend with our families. We should be more present with our loved ones, but instead, we're often glued to the screen.  Given these issues, I believe it would be a wise idea for you to write an article about technology. Considering the problems of obesity in America and online safety, now is the time. Writing this article could not only raise awareness but also potentially bring in a good amount of money. So, pick up your pencil and start writing. Although some people think computers are fun, they are not fully aware of the negative consequences. It's important to take action and address these issues."
1116	1118	1	2	"@CAPS1, the sounds of pinball on my computer go ""boom, bom!"" @CAPS2 exclaims, ""Yea, we won!"" These are noises you don't want to hear all day long. Spending excessive time on the computer is detrimental to your health. @CAPS5, you're a computer enthusiast, and this habit can lead to weight gain. It's also bad for your eyesight, and you miss out on the beauty of nature. @CAPS3, do you want to become so heavy that you can't even get out of bed? I doubt it. If @CAPS5 you're constantly sitting at the computer desk, that might be your fate. @PERCENT1 of doctors state that if @CAPS5 you don't get up from the computer, you'll become obese. Obesity is extremely harmful to your health and can shorten your lifespan. If @CAPS5 you want to live a long and healthy life, you need to get up from the computer and exercise. @CAPS4 says, ""I think I need stronger glasses; my eyes are getting worse!"" If @CAPS5 something like this has happened to you, it's because you've been staring at the computer screen all day. @PERSON1 warns that if @CAPS5 you're always at the computer, you'll need glasses or a stronger prescription. Both adults and children should step away from their computers. Studies show that more adults than children are spending time on computers playing games. Have clear, healthy eyes and leave the computer behind. Picture the sun giving you a beautiful tan, and the gentle breeze in your ear. @CAPS3, does that sound appealing? Put down the computer and go outside. That's an amazing experience you can have. If @CAPS5 you just sit in front of the computer screen, you'll only watch others enjoying the great, relaxing experience that should be yours. Get up, be active, and go outside. Now is the time to leave your computer. @CAPS5, if you haven't realized, the computer is an unhealthy device for humans. Be like me and get rid of your computer. You need to be healthy and, most importantly, active. Have good eyesight and enjoy nature. Stop using the computer."
1117	1119	1	2	Currently, a debate rages on whether computers benefit society. Some people argue that computers facilitate internet conversations between friends and provide information about distant places and people. However, I firmly believe that computers are not essential. People waste a significant amount of time on computers, reducing their exercise time. They pay little attention to nature. Instead of chatting with friends online, why not meet them at the park? Many computer users experience a decrease in metabolism, which is one reason why @LOCATION1.A has the highest obesity rates globally. Moreover, the less you exercise, the less healthy you become, and the more pain and tension you'll feel if your muscles aren't exercised. If we, as @CAPS1, continue to neglect exercise, our future prospects will be bleak. Isn't it disheartening that people focus so much on computers while there are endangered species in nature? Pandas, polar bears, various types of whales, and other creatures need our help to combat extinction. Unfortunately, we're overly preoccupied with computers. As humans, we have the power to make a difference, so we should assist these creatures in surviving for future generations. Perhaps if we take time away from the computer, we'll learn more about these creatures and find nature more fascinating. Why use text - messaging on the computer when we can talk to friends in a park? We have the freedom of speech in @LOCATION1. Our families sometimes need our help, but we're often unavailable because we're engrossed in our computers. While our computer usage increases, our social life suffers, and we lose sight of what's truly important. In conclusion, when considering your computer usage, think about what you can do for nature, your health, and your family and friends.
1118	1120	1	2	Dear editor, I've heard about the debate on whether technology benefits society. I firmly believe that it does. Computers and technology offer numerous advantages. Firstly, they enable communication with friends. Instead of sending a slow and dull letter, you can quickly connect with friends you haven't seen in a while. For instance, when my friend moved to @LOCATION1, it would have been extremely time - consuming to reach them, so I simply went online and had a chat. Moreover, typing is less strenuous on your hands than writing. Secondly, computers are a powerful tool for information - gathering. In the past, researching a topic could take days, but now you can find everything you need in just ten minutes. I recall in fifth grade when I had a difficult project. I spent @NUM1 days looking through books with little success, but I found all the necessary information online in half an hour. Additionally, online sources, such as those on @ORGANIZATION2, can provide hundreds of resources on a single topic. Lastly, technology is incredibly useful in everyday life. Computers can help you find your way, locate a supermarket, and assist with various tasks. One year when I went on vacation to @LOCATION2 and got lost, a computer helped us find our way. Computers can also suggest fun places for you, your friends, or your family to visit, like @ORGANIZATION1. In conclusion, technology benefits society significantly. It allows us to communicate with friends, aids in schoolwork, and serves as a reliable resource for daily life. I hope you've found this information valuable. Please consider it in your next discussion. Thank you for your time and for reading my letter.
1119	1121	1	2	In my view, computers are highly beneficial to people. They provide the information that people may need at any time. Moreover, they serve as excellent learning tools, enabling individuals to acquire a vast amount of knowledge. In today's fast - paced world, access to information is crucial, and computers offer an efficient way to obtain it. Whether it's for academic research, professional development, or personal interest, computers can provide the necessary data. They also offer various learning resources, such as online courses, educational videos, and e - books. In conclusion, computers play an indispensable role in people's lives by providing information and facilitating learning.
1120	1122	1	2	I believe that while computers have some negative impacts on society, their positive effects far outweigh them. Modern computers are highly advanced, allowing us to communicate with friends, access information more efficiently, and enhance our capabilities in scientific research. Almost every teen has an online screen name for chatting with friends. This feature helps kids stay connected and active. Although instant messaging can sometimes distract kids from their daily lives, it can also be incredibly useful. Just last week, a friend of mine forgot to write down their homework and easily contacted me online. I was able to tell them what it was in just @NUM1 seconds. Online communication also enables video chats, making it feel like you're right there with your friends. Since you can't always hang out with friends in person, this is a great alternative. It's not only quick and easy but also free. Computers keep kids off their phones, preventing high phone bills and those annoying conversations about limiting texting. The most significant impact of computers on society is information gathering. The internet allows people to access millions of websites at lightning speed. Every moment, someone is using the internet to find data that would otherwise require a trip to the library. Computers are essential in society; we rely on them, and without them, we'd be lost. They offer an easier way of life that us somewhat lazy @CAPS1 need. The internet keeps us informed about global events without our having to travel. We need the internet, and we couldn't access it without computers. Another major area where computers have helped is research. They've multiplied our man - power and provided a more organized way to store data. I recently watched a show where a computer was testing items for @CAPS2, a process that would take a human weeks. Computers also encourage creativity. They've evolved into smaller, more compact devices that fit in the palm of our hand. They've inspired us to achieve greater things, protect the earth, and explore the unknown. Years ago, a scientist with just a pad of paper wouldn't have dared to think about some of the things we can research today. Computers have connected the world through communication and information, propelling us to a better understanding of our existence. Overall, society needs computers, and their positive impact on society is overwhelming.
1121	1123	1	2	"I firmly believe that people should reduce their computer usage. In today's world, computers have become an integral part of our lives, but excessive use can have detrimental effects. Firstly, from a health perspective, spending long hours in front of a computer screen can lead to various physical problems. A sedentary lifestyle associated with excessive computer use often results in weight gain and obesity. A recent study by @ORGANIZATION3 and the @ORGANIZATION1 studies found that the average person spends about five hours a day on the computer. By cutting down on this time, people can incorporate more exercise into their daily routine. For instance, @PERSON3 at @ORGANIZATION4 pointed out that ""@PERCENT1 of people in the @LOCATION1 alone do not exercise enough."" When people have more free time instead of being glued to the computer, they can take better care of their bodies. I once tried not using my computer for a week, and during that time, I learned to do a back - flip in gymnastics. There are numerous opportunities for physical activity when computer use is reduced.  Secondly, social skills development is severely hampered by excessive computer use. @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION5 stated that ""when people spend time with family and friends, they gain necessary social skills for later in life."" A study at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that those who spend three hours or less on their computers have up to @PERCENT2 better social, verbal, and quick - thinking skills. Spending time with family and friends in person is far more beneficial than interacting online. I make it a point to spend at least three hours a day with my family and friends, and as a result, I have strong relationships with them.  Some may argue that online communication can substitute for in - person social interaction, but in reality, face - to - face interactions require quick thinking and the expression of emotions, which are essential for developing well - rounded social skills.  In conclusion, it is evident that reducing computer time and increasing time spent on exercise or with family and friends is the best way to maintain good physical and mental health. I sincerely hope that you will consider my opinion and take steps to limit your computer usage. Thank you for your attention."
1122	1124	1	2	It has come to my attention that computers are having a significant impact on people's daily lives, and I wholeheartedly agree that this influence is not entirely positive. Given the rising obesity rates in our country, it is crucial that people engage in more exercise, interact with friends and family, and enjoy activities that do not involve technology.  Many individuals are spending an excessive amount of time on their computers, neglecting physical activity. The increasing obesity percentages in various states are a clear indication that people need to prioritize exercise over computer use. Diets are not always effective, as many have tried and failed. Even a simple one - hour walk with a dog is a better alternative to sitting idly in front of a computer screen. For a relatively small fee of @MONEY1 per month, one can join a local gym. However, the key lies in the individual's willingness to make this change.  In addition to exercise, people should also focus on interacting with friends and family. Social interaction helps in the development of essential social skills. When spending time with loved ones, individuals gain the ability to think quickly, express emotions, and communicate effectively. A study at @ORGANIZATION2 has shown that those who limit their computer use to three hours or less per day have up to @PERCENT2 better social, verbal, and quick - thinking skills. I make an effort to spend at least three hours a day with my family and friends, and this has strengthened our relationships.  Finally, it is important to enjoy activities that are not technology - based. The real world offers a plethora of opportunities for fun and exploration. One can invite a friend on a camping trip or spend a little money to enjoy oneself. The outdoors and nature are full of beautiful and awe - inspiring sights, but one can only appreciate them by stepping outside and experiencing them firsthand.  In conclusion, computers are currently manipulating many people's lives and disrupting their daily routines. By following these simple tips of increasing exercise, social interaction, and non - technology - based activities, individuals can lead healthier and more fulfilling lives.
1123	1125	1	2	I am a firm advocate for the importance of computers in our lives. In today's increasingly technology - driven world, computers have become indispensable. They offer numerous benefits, making them a crucial part of our daily existence.  First and foremost, computers are essential for almost every job. As technology advances, proficiency in using a computer is a must - have skill. Police officers rely on computers to track down criminals and maintain criminal records. Schools use computers daily for students to conduct research, write reports, and complete homework. As a student, I can attest to the fact that kids use computers constantly. For example, at @TIME1, I used a computer to complete my math homework assigned by my teacher.  Secondly, computers provide us with the ability to explore the world. We can research any place on the planet, stay updated with the latest news, and be informed about global events. If one is not fond of writing by hand, using a computer can be a great alternative, especially for those who are fast typists. I use my computer to write essays and book reports for @LOCATION1, and I also check the news regularly to stay informed about world affairs.  Lastly, computers enable us to communicate with others online. We can either send emails or have face - to - face conversations via webcam. Online chat is an excellent way to keep in touch with friends who are far away or to clarify homework assignments. On my birthday, my sister couldn't come home from college, but we used webcams so that she could be part of the present - opening and the birthday song.  In conclusion, computers are incredibly important. They are essential for work, offer a wealth of knowledge through research, and facilitate communication. I hope that after reading this, you will share my view on the significance of computers in our lives.
1124	1126	1	2	Since the invention of personal computers, their use has been on the rise. While computers do have some advantages, such as facilitating research and enabling online interaction, the negative aspects far outweigh the positive ones.  One of the most significant drawbacks of excessive computer use is its impact on physical health. Spending long hours sitting in front of a computer screen often leads to a sedentary lifestyle, which can result in weight gain and obesity. Many people are spending so much time in a computer chair that they don't get enough exercise.  Another major concern is the risk of theft associated with computer use. In today's digital age, identity theft and financial fraud are prevalent. Hackers can break into people's bank accounts, which contain all their personal information, and withdraw money at will. Millions of people have their personal details available online, making them vulnerable to such attacks.  Moreover, there are substantial costs associated with computer use. Prolonged exposure to computer screens can damage eyesight, forcing people to spend a significant amount of money on glasses. Additionally, there are those who become addicted to the internet and have to pay thousands of dollars for rehabilitation to regain their health.  In conclusion, the cons of computer use clearly outweigh the pros. The potential risks to physical health, the threat of theft, and the associated costs make it advisable to limit computer use. Everyone should be aware of these dangers and take steps to reduce their reliance on computers to safeguard their well - being.
1125	1127	1	2	In today's digital age, it's common for people to use computers daily. A large number of individuals spend a significant amount of time on their computers, often from the moment they finish work or school until bedtime. This excessive computer use is a cause for concern.  Firstly, it's not healthy to sit in front of a computer screen for six hours or more a day. Staring at a computer for extended periods can damage your eyesight. Instead of wasting time on the computer, people should find other activities. For example, they could go outside and enjoy the fresh air. There are so many things to do outdoors, like going for a walk or exploring new places.  Secondly, spending too much time on the computer means less time for family and friends. Social interaction is crucial for our well - being. When you interact with people in person, you develop important social skills. You learn to think on your feet, express your emotions, and understand others better.  Some might think that online activities can replace real - life experiences, but that's not the case. You can't truly explore and enjoy new things just by sitting in front of a computer. If you want to have a fulfilling life, you need to step out of your comfort zone and try new activities.  In conclusion, a life spent mostly on the computer is a boring and unfulfilling one. People should limit their computer use, go outside, exercise, and spend time with their loved ones. By doing so, they can lead a healthier and more meaningful life.
1126	1128	1	2	In today's era, computers are ubiquitous. While they can be beneficial, I firmly believe they often do more harm than good. Firstly, computers can lead to a sedentary lifestyle. Spending excessive time on a computer means less time for exercise. The more time one spends glued to the screen, the more likely they are to become addicted. This addiction can cause people to neglect physical activity, leading to weight gain and a lack of fitness. For instance, if you're a busy person, the computer can consume your day without you realizing it. Before you know it, the day has passed, and you've achieved nothing productive. It's so easy to get distracted by all the things you can do on the computer, like chatting with friends online instead of going out. This not only affects your physical health but also your social life.  Moreover, excessive computer use can have negative impacts on your health. Staring at the screen for long periods can strain your eyes and may even increase the risk of certain diseases. For example, it can potentially lead to cancer, and in severe cases, it can be life - threatening. I've seen firsthand the consequences of over - using a computer. My aunt died of brain cancer after using a computer for work every day. She suffered for a year with the disease, and it was a painful experience for our family.  However, I do recognize that in some cases, computers are necessary. If you're in business, you'll likely need one. But we should use them with caution. We should only use technology when it's absolutely necessary. This way, our bodies can stay healthy and in shape, which is what we truly need. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, we must be mindful of their potential negative effects and use them in moderation.
1127	1129	1	2	"I'm writing to the local newspaper to discuss the benefits of computers in this computer - dominated era. Computers offer numerous advantages, including enhancing hand - eye coordination, improving communication skills, and providing easy access to knowledge.  Regarding hand - eye coordination, it is a crucial skill as it aids in physical movements. Studies have shown that a significant number (NUM1 out of NUM2) of individuals have improved their hand - eye coordination through computer use. It is especially beneficial for kids who have had hand surgery, as it stimulates the nerves in the hands and brain. A study from last year indicated that PERCENT1 of kids improved their hand movement faster with computer - based activities compared to regular therapy.  Secondly, computers have revolutionized communication. Tools like email and instant messaging are great for pen - pals as they save time and money. There's no need to wait for mail, and responses are almost instantaneous. This is also helpful for shy individuals. A study has shown that PERCENT2 of shy kids have become more talkative in school due to computer - mediated communication. Improved communication skills also boost confidence in kids.  Finally, computers are excellent knowledge tools. Unlike traditional books, which may contain a lot of unnecessary information and take longer to search through, computers allow you to quickly find the information you need by simply typing in a query. As Time magazine put it, ""It's an easy sensation."" In school, bookmarks on the computer make it even easier and faster to access relevant websites.  In conclusion, the era of computers is becoming increasingly popular, and the benefits of computers, such as improved hand - eye coordination, enhanced communication skills, and easy access to knowledge, are undeniable."
1128	1130	1	2	I'm writing to the newspaper to express my strong disagreement with the view that computers are unimportant. I believe computers are essential for several reasons.  Firstly, computers are invaluable for students' research. They can help students find important information for projects. For example, Wikipedia can be used to gather details about historical events like the Battle of LOCATION1. I once visited americanhistory.com to find information about CAPS1 alley CAPS2 and what transpired there. People also use computers to research various school - related topics, such as the Earth and its phenomena.  Secondly, computers offer opportunities for higher education. After high school, one can attend college online. My cousin, for instance, attends an online college because she has to take care of her two children. Online colleges are also heavily advertised on television, as they encourage people to pursue education from the comfort of their homes.  Finally, computers have transformed shopping. Many stores now have online platforms where you can browse their products. Children love shopping, but sometimes it's not convenient to go to the mall or stores. With online shopping, they can view what they want and make purchases, which will be shipped to their doorstep. My mom often orders from CAPS3.C CAPS4, and the items are delivered to our house within a week.  In conclusion, these three reasons - research, online education, and online shopping - clearly demonstrate why people should have a computer. They make our lives more convenient and help us access a wealth of resources.
1129	1132	1	2	I'm writing to the news editors of CAPS1 to suggest an article on the effects of computers on people. In the past NUM1 years, computers have become an integral part of our lives. They offer many benefits, but some experts worry that excessive use may lead to a lack of physical activity and health problems.  In the workplace, computers are extremely useful. As of DATE1, PERCENT1 of CAPS3 are employed, and with the employment rate dropping, people need to be more productive. Programs like ORGANIZATION1 CAPS4 allow workers to type reports efficiently, and tools like CAPS5, ORGANIZATION2, and iCalculator help calculate taxes faster, giving workers more time to focus on other tasks. For those involved in the stock market, computers enable them to manage their investments without incurring high phone bills from calling brokers. Laptops also make it possible to work on the go.  Computers are also great for learning. They teach skills that are essential for jobs and daily life, such as typing, using work programs, and programming. They improve math skills and hand - eye coordination. You can even read your favorite books through online scans, some of which are free.  In terms of socializing, computers offer numerous options. Platforms like CAPS6, Twitter, email, and others allow people to stay in touch with friends and meet new people. For example, on CAPS6, you can have up to NUM2 people in a conversation at any time. It's convenient when you don't feel like going out or when your friends want to talk at odd hours. Online gaming has also become a huge phenomenon. People of all ages, including NUM3, NUM4, and those in CAPS8, CAPS9, and CAPS10, can enjoy gaming. It's a fun activity that many people engage in, and it shouldn't be dismissed as a waste of time.  Some people wrongly believe that technology is making LOCATION1 into unfit and unproductive individuals. However, it's possible to balance computer use with exercise and sports. When used correctly, computers can help us complete work efficiently and learn new skills. In conclusion, computers are a positive force in our lives if we use them in a balanced way. I hope you find this article useful. Thanks for reading.
1130	1133	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are a waste of money and time, especially for kids. Spending too much time on computers can lead to a host of problems. Kids who spend excessive time on the computer tend to become sedentary. They'd rather play video games and eat junk food than go outside and play with their friends. This lack of physical activity can make them gain weight, and they may become too fat and slow to engage in outdoor activities later.  Moreover, long - term computer use can have serious health consequences. Staring at the screen for extended periods can weaken your eyesight. There are also concerns that it may increase the risk of cancer. My aunt passed away from brain cancer after using a computer for work every day. She suffered for NUM2 years with the disease, and it was a tragic experience for our family.  Most kids are more interested in playing stupid games on the computer for hours. When they get tired of these games and want to hang out with their friends, they may find themselves unable to do so because of their poor physical condition.  In light of these issues, I believe that computers should not be used for more than NUM2 hours a day. This way, we can protect our health and ensure that we maintain an active lifestyle. In conclusion, while computers have some uses, their overuse can cause significant harm, and we need to be more cautious about our computer usage.
1131	1134	1	2	Dear sir, I firmly believe that computers are highly beneficial to society. There are numerous advantages to having access to a computer. One can communicate with others online via instant messaging, which is far more reliable than using a telephone or a cellphone. Often, people do not answer their phones when needed. With a computer, one can send a message directly to a person's mobile device.  Computers also offer vast learning opportunities. One can acquire knowledge about the world, different cultures, and global events. There is information available on the internet that even teachers may not cover in class. Through studying on the computer, one can expand their knowledge base.  While it is a concern if one spends more time on the computer than exercising, modern technology allows for exercise while using a computer. For instance, one can play music or watch a movie while working out on a treadmill.  In conclusion, although there are pros and cons to computer usage, ultimately, the ability to exercise while using a computer means that having computers today is indeed beneficial.
1132	1135	1	2	Recently, a debate has emerged regarding whether computers benefit society. Despite valid arguments on both sides, computers have a positive impact on individuals and society as a whole.  Computers offer several benefits. Firstly, they enable research and learning about local and foreign places. In today's world, it is impractical to visit every location one wishes to learn about. Through the internet, one can research a wide range of topics, from the staple diet of a particular region to the New Year celebrations in another. For example, in the @NUM1 grade, I had to complete a research project on @LOCATION2. By using the computer, I was able to gather all the necessary information and more, and I achieved a perfect score on the project. Additionally, computers help us stay informed about local events and the world around us. During childhood, when children have many questions that parents may not be able to answer, the computer provides a quick and easy way to find answers. Without computers, our knowledge would be severely limited.  Secondly, computers facilitate communication. Mailing a letter can take weeks to reach the recipient, but computers offer an immediate means of communication, whether the person is nearby or far away. Last year, my uncle moved to @LOCATION3 for work. We maintained our relationship by communicating through computers. When he returned home for Christmas, we were as close as before. Scientists report that approximately @PERCENT1 of all @CAPS1 have used computers to communicate at least once, and @PERCENT2 of these people use this method regularly. Without computers, social interaction in society would be severely hampered.  Finally, computers make daily tasks easier. They allow people to complete tasks more quickly, leaving more time for family interaction. For example, my neighbor @PERSON1 said that tax - filing and banking are time - consuming, and he couldn't manage without online banking. Computers also assist with various activities, from shopping to finding the right phone company for a new business. Online shopping saves time spent on traveling, walking around stores, and waiting in checkout lines.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in our lives. They educate us, enhance communication, and simplify daily tasks. Our society would not function as effectively without them.
1133	1136	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, you may be aware that more than half of the students worldwide use computers for studying. In my opinion, people generally do not spend excessive time on computers, and when they do, it is often for studying, learning, or reconnecting with old friends.  Computers have several positive effects. Firstly, most kids use computers to learn about class - related topics. There are specialized websites for studying, and some are designed to teach young children how to read and write. Almost all schools have computers these days, and some even provide them to students for study purposes.  Secondly, computers are excellent for communication. One can send emails to distant friends and use platforms like Facebook to find old friends who have moved away. Video - chatting is also possible, whether it's for catching up with a friend or for business meetings with clients across the country.  Thirdly, computers offer useful applications. Microsoft Word allows users to type essays and term papers instead of writing them by hand. There are also applications for creating PowerPoint presentations for projects and for painting or drawing pictures.  In conclusion, if we didn't have computers, the world would be very different. Kids wouldn't be able to search for project information or type essays easily, and it would be difficult to stay in touch with those who have moved away. Therefore, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people.
1134	1137	1	2	Dear: @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that computers are among the most remarkable inventions ever. They contribute significantly to education, simplify daily life, and make traveling more convenient.  In terms of education, computers are invaluable. Teachers often use computers to help students learn important information. There are websites specifically designed for studying, and some teach young children basic reading and writing skills. Nowadays, almost all schools have computers, and some even provide them to students for study. In the U.S., @PERCENT1 of schools use computers more than textbooks, and students achieve high test scores as a result.  Computers also simplify daily tasks. For example, instead of spending hours writing an essay by hand and then finding it full of spelling mistakes, one can type it quickly and use spell - check. I've never heard anyone say that computers haven't made life easier. Another example is researching information about a new dog. Instead of spending time at the library, one can find the necessary information on the internet in seconds.  When it comes to traveling, computers are essential. Without them, one has to go to ticket offices to buy tickets. I can't even recall what it was like to travel without booking tickets online. Additionally, computers have changed the way we communicate. I haven't sent a traditional card in years; instead, I use email, which is quicker, easier, and more reliable.  In conclusion, although excessive computer use can be a problem, and people should not be overly reliant on the internet, computers are extremely helpful. With technology constantly improving, they will only become more useful. Therefore, I firmly believe that computers are truly remarkable inventions.
1135	1138	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, there has been much debate about whether computers benefit society. In my view, they definitely do.  One reason is that computers are excellent for communication. I once found an old friend from @LOCATION1 on the computer whom I hadn't seen in five years. After school, I often go on the computer to talk to my friends. It's a great way to make plans and catch up.  Another reason is that there is so much to do on computers. It's like having an amusement park at home. The internet can be used for homework or playing games. I sometimes spend a couple of hours playing games on the computer, but I still make sure to exercise daily.  It's true that computers can be addictive, but it's up to individuals to make the right choices. Many people say that over @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS1 population has a computer, and @PERCENT2 check their email or use the computer every ten minutes.  In conclusion, I believe computers are beneficial. They are great for communication and offer an endless number of activities. So, if you don't have a computer, I recommend getting one as it will be well worth it.
1136	1139	1	2	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, the average American uses a computer at least once every day. Computers undoubtedly benefit society. With computers, people can easily learn about distant places, study without carrying heavy books and papers, and communicate with individuals across the country and sometimes even the world.  Computers can educate users about the world without the need to visit a library. Free websites like Wikipedia offer rapid access to knowledge on almost any topic. These sites can be used for essay writing, trip planning, and satisfying curiosity. Some argue that computers prevent people from exercising and enjoying nature. However, computers actually promote physical activity and exploration of nature. They provide quick and easy access to travel agencies and information on popular tourist destinations. Additionally, they feature advertising for gyms and offer ideas for home workouts. Computers do not impede exercise or nature walks; they make them more accessible.  Computers also simplify other aspects of life. Education can be significantly enhanced through computer use. Instead of lugging around heavy books, students can carry a lightweight laptop. They no longer need to worry about keeping track of papers, as everything can be saved on the device. Computers organize files, enabling even disorganized students to stay orderly. Moreover, typed text is neat and easy to understand compared to some handwriting. @ORGANIZATION2 in @ORGANIZATION1 serves as an example of how schools can streamline education with laptops. Each student is provided with a laptop instead of books. One student remarked, ""@CAPS6 is so much easier."" Education can be challenging for some, but computers can simplify the process.  Finally, people can communicate with anyone using chat sites. If someone has a cousin in a distant country or a friend who has moved away, they can maintain contact. Email is much faster than traditional mail. Sending an email from one person to another is nearly instantaneous and more private. While regular mail is simply sealed, emails are password - protected. There are also other socializing sites where people can exchange messages. These platforms help individuals learn about different cultures in other cities, regions, and sometimes even other countries. They can bridge cultural gaps, reduce racism, and contribute to a more ideal world.  Computers improve our community. They allow us to learn about far - off places, make education more accessible, and enable us to communicate with others from almost anywhere. After considering all these aspects, it becomes clear that computers are beneficial to our society."
1137	1140	1	2	Computers represent the future and are the most remarkable technology we have developed. They offer numerous advantages, including the improvement of hand - eye coordination, the opportunity to learn about distant people and places, and the ability to communicate with friends.  Computers enhance hand - eye coordination in multiple ways. Typing is an effective method to improve this essential skill. By typing without looking at the keyboard and knowing the location of each key, one can refine their hand - eye coordination. Using a mouse is also beneficial. Moving the physical mouse in your hand to control the digital one on the screen helps develop this skill. This improvement in hand - eye coordination can have a positive impact on other activities. For writing, the hand movements involved in typing or using a mouse are similar to those used in traditional writing. It can also assist in driving, as you need to operate the steering wheel without constantly looking at it, relying on your sense of movement.  Computers also expand our knowledge of the world. There is a vast array of cultures, and we can learn about all of them from the comfort of our homes. We can also study nature without leaving our living spaces. Learning about different cultures teaches us a great deal, such as the clothing they wear, the food they eat, and the places they live. This exposure can inspire us to make changes in our own culture. Moreover, learning about new places can broaden our horizons and potentially lead to new vacation destinations.  In addition, computers facilitate communication with friends. Chatting, emailing, and video - chatting are excellent ways to stay in touch. With a webcam, you can have face - to - face conversations with friends and family, even if they are far away. You can also share important files like pictures, documents, and videos, which can be useful for work.  In conclusion, computers are a vital part of our lives. They teach us important skills like hand - eye coordination, increase our knowledge of the world, and allow us to interact and share with friends. Their importance cannot be overstated.
1138	1141	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, the use of computers is on the rise, yet not everyone believes it benefits society. Supporters of technological advancements, like me, think that computers have a positive impact on people. They offer three main benefits: teaching hand - eye coordination, enabling learning about distant places and people, and facilitating online communication.  Computers play a crucial role in improving hand - eye coordination. Typing is a prime example. Without good hand - eye coordination, it would be difficult to perform simple tasks like hitting a ball with a bat or catching a ball. This skill is essential in many aspects of life, and computers provide an effective way to develop it.  Another advantage of computers is the ability to learn about far - off places and people. For instance, if you are in @LOCATION1 and want to learn about @LOCATION3, or if you are in France and curious about the German people, you can simply look it up on the computer instead of traveling there. It is impractical to fly to a place just for a short visit to learn about it.  Finally, computers allow us to communicate with anyone online, regardless of their location, whether it's from Africa to the US or to @LOCATION2. They eliminate the need to write long letters, which can be time - consuming and inefficient.  In conclusion, computers are truly special. They offer unique benefits that enhance our lives in various ways. We should embrace this technology and make the most of its capabilities.
1139	1142	1	2	Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1, it's a well - known fact that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 spend excessive time on their computers. In my opinion, people should spend more time outdoors with their families. Prolonged computer use can lead to serious problems, including brain issues, vision problems, and even death.  Brain problems are a significant concern associated with excessive computer use. Many people who spend long hours on the computer are constantly preoccupied with it, even when they are with their families. A recent survey revealed that teenagers are the most frequent computer users. Most of these individuals have little to no life outside their computer rooms.  Vision problems are also on the rise. Eye doctors have been receiving numerous calls from worried parents. I interviewed an eye doctor who shared a case of a child who had difficulty seeing. The child's mother reported that he spent an average of three and a half hours on the computer each day. The child had to get a pair of expensive special glasses to improve his vision.  There have been reports of both children and adults dying due to excessive computer use. Overusing the computer can fry the brain, leading to abnormal behavior. Some people engage in illegal activities such as home invasions, killings, and car thefts. I heard about a teenager who became so addicted to the computer that he started killing people and was eventually shot by a police officer. As more people die from excessive computer use, the death toll will continue to rise.  It's time for us to take action. We need to work together to reduce our computer usage. No one wants to be part of the death toll if it can be avoided. It's time to step outside, have fun with our families, and turn off our computers to avoid the temptation of going back online.
1140	1143	1	2	To the @CAPS1, I've recently learned that some people doubt the benefits of computers to society. However, I firmly believe that computers are a valuable asset. They offer three main advantages: facilitating learning about distant places and things, enabling communication between family and friends, and providing entertainment.  Computers are an excellent tool for learning. They allow children and adults to access a wealth of information about far - off places and various topics. Professors, historians, and other educated individuals share their discoveries and knowledge every day. This means that anyone with a computer has the opportunity to learn something new every day. The computer is the best platform for people to share the information they've learned, creating endless learning possibilities. For example, when I conduct research on historical figures, I often discover things I never learned in school.  Computers also play a crucial role in maintaining relationships. They enable family and friends to stay in touch, even if they are in different locations. Without computers, it would be difficult to communicate efficiently with family members who have moved away. We can send emails to their computers or cell phones. I regularly video - chat with my brother in @LOCATION1. If there were no computers, I wouldn't be able to have these daily conversations with him.  Finally, computers offer a form of entertainment on days when we can't go outside. Some software allows people to create and share games online. On rainy days, I play video games on my computer. These games not only keep me company but also offer educational value. Some games teach us about history.  In conclusion, computers are an indispensable part of our lives. They enhance our learning, help us stay connected with loved ones, and provide entertainment. Their benefits to society and the world are undeniable.
1141	1144	1	2	"Dear @LOCATION4 @ORGANIZATION2, while computers are an excellent invention, there is a growing sentiment of dislike towards them. However, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. Firstly, they are a wonderful source of entertainment for children. Moreover, people can acquire a wealth of interesting knowledge. Finally, they serve as an outstanding means of communication with friends and family.  Playing games on a computer can be highly enjoyable. Additionally, it is a cost - effective option. For example, purchasing a game system could cost over @MONEY1, but one can find and play numerous games for free on a computer. These games are not limited to titles like ""@CAPS2 of @CAPS3"" or ""@CAPS2 of @CAPS5""; there are also sports - themed games. Consider a student who has broken their leg but loves playing soccer. They can still enjoy a soccer game on the computer.  Computers are also a great tool for learning. They were primarily designed for knowledge acquisition. No one in the @CAPS2 knows everything, but if people share their knowledge on the computer, others can learn anything. I recall @CAPS6 when my friend mentioned a person named @PERSON2. I had no idea who he was, and my friend laughed at me. When I got home, I searched for him on the computer and ended up knowing more about @PERSON2 than my friend. In class, when the teacher can't answer a question, they often tell us to either ""@CAPS7"" or ""@CAPS8"" it, which are both search engines.  Communication is another significant advantage of computers. Imagine if @PERSON1 had not invented the telephone; our lives would be very different. Nowadays, most people use computers to communicate. Whether it's @CAPS9, @CAPS10, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS11, they are all excellent communication methods. Making international calls via telephone incurs costs, but using a computer for communication is completely free. You can live in @LOCATION1 and chat with someone in @LOCATION5, or live in @LOCATION2 and email someone in @LOCATION3. With a computer, communication is fast and easy everywhere. My entire family lives in @LOCATION6, and making a call there is very expensive. When we use the computer, it's even better as they can see our faces through the webcam.  In conclusion, computers are far from negative. They bring joy to children through games, teach both children and adults new things, and offer a great way to communicate. I hope these reasons can be published in the local paper so that everyone can recognize the positive effects of computers."
1142	1145	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, did you know that over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 own computers? Computers, one of the greatest technological achievements, are rapidly spreading across the nation and the world. In my opinion, computers have a positive influence on people. They enhance hand - eye coordination, enable efficient learning and research, and provide various online chatting options.  Regarding hand - eye coordination, if you've ever struggled to hit a ball in a baseball game, it might be time to work on this skill. Studies have shown that @PERCENT2 of computer users have improved hand - eye coordination during sports or games. So, using a computer could help you hit homeruns instead of striking out.  When it comes to homework, computers are extremely useful. Suppose your teacher assigns a project due the next day. Instead of panicking, simply go online. Computers facilitate learning and research much faster than going to the library. For example, if you need to know the birth date of the Olympic gold medalist @PERSON1, you can quickly find the answer by googling it. After gathering the information, all you need to do is cite your source.  Once your homework is done and you want to discuss your plans for @DATE1 with a friend, computers offer a multitude of online chatting platforms such as @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, woVoo, @CAPS7, etc. Signing into @CAPS7 allows you to chat with your best friend and relieve boredom.  In conclusion, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives. They are ubiquitous and are changing society for the better. They improve hand - eye coordination, assist in research and learning, and enable communication with friends. If you don't have a computer yet, I strongly recommend getting one.
1143	1146	1	2	@ORGANIZATION1, in my view, computers are highly beneficial as they can provide us humans with a vast amount of information. Although some people claim that computers are overused at times, they play a crucial role in helping the world connect with relatives and friends across the globe, find jobs in different regions, and learn about the world.  Firstly, not all families and friends live close to each other. Some may live on the other side of the world. Webcams and online chatting on computers are essential in such cases. While cell phones are an option, not everyone can afford them. People can visit the nearest library and use the computers there for free to stay in touch with their loved ones.  Secondly, when one loses their job, they cannot simply stay at home and expect to live for free. They need to find a new job. With a computer, one can sign up for jobs directly, which is much more convenient than borrowing a car to go for an interview.  Finally, learning about the world is important for both the young and the old. Teachers also rely on computers to look up information on various subjects. For instance, I'm interested in learning about crocodiles in @LOCATION1, but I live in the @ORGANIZATION2. It's not practical for me to travel all the way to @LOCATION1 to learn about them when I can access a wealth of information by turning on the computer.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers should be allowed to do what they do best: helping humans. They are one of the greatest inventions ever made. Don't you agree?
1144	1147	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1 staff, the question of whether computers are regularly helpful is an important one. Computers are highly useful machines that boost daily productivity. They not only assist people in exploring @ORGANIZATION1 places and learning more about different parts of the world but also enable global communication.  In terms of learning, many teachers and students use computers daily in the educational process. There are numerous online websites that aid students in discovering and understanding various areas around the world. For example, the @LOCATION1 website (www.canadamaps.org) has a map - matching activity for students. Additionally, websites like mapquest and yellowpages help people navigate both across the country and in their local areas. Clearly, computers have a positive impact on students' education and our daily lives.  A large number of teenagers of all ages are fond of using a computer program called @CAPS1, which stands for @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This program enables people of all ages to communicate instantly with friends or colleagues. One simply types in a chat box, and the message is sent immediately.  Emailing is also widely used. It can be used to catch up with friends or discuss matters. One can attach documents, which often consist of important information. Emailing speeds up the process and makes work on the computer more efficient. If a newspaper were written by hand, it would be extremely time - consuming, require many people, a large amount of paper, and a significant amount of money.  In conclusion, computers are a necessity. They have a profound impact on our lives in ways that are not always obvious. They facilitate learning about different places in the world, help us communicate with others, and allow us to carry out work, stay connected with family and friends, and process documents easily. We should not spend all our time on the computer but use it to meet our needs. So, stop writing on paper and start using your computer!
1145	1148	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, there is a lot of debate about whether computers are helpful or harmful. In my opinion, computers are extremely helpful as they allow us to learn new things, communicate with people worldwide, and try new experiences.  For example, if you've ever wondered about the capital of @LOCATION6, you can find the answer in an instant using the internet. The internet is a vast source of information with various news sources and blogs, enabling us to stay informed about what's happening in the world. I clearly remember learning about the earthquake in @LOCATION4 on the internet. You can also find directions, sports statistics, and information about different places. There's no better way to learn about a place than talking to people who live there. For instance, is it better to read about @LOCATION5 or talk to someone from @LOCATION5? The internet has the wonderful ability to bring the world closer together. I recall chatting with people from @LOCATION3 during the gold medal game @PERSON3.  Some may argue that you can meet people from different countries in person. However, it's not easy to meet someone from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. With the internet, it becomes possible to communicate with them.  The internet also allows you to try new things. If you've ever wanted to go to @PERSON4, all you need is a credit card, and you could be there the next day. You can also try new hobbies. For example, if you've always wanted to try ping - pong, you can order a set online and have it delivered in a few days. I wanted to go to a zoo but didn't know where to find one. Using the internet, I quickly found results for @PERSON2 zoo near @LOCATION1.  Although the internet can have inappropriate content, with proper filtering of unnecessary sites, it can do almost anything. In conclusion, when used correctly, the internet is incredibly helpful to people.
1146	1149	1	2	Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I firmly believe that computers, as remarkable technological devices, play a significant role in our lives for three primary reasons: pleasure, convenience, and education.  In terms of pleasure, computers offer a wide array of entertainment options. On various websites, users can engage in conversations with friends, keep track of their friends' activities, and even have video chats. Moreover, one can watch movies, @CAPS4 episodes, and videos, listen to music, play games, and check sports scores. Undoubtedly, pleasure is one of the main motivations for people to use computers today.  Convenience is another compelling reason. Most households in @LOCATION1 are equipped with computers. They simplify daily tasks such as paying bills online and emailing co - workers about work. Additionally, computers assist individuals in creating websites to enhance the visibility of their businesses. It is evident that computers are an extremely convenient piece of technology.  Education is perhaps the most crucial factor. With a computer, one can acquire knowledge on almost any subject. Whether it's learning about @CAPS5 history, sports, or current world events, computers are invaluable. They can aid in studying, note - taking, and homework completion. For instance, when I have a project, I always rely on the computer to gather essential information on the topic.  In conclusion, computers are of great importance in @LOCATION1 in terms of education, pleasure, and convenience. I hope my perspective on computers is well - received, and I encourage you to continue spreading the message about the significance and greatness of computers.
1147	1150	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I am deeply concerned that people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers. In today's digital age, computers enable us to perform a wide range of tasks, from chatting with friends and playing games to controlling home appliances. However, this over - reliance on computers is taking a toll on our lives.  One of the most significant drawbacks is the negative impact on communication skills. According to studies, one out of every @NUM1 teens spends more time communicating with others online than in person. This form of communication hinders children from developing valuable social skills that come from face - to - face conversations. As a result, it becomes increasingly difficult for them to make friends and succeed in work - related interactions. Moreover, with each new generation, communication skills are declining by @PERCENT2. If this trend continues, we may face a future where social interaction is severely impaired.  Another concerning issue is the rise of cyberbullying, a new form of bullying that has emerged due to online communication. Additionally, excessive computer use leads to a sedentary lifestyle. People waste over @NUM2 days a year sitting in front of their computers, time that could be spent exercising or enjoying the outdoors. The percentage of computer users is much higher than that of those who engage in regular physical activity. Physical exercise is essential for our health, and sitting in front of a computer all day does nothing to improve our well - being. In fact, @PERCENT1 of people who use computers at home are more likely to get sick compared to those who spend time outside.  Furthermore, computers prevent us from truly appreciating nature. While we can view images of natural scenery online, it is no substitute for the real experience. Discoveries about new species and environmental awareness cannot be achieved through a computer screen.  Personally, I have realized that I am becoming increasingly dependent on computers. I see friends less often, go outside less, and exercise less. This is a common problem for most people, whether they are aware of it or not.  In conclusion, computers have a negative influence on human beings. We should reduce our computer use and engage in more meaningful activities to improve our lives and well - being. Thank you for your time.
1148	1151	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I am writing to express my positive view on the increasing use of computers. I believe it is a great trend for several reasons.  Firstly, computers are excellent tools for teaching hand - eye coordination. For example, there are programs that train users to type using all their fingers without looking at the keyboard. This skill not only improves typing speed but also enhances overall dexterity.  Secondly, computers provide people with the opportunity to learn about far - away places and people. When working on a school project about another country, one can use a computer to gather detailed information about its religions, culture, and general characteristics. Additionally, one can explore different types of people, from historical figures like @PERSON1 to contemporary leaders such as @PERSON2.  Finally, computers facilitate online communication. By creating accounts on platforms like Facebook, MySpace, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2, people can connect with others. It is even possible to get to know neighbors one has never met before.  I conducted a small survey among new computer users, and @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people said they were satisfied with their computer experience. In conclusion, the increasing use of computers is a positive development. They offer the chance to learn hand - eye coordination, gain knowledge about the world, and communicate with others. I encourage you to get a computer and experience its benefits for yourself. Thank you.
1149	1152	1	2	Imagine winning an all - expense paid trip to @LOCATION1 in a raffle at your child's school. At first, you're overjoyed, but then you realize you know nothing about the place. You're unsure about the weather, the local cuisine, and how to prepare for the trip. Fortunately, with the help of a computer, you can research everything you need to know. You pack appropriately and have a wonderful time on your trip.  Computers are incredibly valuable tools that can enhance education regardless of age. They also enable us to stay connected with friends and family and are essential for many jobs.  In the realm of education, computers have opened up a world of knowledge. They allow us to learn about different countries and cultures, giving us a deeper understanding of the world than ever before. Moreover, computers can teach us new languages and help us better understand complex science lessons. There are numerous online colleges where busy individuals can learn at their own pace.  The internet is an excellent way to maintain relationships with friends and family. We can use email, instant messaging, video chatting, or social media platforms like Facebook or MySpace. For example, my cousin has been in the navy for @NUM1 years. Before I joined Facebook, we lost touch, but now we communicate regularly.  When people think of computers, they often focus on the internet. However, computers have many other practical applications. Many jobs today rely on computers, including those in banks, @CAPS1, teaching, @CAPS2, and cashier positions. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 jobs require computer skills. Computers help us create professional - looking documents, such as book reports and important letters.  In conclusion, computers have transformed our world, and their influence is irreversible. They made that trip to @LOCATION1 easier and have become an integral part of our daily lives. We can use them to stay connected, advance our careers, and most importantly, learn a vast amount of knowledge.
1150	1153	1	2	Dear Newspaper, While technological advancements are remarkable, they do not always have a positive impact on society. In my opinion, computers do not bring benefits to my community for several reasons.  Firstly, computers can be extremely dangerous. Just as our parents tell us not to talk to strangers when we go out, the same caution should be exercised when using a computer. Online predators often present themselves as someone they are not, making it difficult to trust people we meet in chat rooms. Cyberbullying is also a significant problem associated with computer use. Moreover, once something is posted on the internet, it can be accessed by almost anyone, including pictures, blogs, and comments. This lack of privacy poses a real threat.  Secondly, people, especially the younger generation, spend an excessive amount of time on computers. Instead of engaging in activities that are beneficial to their physical and mental health, they waste hours in front of the screen. If people dedicated as much time to helping their community as they do to using computers, the world would be a better place, and it would also strengthen social bonds. Computers seem to control people's lives, which is not a healthy situation.  Lastly, computers are a financial burden. In @DATE1's economy, people need to save money for important things like college or basic necessities. The rapid pace of technological advancement means that even high - tech computers become obsolete within a year or two, and new ones are required. Additionally, computer prices are constantly rising, making it difficult to keep up.  In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on communities across @LOCATION1. They are dangerous, time - consuming, and expensive. We should reduce our reliance on computers and focus on more meaningful and beneficial activities to improve our lives and society.
1151	1154	1	2	Dear Readers, I am aware that some believe computers can have a negative impact on people's lives. This is because it may lead to a lack of outdoor exercise and appreciation of nature. However, in my view, individuals have the option to go outside, engage in physical activity, and enjoy the natural world. Computers offer a vast amount of information that can inspire people to participate in various outdoor activities. They also enable the downloading of videos and software for exercise, allowing people to learn new techniques. In my own life, my parents and other family members often browse online to discover weekend and seasonal activities. Computers are highly significant and have the potential to transform lives. Without them, some individuals would be unable to access an education. Doctors, police officers, and banks rely on computers in their work, which simplifies our daily lives. From my perspective, computers have a positive influence on our lives. While they can have negative aspects, it ultimately depends on self - control and how they are used.
1152	1155	1	2	Computers are advancing rapidly, and almost everyone either owns or has owned one. In my opinion, they bring great benefits to society. Firstly, they enhance hand - eye coordination. Even when you're playing games, your hand - eye coordination is improving. This skill is essential for sports like baseball, hockey, and I personally use it most when playing these two sports. So, the next time you're on a computer, remember that your hand - eye coordination is getting better. Secondly, computers help us learn about distant places. If you want to know about a far - off location you may or may not be able to visit, you can use a computer to gain background knowledge. For instance, if you have to travel to a place for business and know nothing about it, simply use a computer to do some research. If you're flying to @LOCATION1 and have no idea about it, use a laptop on the way to gather some information. Thirdly, computers are excellent for learning new languages. If you need to learn Spanish in a few weeks, you can download a free language - learning app. If you lack a French dictionary and need a few words, use a translator. When communicating with someone from @LOCATION1 whose language you don't know, use an English - to - African dictionary translation app on your computer. These free translation applications are very useful. In conclusion, computers are used daily and greatly assist us, whether it's learning a new language or just chatting with friends.
1153	1156	1	2	"To the editor of the daily newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on people of all ages. Nowadays, computers are overused for privileges we already possess. When people use computers for random activities, they neglect physical exercise. Moreover, while email and social media platforms like Facebook are good for communication, people often check their emails constantly instead of paying attention to their parents returning home after a long day at work. As a result, kids get distracted and forget to do their homework. Although computers are a great invention, in today's society, there are numerous issues that are not always addressed. Firstly, people fail to get the necessary exercise because they are either playing on the computer or video - chatting with friends. Approximately @NUM1 of Americans are obese, so exercise should be a top priority. However, the new websites and activities on computers are holding people back. Additionally, both kids and adults engage in high - end communication methods on computers that waste a lot of time. There are many unnecessary activities on computers, which make people think these options and web pages are important, leading to a lack of exercise. Indeed, computers are a necessary technology, but people are abusing it by living their entire lives in the virtual world instead of focusing on other things like exercise and maintaining good health. Secondly, computers take time away from family. For example, @TIME1 when my dad came home from a long day at work, he didn't get the warm hug he was longing for because everyone was engrossed in their emails or what was happening on Facebook. Family is the most important part of life, and if computers are interfering, computer usage must be regulated. Which is more important to you, family or computers? I understand that you still interact with your family, but chatting with your sister on Facebook when she's just in the next room is clearly not the best way. Computers affect you and those around you in more ways than you might think. Finally, computers also affect schoolwork and work. Most kids spend too much time on the computer and neglect their homework. This is unacceptable. Kids and teenagers are constantly playing games, using social media, and video - chatting, often realizing too late that they need to start their schoolwork. A girl from @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS1 time I spent the whole afternoon on Facebook and then remembered I hadn't started my @CAPS2 essay!"" This has happened to many people because computers are extremely distracting. Yesterday, I spent @NUM2 hours video - chatting with a friend and didn't start my homework until @NUM3. In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on people. They prevent people from exercising, take time away from family, and disrupt schoolwork and work. Computer use definitely needs to be adjusted."
1154	1157	1	2	In my opinion, computers are a valuable source of information, communication, and business. They simplify many aspects of our lives. For example, instead of going to the library to look for information, you can use a computer. As one of the most advanced technologies, computers allow you to search for anything in the world. They are also extremely helpful for school projects or work - related tasks. In some jobs, the use of computers is mandatory. Computers are great for learning about things you've never heard of, and some people even take online classes. They can also assist in planning a vacation. Moreover, computers are commonly used to communicate with family and friends. If you own a computer, you probably have an email, a homepage, or other means to keep in touch. There are even websites for meeting new people. I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They can be used for a wide range of purposes and are an excellent technological resource. They can save you a lot of time. For instance, if you have a @NUM1 - page essay due tomorrow, it's much easier and faster to type it on a computer than to write it by hand and risk making mistakes. When typing a letter or a paper, computers have features like spell - checking, which can show you where you've made errors, thus saving you time. In conclusion, computers are an indispensable part of our daily lives and bring numerous benefits.
1155	1158	1	2	Dear newspaper, I believe there are multiple reasons why computers are beneficial for people. First, they help keep friends connected. If you move to another town, attend a distant college, or relocate for work, you may lose touch with your friends. However, computers can solve this problem. On social networking sites such as @CAPS3, Twitter, and MySpace, you can easily find your old friends and stay in contact. You can catch up, reminisce about good times, and even plan to meet. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have been reconnected through social networking on computers. Experts claim that staying connected with your past is important for your well - being and happiness. I once had a similar experience. When I was young, I had a @CAPS2 whose grandmother lived near my dad. After over a year of friendship, he moved to @LOCATION1, and I thought I'd never hear from him again. Later that year, I also moved to a different town. Then, he searched for me on @CAPS3, and we reconnected. I found out he'd moved back to my old neighborhood. Second, computers are great sources of knowledge. If you need to find information without going through the hassle of searching in books, a computer is the ideal tool. As long as you can find an accurate and reliable source, a computer can provide an amazing amount of information. Statistics show that you can find @PERCENT2 more information on a computer than in a book. Experts predict that books will soon become obsolete, and computers will dominate as knowledge sources. Third, there are many team - based programs on computers that help people develop teamwork and team - building skills. In conclusion, computers are beneficial for people as they help reconnect friends, serve as knowledge sources, and promote teamwork skills, having a positive impact on our lives.
1156	1159	1	2	In an era where computers have become ubiquitous, their impact on society has sparked intense debate. A study by @ORGANIZATION1 reveals that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 individuals spend over @NUM3 hours daily on computers. @PERSON1 remarks, “With the soaring popularity of computers, we've witnessed a surge in social problems, health issues, and pollution.” This prompts the crucial question: Do computers truly benefit society, or do they exert a negative influence on people? I firmly believe the latter to be true. Firstly, computers are keeping people indoors, robbing them of the opportunity to enjoy nature. Picture the enchanting scene of sitting outdoors under the radiant fall sun, watching red, yellow, and green leaves dance in the breeze. But how can one appreciate such beauty when their eyes are glued to a computer screen? A survey by the national nature @CAPS3 shows that eight out of ten @CAPS2 admit to staying indoors on sunny days to play on the computer. Dr @PERSON2 states, “The more people who witness nature's beauty, the less likely they are to pollute it.” If people can't even turn off the computer for @NUM4 hours a day to explore the world, how can our country remain clean? Clearly, computers prevent people from seeing the beauty of nature. Secondly, computers consume so much of people's time that they neglect their families. I once thought chatting online was sufficient, but I've since realized that face - to - face conversations are far more meaningful. I recall meeting a girl who preferred email, texting, or instant messaging over real - life conversations. Statistics show that 79% of families break up due to social problems. Successful and intelligent people understand that communication is the key to happiness and advocate reducing computer use. Lastly, excessive computer use leads to a lack of exercise. Teenagers should exercise for an hour every day, yet @NUM5 out of @NUM2 teens at @ORGANIZATION2 admit they don't meet this requirement. Since @DATE1, when computers were less prevalent, there has been a @PERCENT1 increase in childhood obesity. At @ORGANIZATION2, nearly @NUM4/2 of boys in @NUM8 grade admit to spending too much time on computers. Computers are clearly taking away the time that should be dedicated to exercise. In conclusion, it's evident that computers have a negative impact on people. Our environment is suffering because people are too engrossed in computers to appreciate its beauty. Families are drifting apart, and people are becoming less active. We should take a stand against excessive computer use. It's the best decision we can make for our well - being and the future of our society.
1157	1160	1	2	I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. There are several compelling reasons to support this view. Firstly, computers are a vast source of knowledge. If you want to learn about a country's culture, you can easily find the information on the computer. Without it, you might have to visit a place without prior knowledge, such as not knowing the appropriate treatment for local illnesses. Moreover, the computer can teach you how to navigate from one place to another without the need to stop and ask for directions. It's essential to have access to information, and the computer allows you to look up and discover what you need. Secondly, computers enable you to reconnect with long - lost family members. Reconnecting with loved ones is of great significance. Imagine if something happened to a family member, like a broken leg or hip, and you were unaware because you couldn't find them. Many people, especially during @MONTH1, miss their families and long to be close to them or have a conversation. With the computer, you can find them, and they can also reach out to you when they need to talk. Thirdly, the computer is an excellent tool for communicating with friends. Whether in a chat room with multiple friends or having a one - on - one conversation, it's a great way to stay in touch, especially if you've moved far away. Talking to friends can relieve stress for some kids. A good friend can make you laugh, talk you out of doing bad things, and help you relax. Lastly, computers are necessary for loading music onto @NUM1 players, @CAPS1, and other devices. Music is a source of joy for many people. Without computers, there would be little point in buying many electronic devices as they often rely on computers to function. People enjoy listening to music on their @CAPS1 or @NUM1 while exercising, and the computer is the means to make this possible. In conclusion, considering all these aspects, it's clear that computers have a positive effect on people. They enhance our knowledge, strengthen our relationships, and add to our entertainment options.
1158	1161	1	2	In today's world, computers have become an integral part of people's lives across all age groups. They offer numerous benefits in various aspects. For students at @ORGANIZATION1, computers are invaluable for academic work. Teachers often struggle to read students' handwriting, so using a computer to print out neat papers is extremely helpful. The local library always has extra computers available for students to complete their projects. Many of these projects involve writing papers, and the computer provides multiple ways to do so. When it comes to socializing, teenagers are often found on '@CAPS2', a website that allows them to communicate with friends and relatives. Some relatives may live far away or not have access to a phone, making this platform a great alternative. While some people think '@CAPS2' is unproductive and takes time away from homework, it can also be useful. For instance, if a @CAPS3 forgets to write down the homework, they can log on to '@CAPS2' and chat with a classmate from @ORGANIZATION1 to get the assignment. Computers also offer powerful search engines like '@CAPS4 pile', '@CAPS5', and the popular '@ORGANIZATION2'. People use these search engines for a variety of purposes, such as researching for papers, planning trips, or obtaining random information. For example, many people want to visit @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1 for @CAPS6 but are unsure what to do there. By using a search engine, they can find out that in @LOCATION1, they can visit the @LOCATION1 zoo, and in @LOCATION2, they can go to @CAPS7 world or the @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 to learn about @CAPS11. In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in education, socializing, and information - gathering. They provide solutions to many problems and enhance people's lives in multiple ways. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope you'll consider the points I've made.
1159	1162	1	2	Dear Local @CAPS1 Newspaper, while I understand why some people think computers and technology are bad for society, I firmly disagree with this view. In my opinion, technology, especially computers, can bring people together and offer significant benefits to @CAPS5. They can also save time and money. Computers are excellent for bringing people together. I had a dear friend who moved across the country to @LOCATION1. Without the ability to video - chat on my laptop, we would likely have lost touch. Similarly, my grandmother, due to her age, can't always join the whole family for Passover. Through video - chatting, she can still be part of the celebration and see everyone together. It's truly a wonderful experience. Computers are also beneficial for @CAPS5. As a student at @ORGANIZATION1, I sometimes forget to write down assignments. Thankfully, I can use my laptop to access @ORGANIZATION1 notes.com. Without this, I would have received a zero on my homework. This clearly shows the educational value of computers. In addition, computers save time and money. In today's busy world, many people don't have the time to go out and buy things. With the computer, they can order a wide range of items, from food to clothes and toys. Surveys indicate that over @PERCENT1 of average @CAPS4 order online, saving on gas as they don't need to drive. Overall, computers are handy and helpful for people of all ages. They assist @CAPS5 with homework, help maintain relationships with family and friends, and are a great resource for busy adults. I believe that as time goes on, more and more people will recognize the many advantages of computers.
1160	1163	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I am firmly convinced that computers have a positive impact on people. They play a vital role in reconnecting far - away friends and family, discovering amazing nature parks, and finding local @CAPS8 and exercise equipment. Computers are a powerful tool for connecting with loved ones. A recent study shows that @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 citizens have communicated with friends or family living across the country via the internet. A survey by The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine indicates that the computer is the best means to stay in touch with loved ones. @CAPS9 friend @PERSON3 is @CAPS4, and his cousins live in @LOCATION4. @CAPS6 said, “Without the computer, they would be like ghosts to me.” Clearly, the computer is essential for reconnecting with far - flung friends and family. For nature lovers, the computer is a game - changer. Imagine if you love nature but can't find any new and exciting parks. Fortunately, a simple search on a search engine can yield fantastic results in seconds. Some think the computer takes away time from enjoying nature, but I believe it enhances it. @CAPS9 sister, who loves nature photography, lost interest over time because she was tired of photographing the same local scenes. After I searched for nature parks on the internet, she is now traveling all over @LOCATION2 again. Nature expert Lean @PERSON2 says that @PERCENT2 of people lose interest in nature because they don't know new places to visit. A @CAPS7 magazine also concludes that the internet is the best way to find nature. Without the internet, few people would have the same passion for nature as they do today. In the fight against obesity in @LOCATION3, computers are crucial. Everyone needs exercise, and currently, there is a need to enroll more @CAPS8 and create more exercise equipment. According to @PERSON1, @PERCENT3 of @CAPS8 have websites accessible via the computer. @CAPS8 @NUM1 @LOCATION5 magazine states that creating an online website is the best way to attract members. @CAPS9 friend's dad found a new gym that opened recently through an online search. In conclusion, the computer's ability to reconnect friends and family, reignite the love for nature, and promote exercise is undeniable. If these positive effects are considered bad, then it's hard to define what good truly is. The computer has become an indispensable part of our lives, enhancing our relationships, our connection with nature, and our physical well - being.
1161	1164	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I am well - aware of the ongoing debate regarding technology, specifically computers. Computers are a valuable, interesting, and even enjoyable piece of technology. They open up the world to new people and places, and limiting their use is unjustified. Computers are the keys to innovation and creation. A study by @ORGANIZATION1 on computer usage revealed that @PERCENT1 of people get their news, files, and even plan through the computer. Currently, @PERCENT2 of creations are being accomplished via the computer. This clearly demonstrates the power of computers, enabling people to do what was once impossible. Now, humans can spread information across the world in seconds. Computers also contribute to business growth through advertising and work software. They are essential for unlocking new possibilities and options that were unthinkable @NUM1 years ago. I understand that my opposition not only opposes computers but also aims to restrict their use. This is unfair and potentially unconstitutional. They claim that people exercise less due to computers. However, when asked if computers had a negative impact on their exercise, @PERCENT3 of people said “no.” One man stated, “Because of computers, I learned new workouts and even found a great local trainer.” @CAPS2, you should recognize that computers are not just for games and toys. They allow people to grow, learn, discover travel destinations, and assist in exercise. Computers are an excellent communication tool. Emails, @CAPS3, and other software enable people to communicate globally. In an innovative world, communication is crucial. People can spread news in seconds, and in fact, @PERCENT4 of news is now disseminated through the computer. Media outlets like New @CAPS4 times and the Wall Street @CAPS5 have mainly shifted their news to the internet, making it accessible to people worldwide. Work is also predominantly done on computers. People can send files, ship, and even order online. Important business meetings can be held via computer, allowing participants to attend from home. Computers are indispensable for communication, work, and news. I hope you consider my opinion. Computers are necessary for a world that solves problems, communicates effectively, and expands. Therefore, I believe there are no problems with computers.
1162	1165	1	2	Dear @PERSON1 @CAPS1, I'm writing to tell you that I think computers are a smart investment for several reasons. Computers benefit society in multiple ways. They help children with homework. When kids are bored, they can play games or listen to music on the computer. Once, I was sitting at the kitchen table trying to do my history homework. I didn't know the year of the Revolutionary War. So, I went to my room, turned on the computer, and used Google to find the answer. This is also helpful for parents. When they're doing the bills or other tasks, they won't be bothered as kids can look up information on their own. After finishing my homework, with the computer still on, I'd check who's online to talk to and make sure I didn't miss any assignments. Talking to friends online helps stay in touch with those in other states or people we don't see often. It can help make new friends and strengthen existing friendships, reducing potential problems. If no one is home or online, I might listen to some music and take a nap. Or I could play the new Counter - Strike game I got. I had the least number of deaths on my team in that game! But after a while, I'd turn on some music and lie in bed. Now that I've told you about the benefits of computers, you should keep in mind that they can assist with homework, communication with friends, and provide entertainment.
1163	1166	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, while computers can be helpful on occasion, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people believe they are a waste of electricity. Overall, computers are not beneficial to everyday life. When people use computers, they often spend multiple hours on them. This leads to less exercise and can harm their bodies. Moreover, people tend to use computers obsessively, devoting more attention to the machine than to their families. Everyone knows that exercise is important. In the @LOCATION1, heart disease is the leading cause of death, and it is often caused by obesity, which can result from a lack of exercise. When using a computer, people sit rather than move around, slowing down their metabolism and burning fewer calories. This is unhealthy even for those in good physical condition. Using a computer also has an impact on the eyes. The bright @CAPS3 lights of the screen can cause problems. About @PERCENT1 of the kids at our school wear glasses because of excessive computer use, which is @PERCENT2 more than before. Previously, only about @NUM3 kids wore glasses. Family deserves more attention than a computer. A survey showed that, on average, @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people spend about eight hours on the computer (both at work and at home) and only about an hour with their families. The results are truly shocking. While computers are good for quick research, they also cause people to gain weight, make them spend money on glasses, and take them away from their families. In conclusion, at the end of the day, computers are not very helpful.
1164	1167	1	2	Have you ever wondered how the world would be without computers? I believe it would set us back several eras. We need computers for communication and learning. Without them, our country would be at a disadvantage. Some people claim that computers prevent us from getting enough exercise and enjoying nature. However, computers can also help with these aspects. Communication is one of the greatest advantages of computers. Teenagers love to @CAPS9 @CAPS10 with each other at home because it's as fast as face - to - face conversation. @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 is another popular tool. Company bosses use it to send @CAPS10 to employees, ensuring everyone is informed. There's also a new video - chat feature that allows face - to - face communication with people from the other side of the world. Computers are also a vast source of knowledge. There are dictionary, history, and encyclopedia websites. You can find detailed information about any historical period or use Wikipedia to look up specific objects or people. Schools use various educational websites to enhance students' knowledge, including math, English, @CAPS3 studies, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 for science. There are also numerous websites for learning new languages. The @CAPS6 @CAPS7 program on the computer can teach languages as effectively as a human teacher. Some still argue that it's not enough and that we need exercise, nature, and family time. But computers can assist with these too. You can search for workouts and nearby hiking trails. Websites like @CAPS8 allow you to @CAPS9 @CAPS10, share pictures, play games, and video - chat with family members, even those living far away. In addition to the reasons mentioned, computers teach hand - eye coordination and offer many other benefits. You can check sports scores from the past or the previous night. Computers have a positive impact on people, and everyone should have one.
1165	1168	1	2	Dear newspaper writer, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They help people learn different languages, communicate with friends worldwide, and make it easier to write and send letters to colleagues or bosses. Computers enable people to learn a new language without spending a fortune. Using Rosetta Stone costs @NUM1 US dollars, but online language learning is free. The slogan of Rosetta Stone, “I have spent less money than months of formal classes,” might be better replaced with “We have a better learning company than anyone else.” This shows how computers facilitate language learning. Computers also simplify communication with friends. You can use instant messaging, web - casting, and texting to stay in touch. The purpose of these tools is to save people from traveling long distances and spending money to share important news. Finally, computers make it easier to communicate with bosses. You can email your boss to inform them that you're faxing your final report for a new position interview. It's easier for your boss to read, and even if you're in Japan and your boss is in Florida, the message will reach their computer in about @NUM2 minutes. In conclusion, the three main reasons computers are positive are that they allow people to learn a new language for free, communicate with friends more easily, and send messages to bosses more efficiently than by calling. These reasons clearly demonstrate the positive impact of computers.
1166	1169	1	2	In response to the Middlebury paper's article on whether computers benefit society, I firmly believe they offer numerous advantages, making them indispensable in our schools, homes, and businesses. Their benefits far outweigh any potential drawbacks. Can you truly envision a life without email or staying informed about society? In schools, computers enhance children's learning. For instance, students can study math facts online in math classes or learn about the skeletal system in health classes. They also help save money. Instead of paying for a child to travel to a location like Rome to learn about the Colosseum, they can first explore it on the internet to determine if the trip is worthwhile. Moreover, computers are great for practicing hand - eye coordination through exercise games. This helps develop a skill that children will use throughout their lives. As technology advances, the educational benefits of computers will only increase, so restricting children's access to them is a grave error. Computers simplify communication. Students can receive homework via email, saving time. Instead of incurring high phone bills, tutors' fees, and cellphone costs, families can communicate through email and potentially save money. Keeping in touch with family members becomes effortless as a single email can update everyone. Some may blame computers for people not exercising, but individuals have control over their exercise habits. Computers do not dictate whether one exercises or spends time with family. In fact, they can bring people together. The decision to use computers lies with the user. When used judiciously, computers contribute significantly to society. Therefore, maintaining our current level of computer use is the best approach, as eliminating them would reduce communication and education, and there's no guarantee that exercise would increase.
1167	1170	1	2	It has come to my attention that some members of society believe computers are not beneficial. This view stems from a lack of judgment and a closed - minded perspective. In today's world, computers are as essential as oxygen to the body, and removing them would lead to severe consequences. Approximately [PERCENT1] of modern companies require their employees to use computers. They are not mere toys but are as crucial to the working class as a # [NUM1] pencil is to a student taking a test. For example, [PERSON3], the owner of a small business, states that his company designs software and relies heavily on computers. Many of his employees work from home and must own computers. Computers are not just for adults. Students also rely on them for homework. [PERSON4], an eighth - grader at [ORGANIZATION1], has at least three hours of homework each night, with about an hour typically requiring a computer. The computer reduces the time needed to complete her tasks, allowing her to quickly type essays or research science topics. In areas like [LOCATION1], computers are a gateway to the outside world. It is a somewhat isolated area, and computers help spread news and make residents aware of national and global issues. [PERSON2] recalls that when an earthquake occurred in [LOCATION3], their teacher projected the news on the whiteboard using a computer. Without computers, a vital source of knowledge would be cut off from both adults and children. Most importantly, computers facilitate communication between friends and family. [PERSON1], a senior at [ORGANIZATION1], will be going to college in [LOCATION2] next year. She plans to stay in touch with her family via email and other computer applications. A study shows that [NUM1] out of [NUM2] families in [LOCATION2] have relatives living far away. Without computers, these families would face difficulties in maintaining relationships. In conclusion, computers are an invaluable asset. They are essential for work, education, spreading knowledge, and communication. Eliminating them would cause chaos and disrupt the lives of people in various aspects. Therefore, we should recognize their importance and continue to embrace and advance this technology.
1168	1171	1	2	There's a debate about whether we should have and advance computers. I firmly believe that computers are a necessity for the average person. They make life easier for everyone. Sure, there are cellphones and other electronics, but they aren't always reliable. Computers, on the other hand, are always trustworthy, whether for homework or other tasks. They enable easy interaction, aid in learning, and can be safe if used wisely. Computers allow us to communicate with people across the globe. There are various applications to choose from, and they're all user - friendly. I prefer [ORGANIZATION2] email. I have family in [LOCATION1], a whole continent away. Calling them would result in a huge phone bill. A recent study shows that [NUM1] out of [NUM2] families in [LOCATION2] have relatives far away, which is [PERCENT1] of the population. Without computers, these families would struggle to maintain relationships, and phone companies would profit at the expense of regular families. Computers also make learning and task - completion easier. As a student at [PERSON1], I and my classmates need to type homework at least three times a week. Just yesterday, I had multiple writing tasks. Using a typewriter would make homework nearly impossible or lead to a lack of sleep. Additionally, computers are great for research. We can learn about new countries, colleges, and the world without leaving home. They're also an environmentally friendly alternative to newspapers. Some think computers are unsafe, but if we're educated about the risks, as most students are in school, this isn't always the case. Nine out of ten students rate computers an A+ in terms of safety. My parents and I have never had any safety issues using computers for over thirty years. In conclusion, computers are the best option for communication, learning, and interacting with others. They help us stay connected with loved ones, make education more manageable, and can be used safely. So, we should support their continued use and advancement.
1169	1172	1	2	There's a growing use of computers, yet not everyone believes it benefits society. I side with those who think computers don't benefit society, and here's why. People who spend excessive time on the computer need to exercise more. Regular exercise is crucial for maintaining good health and strength. Those who neglect exercise are likely to overeat and gain unwanted weight. Some of them don't exercise at all. Moreover, computer - obsessed individuals interact less with their family and friends. This often leads to arguments with family members when they're asked to get off the computer. After an argument, they may retreat back to the computer, creating an unhealthy cycle. Spending long hours on the computer is not a healthy behavior. Finally, people should enjoy life. They should experience the world with their own eyes, have parties with family and friends, and pursue meaningful activities in college and beyond. They need to appreciate life in its original form, without relying too much on computers, iPods, or cellphones. In conclusion, my stance is based on the need for people to exercise more, interact with their loved ones, and enjoy life. I hope this explanation helps you understand my perspective.
1170	1173	1	2	I believe that computers are highly beneficial to society. They assist in tasks such as research, communication, and offer a source of entertainment through games and websites. Computers are like digital encyclopedias, containing almost all the information one might need. For research, there are databases and websites designed to provide accurate and useful data. For example, if you have an essay due tomorrow and need quick and valid information, you can simply access a computer database like [CAPS3] [CAPS4]. This saves time and effort compared to traditional research methods. Communication is another area where computers excel. Email and [ORGANIZATION1] are popular means of communication. Email allows you to send a message and wait for a reply, while [ORGANIZATION1] offers instant responses. Video - chatting is the latest trend, enabling people to see and hear each other in real - time. This is especially useful for families living far apart. Computers also serve as a source of entertainment. The web has numerous gaming websites such as [CAPS6].com, miniclips.com, and [LOCATION1]. These websites can help relieve stress after a bad day. You can also purchase computer games, like The [CAPS7], which allows you to create a character and immerse yourself in a virtual world, helping you forget about stress. In conclusion, computers enhance society in multiple ways, including research, communication, and entertainment. They are a powerful tool that enriches our lives. They take on difficult tasks and usually succeed, making them an essential part of our daily lives.
1171	1174	1	2	"Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2, are you aware that prolonged use of technology can potentially lead to cancer? Since their invention, computers have advanced significantly over the years. People, especially children, often overlook the risks technology poses to physical health, family and friends, and even mental well - being. In @LOCATION1, the obesity rate has reached an all - time high, yet many are unaware that technology may be a contributing factor. Did you know that the average @CAPS3 teenager spends at least @NUM1 hours on computers? Without exercise, calories accumulate, putting individuals at risk of diabetes. Diabetes is one of the most common health issues associated with technology, along with obesity. @NUM2 @CAPS4 are diabetic, indicating that our health is not in a safe state. If people limit their computer use to @NUM3 hour a day and exercise for at least @NUM4 minutes a day, they will enjoy better health, have more energy, enhanced mental focus, improved sleep, and a more attractive physical appearance. Computers can also damage friendships. Cyberbullying is a prevalent problem, with @NUM4 of students engaging in it. When people spend all day on the computer, they neglect real - life interactions, which harms their mental health. Additionally, some forms of cancer are caused by the radiation from technological devices. Radiation can damage the brain, leading to Alzheimer's and other mental diseases that typically appear in old age. Young adults in school have also become accustomed to texting. @PERCENT1 of students text, and @PERCENT2 develop poor spelling habits, with @PERCENT3 accidentally writing incorrect words like ""thru"" in school. This shows how technology is negatively affecting our mental faculties. Clearly, computers impact health, socialization, and mentality. Please, stop overusing technology and avoid being part of the problem."
1172	1175	1	2	"Dear people, computers have been around for a relatively short time, yet the number of users and usage frequency are increasing daily. While they are used for entertainment, education, and long - distance communication, they have had a negative impact on people. Initially, people enjoy using computers for activities such as browsing the @CAPS1, playing games, and working. However, over time, they can become addicted. The allure of games and the @CAPS1 is a major reason for this addiction. In fact, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 residents who own a @CAPS8 are addicted to computers, and this percentage is expected to rise to @PERCENT2 in the next @NUM1 years. Computer addiction can lead to severe consequences. Some people have died due to excessive computer use, neglecting to eat and sleep. A recent newspaper reported that a student at @ORGANIZATION1 dropped out of school because of poor academic performance. His parents discovered that he was addicted to the game ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4,"" which is currently the most popular game on the @CAPS8 in this @CAPS3. Studies suggest that @CAPS8 addiction is nearly as harmful as smoking addiction. Another negative aspect of @CAPS8 use is online bullying. People are bullied while chatting on @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and via email. A friend of mine recently received hurtful emails. Online bullying is more severe than in - person bullying because on the @CAPS8, the anonymity allows bullies to act without being easily identified. @PERSON1, a professor who has studied online bullying, stated that ""Online bullying has become more severe than face - to - face bullying. People are more threatened and exposed to more offensive language."" If people do not stop, online bullying and harassment will worsen, and individuals can even be arrested for their online content. Finally, excessive computer use leads to a sedentary lifestyle. Computers contribute about @PERCENT3 to the overweight population. With the convenience of the @CAPS8, people can perform various tasks without physical activity, such as emailing instead of mailing, listening to music without getting up, and shopping without leaving home. As a result, @PERCENT4 of computer users are overweight or obese. They also spend less time interacting with friends and family and enjoying nature. In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on people. Parents should regulate their children's computer use. If you suspect you are addicted, create a daily schedule, limit computer use to an hour at a time, and take breaks. Addiction, online bullying, and weight gain are just some of the problems associated with @CAPS8 use, and there are many more."
1173	1176	1	2	Dear newspaper, I believe that the increasing use of computers is wonderful. Computers are a remarkable technological advancement. They are used for entertainment, education, and communication, enabling people to connect with others regardless of distance. I love spending time on the computer, especially on @CAPS2, where I can chat with people. For example, some individuals use computers to communicate with family members living far away. I haven't seen my cousin in @LOCATION2 for @NUM1 years, but I can stay in touch with her online. Even my grandma has @CAPS3 and uses it to talk with her family. I think using the computer is not only a great way to stay in touch with loved ones but also offers other benefits. It can improve hand - eye coordination. My grandma, despite her age, has excellent hand - eye coordination because of her computer use. When she types, she presses the keys accurately. Computers also help people write better. For instance, I find that when I write on the computer, I don't need to rely on other tools, and it enhances my writing skills. Moreover, computers are a great resource for learning about distant places and people. On @ORGANIZATION1, you can find information about any street or person. If I have a project, I can easily find the necessary information on @ORGANIZATION1. The ability to access pictures and details about places and people makes computers extremely useful. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. They facilitate communication, improve physical skills, and enhance learning. Therefore, they are a great asset to society.
1174	1177	1	2	"I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on people, primarily because they lead to a decrease in physical activity. Allow me to explain my reasons. Firstly, excessive computer use reduces the time people spend exercising. When people stop exercising, they can become drowsy and lazy. As @PERSON1 said, ""People who exercise regularly are more capable of performing tasks, while those who don't may struggle."" Moreover, lack of exercise can affect one's ability to run or even stand. By choosing to stay on the computer instead of participating in physical activities, people miss out on the fun. Secondly, computers can erode knowledge. Spending too much time on the computer can cause people to forget what they have learned. They may also require tutoring because they cannot focus on their studies. In extreme cases, people may even forget the people they know and where they live. Finally, computer use takes time away from family and friends. Instead of interacting with loved ones, people are glued to their screens. In conclusion, the negative effects of computers on physical activity, knowledge, and social relationships are significant. We should be more mindful of our computer use to avoid these detrimental consequences."
1175	1178	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, as a student, I am convinced that computers have numerous negative effects on people. While many view computers as a helpful technological advancement, there is a darker side to their use. The cyber world is full of potential dangers. Although computers are useful for school research, work, and other important tasks, they also bring about many problems. Nowadays, kids are so attached to their computers after school that they often neglect their homework, projects, and assignments due to distraction. Some parents are deceived into thinking that their children are doing schoolwork when, in fact, the kids are meeting strangers on social networks such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 @NUM1, @CAPS6, and others. Meeting these strangers in person can lead to serious problems because not everyone is as nice as they seem online. This clearly shows the danger of excessive computer use for kids. Young children, pre - teens, and teenagers can access harmful and inappropriate content that is not suitable for their age. Another concern is the impact on physical health. People who spend all day on computers often consume junk food and do not exercise, leading to weight gain and poor physical fitness. This is a health issue for kids as young as @NUM2 and adults as old as @NUM3. Additionally, excessive computer use prevents people from going out, exploring new things, spending time with friends and family, and having fun. I strongly believe that computers or laptops should not be kept in kids' rooms. When kids lock themselves in their rooms with the computer, they often stay up late, which makes it difficult for them to get up for school or work. In conclusion, computers are not always beneficial. To use computers while maintaining a healthy lifestyle, people should create a schedule to limit their usage.
1176	1179	1	2	I firmly believe that excessive computer use can have detrimental effects on both one's health and relationships with friends and family. When engrossed in the digital world, individuals are likely to decline invitations to go outside or participate in family activities. For instance, if a friend asks to go out, a person glued to the computer is likely to say no, which not only harms their health but also strains the friendship. Similarly, when the family plans a movie night, the computer - bound individual may choose to stay home, negatively impacting family relationships. Moreover, most people prefer staying on the computer over working out. Prolonged computer use often leads to increased hunger, and without physical activity, weight gain becomes inevitable. The lack of exercise, combined with a mind constantly pre - occupied with the computer, can make a person more susceptible to illness. Another issue is sleep deprivation. When playing an engaging game, people may forgo sleep. Over time, this can lead to addiction and an inability to concentrate, especially if there are academic commitments. In conclusion, computers can disrupt health, social life, sleep patterns, and concentration, and it is important to limit their use.
1177	1180	1	2	Dear local newspaper, the familiar scene of a mom telling her child, “Get off that computer; it's (time)!”, and the child replying, “But mom, I don't want to. I'm in the middle of a game,” is all too common. Every kid loves playing on the computer, but it's concerning when a child spends an excessive amount of time (NUM1) on it. Experts are definitely (PERCENT1) right in stating that both kids and adults are spending too much time on computers. There are better alternatives to computer use. For example, exercise is a great option. Running on the community track every night can transform fatigued legs into strong ones. I play baseball, and every year, my dad takes me to the track in (DATE1) to time me for (NUM2) and (NUM3) yard dashes, the (NUM4) meter, and the mile. I train from then until (DATE2), and my dad conducts another assessment. Weight - lifting, including bench - pressing, squatting, and dumbbell curls, is also an effective way to get in shape. Once in shape, one can participate in a sport. Enjoying nature is another alternative. Instead of being inside playing computer games, one can go outside and soak in the beauty of nature, whether it's observing squirrels or trees. In winter, enjoy the snow. If that doesn't appeal, spending time with family is a great choice. Plan a trip to a baseball game, park, or movies. In my opinion, people should exercise, enjoy nature, and spend time with family instead of being glued to the computer.
1178	1181	1	2	I am of the view that computers have a positive impact on people. Consider two girls: one is using her computer to do homework, and the other is chatting with friends. These activities contribute to a more productive world. Computers offer several benefits. Firstly, they enhance hand - eye coordination. Through online games, players can acquire skills that are transferable to real - life situations. For example, a boy who plays football online can apply what he's learned in an actual football game. This improved coordination helps in multitasking and learning new things about society, which can be used to discover new ideas and benefit the community. Secondly, computers are excellent learning tools. They can direct users to news and information about the world. They are like a vast repository of knowledge, enabling people to learn about far - away places and cultures. Finally, computers facilitate communication. Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace, along with communication tools such as Skype, video chat, AIM, and email, allow people to connect with others. Email, in particular, is not only for chatting but also for conducting business, sending pictures, invitations, and announcements. Schools, offices, and companies worldwide use these tools, making the world a better place. In conclusion, computers positively affect people globally. They improve hand - eye coordination, aid in learning, and enhance communication, as seen in the girl getting an A on her homework and the other girl signing off to be with her family.
1179	1182	1	2	Dear Newspaper (CAPS1), I firmly believe that computers and advancing technology bring numerous benefits to society. They contribute to hand - eye coordination, offer an easy way to learn about distant places and cultures, and help people save and utilize time more efficiently. Hand - eye coordination is essential for everyone. Without it, simple tasks like throwing a ball could go awry. Computers can improve this skill through various games and activities. When it comes to learning, computers are a valuable resource. For instance, if a student is studying (PERSON3) in (LOCATION1) in their (CAPS2) (CAPS3) class, or (PERSON1) in (CAPS4) class, or (PERSON2) in music class, it's much easier to look them up on a search engine than to rummage through old, dusty biography books. Computers also benefit working or stay - at - home parents. Instead of searching through a phone book to contact a person or business, they can simply go to (NUM1).com and type in a name. Additionally, if a child is being a distraction, parents can set them up with an educational game to finish household chores. In conclusion, the advantages of computers in terms of hand - eye coordination, learning techniques, and time - saving are significant reasons why they are beneficial to society.
1180	1183	1	2	Dear (CAPS1) (CAPS2), I am convinced that computers have a negative impact on people for three main reasons. Firstly, computer use can severely damage eyesight. Staring at a computer screen constantly can lead to blindness and may also cause serious head injuries due to eye strain. Secondly, having a computer at home with little kids is unsafe. Adults may watch inappropriate content that is not suitable for children, which can have a harmful effect on them. A child in the house may be exposed to things they are not ready for, and this can have long - term consequences. Finally, excessive computer use isolates people from their families and friends. If someone is always on the computer, they will miss out on important family moments and social interactions. To address these issues, it's crucial to take precautions. Keep an eye on what is being watched when there are kids around. Most importantly, get off the computer and spend time with family and friends. In conclusion, the negative effects of computers on health, family life, and child safety are significant, and it's necessary to limit computer use.
1181	1184	1	2	In today's era, computers play a crucial role in business, education, and recreation, bringing numerous benefits to society. Firstly, they offer a means to attain a better education. For instance, the social - studies textbooks in school still refer to @LOCATION3 as the @LOCATION1, while computers can provide up - to - date global information. As @CAPS2 @PERSON2, an eighth - grade teacher, said, “With our outdated textbooks in school, the @CAPS1 is our number one resource to get information.” Moreover, one can learn about distant places without leaving the comfort of home.  Secondly, computers are an excellent form of communication. I recall being in @NUM1 grade when my father was on a business trip abroad. Since our phones couldn't make long - distance calls, we relied on computers to stay in touch, which helped me cope with his absence. According to @CAPS2 @PERSON1, an electronics expert, “You can save over @MONEY1 a year when you use the @CAPS1 to communicate over a cell phone.”  Finally, using a computer enhances hand - eye coordination. Continuous typing on the keyboard improves hand dexterity. A recent poll in the @LOCATION2 Times by @CAPS3 indicated that “@PERCENT1 of computer users are more coordinated throughout their day compared to those who don't own a computer.” In modern times, hand - eye coordination is essential.  In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial to society and all their users. They are indispensable tools for education and business in @CAPS4's world. Thank you for your attention.
1182	1185	1	2	It is a well - known fact that people like computers. They are as addictive as they are useful. Contrary to some beliefs, computers are extremely beneficial for our daily lives. One can play @ORGANIZATION1, communicate, listen to music, watch movies, and even learn a language on a computer.  @ORGANIZATION1 are a great source of entertainment and relaxation. In the present age, traditional @ORGANIZATION1 can't match the joy that computer @ORGANIZATION1 bring. They break geographical barriers, allowing us to have experiences like playing baseball with a friend miles away or getting the “You got mail” alert. This alert, which millions of people receive daily, indicates that an email has been sent. @CAPS4, sent over the @CAPS7, are much faster than traditional postal services. Instead of waiting @NUM1 days for a letter, one can send a message to friends within minutes. Electronic messaging systems like Microsoft @CAPS3 @CAPS4 are superior forms of communication that connect us to the world. One can send a message to anyone with a message box.  If one wants to watch a movie but doesn't own it, a computer with a disc drive can play any @CAPS6. Even better, movies available on the @CAPS7 can be downloaded and watched with a click of the mouse. Computers are filled with gadgets and accessories that simplify our lives. It's hard to find something that can't be accessed on a computer, whether it's @ORGANIZATION1, movies, or @CAPS4. They are the perfect tools in modern society.
1183	1186	1	2	There is a debate about whether computers benefit society. Some believe they are beneficial, while others think they are too consuming. In my opinion, computers are a great help to society.  Computers teach hand - eye coordination. Take softball as an example. In softball, good hand - eye coordination is needed to swing at the ball accurately. If kids improve their hand - eye coordination through using computers, more of them might join local or travel sports teams.  I also love traveling. I often learn about destinations by looking them up on the internet. About three years ago, I was going on vacation to @LOCATION1. By researching it online, I discovered many tourist attractions and packages like swimming with dolphins. I had a great time there, and I might have missed out on all the fun if I hadn't looked it up.  Another reason I like computers is the ability to chat with friends online. @CAPS2 is very popular. Some people use it to look at pictures, while I use it to chat with friends. One night, while chatting with a friend, she reminded me of our science homework due the next day. Thanks to her reminder, I completed my work. Chatting online can improve kids' grades by @PERCENT1 as friends can remind each other of important things like homework.  In conclusion, society needs computers. They teach hand - eye coordination, allow us to learn about far - away places and people, and enable online chatting. It's hard to imagine what society would be like without computers.
1184	1187	1	2	More than @PERCENT1 of the population uses computers, and they have a positive impact on society. Computers help people learn and stay in touch with family and friends, although they can be a bit addictive, and people generally know when to stop using them.  Computers are excellent tools for learning. Websites such as search engines, dictionaries, and @CAPS1 encourage us to explore the “riches” of tropical @LOCATION1. By providing easy access to knowledge - gaining tools, computers help us become more advanced in various aspects of life. For example, scientists can develop new theories and uncover new things using computers.  Computers also facilitate communication. As @PERSON1 said, “I have kept in touch with many of my friends from high school. The computer, through email and Facebook, is a great way to stay in touch with them!” Social media websites like Facebook and MySpace help people stay connected and find family and friends. It's evident that many people would feel lonely without the internet to connect with friends.  Although computers can be addictive, the number of addicted people is relatively small. Only @NUM1 out of @NUM1,000 people in the world are addicted to computers. Most people understand that computers are a beneficial and fantastic source of technology.  In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. They aid in learning, help with staying in touch, and are not overly addictive. Therefore, they are extremely beneficial to the world, its people, and technology.
1185	1188	1	2	In my view, computers are becoming a significant problem in our lifestyles. Although many seem to benefit from them, they actually have negative impacts.  Firstly, computers are a major distraction in our daily lives. People want to lose weight, but instead of exercising, they prefer to check websites or chat with friends. This is a lazy distraction. If we continue this way, more than @PERCENT1 of the currently fit and healthy population will become obese. We need to address this issue, such as reducing the promotion of websites on @CAPS1.V networks or having a computer - shutdown week to encourage people to enjoy the outdoors.  Secondly, it's concerning that many adults have to ask their kids how to use the computer. Our future leaders are spending too much time on the internet, playing games, checking emails, and instant - messaging. As a result, they are turning in less schoolwork each year. This is a critical period in their lives, and they need to learn important things now to secure their futures. Instead of making a habit of going online daily, they should focus on completing their homework.  In conclusion, many aspects of our lifestyles need to change, whether it's related to schoolwork or health. It would be best to reduce our computer usage to minimize distractions and focus on living a more fulfilling life that doesn't revolve around a computer click.
1186	1189	1	2	Proven by @PERSON2, over @PERCENT1 of children have access to desktops, laptops, or some form of the internet, making it seemingly the most prevalent medium. However, I firmly believe computers are a double - edged sword. They consume people's time, especially children's, hindering them from completing their work. Moreover, computers not only facilitate communication with friends but also give rise to @CAPS5 bullying. Additionally, they stress out parents as they have to pay the internet bill. Nowadays, children come home, change, and immediately log on to the computer to chat with friends and listen to music. This seems fine until report cards arrive, and they find they're failing half their classes. I recall my friend @CAPS3. She would come home, change, eat, and then log on to the computer. As the end of the year approached, she realized she had two issues: she was overweight and failing all her classes. She recognized that excessive computer use was unnecessary, so she reduced her computer time for a month and a half, did her homework, and this experience convinced me that children need to cut down on computer use. Proven by @PERSON3, over @PERCENT2 of children have either been cyber - bullied or have @CAPS5 bullied someone. This often happens when children are unsupervised or bored and pick on others. When asked what to do, @PERSON1 suggests taking away the @CAPS1. I remember reading about a young girl on newchannels.com who was @CAPS5 bullied. This shows that children worldwide can be cyber - bullied at any moment. In conclusion, the negative impacts of @CAPS1 on children are evident, and steps should be taken to limit their use.
1187	1190	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are a complete waste of time. Those who claim they're helpful are merely making excuses. Some say computers are useful for research and communication, but both can be achieved without one. Computers are a money - wasting distraction. People spend hours chatting on computers, but a phone can serve the same purpose. A study has shown that phone calls are cheaper than using the computer for communication. In this economy, saving money while achieving the same result is a no - brainer. Moreover, typing on a computer isn't real interaction, and you can't be sure who you're talking to. It's a risky alternative to a phone call. Using a computer is as addictive as smoking. People sit in front of computers for hours daily, getting no exercise. This lack of physical activity contributes to the rising obesity rate, especially when combined with the increasing number of fast - food places. Some parents are negligent; they allow their children to spend @NUM1 hours a day on the computer without encouraging them to go outside. Children need motivation to be active, or they'll become even more overweight. We need to form a group to address this issue. Otherwise, @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 will be obese. Another excuse computer enthusiasts make is that they use it for country research. But why not ride a bike to the library, get a book, burn calories, and learn reliable information? Not all internet information is true, while books are more trustworthy. It may take a month or two to wean computer lovers off their devices, but if we act now, we can make a change. Computers are a waste of money, and the world would be better without them. People are being lazy and using baseless excuses to justify their computer use. Living without computers is easy, and it would lead to a healthier, more active lifestyle.
1188	1191	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, the question of whether computers have good or bad effects on people is a crucial one, and I firmly believe they have negative impacts. First, people spend too much time on computers instead of exercising. In @LOCATION1, the obesity rate is rising, and excessive computer use is a contributing factor. People prefer to play online games rather than engage in physical activities like playing tag or sports. It's clear that people should get off the computer and start exercising. Second, while some think computers teach hand - eye coordination, sports can do the same. Instead of sitting at a computer, one can be outside having fun while learning this skill. Running around outdoors to learn hand - eye coordination is far more enjoyable than sitting still at a computer. Finally, although people claim to use computers to learn about far - away places and people, books are a better option. People often look up information on the computer and then start playing games. Also, internet information may be unreliable as websites can be hacked, while books are more trustworthy. You can't hack a book; the only way to change it is to rip out pages, which is a waste of money. Now is the time to decide whether computers have good or bad effects. I believe they have bad effects. There are other ways to learn hand - eye coordination and gain knowledge about other places. Most importantly, people should exercise more and spend less time on the computer. I hope the newspaper will share this view and spread the message to the world.
1189	1192	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1, I'm writing to share my opinion that computers have a positive impact on people. Firstly, computers offer a wealth of information. When I have a school project on a famous person or a place, the computer provides more details than a book. I can easily find out the distance between my location and a place, or the local weather, by typing a query into a search engine. If I need pictures for a biography project, a simple search will yield numerous images. Secondly, computers promote unity. Social networks like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 have millions of users, allowing people to connect with others worldwide. The @ORGANIZATION1 webcam feature enables face - to - face communication. For example, after the recent earthquakes in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3, people could use computers to spread the news and encourage support for those in need. Finally, computer skills are essential for employment. Almost every job involves using a computer. Whether it's researching a disease, working on a machine, or publishing information, computers play a vital role. For instance, if you have a job where you print papers regularly, you use a computer to edit and assemble the content first. Basic computer skills are necessary for both new and common jobs. In conclusion, computers are an indispensable part of modern life. They offer learning opportunities, promote global unity, and are crucial for employment. Their benefits far outweigh any potential drawbacks.
1190	1193	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, contrary to the view that computers are a distraction and unnecessary, I believe they offer numerous benefits. Computers are a valuable tool for learning and research. We can use them to study new subjects, collect data for medical research, or work on machinery. They are an integral part of many jobs. Almost all published materials and public - facing content are created using computers. For example, if you have a job where you print papers regularly, you use a computer to edit and format them first. So, basic computer skills are essential for both new and common jobs. Regarding the claim that computers are time - consuming and unhealthy, it's an individual choice. People can choose to go out, see friends and family, go to the gym, or take a vacation without a computer. While computers are fun and offer many activities, they're not as essential as air or water. You can live without using a computer for a week, take a walk, read a book, or hang out with family. In education, computers are also useful. In @CAPS2, students use computers in the lab to learn to read or use other programs, write essays, and conduct research for class projects. The most significant use of computers today is communication. Websites like YouTube, Facebook, and MySpace are designed for this purpose. They allow people to share ideas, talk to distant friends and family without high phone bills, and stay informed about politics, news, and weather. In conclusion, computers are a vital part of our daily technology. They're not unhealthy or time - consuming unless we let them be. With proper use, they can enhance our lives in many ways.
1191	1194	1	2	"I firmly oppose the so - called ""experts"" who claim that computers have negative impacts on people. The argument that computers lead to less social interaction with family and friends is unfounded. Social networking platforms such as @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 enable @CAPS22 with all friends. @CAPS4 and other online games help users meet new people who may be hundreds of miles away. Twitter is useful for quickly sharing short messages like ""@CAPS5 to @LOCATION1"". @CAPS18 allows users to communicate with friends, comment on their videos, subscribe to them, and offers hours of free entertainment.  Computers also provide a wide range of fun games. There are numerous free games, like @PERSON1, which has endless possibilities. @PERSON1, developed by @CAPS6, claims to be the most popular @CAPS7 (@CAPS8 @CAPS9 Online @CAPS10 - playing @CAPS11) on the web. Players can level up combat skills such as attack, defence, strength, ranged, and magic, as well as non - combat skills like wood cutting, prayer, farming, fishing, mining, and cooking. Similar to most @CAPS4, @PERSON1 has quests of varying difficulties. For instance, one quest may require killing a demon, while another only involves finding a missing cat. There are over @NUM1 quests, and there are always at least @NUM2 players online. Other notable @CAPS13 games include @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS14: @CAPS15, @CAPS16 of @CAPS17, @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION2, and @ORGANIZATION1.  The computer offers an impressive array of entertaining @CAPS11 for all ages, not to mention sites like @CAPS18 or addicting games. The claim that computers hinder exercise is baseless. Exercising is a personal choice. It's like saying that before the advent of computers or video @CAPS11 consoles, a @CAPS20 board stopped kids from exercising. The real factor determining whether one exercises is personal judgment. With good judgment and willpower, one can choose to play sports or go to the gym instead of staying indoors tweeting and @CAPS21.  In conclusion, computers offer abundant opportunities for @CAPS22, and there are many ways to engage in it. Many sites can amuse us, and we should make good use of them. We can also purchase games like @CAPS16 of @CAPS17 or @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS14: @CAPS15 for our @CAPS13. Computers do not actually prevent us from exercising; it merely requires good judgment to get up and be active."
1192	1195	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, imagine having all human knowledge at your fingertips and an endless source of information right in your home. Who wouldn't want this all the time? The question then is whether computers have positive effects on people. I am strongly convinced that computers bring benefits to society.  Firstly, computers help improve hand - eye coordination. Typing is a primary way to develop this skill. When starting to type, one looks at the keys, but eventually, the key locations are memorized. Computer games also contribute to hand - eye coordination. It's impossible to win a game without looking at the screen. The hand - eye coordination skills learned from computers can be applied in other areas, such as sports. For example, in baseball, good hand - eye coordination is essential for catching and hitting the ball.  Secondly, computers enable people to learn about different places and people. When planning a vacation, people often turn to the internet to research what to do and see. Many use the internet to study other countries. When eighth - graders were doing reports, 87% of them used the internet for information.  Some people argue that computers reduce interaction with family and friends, but in fact, computers allow people to communicate with loved ones around the world. Online communication methods like @CAPS5 - mail or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 make it faster and easier to send messages. It's easier to remember an @CAPS5 - mail address than a phone number. Video - conferencing options even let you see the person you're talking to, as if they were in the same room.  In conclusion, computers are an excellent tool for refining hand - eye coordination skills. They allow us to explore distant places and people and understand different lifestyles around the world. Most importantly, they provide various ways to communicate with family and friends online, such as through @CAPS8, @CAPS5 - mail, or @CAPS10. Undoubtedly, computers benefit society. So, share this information with others to convince them of the positive aspects of computers.
1193	1196	1	2	Computers have a positive influence on people. They help users stay in touch with family and friends, assist with schoolwork, and offer entertainment options like video games and music and movie access.  Regarding social connections, computers enable users to find out where family and friends live, how they are doing, and what they've been up to. They allow for email communication and help users see friends who have moved far away.  In terms of schoolwork, computers are invaluable. They help students find answers to teachers' questions, write reports on various subjects, and access websites that can assist with book - related tasks. These sites can also lead to school websites, so students can check for homework assignments even if they forget or are absent. Most papers and questions are available on the internet, enabling students to complete their homework.  Computers are also commonly used for watching movies, whether old classics or new releases. The same goes for music. From @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 to country music, all types can be found. New @CAPS3 shows and music are also accessible.  Video games are very popular. Many people play them to interact with friends they haven't seen in a long time and to avoid boredom. When it's raining outside and there's nothing else to do, video games are a great option. There are always people online to talk to, and new friendships can be formed.  In conclusion, computers are far from being a waste. They help users stay connected, make new friends, and provide access to a wide range of entertainment options, including @CAPS4 shows, music, and movies.
1194	1197	1	2	I believe that people should spend more time outdoors, exercising, and enjoying nature with family and friends. By doing so, more teens and adults would be in better physical shape and healthier. Imagine waking up, having breakfast, and then heading to the park with family and friends for some exercise.  However, many people, including teens and adults, spend too much time on computers or laptops. Some people who support technological advancements claim that computers have a positive impact on people. But I disagree. While it's true that computers are necessary for some people with business - related work, most people should limit their computer use.  For those with a business that requires daily computer work, it's understandable that they need to use a laptop or computer. But for teens, computer use should be restricted. If they need the internet for research or writing a paper, it's acceptable. But using the computer just to chat with friends is a waste of time, especially when they should be studying and doing homework to ensure good grades and a successful academic career.  In conclusion, it's important to strike a balance. Teens should focus on their studies, and everyone should make sure to get outside and enjoy fresh air with others. I hope that teens and adults will start spending more time outdoors, as it will be beneficial for everyone's health. Trying this approach will surely lead to a healthier and more fulfilling life.
1195	1198	1	2	I understand that some people wonder why computers have such an impact on people. In my opinion, computers are better than newspapers. Both can provide news, information about weather, houses for sale, TV casting, jobs, etc., but computers offer a virtual experience.  Computers bring many benefits to society. They teach people to read, write, type, and learn. We can communicate with others, view pictures of people we know, and use search engines like Google to find information. Mapquest on the computer helps us find our way around.  However, there are also negative aspects. With internet - connected computers, there are websites that are not suitable for certain ages. Kids may access inappropriate websites without their parents' knowledge. There have been cases where people make plans with strangers met online, and then those people go missing.  If experts were to take away computers, many kids would be angry and upset. They would have few options other than playing video games or going outside.  In conclusion, while computers have their drawbacks, they also offer a lot of advantages. We should make the most of their positive aspects while taking measures to avoid the negative ones.
1196	1199	1	2	Computers play a highly beneficial role in people's lives. They offer a means to acquire new knowledge, establish connections with others, and simplify the writing process. Through technology, individuals can explore diverse new topics. By typing a query into @ORGANIZATION1, relevant results appear within seconds, and clicking on them reveals the required information. This functionality is particularly useful for research papers, as the internet enables the creation of a more comprehensive final draft. The knowledge gained from using computers can positively impact academic grades and work performance.  Moreover, computers facilitate communication. People can @CAPS1, engage in conversations on @CAPS2, or have face - to - face interactions via webcam with loved ones they may not have seen for months. On @CAPS2, pictures can be added, allowing those who missed an event to visualize it.  In terms of writing, traditional paper - based writing can be arduous and time - consuming. However, with a computer, one can type freely, and spell - check will identify and correct spelling mistakes, ensuring that no points are lost due to incorrect spellings. Additionally, for those with poor handwriting, typing on a computer offers a practical solution.  Overall, computers have a significant positive impact on humanity. They educate, enable long - distance communication, and simplify the grading process, thus contributing to the betterment of society.
1197	1200	1	2	Dear local newspaper, it is disheartening to observe that on a pleasant sunny day, many people choose to stay indoors on their computers instead of enjoying the outdoors. This trend is having a negative impact on the @LOCATION1 population. If no action is taken, the situation could become extremely dire.  One of the most concerning issues is the high obesity rate among children in @LOCATION1. Normally, children and even teenagers should be actively engaged in physical activities to burn calories. Instead, they are spending hours in front of computer screens, playing virtual games, checking emails, and so on. Even simple household chores could significantly reduce the obesity rate compared to sitting idle in front of a screen all day.  Another problem is the health risks associated with computer use. Staring at the bright computer screen for extended periods can be harmful to the brain, as computers are responsible for @NUM1 out of @NUM2 child seizures each year. The radioactivity emitted by computers can also increase the risk of cancer. Since there is currently no cure for cancer, prolonged computer use puts one's life at stake. The longer a person uses a computer, the more radiation is absorbed by the brain.  Computers also have negative mental and social effects. During @DATE1, students may spend excessive time on computers, leading to a loss of @PERCENT1 of the knowledge they learned in school. It has been proven that computers can cause memory loss. Socially, while others are out having fun, those who are glued to their computers may find themselves isolated.  The debate on this topic may continue indefinitely, but before turning on the computer, one should seriously consider whether it is truly worth the potential harm. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computers on the @LOCATION1 population are significant, and people should be more cautious about their computer use.
1198	1201	1	2	Dear editor, the prevalence of computers in the @LOCATION1 is on the rise, and this trend is having a detrimental effect on society. People are spending an excessive amount of time on computers, neglecting other important activities such as exercise, experiencing nature, and interacting with family and friends.  Regarding exercise, a survey conducted by the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 shows that only @PERCENT1 of computer users exercise at least once a week, while @PERCENT2 of non - frequent computer users do so. Lack of exercise can be harmful to one's health, and encouraging people to step away from computers and engage in physical activities would lead to a healthier and fitter nation.  Computers also prevent people from fully enjoying nature and exploring the world. Although the internet can provide some information about different places, actually visiting @CAPS1 and other unfamiliar locations offers a more profound understanding of other cultures. For instance, when the author visited @LOCATION2, they witnessed the stark differences between the poor and the rich, an experience that cannot be replicated on a computer. People should experience the world through their own eyes rather than through a computer screen.  Finally, computers inhibit social interaction. The author admits that they often ignore friends and family when using a computer. Socializing is an essential part of life, and without it, people cannot be truly happy.  In summary, excessive computer use can lead to reduced exercise, limited exploration of the world, and a lack of social interaction. To build a better country, the people of @LOCATION1 should make an effort to reduce their computer usage.
1199	1202	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people, and here are my reasons.  Firstly, computers enable us to stay in touch with family and friends. If your grandmother lives in @LOCATION2 while you are in @LOCATION1, it is not practical to visit her every time you want to see her. With a computer, you can have a live chat with her, and you can also plan a visit. Similarly, you can use a computer to communicate with friends, ask them questions about homework, etc. This ability to connect with loved ones is a significant advantage of computers.  Secondly, computers are a great resource for finding answers to questions. When you are working on a big report and your friends are unavailable, you can rely on your computer to look up the information you need. It would be extremely difficult to complete tasks without the help of a computer.  Thirdly, computers offer a convenient way to work. Stay - at - home moms can handle finances on the computer. Many people choose to work on computers to contribute to environmental protection. In the future, I am likely to work on a computer because it is easier.  I have chosen these reasons - the ability to connect with family and friends, the capacity to find answers to questions, and the opportunity to work on a computer - to illustrate the positive effects of computers. Although some people may think that computers do not enhance knowledge or are not beneficial for the brain, many people actually like and own computers. I hope you will also have a positive view of computers as they are truly helpful.
1200	1203	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, at my school, many students spend their after - school time on computers instead of going outside. This is a concerning trend as it prevents them from enjoying nature, interacting with family and friends, and getting exercise.  Going outside offers numerous benefits. For example, a walk in the woods can enhance one's knowledge as they may discover interesting new species. In the neighborhood, there are often many kids, and one can start a game of baseball. Additionally, building a treehouse or a tire - swing with family members can be a fun and rewarding activity.  When kids are on the computer, they miss out on social interactions. During @DATE1, going to the beach with friends is a great way to have fun and cool off without spending money on an air conditioner. One can also take a day trip to a different state or visit a sick relative across the country. A picnic is another opportunity to meet new people and enjoy delicious food.  The high percentage of kids choosing to use the computer over exercise is also worrying. @PERCENT1 of kids prefer the computer, which can lead to weight gain. Moreover, many kids eat while using the computer for hours on end, which is extremely unhealthy. Joining a school sports team, such as the basketball team or cross - country running, can not only help kids get exercise but also teach them important life skills, such as teamwork.  In conclusion, choosing the computer means sacrificing the joys of the outdoors, time with family and friends, and good health. Therefore, it is advisable to choose other activities over computer use.
1201	1204	1	2	"To @CAPS1, @CAPS6, and @MONTH1, I'd like to address your concern. @CAPS2, I've learned that you believe more and more people are using computers, yet not everyone thinks this is beneficial to society. I firmly disagree. I am of the opinion that computers have a positive impact on people. Using computers helps develop hand - eye coordination, enables people to learn about @CAPS3 and distant places, and allows individuals to communicate online with friends or family.  Wouldn't you want your children to grow up with excellent hand - eye coordination? Over @PERCENT1 of parents said yes. As numerous statistics show, adults and children who use the computer for an hour or more a day have better hand - eye coordination than those who only use @CAPS6 once a week. Typing speed increases with daily computer use of over an hour, and reaction times also improve. This not only enhances computer skills but also has benefits outside the home, such as in sports. For instance, if you play baseball, your pitching speed can increase by over @PERCENT2 with daily computer use of more than an hour. As a batter, your reaction to the pitch can also improve by over @PERCENT2 just by using the computer. Is your @CAPS3 project running out of time? Without computers, you wouldn't be able to obtain the necessary information quickly enough. Dr. @DR1 from @ORGANIZATION1 stated, ""You can get the same information about people, other countries, and @CAPS3 from the computer as you can from a book, and it's easier. Moreover, you need to buy books to access their information, while computers are inexpensive and allow you to look up what you need easily."" Don't settle for less; get the best! Over @PERCENT3 of @CAPS4 have out - of - state friends or family they'd like to stay in touch with. With a computer, you can chat with them via webcam. Instead of making a call or sending an email, you can chat and see them in real - time. Several computer owners say, ""@CAPS5 It's like you're actually hanging out with them!"" It takes at least @NUM1 days to receive a letter or email from someone far away, but with computers, communication is instant. Wouldn't you prefer to talk to friends and family daily rather than waiting for a call, email, or letter? I think so. In conclusion, owning a computer is a great investment. Without computers, you wouldn't be able to communicate with friends and family online, improve your hand - eye coordination, or learn about @CAPS3 with just a click of a button. Isn't this what you want?"
1202	1205	1	2	"Dear Newspaper editor, have you ever been working on a paper or reading something and come across a word you've never heard before, and just can't figure it out? That's where a computer can be of great help.  Yes, some people waste their time online, but those are individual issues. Computers are extremely useful for school projects and research. You can reconnect with old friends you haven't seen in years, and learn a great deal through the internet and computers. First of all, many of the things we do today would be impossible without computers. For school projects, I frequently use @ORGANIZATION1 Word and PowerPoint, as our teachers prefer us to do assignments this way rather than handwriting everything. Searching for information on the computer is much faster and easier. For example, looking up the word ""elephants"" in an encyclopedia would probably take @NUM1 times longer than doing it on Google. Plus, Google can call up millions of websites related to ""elephants"" in about @NUM2 1/@NUM2 seconds. Another significant benefit of computers is the ability to reconnect with old friends you haven't seen or talked to in years. You can also meet new people through dating platforms and social media like Facebook. There are also websites like Twitter where you can follow celebrities and @CAPS2. The internet provides a wealth of useful information. Some kids take online @CAPS3 @CAPS4 courses, and they really have no other choice but to rely on computers. In conclusion, computers can be very beneficial to many people. I know it's not good to sit and play computer games all day, but they help us accomplish a lot, such as school projects or any other projects. It's also nice to catch up with someone you haven't talked to in a while. We've learned a great deal from the internet. I hope you'll consider my opinion."
1203	1206	1	2	"Dear editor of @ORGANIZATION2, I've noticed that many people are spending excessive time using their computers. This is an issue that needs to be addressed as it impacts people's health, safety, and education. Excessive computer use can lead to poor health. Take my friend @PERSON1 as an example. He sits at home on his computer all @DATE1, playing games, going on @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. He rarely exercises and hardly ever sees daylight. As a result, @PERSON1 has gained @NUM1 pounds, which has led to obesity and heart problems. He even wears dentures because his general hygiene has declined. Another common health problem associated with excessive computer use is arthritis. Dr. @PERSON3 from @ORGANIZATION1 told @ORGANIZATION3, ""The large amount of typing on the keyboard can lead to joint problems, arthritis, and other joint - related issues."" A study conducted from @DATE2 to @DATE3 on the long - term effects of computer overuse yielded shocking results. @PERCENT1 of the test subjects visited doctors for joint pain problems. While these health risks are concerning, people's safety is an even bigger issue. When people use the computer excessively, they put their safety and well - being at risk. There have been cases of serious injuries and scams due to the internet. In @DATE4, a girl named @PERSON5 was kidnapped and taken to @LOCATION2. She met a man named @PERSON6 on @CAPS4.com, who convinced her to meet him at an airport. From there, she was taken to @CAPS5 and held for ransom. Every time people use their computers, they expose themselves to risks. Dr. @PERSON4 from @ORGANIZATION2 claims, ""I've seen @NUM2 internet - related kidnappings and other crimes. The victims were people who overused the computer and frequented the internet."" People's education is also affected by excessive computer use. The internet contains false information and can be a time - waster. When students are working on reports, they often use the internet for information, commonly relying on websites like @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION4. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of the information on the internet is incorrect? That's more than half! The internet can also waste a lot of time. My brother, @PERSON2, had an assignment on @DATE1. He spent @NUM3 hours on @CAPS2 and didn't even write his essay, resulting in a zero grade. In conclusion, overusing your computer can cause health problems, endanger your safety, and harm your education."
1204	1207	1	2	Dear editor, you've likely used a computer, so you know how convenient and positive they are. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of all @CAPS1 use computers regularly? These technological wonders offer numerous ways to communicate and learn, clearly showing that computers have an extremely positive impact on people. Who hasn't played a game on a computer? Computers provide various forms of entertainment, such as games, music, and videos. I once had to drive @NUM1 hours to visit my grandma in @LOCATION1. The only thing that saved me from boredom during the trip was my portable computer, on which I played games and watched movies. Critics claim that computer users don't engage in physical activities. Well, try exercising when you're cramped in a car traveling @NUM2 @CAPS2. This shows how computers have a positive effect on me. It was @NUM3 on @DATE1 @TIME1, and my mother was about to give birth. Unfortunately, none of my relatives were present as they all live on the other side of @LOCATION2 @CAPS3. However, thanks to computers, they were able to witness the arrival of the baby without leaving their homes. Computers offer many socialization options, such as social networking sites. Within @NUM4 hours after the baby was born, there were numerous pictures and videos on these sites, allowing everyone to enjoy seeing my @LOCATION1 baby sister. Computers make life convenient for everyone. Last but not least, computers are not only a great tool for school but also essential for educational success. One snowy day in @DATE2, I was assigned a research paper on @PERSON1. I knew nothing about @PERSON1, so I asked my mom to drive me to the library to borrow books. But due to the snow, the library's power went out and it was closed. This wasn't a problem, though, as I only spent @NUM5 minutes on the computer searching for information, instead of hours flipping through book pages. Thanks to the computer, I got an A on my report. Overall, computers serve many useful purposes. They can provide entertainment, help you socialize with people worldwide, and offer information on any topic. @ORGANIZATION1 readers, now you understand why computers are beneficial for your lives and everyone else's. I encourage you to spread the word about the advantages of using computers.
1205	1208	1	2	I disagree that computers are always good for you. There are several reasons for this. First, if you spend too much time on the computer, you end up doing nothing productive. People need to be active, and if you keep sitting in front of the computer all day, your body gets used to inactivity. Eventually, it can become difficult to move or walk. Second, you can meet bad people on the computer. Not everyone on the internet is trustworthy. Some people may be involved in illegal activities or have bad intentions. They could be hiding their true identities and trying to deceive you. Third, you can get into trouble. When you're on the computer, you might share personal information about yourself. You never know who might use that information against you. For example, someone could use it for identity theft or other malicious purposes. In conclusion, spending a long time on the computer can be bad. You become inactive, you're at risk of meeting bad people, and you could get into serious trouble. Now that you know why long - term computer use can be harmful, what will you do? P.S. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
1206	1209	1	2	In contemporary society, computers exert multiple influences on individuals, most of which are highly beneficial and can foster self - confidence. Computers serve as powerful educational tools, enabling people to learn about ancient figures and complete school projects. They also offer a wide range of entertainment options. Moreover, computers can enhance one's job - seeking prospects and support career development.  Education holds great significance for most people. Given that children may not spend sufficient time in traditional schooling, computers step in as teaching aids. Kids can explore different places, work on projects like writing essays or conducting science fair experiments, and learn about historical figures such as famous musicians, celebrities, and legends.  Entertainment is a constant pursuit, and the computer is the go - to option. People can play a diverse array of games, including those from the past and future, such as multiplayer, figure, castle defense, sports, racing, and arcade games. Online interaction with friends and communication with distant family members are also popular activities. Additionally, watching various videos, including funny, sad, and music videos, provides entertainment.  Computers also impact employment. They can train individuals for their jobs, help them understand job requirements, and assist in job searches. Moreover, they allow people to create web pages. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people. They enhance education, offer entertainment, and support career - related activities.
1207	1210	1	2	There have been significant advancements in computer technology, and opinions on it are divided. Here are reasons against excessive computer use. Spending too much time on the computer leads to less physical exercise, which can result in weight gain. It also reduces the time spent enjoying nature, causing people to become disconnected from the natural world. Additionally, it cuts down on the time spent with friends and family.  Firstly, reduced exercise is a major concern. Lack of physical activity leads to weight gain, limits one's ability to perform daily tasks, and poses health risks. If the situation worsens, one may even lose the ability to move freely. To avoid this, it is crucial to manage computer - usage time. Instead of wasting time on the computer, one could go for a jog outdoors.  Secondly, less time is spent in nature. Nature is beautiful but is being destroyed, and only a small number of people are actively helping the environment. Considering the billions of people on Earth, the few hundred thousand who contribute seem insufficient. It is a shame to witness the decline of nature while most of us remain inactive.  Finally, less time is spent with friends and family, which is the most important aspect. Family is our closest support system, and friends bring joy and support into our lives. Spending excessive time on the computer may cause family members to distance themselves and friends to drift away.  In summary, these three reasons highlight the negative impacts of excessive computer use. It is important to remember that while computers are not inherently bad, too much of anything is harmful.
1208	1211	1	2	Dear editor, did you know that a certain percentage of people in a particular location own computers? Computers are undeniably beneficial to society. They are essential for staying updated on important issues, communicating with others, and acquiring new knowledge, making them a necessity in daily life.  The dissemination of news is crucial, and computers play a vital role in this process. Ordinary people need to be informed about weather conditions, global issues, and other important topics. With a computer, one can access information immediately. For instance, there is no need to wait for the weather report on TV when local weather information can be obtained within seconds. Recently, an earthquake in a specific location caused the death of millions of civilians. In case of a natural disaster in another area, computers can ensure that everyone is promptly informed.  Computers are also an excellent means of communication. Many people, like me, have relatives living far away. Since long - distance phone calls can be expensive, email is a cost - effective alternative. A significant number of people use email to contact distant friends and family. Social networking sites such as well - known platforms also allow friends to stay in touch.  Furthermore, computers are a great source of learning. Children can easily search for information for school projects or essays. Adults can also use computers to learn new things, which is more convenient than going to the library to find information in books. Most adults even use online dictionaries to look up word definitions.  In conclusion, computers bring numerous benefits to society. They keep us informed, facilitate communication, and support learning, and these technological advancements are beneficial to humanity.
1209	1212	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, having a home computer is advantageous for several reasons. It aids in learning about other countries and cultures, is more efficient for typing, saves money and paper, and revolutionizes communication.  One of the most important reasons people need computers is for learning and researching global events. For students, using a computer to research a country for a school paper is quicker and easier than referring to a textbook. It is also better for learning about people and cultures.  Typing on a computer is faster than writing by hand. It saves time and money as there is no need to worry about handwriting, broken pencils, or spelling and grammar errors. Additionally, it eliminates the cost of buying writing supplies such as pencils.  Computers also save money by reducing the need to purchase paper for textbooks. They have transformed the way people communicate. Before computers, communicating with people in other countries was costly, either through phone calls or mail. Now, instant messaging saves time and paper. Webcams allow face - to - face communication, saving money on postage, phone calls, and travel.  In summary, a home computer offers significant advantages. It saves time in research, money on communication and writing supplies, and paper by replacing textbooks.
1210	1213	1	2	In my view, computers bring benefits to society. Businesses, fast - food restaurants, and schools all rely on computers for their operations.  Businesses use computers for various tasks. Workers in the design industry have shifted from using paper and pencils to design software. Instead of traditional filing cabinets, computers are used to store information about patients, clients, and employees, as they can hold more data. Workers also type papers and essays; for example, news reporters type reports for publication. Overall, computers are essential for filing, typing, and designing in businesses.  Fast - food restaurants and regular restaurants have replaced cash registers with computers. Chains like well - known organizations use technology to record orders and payments. Unlike the old - fashioned cash registers, modern systems are computer - locked. Every restaurant now has at least a touch - screen computer, making computers indispensable for their survival.  Schools also need computers. Students write reports for projects and classwork, and teachers use computers to file student names, grades, and other information. Teachers also create homework pages and print materials from word - processing software.  In conclusion, computers benefit society as they are necessary for business operations, restaurant management, and school activities.
1211	1214	1	2	Dear @PERSON1, computers are essential and bring numerous benefits to our community. They significantly contribute to making our lives more convenient. In fact, we use computers in some form every single day. The advantages of computers are manifold: they connect people, disseminate news, and enable the operation of everyday objects.  Computers offer various means of connection. In the modern business landscape, most enterprises rely on computers for their operations. Thanks to computers, business owners can manage companies across the globe. For instance, a business in @LOCATION2 or elsewhere in @LOCATION4 can establish a connection with a building in @LOCATION1 through live video chats. They can easily communicate with any branch of their business worldwide. Even small - scale businesses utilize computers to reach out to customers. Online shopping has become a common practice these days, which is a prime example of how stores connect with buyers. Stores can showcase their products and store locations, thereby attracting more business. Moreover, computers connect individuals. Approximately @PERCENT1 of the kids in my school own a computer, leading to the emergence of numerous social networking sites. @CAPS1 is currently the most popular one. Students can reconnect with old friends from different places and even other countries via live chats on @CAPS1 or instant messaging on @CAPS2. With just a click, people can stay connected regardless of the distance.  Computers also play a crucial role in news dissemination. Without computers, most of us would be unaware of world events, such as the @LOCATION3 earthquake. If it weren't for computers, the affected area in @LOCATION3 would face more difficulties as they might not receive as many donations. Additionally, computers have transformed the way we access national news. Most newspapers are now available both online and in print, and it won't be long before they are completely digital. This will revolutionize how we consume news, making it just a click away. What used to take days to reach us now takes only minutes or even seconds.  Science has also benefited from computers. Phones have evolved into multi - functional devices, serving as personal organizers, internet browsers, and messaging tools. They are essentially miniature computers. Cars are also equipped with computers; for example, the @CAPS3 in our cars are computers, and we would be lost without them. Computers control almost every aspect of a car's operation.  In conclusion, computers bring us a multitude of benefits. They connect us, deliver news, and are integrated into almost all of our technological devices. It's hard to imagine life without them.
1212	1215	1	2	"You know those square boxes with screens or rectangular objects with letters on @CAPS11? And the other rectangular boxes where you insert disks or USBs and turn @CAPS11 on? All of these are computers. Yes, @CAPS11 can be fun. You can play games, surf the internet, watch videos, and check your mail. Having a computer can make things easier, but there are also some problems.  There are @NUM1 reasons why computers can be bad. First, if you have kids and they use the computer at home, it can lead to addiction. Your child might constantly pester you, saying, ""@CAPS1 or @CAPS7, can I go on the computer, please?"" When you say yes, they'll be happy. But when it's time to turn off the computer, they'll plead, ""Can I stay on just a little longer? I'm in the middle of a game."" Even after they finally turn it off, the next day they'll ask again. If you say no, they might cry and throw a tantrum. The more you let them use it, the more they'll want to stay on.  Second, computers can expose children to inappropriate content. As your child grows, when they access the internet, they might encounter nude pictures or videos, which could potentially lead to early sexual activity. It's concerning that at the age of @NUM2 to @NUM3 years old, children can be exposed to such inappropriate content through a computer.  Last but not least, computers are expensive. These days, they cost about @MONEY1. Buying a computer can be a significant expense, and getting it fixed or replacing it can also be costly. And once your child has access to it, they'll likely use it even more, which can be a burden.  This is why having a computer isn't always a good thing. Now that you've heard my reasons, I hope you'll consider this information and think carefully about whether you really want a computer. While they are useful and convenient, they also have some negative side - effects. These facts are true, and I believe that about @NUM4 people around the world face issues related to computers every year. So, think hard before making a decision."
1213	1216	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, in this modern era, computers are an extremely valuable tool. I firmly believe that they have a positive impact on people. They help develop hand - eye coordination, enable easy access to information about distant places and people, and facilitate online communication.  Hand - eye coordination is a vital skill for young children. Without it, they may have poor handwriting and struggle in sports. Computers assist in teaching this skill because children need to use their fingers to press the keys they see on the screen. As they try to type faster, their fingers and eyes must work in tandem, which further enhances this coordination.  Computers also provide people with the ability to easily learn about far - off places, people, and various topics. In the past, individuals had to spend hours searching for a decent book on a subject and then sift through hundreds of pages to find the specific information they needed. Now, with just a few clicks, that information is readily available. For example, if you have a dripping faucet and don't want to hire a plumber, you can find step - by - step instructions on what to do using the computer. The possibilities are endless.  Finally, computers allow people to stay in touch with friends who live far away. It's more convenient than traveling by plane as you don't have to hold a device constantly. You can move around and come back when you receive a message. It's also very useful for business people. As @PERSON1, the author of a business magazine, mentioned in an interview, it's nearly impossible to run a successful business without a computer. They can communicate with multiple people simultaneously while still getting other work done.  I can't understand how some people claim that computers have a negative influence on society. I hope you'll publish this in the paper to show that computers are essential in our lives.
1214	1217	1	2	I'm convinced that having a computer is a great thing. There are several reasons to support this view. Firstly, a computer can serve as a map. You can explore places you've never seen before and find directions to your destination. It's incredibly convenient when you need to figure out how to get somewhere.  Secondly, it allows you to stay connected with your friends. You can have conversations with them online, no matter how far apart you are. This helps maintain relationships and keep in touch with what's going on in their lives.  Another great aspect is the entertainment it offers. You can play all kinds of different games, which can be a lot of fun and a great way to relax. You can also access pictures and watch videos.  Moreover, computers are extremely useful for students. They can be used to do homework, research information, and learn new things. The amount of knowledge available at your fingertips is vast.  In conclusion, computers bring so many benefits to our lives. They make it easier to find places, connect with friends, have fun, and learn. We really need them in our modern world.
1215	1218	1	2	There are over @NUM1 students at @ORGANIZATION2, and out of @NUM2 students have computers. In my opinion, computers have a positive impact on people. Students who use computers gain more skills than those who don't, as they learn various software and how to stay safe online.  Computers help kids develop hand - eye coordination. This skill is essential in many aspects of life. In sports like baseball or basketball, hand - eye coordination is crucial. For example, if you're a catcher in baseball, you need to coordinate your hands and eyes to catch the ball. Most sports require this skill, and computers can assist in its development. Hand - eye coordination is also beneficial for people in the workplace. If you work with computers, being proficient with the keyboard can lead to faster results. Whether it's in sports or at work, hand - eye coordination is highly valued. While some people are born with this ability, for others, practice on the computer is an effective way to improve it.  Computers also enable us to learn about faraway places and people. Towns can create webpages with pictures, information, and even vacation - planning resources. @ORGANIZATION1 is a great tool that can help you find any place and learn everything about it. You can plan a visit to a location by buying tickets online or simply read about what it's like. Even if you travel to a place like @LOCATION1 where you don't speak the language, you can use translating sites on the computer to understand things.  Finally, computers make it easy for people to communicate with others. Social media platforms like Facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 allow us to talk with friends, family, and even new acquaintances. I personally have a Facebook account, an AIM profile, and an email. I often use these platforms to chat with my school friends and cousins who I don't get to see often. Online communication helps us interact with people we might not meet in person regularly and develop important social skills.  In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. They are widely used and not difficult to operate. They teach hand - eye coordination, provide access to information about faraway places and people, and facilitate online communication. Computers are truly one of the greatest inventions of our time.
1216	1219	1	2	Dear editor, I have read your previous article claiming that computers can consume excessive time from individuals' lives, time that could be dedicated to exercise or other activities. This assertion is entirely false, as computers, in numerous aspects, actually benefit society. The internet offers a fast and straightforward means to reduce the time spent on tasks we would otherwise undertake. For instance, instead of sending a letter to invite someone to an event, one can simply send an email. Letters may take weeks to arrive and can even get lost, whereas an email reaches the recipient instantly. Moreover, in case a movie sells out or is canceled, the internet allows for easy rescheduling and online ticket purchases to prevent such issues. Suppose your phone rings, and it's your best friend telling you to turn on the news, but you have to leave in three minutes to pick up your kids. Instead of waiting for the news reports, you can immediately check one of the many news websites and still be on time. If you've been eager to talk to someone you haven't seen in a long time, websites like [CAPS4] and Facebook enable you to do so in an instant. You can catch up with that person and discover new things. Additionally, if you've been feeling lonely and unable to find the right person, dating sites can help you find a compatible partner, and you might even go to the event together. Not only does the internet save time and connect you with others, but it can also have physical benefits. According to research at [ORGANIZATION1], individuals who use computers for at least [NUM1] minutes a day experience a [PERCENT1] increase in hand - eye coordination, reaction time, and accuracy. The claim that using computers is bad for your eyes is a falsehood, as proven by [PERSON1], a professional in the field of health with [NUM2] degrees in science and health. In conclusion, computers are a valuable asset to society, offering numerous advantages that outweigh the supposed drawbacks.
1217	1220	1	2	To whom it may concern: I acknowledge that computers have led many people to spend less time outdoors. However, they have also kept kids off the streets, where they might cause trouble. Computers have become an integral part of our daily lives. Some people use them to stay connected with family or reconnect with old friends. While some experts claim that computer use is harmful, our institution, [ORGANIZATION1], offers a computer class. In this class, we learn keyboarding skills, research techniques, and how to conduct in - depth research on any topic. Clearly, [ORGANIZATION1] recognizes the importance of computer use. In the past, kids would often hang around on the streets. Nowadays, they spend more time indoors using computers. This is not necessarily a negative development. In the past, you or your parents or grandparents might have heard about gangs and fights on the streets. Now, such incidents are less frequently reported by children when they come home. I'm not saying that these problems have disappeared entirely, but the frequency of such reports has decreased. Moreover, computers have made it easier for people with family in other countries to stay in touch. My mother immigrated to [LOCATION1] at the age of [NUM1], while the rest of her family still resides in [LOCATION2]. Due to the five - hour time difference, it is challenging to coordinate phone calls. However, they can easily stay in touch through email and [CAPS1] chat. In schools, computer use is also highly encouraged. At [ORGANIZATION1], our computer class teaches us how to type proficiently and how to correctly cite and research work. This knowledge is crucial as it helps us avoid plagiarism, which is illegal. Teachers often assign projects that require computer use, whether it's looking up specific information or typing a document. We also use online [CAPS2] books instead of carrying heavy physical copies. After considering all these facts, it is evident that computers bring substantial benefits to society. Students are kept away from street trouble, people can maintain family connections, and schools use computers to enhance learning. Therefore, it is clear that computers are a positive force in our lives.
1218	1221	1	2	Dear [CAPS1] or [LOCATION1], some people believe that computers are detrimental to society because people spend excessive time on this technology. While I agree that some individuals may spend too much time on computers, I do not believe that this is the reason for the supposed decline of society. In fact, computers are beneficial as they represent an advancement in communication. People can communicate with others by using a webcam and microphone. Computers not only facilitate communication but also help us stay informed about modern society, such as through news updates. This complex device can also store files and documents. If a paper - based file is lost, one can simply reprint the digital version. One common activity in the digital age is chatting with distant friends and family during spare time. Legal websites allow people to be informed about events that have occurred to their friends or family, such as an incident or an upcoming event. Some experts, like [PERSON1], who specializes in human behavior, claim that excessive computer use is the leading cause of obesity and prevents people from socializing outdoors or exercising. However, this is not entirely true. Many people who use the internet for communication often go for a jog around the neighborhood before engaging in online conversations. Information is essential in our society, and computers can provide us with up - to - date news and weather reports. Nowadays, intelligent people use computers to search for missed news and future weather forecasts to plan activities like picnics. This is a useful tool for society to keep up with the world and not miss important events. I believe that computers represent an advancement in modern society as they allow us to obtain the information we need quickly. When we are in a rush to go to work, we often lose papers and files. Computers can conveniently copy files and documents, saving us from the stress of losing important work. It is reported that thirty out of fifty people have been saved from losing their jobs thanks to computers. Computers can also store data, such as songs and pictures, and allow us to transfer and access these files on other devices. In conclusion, it is time to recognize the benefits of computers. With a single click, we can talk to long - lost friends, find the information we need without leaving home, and store important files. Therefore, we should support the use of computers as they are a valuable asset to our society.
1219	1222	1	2	In my view, people should not use computers all the time. Staying up late using a computer, especially on a school day, can make one tired. Looking at black - and - white words on a screen for long periods can also cause fatigue, leading some people to rely on energy drinks like Red Bull or Monster, which is not advisable. Additionally, in schools, a large percentage ([PERCENT1]) of students use laptops and computers. These students usually go online to platforms like Facebook, YouTube, play games, or use Google. On the other hand, the remaining percentage ([PERCENT2]) of students and adults still write on paper. Writing on paper helps develop good hand - writing skills and a better combination of hand - eye coordination. In some states, people do not have internet access or cannot use computers. They have to write their work on paper. Some kids, young adults, and students may have poor handwriting, but writing on paper is still an important skill. Overall, I firmly believe that not everyone should have a computer. Relying too much on computers can lead to a decline in important skills such as handwriting and can also have negative impacts on physical and mental health. Therefore, a balanced approach to computer use is necessary.
1220	1223	1	2	[ORGANIZATION1], in my opinion, computers are highly beneficial to people. I hold this view because computers enable many individuals to access information that they would not encounter in their daily lives. They have a positive impact on people in multiple ways. Many people today are extremely busy with work and may not have the time to buy a newspaper or watch the news on TV. However, computers allow them to access the same information in a shorter period. Some people whose jobs involve using computers can even read the newspaper on their work computers while performing other tasks. This not only benefits individuals but also society as a whole. Computers also facilitate communication. People can use webcams and other tools to stay in touch with others. They can see each other from different parts of the world, which provides an opportunity to connect with people who are far away. Moreover, computers are a great learning tool. They offer a wealth of knowledge, allowing people to learn new things. This is beneficial for society because the more knowledge people acquire, the better it is for the community. For example, those who did not have the opportunity to learn certain things can now do so through computers. [PERSON1] states that [PERCENT1] of kids believe that computers have helped them in various ways. When people are bored, computers offer entertainment options such as games and videos. Playing games on computers can improve hand - eye coordination, as kids have attested. Additionally, computers are a form of technology that is essential in everyone's life. Technology, in general, has helped many people and continues to do so. Computers can teach people new skills and capabilities that they may not have known they had. In conclusion, computers have numerous positive effects on people. They not only benefit the users but also have a positive impact on society as a whole. They provide opportunities for learning, communication, and entertainment, making them an invaluable asset in our modern world.
1221	1224	1	2	In contemporary society, numerous new technologies have emerged, including the @NUM1 player, cell phones, and video game consoles like the Xbox @NUM2. However, the computer is perhaps the most popular and widely used. It offers the ability to search for information with just a few clicks. Some individuals are so engrossed in technology that they become almost addicted, using it at every opportunity. This raises the question of whether this is beneficial for people and if it is affecting their health and physical activity. Indeed, people today are significantly influenced by the internet. Certain websites, such as Facebook, MySpace, and YouTube, can be highly addictive. Since the inception of Facebook @NUM3 years ago, the level of addiction has increased dramatically, along with high - stress levels, as Dr. @DR1 points out. This online behavior needs to stop as people are becoming addicted and gaining weight due to a lack of physical activity. While the internet can be very useful, it should not be used non - stop as it can impact health and pose other risks.
1222	1225	1	2	Hello! I'm writing to discuss whether computers are a bad or good thing for society. I firmly believe that computers are a great addition. They assist us in numerous ways and also help us make new friends and stay updated. Firstly, computers have a positive impact on society because people can access the latest updates on the weather, society, and countries. It benefits society as people no longer need to sift through old newspapers. All they have to do is click, and they can read the information, likely accompanied by pictures. Secondly, computers are beneficial as they help us in many aspects of meeting new people, maintaining good relationships with them, chatting, and sharing pictures. Finally, if you have a business, you can sell your merchandise, manage business plans, and create a website. Over time, many people will learn about it, which can have a significant impact on your business. These are my three reasons for believing that computers have a positive effect on society, and I am convinced that they truly do.
1223	1226	1	2	@ORGANIZATION1, envision a world devoid of computers. Where would we source all our information? Would we have to rely on television or magazines, where information can be altered? Moreover, how would we complete work reports or homework? I know several individuals with untidy handwriting; how would others read their work? Essentially, computers have a profoundly positive impact on our lives, and life without them would be chaotic. Computers enable people to learn typing, which can enhance overall skills such as hand - eye coordination. They allow us to connect with unfamiliar places and see family members, and they also facilitate online education, which can contribute to the economy. Computers affect us in a highly positive way and transform our daily lives. It's concerning that some children today cannot type. A recent study at @ORGANIZATION2 revealed that @PERCENT1 of kids older than @NUM1 already know how to type on a keyboard. Computers have a significant influence on us in many skills that are often under - recognized. Since these kids know how to type, they can also spell better. I recall once while writing an online report, I encountered a word I didn't know and always struggled to spell. I took my time and typed it out letter by letter, and it was correct! This example demonstrates that computers can impact everyone's lives, even those of younger kids. The way we obtain information from computers is similar to how our hands receive instructions from our brains to move. For instance, when babies learn to walk, they rely on their brains to show them how. Similarly, during a natural disaster like the earthquake in @LOCATION1, we rely on computers to inform us about what is happening and how such an event could occur. Computers can affect us in this way because there are many aspects of our world that we might never discover without them. Computers also impact families' daily lives by providing online education. My @NUM3 - year - old cousin told me she was happy her mom could attend college from home, allowing them to spend more time together. Contrary to the belief that computers can distance families, they actually bring them closer. There is no doubt that computers have a positive impact on all of us. They help us learn to type, connect us with the world, and bring families closer. Without computers, we would not be the same as we are today.
1224	1227	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I advocate for the continuous improvement of computer technology. Some people argue that individuals spend excessive time on computers and insufficient time outdoors. However, I personally believe that the computer is valuable, provided it is not used incessantly. There are multiple reasons for the importance of computers. Firstly, there are numerous places in the world that not everyone can visit. The internet is an excellent means to learn about these places. Additionally, if you are planning a vacation and wish to know more about your destination, you can simply search for information on the computer. Moreover, the computer can aid in studying a place. When writing a research paper for school, you can conveniently find information on the computer. If you are in a disagreement with someone, you can quickly and easily obtain relevant information by conducting an online search. You can also learn new things that you previously had no knowledge of. In most cases, the internet is extremely helpful. Another significant aspect is communication. There are various ways to communicate with others on the computer. If you have friends or family living far away, you can stay in touch without leaving your home. If you are unsure about your homework, you can ask a friend online. You can also share pictures or videos to maintain connections. Although some people misuse this feature for inappropriate purposes, you can take measures to avoid such content. The internet can be highly beneficial in your daily life. You can learn about new places, conduct research, and communicate with friends and family. By continuously improving technology, you will be able to do even more than you can currently. The internet will offer greater assistance in your daily life. As you can see, the internet is beneficial to people, and it is not just about keeping people indoors. That is why I believe we should continue to improve computer technology.
1225	1228	1	2	Dear newspaper, I firmly believe that new technology is a remarkable advancement, and thus, I think computers have positive effects on our society. These effects include skill development for the present and future, facilitating better education, and enhancing social interaction. Computers offer numerous benefits, and we just need to recognize them. Come and discover why having and using computers is a great choice. Firstly, computers can help people develop skills they may not even be aware of. For example, a teenager might realize while typing a paper that she has a passion for writing. She can then explore different writing styles on the internet and potentially become a famous journalist. Similarly, if a man applying for a job is required to know specific software, he can find a tutorial on the computer. Computers can assist people in building skills both now and for their future. Secondly, computers can help people achieve a better education. Adults who have not attended college can take online courses and earn a degree. It's not just for adults; kids can also research the history of different places they live in or want to visit. The advantage is that you can find information quickly and easily. Computers enable people to learn more and obtain a better education. Finally, computers enhance social interaction. There are numerous ways to connect with family and friends. You can send an email and wait for a reply, or use instant messaging to talk as if the person is in the same room. There are also social media platforms like Facebook, where you can reunite with old friends. As you can see, computers have numerous positive effects on people. They help build skills, improve education, and enhance social connections. Hopefully, you can now understand how computers can have a positive impact on so many lives.
1226	1229	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2, you may wonder whether computers have a positive or negative impact on people's lives. If you think it's negative, I'll show you why it's actually very positive.  Computers teach good hand - eye coordination. When using a computer, you improve this skill. For example, when you're online and see something you like and want to view it larger, you move the mouse and click. You don't need to look at where you're moving the mouse. Also, when typing a paper, you can look at the screen and move your fingers freely without looking at the keys.  Computers help people communicate with others. This is crucial when you need to talk to someone living far away. The @CAPS7 is great in such cases. You can send @CAPS3 or engage in @CAPS4 chat. You have multiple options for communication.  Computers are useful for school and work. They assist in doing projects, which can help you learn about unknown places. Once, I was curious about how people in @LOCATION1 lived and survived. Using the computer, I found out within half an hour. At work, if your boss expects you to finish a task, you can use the @CAPS7.  In conclusion, I firmly believe computers are positive. They improve hand - eye coordination, facilitate communication with people from other areas, and aid in school and work. I hope this shows that computers are beneficial for us and are essential for a better future.
1227	1230	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, have you ever wondered who invented the ice - cream cone while licking one? You can easily find out using technology. That's the beauty of it. You can talk to friends or family, get help, and it's always available when you need it.  If you've had to move far from your best friend and were heartbroken, computers with webcams can help. It's not the same as being together, but it's close. You can talk anytime, anywhere. You and your friends can chat on the computer. If your parents won't let you go out, you can still talk to your friends. Older people can use Facebook to find long - lost friends.  Computers and technology are also great for getting information. Schools rely on computers, both students and teachers. Teachers assign projects that involve using computers to find information on a topic. If you hear about something new, you can look it up with just a click. It can even help in a fight with a friend about who's a better @PERSON1. You can look up stats to find a winner.  Phones like Blackberrys, @CAPS3, and iPhones have built - in internet. You can play games or watch TV at the airport while waiting for your plane. People in business can look up information anytime.  In conclusion, technology is beneficial in our society. It allows us to talk to far - away friends, get any information with a click, and it's available on phones and other tech devices.
1228	1231	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe computers have positive effects on people. They enable learning about different places and people around the world, and they allow communication with family or friends living far away.  Computers are great for learning about foreign places. If you're planning a vacation to a foreign country, you can find the best historical sights and hotels. If you have a project on a foreign country, you can search for all the necessary data.  Computers also help in keeping in touch with family and friends who live far away. This way, you don't lose the connection. You can also discuss hang - out plans with your far - away friends.  In conclusion, computers are extremely useful. They expand our knowledge of the world and help us maintain relationships with those who are geographically distant. They truly have a positive impact on our lives.
1229	1232	1	2	Advancements in technology, especially computers, are highly practical and beneficial to those who have access to them. Computers help improve hand - eye coordination. When a person learns to type while looking at the screen, they can perform everyday tasks better. Good hand - eye coordination also enhances focus, which is crucial for success in school, work, and social life.  Computers also allow people to learn about new things. I've personally benefited from the vast amount of information available through computers. They are educational tools that enable us to explore the world and gain knowledge that was previously difficult to access.  Finally, computers revolutionize communication. Instant messaging on computers is similar to a phone call but free. Video chat, where people can see each other's faces while talking, is even more popular. These communication methods are especially helpful for those with family or friends in other places.  In conclusion, computers are a great asset to society. They teach hand - eye coordination, facilitate learning, and improve communication. They have a profound and positive impact on people's lives everywhere.
1230	1233	1	2	Dear local Newspaper, I understand you're discussing whether computers have a positive effect on people. In my opinion, they definitely do.  Computers allow us to learn about foreign places and cultures. The more we know about different cultures, the more well - rounded we become. Without computers, many people wouldn't be able to explore these places and gain knowledge. It's like a giant encyclopedia that provides information to those who can't travel the world.  Computers are a valuable resource for students with special needs. They offer pictures, sounds, and interactive activities. Since some kids with special needs have difficulty reading, the computer can read aloud to them. It's hard to imagine where these children would be without computers.  Computers also make it easy to connect with distant family and friends. In the past, it took days to send and receive letters. Now, with a click of the mouse, we can send emails. We can even see our loved ones face - to - face through video calls using webcams. It saves time and money, and brings people closer together.  In conclusion, computers have numerous positive effects on people. They help us learn about different cultures, support students with special needs, and improve communication with distant friends and family. They are an essential part of modern life.
1231	1234	1	2	Nowadays, an increasing number of people use computers daily. Computers are extremely useful for various tasks such as projects, emailing, and researching vacation spots. Nevertheless, some scientists contend that people are spending excessive time on computers instead of engaging in physical activities like exercise or taking a walk. In my view, computers are an indispensable part of a person's life because the information available on them is highly valuable. For instance, when you have a report due, the computer can be your best resource. Imagine if your teacher tells you that a report is due tomorrow and you don't have time to go to the library. I would immediately turn to the computer to gather all the necessary information. Additionally, I would use a computer to learn about distant places and famous historical figures. I could also look up details about my vacation destination, including the best restaurants, hotels, and tourist attractions. Computers are also great for chatting. My grandparents moved away, and I don't get to talk to them as often as before. However, with a computer, I can quickly send them an email to say hello or ask how they are doing. Moreover, it's hard to imagine going to work without a computer. At some workplaces, a significant part of the job involves emailing colleagues about work - related problems and meetings. By using a computer, you can stay well - informed about everything happening. Also, if you have a test to study for and you forget your notes at school, you can look up the relevant information online and study from the computer. This way, you won't fail the science test the next day. After finishing all your homework, the computer can offer a nice break. If you want to use the computer to chat with your friends, it can serve as an incentive to get your homework done first. Sometimes, people need some relaxation time after a long day of homework. Playing games on the computer can be a pleasant way to unwind. In conclusion, computers are of great help for reports, vacations, chatting, studying, and playing games. Many people also use them for work. I firmly believe that computers are an essential part of a person's daily life.
1232	1236	1	2	In my opinion, computers are a wonderful addition to our world. They have a significant impact on people globally as they assist with schoolwork, facilitate communication, and offer safe entertainment. First, computers are crucial for a child's schoolwork. When a student is working on a research paper, the internet is a valuable source of information that may not be found in books. Moreover, if a student forgets, loses, or misplaces their homework, they can log onto the school website and print it out. Also, most teachers expect essays to be as neat as possible. Typing on a computer ensures neatness and is accessible to all students. Clearly, computers are essential for school - related tasks. Second, computers are an excellent means of communication. For example, an employee can easily email their boss to have a conversation or send something. Friends can instant - message each other, and a teacher can email a parent to set up a conference with a specific time and date. This shows that computers make communication easy and efficient. Finally, computers provide a safe and fun form of entertainment. Many companies create kid - friendly websites. My six - year - old sister goes on a website that teaches in an enjoyable way. Studies indicate that a certain percentage of kindergarteners who use these websites perform better in first grade compared to those who don't. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a positive and far - reaching effect on people around the world. They support schoolwork, enable easy communication, and offer safe educational activities. Undoubtedly, computers are a great addition to our world.
1233	1237	1	2	"Dear [Recipient], some people believe that computers are overused and contribute to weight gain, even obesity. While this might be true to some extent, computers also teach hand - eye coordination, allow people to learn about distant places, and facilitate communication. Overall, I think computers have a positive impact on people, and here are the reasons. Computers play a role in teaching hand - eye coordination. You might be thinking, ""How can computers do that? You're just staring at a screen."" However, when playing games on a computer, people watch the screen and use their hands to click. They don't just focus on the mouse. Scientists have proven that people who own a computer and use it for at least [Number] hours a week have [Percentage] better coordination than those who don't own a computer. This statistic clearly shows the significance of computers in this regard. Hand - eye coordination is beneficial for sports like baseball and future jobs. Without computers, our hand - eye coordination would be affected. People often assume that computers are only for games, but in fact, they teach us a great deal about the world. Without computers, we would know little about what's happening in other countries. For example, the other day, my mom was checking her email and came across the story of a young, starving child. This story changed her perspective as she often takes food for granted. Without the computer, she would have known less about the situation in other countries. Since we live in the [Country], we are often unaware of what's going on in other, less fortunate countries, but computers help us stay informed. One of the main advantages of computers is the ability to communicate. My grandmother once said that without computers, she wouldn't be as close to me as she is now. My grandmother and I use the website skype.com. This website allows us not only to talk but also to see each other. Thanks to such sites, I can stay in touch with my grandmother who lives far away. Without computers, this would be impossible. Computers also enable communication with people nearby. I often ask my friends about homework or test dates over the computer. In conclusion, computers are helpful in multiple ways. The world would be very different without them. They teach us about the world, improve hand - eye coordination, and allow us to communicate with others. Although computers have some flaws, their positive effects far outweigh them."
1234	1238	1	2	Dear our local newspaper, computers have a significant negative impact on people and can dramatically change their lifestyles. For example, people who spend all day on computers have less time for exercise, enjoying nature, and socializing with friends and family. One reason why computers can be a problem is that excessive computer use leads to a lack of exercise. Staying fit and healthy is always important. A certain percentage of people in the [Country] are obese, and this could be related to the time spent on computers. I can relate to this because I have a relative who admitted to gaining at least five pounds due to excessive computer use and lack of exercise. Is it really worth sitting in front of the computer all day, eating? There are more active forms of entertainment that can keep us healthy. Another issue is that an over - focus on technology can harm social abilities. Spending too much time on computers can lead to a loss of self - confidence and make a person less outgoing. No one wants to be a loner, and the feeling of isolation can be devastating. It also becomes difficult to interact and make new friends. It's always nice to have a circle of loving people around you, but you could lose them by spending too much time on the computer instead of with them. Lastly, life without the support of friends and family can be tough. In conclusion, people who spend excessive time on computers have less time for exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with others. Focusing too much on computers can have a negative impact on our lives and change its course.
1235	1239	1	2	"Dear editor of [Location 2] [Publication], [Location 3]'s society is being negatively affected by computers. They are extremely time - consuming, and I'm worried that they are causing more people in [Location 3] to become obese. People are concerned that computers are limiting their interactions and the time they spend enjoying nature. I share the same concerns, and I think something should be done about it. On average, an American spends about [Number 1] hours a day on a computer. Considering work, school, and sleep, this leaves very little time, only about [Number 2], for people to explore nature. The number of visitors to our national parks has been decreasing rapidly. I visited Yellowstone last week to check the visitor numbers. The person at the entrance said that since [Date 1], about [Percentage 1] fewer people have visited [Location 1]. I believe this is because computers consume people's time with new trends and games on websites like miniclip.com, preventing them from going to parks or zoos. I also think that people are spending so much time on computers that they don't have time to exercise. With games like the ""Sims game,"" it's hard for people to stay fit and healthy. I conducted a study on how many hours kids spend on their computers. Out of those who said they spent more than [Number 4] minutes on the computer, [Percentage 2] of them could be legally considered obese. Do we really want our next generation of presidents, lawyers, and doctors to be in such a state? Instead, we want them to live life to the fullest by taking care of themselves through exercise. Computers are consuming kids' time to an unacceptable degree. Finally, computers are affecting family and friend relationships. Families and friends don't interact as much as they used to. Sure, parents come home and give their kids a kiss on the head when they see them on the computer, but is that enough? I don't think so. I asked a friend's child about his interaction with his family and friends. He said that since he got his new ""[Computer Model] with a [Number 5] - gig hard drive,"" he hasn't been talking to them much. Instead, he spends about [Number 6] hours a day chatting online with his friends. In conclusion, computers are limiting people from going to parks, exercising, and interacting with their loved ones. If this continues, in [Number 7] years, [Location 3] might be overly dominated by computers. We need to put a stop to this now."
1236	1240	1	2	Dear editor, I firmly believe that computers are an excellent and enjoyable tool. However, I also think people can spend excessive time on them. Computers are truly remarkable. They can be used to type papers or reports, create graphs, and perform other important tasks for us. Nowadays, schools are increasingly relying on computers. They have websites where students can find their homework, classwork, projects, reports, and extra - credit opportunities. Schools have even introduced a new feature, allowing parents and students to check grades online. Computers not only assist students but also the general public. For instance, if a student has a project but doesn't know how to start, they can search on Google for ways to begin. As you can see, computers are very useful and easy to use for schoolwork. Moreover, computers are great not only for academic purposes but also for leisure. Before the advent of computers and the internet, people had limited options for entertainment during dull moments, such as watching TV, reading a book, or going outside (if possible). If you lived in a city, perhaps in an apartment without a proper community, going outside could be difficult. Reading books could become boring over time, and there might be nothing interesting on TV. But with the arrival of computers and the internet, people can play games, watch videos, and communicate with distant relatives. Computers are also ideal for social networking. Not all families live close to each other, but they can still stay connected. In today's economy, we can't always afford to visit them frequently. Through computers, we can connect with them on Facebook, MySpace, and even have video chats, which is wonderful for maintaining relationships with far - away family members. Nevertheless, people can sometimes become overly obsessed with computers. Some individuals spend the whole day on a single website, especially Facebook or YouTube. I'm not saying these websites aren't fun, but they aren't worth sacrificing the chance to go outside and have natural, free fun. I recall logging into Facebook and seeing a girl online. When I logged off about an hour later, she was still there. When I logged in again around @TIME1, she was still on! Spending that much time on one website is excessive. Computers are a great tool for business, education, and leisure, but too much of it is not good.
1237	1241	1	2	Do you like computers? Do you use the internet for assistance? Do you use it daily? Well, this article provides information on all these aspects. First, many people dislike computers because they claim they are too confusing. In fact, computers aren't that difficult to operate; you just need to be patient and take some time to get used to them. Additionally, computers can simplify tasks like typing. Why write by hand when you have the option to use a computer, which allows you to write faster than on regular paper? Second, the internet is much more convenient than books. All you have to do is go to @ORGANIZATION1 or any other search engine, type in what you're looking for, and in an instant, you'll have all the world's information on that topic. Also, if you're planning a vacation, the internet can be a great help. You can buy plane tickets online, and sometimes there are special discounts available on the web. You can also book hotels and view live pictures. So, when you plan a vacation online, you can be sure it will be a good one. Finally, you can purchase almost anything with just a click of a button. Most websites offer discounts. I remember once when I bought @MONEY1 shoes for @MONEY2 online. Usually, the items are shipped to your home within a couple of days. Going on the computer frequently isn't bad. I use the computer almost every day, but I also go outside. I can do this because at night, when it's not suitable to go outside, I use the computer for schoolwork or entertainment. You can also talk to your friends or family over the internet. For example, if your mom or dad goes on a @NUM1 - week business trip, you can use your webcam to talk to them and see them as if you were in the same room. So, is using the computer really that bad? I don't think so, as it is extremely helpful and easy to use.
1238	1242	1	2	Dear newspaper company, the number of people using computers is increasing every day. However, not everyone believes that computers benefit society. Some people argue that those who spend a lot of time on computers don't get enough exercise or play outside. After getting off the computer, their eyes may hurt, and their vision may deteriorate. Despite these concerns, I firmly believe that the benefits of computers are significant when used properly. The reasons I support the idea that computers have benefits are as follows. They enhance hand - eye coordination and provide information about far - away places. People can rent hotels, movies, and games. You can even communicate with people from all over the world online! Imagine if we didn't have computers. If a serious crime occurred, we might not be able to find the criminal's name or their records. However, there are also some negative aspects of having computers. One major issue is cyberbullying. Kids may be picked on and called names. Another problem is that some people online may seem friendly but then try to do something harmful. There are two other significant problems related to computers: plagiarism and illegal music downloading. Plagiarism is when you take someone else's work and claim it as your own. Illegal music downloading, such as using LimeWire to get music for free, means that the artists don't receive the money they deserve from album sales. That's why I believe that while computers offer many benefits, they also have drawbacks. We need to be careful when using them.
1239	1243	1	2	Dear all computer lovers, I really think you're spending too much time on the computer. Yes, it's good to use the computer to learn new facts, watch funny videos, and since nowadays almost everything is available on it. But most people spend an excessive amount of time on it. You need to do three important things: enjoy nature, spend time with family and friends, and most importantly, exercise. In this letter, I'll explain why you need these things, which you can't get from the computer. First, I'll explain why it's important to enjoy nature. Sometimes, it can be challenging to enjoy nature, but if you look closely, it can be really fun. Examples of nature include trees, grass, and fresh air. I'm sure most teenagers would say that sounds boring and would rather sit and watch TV. But there are ways to make nature fun. Instead of just looking at a boring tree, you can climb it. You can go outside and play with your dog and lie in the grass. One of my favorite things to do in nature is to stay up all night and then go outside very early in the morning, lie in the grass, breathe in the fresh air, and watch the sun rise. Second, it's very important to get off the computer and spend time with family and friends. Family can do @MONTH1 things with you. I know I'm very happy when I'm with my family because they always make me laugh, and my family loves to party. Parties are always fun, especially when you're with family. Friends are also great to be with because they make you laugh, have adventures with you, and are always there for you. In conclusion, while the computer has its uses, it's important to balance it with these other aspects of life.
1240	1244	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I believe that the impact of computers on people is a @CAPS1 thing because most people just sit in front of computers all day. In this letter, I'll discuss the effects of computers on people, what else we could be doing, and what people do on computers. First, computers are having a @CAPS1 impact on people and their lives. They make people stay indoors and do nothing but play games. Approximately @PERCENT1 of those who spend too much time on the computer are probably eating while they're on it, which is why some people @MONTH1 become fat. Most of the people who spend all their time on the computer are in their @NUM1's and @NUM2's, and some are in their @NUM3's or @NUM4's. Just sitting there on the computer won't get you anywhere in life. It won't give you a job or a school education. If you sit at the computer for a long time, you won't be able to do things outside. If so many people weren't glued to the computer all the time, they could be outside playing sports, riding bikes, swimming, running, and more. They could also get a job and earn some money or go to college. Kids who spend too much time on the computer could go to the mall, hang out with friends, get some exercise, or simply enjoy nature. There's no point in spending more than @NUM5 or @NUM6 hours on the computer. The maximum time you should spend on it is an hour to an hour and a half. Kids and teenagers should only use the computer for homework and spend the rest of the time doing something else. Students from kindergarten through @NUM7 grade should go outside and play with their toys, and those in @NUM8 grade and above should hang out, go to the mall, see a movie, or have a sleepover. Everyone in these grades should also interact with their families more, seeing them more than @NUM7/@NUM8 times a month and having parties or just getting together. People should do some of the other things I mentioned instead of being on the computer all the time. Finally, the things people do on the computer include me going on Facebook sometimes. Others go on Facebook, Google, play games, look up information, and more. They also use emails to chat with others. Another popular site is YouTube, where people listen to music and watch videos. I don't think the impact of computers on people is a good thing. I believe people should be out doing things rather than just sitting at home on the computer. Those who sit at home on computers could and probably will become too fat. So, the effect of computers on people is @CAPS1.
1241	1245	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, I've recently heard through @CAPS2 @NUM1 @CAPS3 that people think computers have diverse effects on individuals. Historically, computers have caused issues for the human body. Many @CAPS5 are becoming overly reliant on computers. In my view, computers have a negative impact. Firstly, computers have led @CAPS5 to be inactive and unhealthy. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 @CAPS5 have reported that their @CAPS5 are spending excessive time on the computer. @CAPS5 need to recognize that prolonged computer use is a threat to their health. Do you want your @CAPS5 to develop eye problems? People are not only on the computer for work but also for gaming. @PERSON1 states, ""As technology advances, more and more people are needing glasses."" @CAPS5 need to modify their behavior. I oppose computers because @CAPS5 are becoming unhealthy. Moreover, people are not spending enough time with family and friends. In the past, my mom used to scold me. @PERCENT1 of people believe social interaction is crucial. Computers can even contribute to divorce. People need to strengthen family bonds as it reduces interaction. Lastly, people are not appreciating nature. @NUM4 out of @NUM3 people enjoy nature. It offers a chance to reflect. Many people need time to contemplate their lives, which they can't do with the internet. I used to be stressed as I never had time to relax and think while on the computer doing work or homework. @PERCENT2 of people with busy lives believe they need this time. Can you see how nature can be beneficial? Clearly, computers have a negative effect as people don't have enough time to enjoy nature. In conclusion, I firmly believe computers have a significant negative impact on people. The reasons are reduced activity, poor social interaction, and limited appreciation of nature. I strongly urge you to vote in favor of the negative effect."
1242	1246	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper, my name is @PERSON1. I attend @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 and am in @NUM1 grade. I'm writing this letter to share my view that technology has a positive effect on people. In my opinion, computers are excellent. They are transforming lives in <@NUM2 @LOCATION1</@CAPS2>. Firstly, computers enhance hand - eye coordination. When I was in @NUM3 grade, I visited the library at my @ORGANIZATION1. It had a website called @CAPS3 To learn, which taught typing without looking at the keyboard. Secondly, computers enable people to learn about distant places and people. When I was in @NUM4 grade in @CAPS4 @CAPS5, I had to write about @CAPS6. I went on @ORGANIZATION2 and found wonderful pictures of @CAPS7 and saw how they lived. About @NUM5 weeks ago, a @CAPS8 special reported that @PERCENT1 of people use @ORGANIZATION2 to look up personal information. Thirdly, computers allow us to communicate with far - away relatives. When I want to talk to my cousin in @LOCATION3, I use the internet and webcam. I read an article about a month ago stating that @PERCENT1 of people use computers to chat. Some may argue that people spend too much time on computers and exercise less or spend less time with friends and family. However, using the computer is safer than going outside, ensuring the safety of more kids and people. I hope you'll publish this in your newspaper.
1243	1247	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are the most useful tools in our society, bringing us numerous benefits. For instance, if I want to know what the world across the globe looks like, or the surfaces of the moon, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, etc., I can simply open or download a program on my computer. Computers also foster creativity. There are programs that allow users to draw or build, which can help young children become more intelligent. Additionally, computers create many job opportunities, which are essential in a poor economy. With computers, we can save lives by detecting broken bones or tumors, and design bridges and homes through blueprints. Most importantly, computers aid in learning. They can create simulations of the Titanic, spaceships, or floods. They help us find information, even about people. We can see others via a camera and save lives by locating plane crash sites. On @DATE1, computers are truly the most helpful things we have. We should continue to learn and progress to become more advanced and intelligent.
1244	1248	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am convinced that computers have a positive impact on people. With computers, you can achieve a multitude of things, such as learning about almost everything. There are also programs that facilitate communication with others. Adults can manage finances, pay bills, and handle taxes online. Undoubtedly, computers have a positive effect. A large number of people use computers to learn new things. Nine out of ten people access the computer at least once a month to acquire new knowledge. School - going kids frequently use computers for schoolwork, projects, and experiments, learning about the world and its people. Clearly, computers positively influence learning. Another advantage is the communication programs. Eight out of ten people communicate with others on the computer daily. This is beneficial as it allows people to stay in touch with friends and family from afar and enjoy each other's company. Even if family members move away, you can still communicate via computer. Moreover, adults can handle financial matters on the computer. Seven out of ten adults pay bills online. This is a great improvement as it eliminates the need for manual work. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact in many ways. They help us learn, communicate with loved ones, and manage finances. There are numerous other positive aspects that I have only briefly mentioned. I sincerely hope you'll share my view that computers have a positive effect on people.
1245	1249	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a strong positive impact on people. Some may worry that people use computers too often and neglect the outside world, or use them to waste time. However, computers offer the ability to stay connected, learn, and have fun. In today's society, computers play a vital role, and I trust you'll make the right judgment on their usage. Staying connected is one of the greatest benefits of computers. You can communicate not only with relatives but also with people from different countries, states, or even your next - door neighbors. Email is a great and efficient way to keep in touch. There are also platforms like Facebook and Skype where you can share pictures of yourself and your family securely. Even if you're miles apart, you can easily show your friends your new experiences or your new - born baby. These platforms also allow you to manage your personal information and make new friends. You can plan outings with them. Just yesterday, my @CAPS2 emailed me a picture of a cub bear in a tree near his cabin. He's over @NUM1 hours away, but we can communicate instantly. I replied, and he quickly responded with a fun message. It's like we're right next to each other. I'm sure you use email as frequently as we do. Computers are also an integral part of learning. Teachers, students, parents, and grandparents can all learn from them. There are educational websites, like ""quiz.com"" in our school, where students can take quizzes online. Busy parents can work and get paid online, and people who are too busy to attend college can take online courses. Computers educate, not harm. They are involved in security, jobs, bills, school, and more. Most businesses and schools rely on computers. They protect us and help us grow. Additionally, computers are a source of entertainment. Many people play games on various websites, which can be a fun way to pass the time. You can do so many things on the computer, like playing games, downloading music, using Skype, shopping, and making new friends. Online dating has even led to successful relationships. My cousin met his wife through online dating and they've been happily married for @NUM3 years. After considering these points, it's clear that computers are essential in our lives. Most people own and need computers. They are a convenient way to communicate, learn, and have fun. I hope I've convinced you that computers have a very positive impact on people."
1246	1250	1	2	"Dear The @CAPS1 newspaper, I often find myself longing to relax in the natural, free air. However, with the continuous advancements in technology, one feels compelled to stay updated at all times. In my opinion, technological progress has had a negative impact on people. People are no longer exercising, interacting with family and friends in person, or enjoying nature. Exercise involves getting your heart to pound and your body to sweat, releasing endorphins that make you feel better. Sitting in front of a @CAPS3 all day does not encourage the natural urge to exercise. Those who support technological advances claim that ""@CAPS3 can teach hand - eye coordination."" While coordination is important, the overall well - being of the body should also be considered. @PERSON1, voted # @NUM1 cardiologist in the world, states that ""more and more people are suffering from heart disease and attacks every year."" He further theorizes that people's lives have been overrun by technology, with an increasing number of cases of computer addiction. In fact, @CAPS5 individuals have a @PERCENT2 higher chance of developing heart disease. There are many healthier activities, such as tennis. In tennis, you need to develop hand - eye coordination to hit the ball correctly. It also increases your heart rate and burns fat cells, helping you lose weight. Statistics show that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people say tennis has made them more confident because achieving weight loss and better health gives them a sense of conquering the world. Nature is all around us and is essential for our survival. Trees absorb @NUM4 and release oxygen, which is vital for life. They are also habitats for many organisms like the saumel woodpecker and owls. However, if you spend @NUM5 hours a day on the @CAPS3, you may not notice the beauty of nature. Over @PERCENT3 of people enjoy relaxing outside, listening to birds or watching animals. But technology ruins this balance. Tech companies often rely on oil and coal for energy, which depletes the ozone layer and speeds up climate change. Technology also has negative social impacts. @PERCENT4 of texters misinterpret others' texts, leading to bad decisions. Underage children are involved in illegal activities like sexting due to technological advances. The head of the police department in @ORGANIZATION1 reports @NUM6 more cases of child pornography since the invention of picture - and - text - capable cell phones, and @PERCENT5 of @CAPS5 people involved are minors. Moreover, technology is driving families apart. @PERCENT6 of parents say their children have less appreciation for family after getting cell phones, and @PERCENT1 of kids with phones think they don't need family interaction. I hope this article makes you consider the other side of the technological debate. Children should interact more with their families, enjoy nature, and start exercising, which are difficult to achieve with the current technological advancements."
1247	1251	1	2	There are various types of computers, but they all serve a common purpose: to assist people. Computers can help with a wide range of tasks. You can go online to chat with others, engage in buying and selling, pursue an online college education, learn new things, and neatly type up your homework. Personally, I believe computers are extremely helpful, and we are fortunate to have them. Going online offers numerous opportunities. For example, you can attend college online if you don't have the time to go in person, or simply chat with friends. You can learn almost anything on a computer, and it's also a lot of fun. To most people I know, the computer is one of the greatest inventions. Online college education is quite straightforward. Many people in the country choose to study online. This includes parents who want to return to school but can't attend in person, or those with busy work schedules. They can take classes during their free time. Chatting with friends online is also enjoyable. When you're not at your friend's place, you can use platforms like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, or email to communicate. The computer provides multiple ways to stay in touch. Computers are also filled with a vast amount of useful information. You can learn about different countries, people, or even find the recipe for an apple pie. There is something for everyone on the computer, as we all have different interests. Some people like to buy or sell things, do homework, or play fun computer games. Although people are different, we all recognize the importance of computers. Buying and selling on the computer is easier than it seems. You merely need to list what you want to sell or search for what you want to buy. The @ORGANIZATION1 may handle the delivery process, but that's the basic idea. If you have messy handwriting, you can type your homework neatly on the computer. In conclusion, computers offer a multitude of benefits to individuals and the world as a whole.
1248	1252	1	2	To whom it may concern, @CAPS1. My name is @PERSON1. I am writing in response to the letter about electronics, specifically computers. In my view, while computers can be helpful, they are also extremely detrimental. Computers are expensive, pose health risks, and degrade human learning capabilities. Computer companies like Dell and @ORGANIZATION1 sell computers at exorbitant prices. Even when you buy one on sale, it may malfunction, and you'll have to pay a repairman additional money. For instance, I bought a six - hundred - dollar computer, and it crashed yesterday. It's absurd to keep spending money on such unreliable devices. I've decided that once I get rid of my computer, I won't get another one. Health is another major issue. Sitting at a computer for long periods can cause your eyes to water. Moreover, it can lead to serious health problems. When you choose to sit at your computer instead of going out for exercise, your health deteriorates. You may gain weight, develop pink eye from staring at the screen, and face other health issues. In my opinion, it's better to get rid of the computer, visit friends and family, and stay active to maintain good health. Most shockingly, computers are making people less intelligent. I'll give an example. When a student gets a simple homework assignment like defining a few words, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids surveyed rely on computers to find the answers. This could lead to cheating, and if children don't learn to think independently, they may drop out of school and struggle to learn on their own in the future. In conclusion, I believe we should seriously consider reducing our reliance on computers for the sake of our wallets, health, and intellectual development. Thank you for reading my letter.
1249	1253	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I firmly believe that computers are bad. People often get so engrossed in playing on computers that they neglect their homework. Moreover, computer addiction is a real problem. When using the computer, you might be talking to strangers, which is extremely dangerous, similar to the risks associated with having a MySpace account. There are bad people on the computer who post inappropriate content. In conclusion, the negative aspects of computers, such as causing academic neglect and exposing users to potential harm from strangers, clearly show that they are not as beneficial as some might think. We should be more cautious about our computer use.
1250	1254	1	2	I firmly disagree that computers benefit society. There are three major reasons why computers can be harmful. Firstly, computers are causing people to become detached from their families. For example, when a little girl wants to play with her big sister, the sister may ignore her and continue emailing friends on the computer. Family activities like picnics are often disrupted because a family member is preoccupied with the computer. Computer games can be so addictive that a person may ignore others, and this can even lead to a family member falling into depression. Secondly, computers pose serious health risks. People can become overly addicted and lazy. They sit in front of the computer all day, eating and drinking unhealthy things. This leads to weight gain, and there is a risk of developing diabetes. Lack of exercise can also cause heart problems and other serious health conditions. If a person's weight becomes excessive, it may be difficult to lose weight as the heart may not be able to handle the strain. Finally, computers are keeping people from going outside. People should go outside at least once a day to enjoy nature, get fresh air, and relieve stress. Staying indoors in front of the computer for too long can cause stress, which is bad for health and may lead to depression. It can also be bad for the eyes, especially if you sit in the dark without getting sunlight. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computers on family relationships, health, and outdoor activities clearly show that they are not beneficial for society. I hope these reasons will be taken seriously.
1251	1255	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I recently read an article in the paper on @DATE1 discussing whether computers have a positive or negative impact on people. Despite my love for my computer, I firmly believe that computers can have a detrimental effect on individuals.  Computers can lead to a lack of exercise, less time spent with family and friends, and a failure to appreciate nature. In @LOCATION1, the obesity rate has soared to an all - time high of @PERCENT1. Since using a computer is a sedentary activity, those who use it extensively get little to no exercise. I once spent two hours on the computer and gained two pounds. Moreover, being overweight significantly increases the risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, heart failure, liver failure, and more. My uncle, who is overweight, was recently diagnosed with diabetes and now regrets the countless hours he spent on his computer.  Some claim that computers enhance hand - eye coordination, but in reality, this skill often goes unused as people are too engrossed in computer activities.  Eighty - eight percent of @CAPS1 stated that family and friends are the most important things in their lives, yet 12% said their computer or cell phone is indispensable. Not spending time with loved ones is truly regrettable. My mom lost touch with a new friend and later regretted not spending more time with that person. Additionally, a lack of in - person social interaction can lead to speech problems and relationship issues. My neighbor, who rarely leaves his house and is always on the computer, has trouble speaking and has a limited vocabulary.  Nature is a precious gift, but spending too much time on the computer means missing out on its beauty. The @CAPS3 air is beneficial for our health, while the chemically - changed air we breathe indoors is not. We read about @CAPS4 warming on the internet but often fail to take action. I once read about it on the computer and then took the initiative to clean our lakes.  In conclusion, while computers have their advantages, the amount of time we devote to them can have a negative impact on our health, relationships, and connection with nature. Computers are indeed a double - edged sword, and we should be more mindful of our computer usage to avoid these negative consequences.
1252	1256	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In the @DATE1, the world has undergone remarkable changes for the better, especially with the advancement of technology. Computers, in particular, have become a great boon.  I recall a time long ago when the only means of communication were letters or walking long distances. But now, with computers, a simple email or instant message can reach someone in no time. And there's no need to worry about long - distance charges.  I remember a professor at @ORGANIZATION2 once saying that ""Computers are taking time."" However, in my experience, computers are actually helping us reconnect with family and old friends. For instance, I once moved to a new place and lost touch with many people. I changed my phone number and forgot others'. But with a computer, I was able to use a social networking site to find old friends and distant relatives. Through them, I was soon back in touch with the whole family.  The world wide web is a vast place where people from all over the world can connect. I've met people from different states and countries online. Sometimes, I've clicked with individuals from different races, and I've learned a great deal about new cultures. It's amazing how we can share our interests and try new things together.  In conclusion, computers offer us the ability to communicate more quickly, reconnect with loved ones, and meet new people. They have truly transformed the way we interact with the world around us, and it's high time we embrace this wonderful technology."
1253	1257	1	2	Hey @CAPS1, you know computers are a huge part of our society these days. Since the first computer came out, they've gotten so much better. Now, you don't even need a keyboard in some cases.  Computers are great for our society. They let us learn about technology. When we type a lot, we can improve our memory. We can also learn about things we're interested in. And on top of that, we can talk to people from all over the world. Every day, we can learn something new. Teachers always say that learning a lot now will help us in the future, and computers can make that happen.  The more you use a computer, the more you know about it. You can learn how it's made and about the viruses it can get. Even little kids can learn from computers. There are millions of educational games for kids, and @PERCENT1 of kids who play these games before pre - school are ahead. That's really cool.  Kids and adults both use computers. My brother loves parkour. When he goes on the computer, he looks up different parkour tricks. Adults use computers for work. They might look up information for a meeting or for a business they're involved in.  Communication is one of the main reasons people use computers. There's email, @CAPS3, Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, and so many other platforms. If you ask ten random people on the street, @PERCENT2 of them will say they have a Facebook account. Communication is super important for businesses and relationships. If your family or friends are far away, a computer can help you stay in touch. And for businesses, you can use the internet to tell people if you're going to be late.  In short, computers have always been and will always be a big part of our society. They help us learn, communicate, and work. It's clear that this technology is really useful for us.
1254	1258	1	2	Dear readers, in the ongoing debate regarding the effects of computers, it is evident that computers offer substantial benefits to individuals.  In the business realm, modern computers are equipped with advanced software. For example, business software enables the creation of brochures detailing sales and expenses with just a few clicks of the mouse. This method is not only cost - effective but also environmentally friendly. Moreover, clients and business owners can conduct conference calls on the computer, allowing for hands - free multitasking while receiving crystal - clear audio. At tax time, spreadsheet software like @ORGANIZATION1 can be used to calculate taxes and organize relevant information. Additionally, tax programs can be purchased for the computer, enabling users to complete their taxes from the comfort of their homes, saving both money and reducing stress.  Computers also play a crucial role in social connections. With the prevalence of social networking sites such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, individuals can reconnect with old friends who have moved away or lost touch. These platforms offer photo - sharing and chat features, facilitating the sharing of personal updates and maintaining relationships. Video chatting further allows for face - to - face conversations regardless of geographical distance, and it provides a private space for sharing personal information.  In conclusion, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives. They enhance business efficiency, simplify financial management, and strengthen social bonds. As technology continues to evolve, the role of computers will only become more significant, and adapting to this digital age is essential for achieving success and happiness.
1255	1259	1	2	To whom it may concern, Imagine your life without a laptop or a desktop computer. It would surely be chaotic. While some people argue that computers lead to a lack of exercise, time with family, and appreciation of nature, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact. Three key reasons stand out: enhanced communication, more engaging learning, and the inevitable computerization of society.  Regarding communication, consider the traditional pen - pal experience. In the past, when assigned a pen pal in another state or country, we had to write letters and wait at least @NUM1 weeks for a response. With computers, we can receive replies within days. Although some adults view emails as a waste of energy, they are far more efficient than letters.  When it comes to learning, many students find textbooks boring. The internet offers a more engaging alternative. While some students can effectively learn from textbooks, a significant number of students learn better through online resources. Information obtained from the internet is more likely to be remembered as it is presented in a more dynamic and interesting way.  Statistics indicate that by @DATE1, @CAPS2 will be largely computerized. Those who resist using computers risk being left behind. There are even @CAPS3 tools available on computers that can enhance various aspects of our lives.  In conclusion, the benefits of computers in terms of communication, learning, and keeping up with the digital age are undeniable. We should not be swayed by the few negative aspects often associated with computer use. Instead, we should embrace this technology and use it to our advantage. The choice is clear: we should be on the side of computer - enabled progress.
1256	1260	1	2	Dear local newspaper, my name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, a student in the @NUM1 grade at @CAPS5 @CAPS6 in @LOCATION1. I am writing to you because I've heard that an increasing number of people are using computers, yet not everyone believes this benefits society. In my opinion, it does. If you continue reading, I will explain why.  Firstly, computers have a positive impact on people. For instance, when I see my older brother using the computer, he seems much more knowledgeable. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 members of my family learn things from the computer.  Secondly, computers teach hand - eye coordination. When I play games on the computer, my hands are actively engaged. (@PERSON1 example: when I watch the game, my hands are in constant motion.) @NUM4 out of @NUM3 people play computer games, relying on their hands to control.  Thirdly, computers give people the ability to learn. When I use the computer, it teaches me so much that I use it frequently. @NUM6 out of @NUM3 students study on computers and learn about things they never knew before. They can also learn more effectively on the computer.  Some may argue that people spend too much time on computers. However, I believe computers help people learn about what's happening in the world. For example, they can learn about ongoing wars and how people are risking their lives for a cause.  In conclusion, in my view, computers benefit society. They have a positive effect, teach hand - eye coordination, and enhance people's learning ability. I think you should support the use of computers.
1257	1261	1	2	Have you ever had someone move away and wished to stay in touch? A computer makes this possible. Moreover, it enables students to learn about different places, people, and much more. But why do some people not embrace computers?  Computers allow online communication with friends and family. For example, through email, @CAPS1, and video chat. I have a friend who moved away, and we now use email to keep in touch. @CAPS1 also enables instant chatting and the uploading of pictures and videos. My @CAPS2 @CAPS3 shares pictures of my baby cousins so that others can see how they're growing. Additionally, some businesses use webcams to communicate. For example, a boss can use a webcam to check on employees' progress without being physically present.  Computers also help people learn. If a student needs to research a topic, they can use search engines like Bing or Google to find all the necessary information for their project. If a family wants to plan a trip, they can search for hotels and tourist attractions. Computers can also assist with typing papers, making it easier for readers to read hand - written work. They also simplify tax - paying. TurboTax is an online program that allows people to pay taxes and keeps a record of all payments. So, if a company claims you haven't paid a bill, you can check on TurboTax.  In conclusion, there are many reasons to enjoy computers. They facilitate communication with friends and family, offer learning opportunities, and simplify tasks like tax - paying and paper - typing. In today's world, computers are essential, and people would struggle without them.
1258	1262	1	2	Dear local newspaper, have you noticed that many people who are constantly on their laptops or computers get no exercise? I have three reasons why people should reduce their computer usage. They could get sick, experience memory loss, and fail to achieve their desired future.  People who spend excessive time on computers are prone to illness. Many people just sit and eat while using their computers, leading to obesity. They then search the internet for weight - loss solutions but rarely take action. Some even consider online - recommended surgeries due to their weight. However, the only real cure for obesity is exercise, which they neglect while on the computer.  When people surf the web, they tend to forget a lot. Some people spend almost their entire day or life on the computer and don't know what to do other than browse. I've seen people forget their location, identity, and even their family members. They rarely contact their relatives, which is clearly not a good situation.  Another issue is the lack of a promising future. While some people apply for jobs online, they often don't get enough exercise and may not earn as well as those who work outside. Some people are so addicted to their computers that they can't pursue their life goals. Some even need therapy to stop using the internet.  In conclusion, getting sick, losing memory, and having no good future are compelling reasons for people to stop excessive computer use and start exercising. If I were addicted to my PC, I wouldn't be educated enough to write this letter. Let's all get some exercise and make a change.
1259	1263	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I firmly believe that more people should use computers. They offer advantages that writing on paper cannot, such as learning about non - school subjects, communicating with friends online, and storing various data in one place.  Computers allow people to learn about things not covered in school, like current events, national history, and how the government functions. Some may argue that news can be obtained from @CAPS1 or newspapers. However, a computer can present news in both article and video formats. In my opinion, online news is less condensed visually than @CAPS1 news.  Another benefit is the ability to communicate with friends over the internet. This is especially useful when friends move away. I had a friend who moved to Pittsburgh when I was @NUM1. After getting a @CAPS3 account, I was able to find and talk to him before his visit. It also helps to stay in touch with friends at different schools.  Finally, computers can store pictures, videos, documents, and contacts on the hard drive. This is crucial for me as I'm not well - organized with schoolwork. When I started using my computer for some school tasks, it helped me reduce clutter and keep all my work in one place. I can also email my work to teachers or share notes with absent friends.  In conclusion, computers can aid in learning, facilitate communication with friends, and help organize data. That's why I think more people should use them.
1260	1264	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am convinced that computers do not have a positive impact on people. Thanks to computers, people are less active, less likely to enjoy nature, and interact less with family and friends.  People are not getting enough exercise because they are too engrossed in computer games. This leads to weight gain, which is already a problem in @LOCATION1 due to unnecessary technology. There are numerous sports like soccer, baseball, and football that people could engage in. Before computers, people were more active and managed well without them.  Computers also prevent people from enjoying nature. Instead of exploring the outdoors, people spend too much time looking up beautiful places and animals online. A walk in the forest, a local park, or by the beach would expose them to a variety of animals, plants, and flowers right near their homes.  Moreover, computers reduce face - to - face interaction. Some people are too busy on social media platforms like Facebook or MySpace, or sending emails and @CAPS3 messages. Sometimes, they may not even be communicating with the real person, which is both dangerous and unhealthy. It's absurd to email a friend who lives nearby when a short walk to their house would be a healthier and more direct way to communicate.  In conclusion, computers make people less active, less likely to enjoy nature, and less likely to interact with others. They clearly do not have a positive effect on people. I hope you will agree and limit computer use to professionals.
1261	1265	1	2	Dear editors, I had planned to take a trip to @LOCATION1. With a computer, I obtained the directions in an instant. Computers are excellent and user - friendly devices. However, as technology advances, people are increasingly relying on computers for entertainment. Some people in @MONTH1 may disagree, but there are numerous outdoor activities that are healthier than sitting in front of a computer all day. These include socializing, enjoying the great outdoors, and engaging in sports. @CAPS1 is a well - known program for social interaction, yet it poses significant risks. For instance, anyone can view your profile, which contains personal information. You don't necessarily have to chat online. You could call a friend and go to a local movie theater. Many people, and I concur, believe that watching a movie with friends is far more enjoyable than playing online chess or other virtual games. If you're not a fan of movies, you can go for a walk, a bike ride, or even walk your dog while cycling. @ORGANIZATION1 park is an ideal place for a vacation. You can camp out at @TIME1 and bike during the day. It's a beautiful part of nature and one of the best parks anywhere in the world. Camping on the weekend is a great way to get closer to your family and friends. Hiking, a popular activity in parks, can be enjoyed by people of all ages. So, go out and spend a weekend outdoors instead of staring at a computer screen. Soccer, baseball, basketball, and lacrosse are just some of the many fun and healthy sports. Every town has sports fields where people of all ages gather. It's also an excellent way to make friends in person, not just over the internet. Exercising while having fun is much better than simply having fun on a computer. Stop reading this article and go out to meet new friends, visit a local park, or play a sport. There are countless things to do besides using a computer, so go and explore!
1262	1266	1	2	I really like using computers and believe they bring benefits to society for several reasons. In today's world, it's essential to stay informed about global events. Instead of constantly watching the news or reading newspapers, you can use the internet on a computer to quickly access the latest information. This is one reason why computers are beneficial. Another advantage is that computers enable people to communicate with others online. You can talk to family and friends you haven't seen or heard from in a long time, even if you don't have their phone numbers. Just log on to the internet, and you can start chatting. Additionally, having a computer allows you to explore the internet and discover facts about people, things, and places you previously knew nothing about. It broadens your knowledge. Moreover, with a computer, you can attend school online without leaving your home. This can keep many people out of trouble as they don't need to go out. Although I have to end this letter, I hope that after sharing these reasons and details, you'll agree with me that having a computer is a great idea.
1263	1267	1	2	In my view, computers have a positive impact on people. They enable you to communicate with individuals from all corners of the world. Learning about different places is much faster on a computer than reading a book. Moreover, many jobs now require employees to have computer skills. Computers are both educational and fun. Imagine how difficult it would be to communicate with someone living in @LOCATION1 without a computer. Thanks to computers, it's as simple as turning on the device. Many teachers enjoy organizing activities with pen - pals, which would be extremely challenging and costly if they had to write letters or make phone calls. When looking for specific information, such as about Florida, a computer is far more convenient. You just type in your query, rather than spending hours searching through numerous books, where you might not even find what you need. The computer has millions of pieces of information and various pictures. Another significant benefit is that most modern jobs prefer to hire people who can operate computers. You can perform tasks on a computer that are impossible on paper, like creating animated movies and video games, which have advanced over the years due to computer technology. Finally, computers are not only educational but also entertaining. You can research information, do homework, and play games. They can be programmed to simulate jobs for policemen, ambulance drivers, and doctors, which can save lives. That's why I firmly believe computers have a positive effect on people. Without computers, our country might not be as advanced as it is today.
1264	1268	1	2	People use computers daily, and there are numerous reasons for their constant use. They might be chatting with family members or searching for jobs. Everyone has their own reasons, and others shouldn't dictate how they use their time. In @LOCATION1, many people use computers to catch up with old friends. They can also use webcams to see each other. Business people are frequently on computers to print documents and send information to other countries. They do a great deal of work on computers. Although they can take a quick jog at @TIME1, it's their choice whether to focus on work or maintain their health as they are busy. On the other hand, non - business users of computers include students and parents. In @LOCATION1, students often have projects and need to use computers to look up information. Parents help their children, talk to relatives, and may search for a new home or job. People should be allowed to do their work. Once they're done, they can exercise if they want. If they choose not to, it's their decision. The increasing use of computers is mainly affecting them, not others. However, too much computer use can lead to poor eyesight due to the excessive light.
1265	1269	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, I've noticed that many people are worried about the technology boom and over - reliance on computers. I'm certain that technological upgrades are harming people. Email and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 have led to a decline in our already poor communication skills. Moreover, we're spending less time exercising outdoors because of the technology revolution, which is filled with unreliable information. Why are we hurting ourselves instead of helping? It's evident that many teens are growing up without proper communication skills. I once read a persuasive essay that used @CAPS3 @CAPS4 - based language, which shows that we're forgetting the proper grammar of the @CAPS7 language. I've also noticed that my friends use slang terms like ""@CAPS8"" and ""@CAPS9"" in their conversations. I understand that computers offer a faster and easier way to communicate, but we can't neglect the value of @CAPS10. People who don't want to become obese should be cautious. If they keep sitting in front of their computers, they'll join the millions of obese Americans. When people sit at their computers, they often bring junk food. Instead of spending hours with @ORGANIZATION2 and being creative, they're wasting their time. Would a citizen rather pay for a computer or enjoy the vast, free, and beautiful outdoors? People are also wasting their attention on unreliable information. In fact, over a certain proportion of the information on the internet isn't reliable. Statistics show that nearly @PERCENT1 of students use certain sites, and they tend to score lower than those who look for research in textbooks. There's nothing difficult about traditional research methods. Clearly, students who do proper research will get better grades than their classmates. Why are people filling their minds with unreliable information? In conclusion, the impact of computers on people is very negative. Many people lack communication skills, are more likely to become obese, and are hurting themselves by being obsessed with inaccurate information. I urge people to put aside @PERSON1 and @CAPS11 PC and embrace @ORGANIZATION2, which is truly beautiful."
1266	1270	1	2	To the Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have an extremely positive impact on people. They enable individuals to develop hand - eye coordination, learn about distant people and cultures, and communicate online via email or instant messaging. All these aspects are compelling reasons to use computers. Computer skills are essential in various jobs, and there's no better time to start acquiring them than now. Hand - eye coordination is crucial in life. It is required in many jobs; for example, in an office, one has to watch the screen while typing. Online communication is very popular today. @CAPS6, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 are just a few of the numerous websites where people can interact through instant messaging or email. These platforms allow users to find family members, friends, and more. One can stay in touch with a friend out of state or converse with someone from another country. Many people use their spare time to arrange reunions with those they knew from middle school to college. A large number of these people haven't seen each other since @NUM1. Clearly, contacting people through the internet is widely practiced today. In conclusion, I wholeheartedly support the use of computers as they are vital to people's daily lives. Whether it's building hand - eye coordination, researching a country, or connecting with family and friends through @CAPS3, @CAPS2, @CAPS6, the internet is highly valuable, and I hope you share the same view.
1267	1271	1	2	The computer is a remarkable achievement of humanity. It is highly useful for quickly retrieving information and possesses numerous other capabilities. Although computers are an extremely useful tool in the modern world, they also have negative effects on people. People are not getting enough exercise because they are constantly on the computer. Additionally, they are becoming less socially active. The most significant and perhaps most detrimental effect is the excessive freedom people have on the internet. Exercise is one of the most important factors for a long and healthy life. People should at least take a long walk every day. If they sit in front of a computer all day, there will be more health problems. People should strive for a healthy lifestyle rather than being surrounded by computers everywhere. People are also losing their ability to interact, and life is becoming dull. Everyone is either texting someone. What's most astonishing is the prevalence of online dating. This is terrible because one might be dating a crazy person. If a couple thinks they are in love but doesn't know how to interact when they meet, there will be real problems. Even when using the computer, that time could be spent socializing with friends and family. Finally, the vast amount of freedom associated with computers is a major issue. There are many bullies, people trying to sell things, and those seeking personal information. Many kids sign up for platforms like Facebook without being careful. They disclose personal details like their address and don't pay attention to who is sending them friend requests. Computers have far too many negative effects on people. It would be excellent if the system could be improved, and people need to be more responsible. People should get out and interact, take a walk, and not let computers control their lives.
1268	1272	1	2	Have you ever owned a computer? I'm certain that if you're around my age, you know how much fun it is to explore the internet. It's like a vast reservoir of information. However, it's not good to abandon everything and just sit in front of the computer. Things such as exercise, socializing, and doing homework are important. If you don't exercise, you'll start to gain weight. If you don't socialize, you'll become a lonely person. Homework is the most crucial because it will help you succeed in life. It's okay to use the computer occasionally, but not for hours on end. Exercising keeps you in shape. If you plan to play sports, you should jog a few times a day. Some people make you feel bad if you're bigger than them. For instance, I knew someone who was a bit overweight for his age, and others made fun of him. You should focus on more important things than the computer. Do you have any friends? Or did they all leave you because you wouldn't stop surfing the web? As a teenager, you should be socializing with friends at the movies, arcades, and parties, not staying at home on the computer. It's especially important to interact with your family. You never know when they might go shopping for you, and in my opinion, ignoring them for the computer is selfish. Since you got your computer, have your grades been dropping? Education is the most important thing in life. Without it, you can't achieve much because you won't have a degree to get a job. If you don't have a job, how can you pay the electricity bill for your computer? Education can take you anywhere if you want it. Otherwise, you could end up like a homeless person on the street with a non - working computer. Do you still think the computer has a positive impact on people? You should talk to parents about getting their children a computer. For example, suggest that parents set a password only they know, so the child has to ask for permission every time they need to use it. Block content that you think is inappropriate for your child, especially if your child is interested in inappropriate things. That's why I don't think the computer always has the right kind of effect on people.
1269	1273	1	2	"Dear newspaper, imagine the fresh air cooling your skin and the wind in your hair as you run beside your best friend. Then, think about the millions of people spending their time chatting on the computer. You might also wonder how much exercise these people get and whether they can interact properly with friends and family. Consider your own lifestyle. Is it dominated by computers, or is it free and full of activity? When you think about chatting with people, do you envision face - to - face communication or chatting via AIM? I surveyed my friends, and five out of ten go home and chat with friends online. This concerns me because these kids are usually talkative but don't play sports, and I'm still trying to understand the problem. I asked questions like ""What do you do at home?"" and ""Are you a computer geek?"" (These @CAPS2 questions were just to support my survey). The next time you're invited to chat online, decline before you become addicted to the computer. The amount of exercise a person gets varies. Some people are constantly on their computers, like the characters in the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 (a Comcast commercial), while others have little to no knowledge of computers. I'm here to highlight the benefits of exercising rather than the artificial aspects of computer use. Did you know that people can lose weight by exercising? Picking up an old curling weight and doing one curl is far better than clicking a computer mouse. Try it if you don't believe me. Interacting with people is a vital part of our lives. It's how we receive and give orders, and it's much faster than sending an email. Without interaction, we can suffer from depression. Depression can make people sick. For example, my father, when @CAPS5 got divorced, the depression affected his body and mind. At the age of @NUM1, @CAPS5 had a rip in his small intestine that became infected and could have been life - threatening. I believe this was due to a lack of communication, and this kind of thing happens every day. Just open your eyes and realize what a computer can do to a person. (@CAPS5 remarried Bonnie and now has a scar on his belly). This movement should change people's opinions. Do people spend too much time on computers? Just go outside and talk to your neighbor to see what they think. I sincerely hope you'll consider my argument."
1270	1274	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, it's true that some people spend most of their day on computers, but not everyone does. Let me clarify that not all people take advantage of computers in a negative way. For example, scientists, banks, and schools rely on computers to facilitate various processes. These types of computer uses are essential for our lives. Without them, we would be ignorant about many things. However, there are indeed people who misuse computers. One of the most serious issues is child porn, which is a major problem in the world. It is also closely related to kidnapping, and in rare cases, parents may be involved. There are many changes that need to be made. Once these problems are resolved, the computer world will become a more peaceful place. In conclusion, while computers have many positive applications, we must address the negative aspects to ensure a safer and more beneficial digital environment.
1271	1275	1	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I firmly believe that the current situation where people are spending excessive time on computers is a concerning issue. In this letter, I would like to share my thoughts on the effects of computer usage on people's time management, activities, and what I term as ""computer dead"". Computers have become so prevalent in our world that people are spending an inordinate amount of time on them. I propose that individuals set a timer for their computer usage. For instance, setting a @NUM1 - hour limit and then logging off once the time is up. This measure would be beneficial because excessive time spent indoors in front of the computer means a lack of exercise, which is detrimental to our health. Parents play a crucial role in setting an example for their children. If parents use the computer for @NUM2, children will think it is acceptable behavior. As a result, children may spend all their time on the computer, neglecting time with friends. Kids today should spend more time outdoors rather than playing computer games. Moreover, if both parents and children are on the computer, they miss out on valuable time together. ""Computer dead"" is a state where all one wants to do is use the computer. We need to be more responsible in our computer usage. Otherwise, we may develop withdrawal symptoms from the computer and end up spending even more time on it. Once this ""computer dead"" state takes hold, it will gradually dominate our lives, and it will be extremely difficult to break free from excessive computer use. Thank you for taking the time to read about the importance of managing our time, proper computer usage, and the concept of ""computer dead"". I sincerely hope you will consider my thoughts."
1272	1276	1	2	Dear editor, I concur that people spend too much time on their computers. By reading this, you will understand my reasons, which revolve around exercise, relationships with friends, and family. Firstly, the lack of exercise due to excessive computer use is a significant problem. When one is constantly on the computer, they lose focus on physical activity. If you are eating @CAPS1 and not exercising because you are preoccupied with the computer, the weight you gain will not burn off on its own. As a result, you will keep gaining weight, and before you know it, you may become overweight and regret spending so much time on the computer. Secondly, excessive computer use also affects your relationships with family. For example, your family may want to go out, but you decline because of the computer. This lack of communication with family can cause strain in relationships. Finally, being addicted to the computer not only isolates you from family but also from friends. You may quit your sports teams, such as basketball or softball, because you think they take up too much of your computer time. Eventually, you may lose many friendships, and even your romantic partner may break up with you. I hope that by presenting these reasons, I have made my point about the negative impacts of excessive computer use.
1273	1277	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to express my firm belief that computers bring numerous benefits to society. Computers enable us to learn about places we wish to visit. We can gather information about these destinations, purchase plane tickets through computer - based platforms, and then embark on exciting journeys to explore these places. In the coming years, computers will become even more integral to our lives. Everything, including education and entertainment, will be accessible through computer - based platforms like the World Wide Web. We will be able to receive our education online and enjoy various games on the internet. Moreover, computers simplify our lives. Instead of using a phone to call friends or family, we can communicate with them online. We can also chat with them through instant messaging platforms without having to visit their homes. In conclusion, computers clearly benefit society. They allow us to learn about new places, will be the main medium for everything in the future, and make our daily lives more convenient.
1274	1278	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, in my opinion, the computer has several positive effects on people. While it may not be perfect, it is beneficial for multiple reasons, and I will share three of them here. One reason is that computers allow people to search for new places and meet new people. With a computer, one can use search engines like Google to find information about places they want to visit. Along the way, they can meet new people, which may reduce their time spent on the computer as they get busy with their new social circle. Another reason is that computers are useful when people have nothing to do. They can invite friends over and watch movies online without going to the theater or paying. There are numerous websites where one can download movies. Finally, teenagers often rely heavily on computers. Since teenagers are technology - oriented, taking the computer away from them may lead to negative consequences. One solution could be to allow them to use laptops outside. In summary, these are my thoughts on the positive effects of computers on people.
1275	1279	1	2	"Computers have significantly benefited society in multiple ways. One of the most prominent advantages is the ability to socialize online. People can communicate with anyone around the world through the internet. I often have video chats with my pen - pal from @LOCATION2. Social websites such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter are extremely popular today. Currently, @PERCENT1 of people have an account on at least one of these platforms, and this number is increasing daily. Additionally, modern technology has made video games more social. @NUM1 in @NUM2 kids play with friends they know while gaming. Using computers can also improve hand - eye coordination, which is crucial in many sports. As @PERSON1 said, ""I don't know if I'd be @CAPS2 good of a tennis player without using a computer to boost my hand - eye coordination."" Hand - eye coordination allows us to perform tasks more efficiently. For example, I can copy notes faster as I can write while looking at the board. Computers can improve hand - eye coordination by @PERCENT2. Computers are also excellent tools for learning. We can learn about interesting places on the internet and plan vacations. For @DATE1 break, my dad and I used the internet to learn about @LOCATION1, and then we decided to go there and bought tickets. We can also learn about historical figures, with over ten billion articles available on famous people in history. If you are a cook, you can learn new recipes online. As @ORGANIZATION1 stated, ""As an @ORGANIZATION1, I learned most of my cooking online."" Moreover, you can learn how to improve your sports techniques. Before joining the swim team, I looked up online how to improve my swim technique, and it helped me qualify to go to @CAPS3 with my team by improving my time by two seconds. In conclusion, I firmly believe that the computer is an amazing invention that has had a profound impact on society."
1276	1280	1	2	To the editor of Newspaper @CAPS1, computers offer substantial benefits to society. This view is based on three key aspects: they are an inexhaustible source of knowledge, host numerous online community websites, and provide an enjoyable user experience. As a well - known fact, computers serve as an infinite reservoir of knowledge. Adults often need to conduct work - related research, and the computer is an ideal tool for this purpose. Similarly, students can utilize the computer's internet for school projects and homework. Moreover, people, especially kids and teens, like to communicate with friends. Many sign up for online community websites. Although there are concerns about online pedophiles, adding real - life friends to these platforms can mitigate this risk. Finally, computers are simply fun to use. After a long day at school, kids can unwind by playing games on the computer. This is not just a form of idleness but also a means to distract from daily stress. In conclusion, the vast knowledge, vibrant online communities, and entertainment value of computers make them a valuable asset to society.
1277	1281	1	2	"Computers indeed benefit society significantly. They equip kids with knowledge about things that are otherwise inaccessible in real life. Additionally, they offer entertainment and help build a positive self - image. Online platforms such as Facebook and @CAPS1 also enable kids to interact with one another. When kids encounter a question they can't answer, they can turn to Google for solutions. Using search engines like Google or other ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"" sites, kids can look up information on various topics, including facts about other countries, famous people, and different types of pets. Another advantage is that the internet provides entertainment for kids, which can enhance their self - confidence. Just because they're not playing outside doesn't mean they can't have fun indoors. Parents also hope to see their kids make friends. Through platforms like Facebook, @CAPS1, or @CAPS5, kids can befriend others in their town or from different @CAPS6. In summary, computers are beneficial as they offer knowledge, facilitate new friendships, and allow kids to enjoy their childhood."
1278	1282	1	2	Dear newspaper editor, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own and use computers daily. However, this widespread use of computers is harming our nation and needs to be curbed. Millions of parents and children spend at least @NUM1 minutes a day on the computer, either working or playing. There are many @CAPS2 and other types of games on the internet, which kids use for entertainment. But it is unacceptable for an @NUM2 - year - old child to play games featuring guns. Kids often become so engrossed in these addictive games that they neglect sports and outdoor activities. This lack of exercise and fresh air can lead to obesity and other weight - related issues. Given that @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 are already obese, it's unwise to keep these harmful games available. There are good and bad ways to use computers. Good uses include planning vacations, working, or checking a child's grades online. Unfortunately, many kids and parents don't use computers for these purposes. Kids have been involved in looking at porn, buying illegal drugs, hacking systems, and other criminal activities. The computer allows people to engage in improper behavior while hiding their identities. For example, when signing up for a website subscription, personal information such as name, address, and phone number is often required. To protect personal information, one may use false details as taught by parents. We can't be sure that people don't use illegal programs in a similar way. Computers also pose risks to @LOCATION1's well - being. In addition to obesity, there have been reports of seizures, visual imprints from games, and even a case where a child killed their parents in a fit of rage. When parents try to limit their children's game - playing, such as deleting accounts or confiscating computers, it can cause kids to have mental breakdowns, including smashing computers, performing poorly in school, and in extreme cases, attempting suicide. In conclusion, computers contribute to health, behavioral, and mental problems. To restore @LOCATION1 to its former state, we must address this computer addiction.
1279	1283	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, a recent poll indicates that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have used or come into contact with computers, and @PERCENT2 of them use computers daily, not just for work. This heavy reliance on technology has negative impacts on society. It leads to a decrease in exercise, a reduced appreciation for nature, and less face - to - face interaction with family and friends. Health professor @PERSON1 states that the main reason people don't exercise is a lack of time, which can be directly linked to the fact that @CAPS2 spend an average of @NUM1 and a half hours a day on the computer. One might argue that computer use helps people learn new things, but it does little to promote physical health. For instance, while one can view a beautiful hummingbird on a computer screen, they can't truly experience the fresh air and the wonder of nature. The computer can only show nature, but one must go outside to fully appreciate it. Computer enthusiasts claim that it helps with global communication, but it distances people from those around them at work, school, or home. Humans need real - world contact, and typing on a computer is no substitute for face - to - face conversation. In conclusion, excessive computer use is not beneficial to society. It reduces physical activity, replaces in - person enjoyment of nature, and limits personal communication. It's time to recognize that computers pose a threat to society.
1280	1284	1	2	In my opinion, the technological advancements of computers bring far more benefits than drawbacks. There are multiple ways in which computers are useful, including in education, learning about the world, and communication. When it comes to school, which many students dislike, the internet can be a great aid. For example, if you're struggling with geometry, you can visit @PERSON1 academy for informative videos. A third - grade teacher can go to @LOCATION1, an educational and fun website, when dealing with energetic kids. You can also listen to math help with earphones for relaxation and learning. The internet is like a large and easily accessible library. On a rainy day, when you want to learn about distant places, you can simply type into a search engine. If you're in Germany and can't understand the @CAPS2 language on the menus, you can use your laptop for translation, making it easy to learn about foreign places. Communication is also made simple through the internet. There are emails, Skype, chatrooms, etc. In an emergency when your phone is unavailable or the phone lines are cut, you can use email. You can even use the internet to remind @PERSON2 to pick up red bull. In summary, the internet is excellent for communication, helps with learning about far - off places, and supports education. These are the reasons why I believe the internet is highly valuable in today's world.
1281	1285	1	2	Computers have a profoundly positive impact on me. They offer numerous benefits to humanity. Firstly, they enable people to learn about distant places. For instance, when a family is planning a vacation to @LOCATION1 and knows nothing about it, they can use a computer to book a hotel reservation. Secondly, computers are invaluable for educational purposes. If you have a school project and need information not available in books, the computer is the go - to resource. Also, if someone is physically disabled and needs to file taxes online, they can visit www.turbotax.com and handle their taxes right from home. Thirdly, computers facilitate communication. If you've lost contact with a friend or family member, you can find them online and plan a catch - up. Even when guardians have concerns about their child, they can address the situation through digital means. In conclusion, we need computers for communication, for work or school assignments, and to learn about new places. I have a passion for computers, and I hope this has convinced you to appreciate them more.
1282	1286	1	2	Dear newspaper, have you ever sat at your computer desk with a nice, cold cake? I firmly believe that computers benefit society. One advantage is that they save people from spending hours standing in a bookstore or library. Instead of struggling to find a book, one can sit at a computer for ten minutes or less and access any information about anything or anywhere. For example, if you want to learn about @LOCATION1, the computer can provide all the details. Another benefit is global communication. People can chat with others around the world. Moreover, experts have conducted tests and found that using computers helps improve hand - eye coordination. Those who use computers have better hand - eye coordination than those who don't. In conclusion, computers clearly benefit society by making information access easier, enabling global communication, and enhancing hand - eye coordination.
1283	1287	1	2	I am firmly convinced that computers bring multiple benefits to society. Firstly, computers serve as excellent learning tools. At home and school, children use them for educational purposes. In some school grades, there are special typing programs to improve typing skills, and there are also hard - drive discs that can make reading more engaging for young kids. Online, one can visit websites with sample math problems, print them out, and practice. These are all great ways to make learning enjoyable and effective. Secondly, computers simplify daily life. They can provide local weather information, allowing you to quickly check if school is cancelled in winter. When working on projects, it's easy to look up information on the computer. It also offers useful links for writing papers, creating PowerPoint presentations, and making Excel spreadsheets, which can be used for graphing science results or typing papers for @CAPS2. Lastly, computers enhance communication. When I'm sick and absent from school, I can email my teachers and ask about makeup work. Social media platforms like Facebook, AIM, MySpace, and Skype are fast and fun ways to communicate with friends. You can also email friends and family far away. In conclusion, computers are a great asset as they aid in learning, simplify daily tasks, and make communication easier.
1284	1288	1	2	I am of the opinion that computers have a positive influence on people. Firstly, using computers enhances hand - eye coordination. When using the keyboard while looking at the screen, one develops this important skill. Hand - eye coordination is useful in sports, exercise, and even in professional settings. For example, in an office, being coordinated makes a better impression than being clumsy. Secondly, computers have an amazing ability to search the web. They allow us to conduct millions of searches on any topic. In fifth grade, I did a research project on @LOCATION2, and the computer provided all the information I needed. When there was a devastating earthquake in @LOCATION4, computers helped spread the word and mobilize aid. Also, when planning a vacation, a family can handle most arrangements online, like buying flight tickets, booking a hotel, and renting a car. My family's vacation to @LOCATION1 was a success because of the computer. Lastly, computers facilitate communication with distant friends and family. I use video chat to talk to my grandparents in @LOCATION3 as I rarely see them. When my dad is on business trips, we use instant messaging or video chat. We can also communicate with those fighting in @LOCATION5 through video chat. In conclusion, computers are beneficial as they improve hand - eye coordination, enable research, and enhance communication. I hope you agree that computers have a positive impact on people today.
1285	1289	1	2	While computers have their merits, there are also some negative aspects. Spending too much time on computers is not good for health as people need exercise to stay fit. If one plays games all day on a computer, they won't learn much, and their focus will shift from school to the screen, which can make a person, whether a child or an adult, dull and unproductive. It's a pity to waste one's life because of excessive computer use. Some people think technology is useless, believing that a smart person should rely on their own brain rather than a computer. Also, many poor people have never had a computer or even heard of modern technology, and in some countries, people can't afford electricity, let alone computers. However, computers also have positive sides. They help people find locations, and without a cellphone, one can use a computer to call friends, go online, listen to music, play games, chat with friends and family, and watch movies. Learning to use a computer can be a bit challenging, from turning it on to using the keyboard and typing fast. And online gaming allows people to chat with other players. In conclusion, despite the negative effects, computers have many positive reasons for a lot of people, and that's why I believe they have a significant impact on our lives.
1286	1290	1	2	"In my view, computers are among the greatest inventions and have a positive influence on people. With a computer, one can listen to music, watch shows, conduct research for projects, or simply have a good time. Computers facilitate the creation, consumption, and production of music and shows. They expose users to other musicians, inspiring them to create their own music, and provide tools to add beats and different vocals. One can also watch a wide variety of shows on a computer, and some even use special programs to create movies. Moreover, the computer is a vast source of information. It can help find answers to numerous questions, including potential cures for diseases like cancer. Even simple research queries, such as ""Who founded @CAPS2,"" can be quickly answered with a Google search. Although there are concerns that people may become lazy due to computers, they undeniably simplify life. Instead of poring over dozens of books, one can search for information online. Online classes are also available. Another significant advantage is socializing. While online socializing may not be as effective as in - person interaction, it gives quieter individuals, like me, a chance to express themselves without the awkward silences often experienced on the phone. For example, I use Facebook to keep in touch with family and friends I no longer see regularly. I lost touch with a close friend after we switched schools but found her on Facebook. There are also countless online games for younger people. All in all, it seems clear that computers have a positive impact on people. What do you think? Can one major negative outweigh numerous positives? I believe it can't."
1287	1291	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 of my local newspaper, I hope you don't believe the so - called experts' claims about computers being a health risk. They argue that excessive computer use leads to a lack of exercise and poor family interaction. However, users should have the self - control to limit their computer time, and parents should set boundaries for their children. Computers are highly convenient when one needs immediate information on a topic. The responsibility for lack of exercise lies with the individual. People should have the motivation to exercise, but some who spend all day on the computer claim it's not their fault. I read last week that someone even told the press that her weight gain was not her fault. This is absurd. The only one to blame for not getting enough exercise is the user. Regarding family interaction, parents are in control. They should ensure their children don't over - indulge in computer use. The operator must have the willpower to know when to stop and set limits. Without home computers, it would be a hassle. Kids rely on computers for quick and accurate information. Otherwise, parents would have to take their children to and from the library, which is time - consuming. And let's not forget the ease of access the internet provides. In conclusion, computers are a great asset. They are not the cause of lack of exercise or poor family interaction. Their convenience makes them a valuable addition to our lives. I sincerely hope you agree with my opinion after reading this letter.
1288	1292	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I'd like to share why computers aren't all bad. Firstly, computers are useful for gathering information for projects. For instance, if you're working on a project about countries like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, or @LOCATION1, a computer offers a wider range of knowledge compared to a single book. A book may not have all the information you need for your project, but a computer can access a vast amount of data. Secondly, you can reconnect with old friends. There are multiple platforms like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, Twitter, and Yahoo where you can communicate. It's also a great way to make new friends or talk to family members. Talking to family is especially nice as they already know you well. Finally, computers are a great tool to learn new things. You can use search engines like Google, Ask, or Wikipedia to find answers to questions you've always wondered about. Of course, books are also full of answers and ideas. In conclusion, there are many ways to get the answers you need. However, this doesn't mean you should be glued to the computer all the time. It's important to go outside, play with friends, and enjoy the outdoors. So, use your computer time wisely and then head out to have some real - world fun.
1289	1293	1	2	Dear local news papers, I'm writing to say that using the computer isn't a bad thing. Do you prefer to be bored or be entertained while learning? Being on the computer improves hand - eye coordination. For example, my grandpa was in the @ORGANIZATION1, and when @NUM1 people were firing at him, his good hand - eye coordination, which he developed from using the computer, saved his life. Good hand - eye coordination can also prevent accidents like getting your hand caught in a car door. Learning is another great benefit. The internet allows you to learn about anything. By learning about far - away places, you can expand your conversations, seem smarter to others, and actually become more knowledgeable. Most importantly, you can talk to friends. You can use platforms like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, Twitter, and Yahoo to communicate. Communicating online can boost your self - esteem. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of people do better in school if they communicate online? It's also great to talk to family members as they know you well. I'm sharing these ideas and concerns with you and hope you'll consider them and spread the word.
1290	1294	1	2	Imagine our lovely town filled with unhealthy, lazy, non - interacting, and computer - addicted people. The question we need to address is whether local people should spend excessive time on computers. I firmly believe, as @PERCENT1 suggests, that we shouldn't. Computers can damage your eyesight. Eye doctor @PERSON1 said that each year, more people come to the eye clinic. A local newspaper chart showed that the number of people with computer - related eye problems has increased significantly. Almost everyone addicted to computers wears glasses. Also, computers make us miss out on nature. With @DATE2 approaching and leaves on the trees, if you're constantly on the computer, you won't notice these beautiful natural changes. Computers also harm family relationships. I remember one time I wanted to play catch with my dad, but he was on his computer. I ended up staying inside and going on my own computer. Moreover, excessive computer use leads to an unhealthy lifestyle. People would rather be couch potatoes, chatting online and eating junk food instead of staying fit and interacting in person. Picture lazy, obese people sitting on the couch all day with blood - shot eyes from staring at the monitor. A man was rushed to the hospital due to a common cancer caused by an unhealthy lifestyle and passed away @NUM2 days later, according to @PERSON2 from the hospital. In conclusion, spending too much time on the computer is a bad idea. It ruins eyesight, makes us miss nature and family time, and is extremely unhealthy. We need to decide whether to take the risk or stay fit, healthy, and happy. So, go for a jog, eat a healthy snack, and limit your computer time.
1291	1295	1	2	An increasing number of individuals are using computers. They appreciate computers for accessing news from distant places. Computers are beneficial for everyone in the world. It seems that no one can live without them. However, there are also those who have no interest in computers. I know that among families and friends, many have computers and use them to communicate. For example, on platforms like MySpace, one can have friends and family connections from all over the world. Nevertheless, some people spend excessive amounts of time on their computers. In conclusion, while computers offer great convenience and connection, it is important to use them in moderation.
1292	1296	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, I have some thoughts on the current state of technology. Many people are hesitant about further technological advancements, which is understandable as it can draw people away from their families and divert their attention from the real world. I understand their concerns, but I also want to present my own perspective. Although statistics show a @PERCENT1 decline in recreational activities, people are also finding new things to do. With the growing global concern for the environment, more people may start going outdoors. They might join a new environmental activist group after hearing about it or try live - action role - playing after watching a related movie. The media can offer unexpected discoveries, which is better than sitting outside aimlessly, waiting for parents to bring news from the outside world.  Another aspect is the music industry. It has been revolutionized with advanced and diverse ways of listening to music. The main issue today lies with some artists who take advantage of recording studios and sometimes others just to gain fame by lip - syncing without real talent. However, modern technology allows us to enjoy music like in the golden age. Investing in the music industry and promoting technological advancement can provide long - term entertainment and fun. It may also be beneficial for the economy. If we didn't have new @CAPS3 to sell each year, there would be a significant decline in stock market prices, and the current economic situation wouldn't improve. This also applies to cell phones and other frequently upgraded hardware, which is good for business.  I believe the purpose of life is to find joy. For many, it's more enjoyable to relax with a date, some candlelight, and watch a romance or thriller on the @CAPS4.V. Television has evolved in many positive ways. It's a great way to unwind, learn about different things, and feel like you're in a place like @LOCATION1 without actually being there. It keeps us updated on current events, shows us things we want to do and how to do them. I, for one, have learned a great deal from it. In conclusion, we should embrace technological advancement as it brings various benefits in different aspects of our lives.
1293	1297	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 - republican, @CAPS2, namely computers, do have a positive impact on society, but they also have negative effects. Computers enable people to chat, voice - chat, or video - chat with family members in other countries. This would be extremely costly or even impossible via phone. They also offer numerous learning resources at one's fingertips. One of the positive aspects of computers is the ability to connect with people globally. Programs like Skype allow for free video, voice, or text chatting with people around the world, which would be prohibitively expensive on the phone. It gives people the chance to see family members they rarely meet.  Another advantage is the vast amount of resources and information available. The internet contains almost every piece of information imaginable. When writing a research paper, one can go to Wikipedia and find relevant information on various topics. The internet can be very helpful. The @CAPS2 also offers many good mind and puzzle games that aren't commonly available otherwise. There are numerous beneficial things on the internet that can stimulate the mind. If one can't afford a newspaper, they can read articles and stories online.  I also believe that @CAPS2 have a positive impact on people because they can replace many traditional activities. Instead of going to the @CAPS3, many people choose to use the @CAPS2. Usually, people can do more on the @CAPS2 than on the @ORGANIZATION1. In conclusion, computers have a positive influence on people and are surely the future. They allow us to play games, communicate, and even read the news.
1294	1298	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I've recently learned that you're debating the impact of computers on people. In my opinion, computers have a neutral effect. In today's world, computers are used for a variety of purposes, such as research and communication. Young people may spend a lot of time on computers because they have a great deal of computer - based homework. For adults working in large companies, computers are essential for collaborating with colleagues worldwide. Instead of traveling for meetings, they can use webcams.  I understand your concern about people spending too much time on computers. However, people who love reading or playing music also spend hours on their hobbies. There isn't much difference. For some, using a computer can be as engaging as a sport for others.  Computers are ubiquitous, found in homes, schools, crime, and medical labs. They are a primary source for databases, including @CAPS4 and criminal records. Without computers, it would be difficult to catch criminals or detect diseases in time.  In conclusion, while there are pros and cons to using computers, their importance in many key aspects of modern life means that the pros outweigh the cons.
1295	1299	1	2	"Dear @PERSON2, Have you noticed how much our society has changed in just ten years? This change is largely due to computers. While computers offer advantages such as messaging and access to information, they also detract from some important aspects of life: staying fit, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. Without these, life would be less fulfilling.  Surfing the web may be fun, but it has been proven to be unhealthy. According to @PERSON3, a specialist in obesity at @ORGANIZATION1, ""If a person spends more than two and a half hours on the computer every @TIME1 for about a month, they will experience a sudden increase in weight. If this behavior continues, they could gain up to one - third of their initial body weight without medical intervention."" Additionally, @PERCENT1 of computer users snack while online, which further contributes to weight gain. Computer enthusiasts often neglect exercise. Instead of taking half an hour away from the computer to play with a dog, go for a jog, or do aerobics, they prefer to stay in front of the screen. This can lead to health problems for them and future generations.  Nature is being ignored more than ever. @PERSON1 remembers when the trails @CAPS2 runs were full of people. ""@CAPS1"" @CAPS2 says, ""They're now overgrown with woods, and it's harder to clear them than it was to deal with people."" Due to new technologies, especially computers, nature lovers are decreasing in number, and the beauty of nature is being overlooked. Some worry that it may fade away completely if we don't take action.  Computers also have a negative impact on family life. Doctors and everyone can see that when computers and other technologies are available, there is less interaction within families. Mrs @PERSON4, an @NUM1 grade teacher in @LOCATION1, noticed that her family spent less time together after each member got a laptop.  In conclusion, computers have a negative influence on society. People don't make time to stay fit, nature is being ignored, and family interaction is poor. To address this, we should set aside some time each day to focus on these important aspects of life so that our lives with computers can still be beneficial."
1296	1300	1	2	I firmly believe that computers do not benefit society. While kids can acquire more knowledge through them, they tend to spend excessive time online. When children engage in online conversations, they often have no way of knowing the true identity of the other party. There are also technical issues with computers, such as file - deletion problems.   Kids spend too much time on computers. Although computers can teach various things, they also offer games. Children usually spend more time on games than on studying. Moreover, due to a lack of exercise, children can become aggressive and gain weight. They may even lose interest in other activities and only want to be on the computer.   Online, it's easy for people to create fake email addresses and false accounts on platforms like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 - space to obtain children's personal information. Even when chatting with someone with a familiar name, it might not be the person you think. For instance, I once thought I was talking to @CAPS2's cousin on @CAPS1, but it turned out to be his wife. So, one must be cautious about what to say and who they are really talking to.   Computers are also prone to viruses. When a virus infects a computer, it can delete important files. For example, if you save a news video as a favorite and then the computer gets a virus, the video will disappear from the website. Sometimes, the computer malfunctions and makes it difficult to access websites, requiring multiple clicks.   In conclusion, considering the excessive time kids spend on computers, the risks of online communication, and the technical problems, computers do not bring overall benefits to society. There are indeed many other reasons to support this view.
1297	1301	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I've noticed a debate regarding the impact of computers on people. Some believe computers have a positive effect, while others disagree. In my opinion, computers are having a significant impact on people today, and many are spending an inordinate amount of time on them.   The time people spend on computers is truly outrageous. Many just sit at home, playing games on their computers. Although computers are useful for paying bills and connecting with distant friends, some people abuse them. For example, they use the anonymity of the computer to make threatening remarks, which can lead to conflicts.   Computers can also be very dangerous. Social media sites like MySpace and Twitter can be risky for teens. Strangers may approach them and invite them to meet in person, which is extremely dangerous. Additionally, inappropriate pictures of a person may be posted on websites without their knowledge.   Hacking is another major concern, especially for those with webcams. Some people can hack into webcams and monitor your activities without your awareness. They can also access your computer's documents.   In conclusion, computers have a substantial impact on people today, and this issue needs to be addressed. We should find ways to mitigate the negative effects and ensure the safe use of computers.
1298	1302	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I think computers have both positive and negative effects on people, but I believe the positive effects outweigh the negative ones.   First, computers are essential for education. You can conduct almost any kind of research on them. For example, if you're doing homework and can't remember an answer, you can quickly find it online. Also, you can type your papers on the computer, which is beneficial when your handwriting is messy, allowing your teacher to read your work easily. Moreover, if you're sick or on vacation, you can work from home and send your work to your boss via email.   Another great aspect of computers is communication. There are numerous ways to communicate using a computer. For instance, you can send messages to people's cellphones. You can also communicate with others who are online or on various websites like @CAPS9, @CAPS10, etc. Video - chatting is also possible on platforms like @ORGANIZATION1.   Finally, computers offer a lot of fun. You can buy games from stores and download them onto your computer. My personal favorite is The Sims. While computer games can be addictive, as long as you don't play for excessive hours, there's no problem. There are also educational games that make learning enjoyable. You can also play free games or download them from the internet easily.   In conclusion, although computers have their drawbacks, I choose to focus on the positive side. They are educational, great for communication, and fun. I encourage you to see the bright side of computers as well.
1299	1303	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, when it comes to the pros and cons of computers, both sides present valid reasons. In my view, computers are very important for students like me.   Computers assist me and my classmates with assignments. Instead of spending time going to the library to look for a book that may not have the required information, we can find a wealth of valuable information on the internet. They also help develop hand - eye coordination. Typing is fast and neat. My handwriting isn't the best, but I can type quickly with few mistakes, so I don't need to worry about having the neatest handwriting.   Computers are the fastest way to do many things. If you spend too much time writing neatly, you may not have time to enjoy nature. Even my dad, an environmentalist, uses computers. However, we need to maintain a balance. The easy way isn't always the best. Just like caffeine, which is unhealthy in large amounts but helpful in small doses, computers should be used in moderation.   Trying to get rid of computers is unreasonable as they are now ubiquitous. In a recession, we don't need additional problems. While I prefer face - to - face communication with friends, a computer is a great alternative when that's not possible.   In conclusion, computers are very helpful, but the key is balance. We should use them in a way that maximizes their benefits while minimizing the negative impacts.
1300	1304	1	2	Do you want to discover new things, explore the world's mysteries, make overseas friends, or relax after @ORGANIZATION1? Thanks to advanced technology, many things that were once considered impossible decades ago are now achievable. We need to determine whether computers have a positive or negative impact on people, and I firmly believe they bring numerous benefits and opportunities to society.   Computers are widely used for educational purposes. Computer experts have developed countless programs to simplify @ORGANIZATION1 for kids. For example, @CAPS1 helps with essays and reports, preventing teachers from straining their eyes reading messy handwritten compositions. @ORGANIZATION2 aids in organization and calculation, and @ORGANIZATION3 enables the creation of dynamic presentations. Many schools have computer labs for students to complete their tasks, and @ORGANIZATION1 has provided laptops for students to work on projects and take tests, which saves a significant amount of paper and trees. Moreover, many colleges offer online courses, allowing people to obtain a degree from home.   Computers also offer great entertainment benefits. I've noticed that many teens enjoy playing cool games on the internet. It's an ideal way to relax after a stressful day. You can listen to the latest songs for free on some websites and watch a wide variety of movies online, eliminating the need for movie tickets and driving to the theater.   Contrary to the belief that computers isolate people from social life, they actually provide a chance to communicate with people worldwide. Decades ago, no one would have imagined being able to chat directly with someone thousands of miles away without mail or a telephone. When I went to @LOCATION1 @DATE1, I was grateful to computers for allowing me to stay in touch with my friends and relatives. I could quickly send them pictures of the local winter scenery.   In conclusion, computers have endless positive effects. They facilitate learning, provide entertainment, and improve communication. New technology also makes the earth greener by saving paper. We should popularize computers and make the most of their benefits.
1301	1305	1	2	"Dear editor, I firmly believe that computers are a valuable addition to any household. They offer significant assistance and entertainment. Firstly, they facilitate seamless communication with distant friends and family. Through platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Skype, staying connected has never been easier. As @PERSON2 states, ""I love Facebook because I can keep in touch with my family members in the @LOCATION1."" Moreover, researchers have found that individuals with accounts on these platforms develop closer family bonds compared to those without.  Computers also serve educational purposes effectively. Many parents utilize educational computer games to prepare their elementary - school children for school. A local mother remarks, ""@CAPS1's fun and gets my son prepared!"" Studies indicate that computer games are @PERCENT1 more effective than textbooks and worksheets in preparing children for school.  Entertainment is another major reason to have a computer at home. One can play various games such as cards, chess, or pinball, visit game websites like addictinggames.com, or watch videos on YouTube. @PERSON1 shares, ""I like to spend some of my free time on addictinggames.com."" A poll revealed that @PERCENT2 of kids and teens prefer online games to board games.  In conclusion, computers are essential in the home. They enable communication, support education, and provide entertainment. I am truly grateful for the computer in my home as my family and I use it daily for these very reasons. It is indeed one of the most important things in an average household."
1302	1306	1	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, my stance on the computer controversy is that computers are not only good but also indispensable in today's world. They are excellent tools for communication, a primary source of information, and are widely used in business operations.  Computers offer a great way to communicate. You can chat with friends, send emails to peers, and connect with others on various websites. For instance, when I forget my homework or school assignments, I simply use my computer to message a friend and get the necessary information. It's a quick and efficient method. There are also platforms where you can interact with people who share your interests, allowing you to make online friends. The computer breaks down geographical barriers, enabling connections regardless of location.  When it comes to information, the computer is a treasure trove. Have a question? Just type it into ""Google"" or ""@CAPS4"" and receive an immediate answer. Need to research a paper on @PERSON1? You can find thousands of websites filled with relevant information. You can search for any subject and easily access numerous sources. You can even identify a song you heard using your computer.  In the business environment, computers are equally crucial. They are used to send messages within the organization, create and present marketing campaigns, new product ideas, and many companies rely on the internet for advertising to reach a wider audience and sell their products.  In conclusion, computers are not over - used; rather, their wide range of applications makes them a necessity for everyone. They are a vital means of communication, a key source of information, and an essential part of the business world."
1303	1307	1	2	In my opinion, computers have a positive impact on people for several reasons. Firstly, they revolutionize communication. With computers, you can connect with people from all corners of the world. Instead of incurring high costs for long - distance phone calls, you can communicate for free via the internet. This not only saves money but also enriches our social lives. Without computers, our social interactions would be limited, and life would be less exciting.  Secondly, computers help with organization. If you have a lot of paperwork lying around, a computer provides features to store and organize things. This reduces stress and makes it easier to find what you need. Being more organized makes you feel better and more in control.  Finally, computers are a great source of entertainment. You can play games, listen to music, watch videos, and chat with friends. If you can't afford a game system, the computer offers a wide range of free games. You can also download music or visit websites with music content. Video chats with distant friends are also possible.  I hope I've convinced you that computers are great and have a positive effect on people. The ability to play games, store things, and chat with others is truly amazing.
1304	1308	1	2	Dear newspaper editor, do you have a computer? Do your kids spend excessive time on it, chatting with people on Facebook or MySpace? While it can be fun for a short while, some people get overly engrossed. They neglect exercise, avoid interacting with family and friends, and may even get into trouble at school or home.  Spending all your time on the computer leaves no time for exercise. It's not only unappealing but can also be harmful to your health in the long run. Time seems to fly when you're on the computer, and before you know it, hours have passed. Even adults are not immune. My mom was on the computer for an hour but felt it was only a few minutes.  I know this from personal experience. A few months ago, I spent a whole month coming home from school and spending several hours on the computer. It had a significant impact on my life. I stopped going out with friends on weekends and preferred to stay home when my family went out. My mom confronted me, and I realized I was missing out on a lot.  Kids who spend too much time on the computer may also face problems at school or home. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of kids who use the computer for long periods end up failing a class or being held back. They may also get in trouble at home for neglecting their chores.  I understand that computers are useful for looking up information and chatting with people for a short time. However, excessive use can really mess up your social life. We should use computers less, get out, exercise, have fun with family and friends, and perform well at school and home so that we can enjoy some computer time in a balanced way. I hope you can see things from my perspective.
1305	1309	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, a @CAPS2 is truly a remarkable piece of technology that has significantly influenced our daily lives. The question on many people's minds is whether computers have a positive or negative impact on us. In my view, despite the help they offer in certain aspects of daily life, computers generally bring more negative effects.  One major issue is that people are so preoccupied with their computers that they spend less time on other important things. They spend less time enjoying nature. Instead of going out to experience the beauty of the natural world, they sit in front of the screen. Moreover, they barely have time to interact with friends and family. For example, in a conversation, @CAPS5 asks @CAPS6 to go ride bikes, but @CAPS7 refuses, choosing to play on the computer instead.  Another concern is health. Nowadays, people are spending less time exercising. Instead, they sit at home on the computer or slouch on the couch with a laptop. This sedentary lifestyle is ignoring their health. I know it's hard to resist the temptation of the computer, but we shouldn't let it take over our minds and future.  The environment is also affected. When people use computers, fuel is burned, which harms the environment. People are so focused on technology that they don't care about their surroundings. If I could speak on behalf of nature, I'd say, ""@CAPS3 less computers and @CAPS3 more green!""  Family and friends are the most important things in life, but computers are causing a rift. Many people are distancing themselves from their loved ones because of excessive computer use.  In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on people. People are spending less time on their health, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family due to the advancement of technology. However, this is just my opinion, and it only matters if you find it reasonable. I hope people can strike a balance between technology and the real world."
1306	1310	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, I am writing to discuss the impact of technology on people. There is an argument that computers consume an excessive amount of people's time. I will elaborate on how technology hinders people from exercising and gaining life experiences.  The first reason computers negatively affect people is that when individuals are constantly glued to their computer screens, they lack opportunities for exercise. With the increasing number of children playing video - games or using computers, the childhood obesity rate is likely to rise gradually as they do not engage in physical activities and may become very weak. Thus, computers prevent people from getting the necessary exercise.  The second reason is that computers impede people from gaining life experiences. When someone asks, ""@CAPS3, what did you do today?"", the only possible answer might be ""@CAPS4, can we change the question to what did I not do today?"" Spending all day on the computer means missing out on exploring and observing nature. Although one could potentially do so on a @CAPS6 server, it is not the same as real - life experiences. Even when parents invite their children for a walk, they should accept the offer as they might learn or see something new.   In conclusion, I hope you recognize that exercise and gaining life experiences can bring about a lasting positive change in one's life."
1307	1311	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, there is skepticism among @CAPS4 people regarding whether computers benefit humanity. I firmly believe that computers are indeed beneficial. They enable people to communicate online with loved ones and friends across the globe and learn about foreign places. Instead of taking away from life, computers present it through fascinating digital means.  Computers allow individuals of all ages to interact with others via the world - wide web. While in - person meetings are sometimes preferable, it is not always feasible. For instance, if you have relatives or friends in a different country, the internet is the best way to stay in touch. Similarly, if you are part of a band or a group and are out of town, social sites like Facebook or MySpace allow group members to communicate and discuss matters from anywhere, such as a hotel.  Moreover, students can access missing schoolwork and email their teachers from home. This helps them catch up on missed lessons. The technological innovation of computers, since the @DATE1, has facilitated interaction with others and learning about distant lands.  Many people, including myself, desire cultural experiences and wish to explore the world but may not be able to do so. Computers save time and money. All one needs to do is open a search bar, type a word, and they can view @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, or the fields of @LOCATION1. Additionally, when a new tourist attraction emerges, whether it's an amusement park, a monument, or a historical discovery, the internet can showcase it. We can see what we would see if we were physically present, but from the comfort of our homes.  In conclusion, computers are helpful as they enable us to perform tasks that would otherwise be difficult under certain circumstances, such as communicating with people online and learning about foreign countries. Everyone with a computer has the opportunity to do these things.
1308	1312	1	2	Imagine how people felt in the past when there was no advanced technology. What if you haven't seen your best friend in years and you live far apart? Well, now we have this amazing device called a computer. It is not only great but also a hands - on activity that improves eye coordination.  Let me tell you how this device impacts human daily life. The key areas are building great relationships, taking online courses, and accessing the best local websites. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have a successful life through online dating? Many people struggle with relationships. For example, my mom and dad had a series of arguments. My mom felt the relationship was not good enough and decided to find dates online and start a new life. This shows the wonderful things the computer can do for relationships.  If you're a high - school dropout because you can't keep up with the class, don't turn in homework, and fail tests, don't lose hope. Now you can take online courses to improve your grades and feel more confident. You can sit at the computer, complete assignments, and watch your teacher teach via webcam. You can even get your homework faxed to you. Someone out there is living this life, and it could be you.  There are numerous new websites around the world. However, there's nothing better than social websites like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter, where you can stay in touch with your friends. Webcams are even more interesting as they allow for face - to - face communication from home. It's really cool to see your friend even when you're not together. Communication helps people make new friends.  In summary, the computer offers a lot of fun activities. It has a significant impact on human lives as more and more people are getting interested in it.
1309	1313	1	2	"Dear local Newspaper, why waste time learning at home when schools are there for that purpose? There is a growing concern that people are spending too much time on their computers. This means less time outdoors, exercising, and enjoying nature. People also need more time to interact with their families.  I once had an experience where my mom bought a new computer. I stayed up all night on the internet. When I woke up in the morning, I was so tired that I didn't want to go to school. I believe people should reduce their computer usage. The more time people spend on computers, the less time they spend enjoying the outdoors. Instead of chatting on MySpace with someone who lives right down the street, you could meet them at the park.  In @CAPS2, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people who use a lot of computer time are missing out on the joys of interacting with others and enjoying nature. Family activities are a great way to spend time. You can go to the park on a nice day, go swimming, play sports, go to the movies or the mall in the winter. Don't waste your time on the internet.  In conclusion, there is excessive computer usage. As the newspaper editor, I suggest making computers more expensive so that people can spend their money on more useful things. My mom always says, ""The more people use their computers, the less they put their feet in their shoes and walk outside!"" Many people in @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 share the same view. Please consider my opinions. Thank you."
1310	1314	1	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, have you ever truly admired the computers in our generation? They allow us to explore a vast array of interesting and amazing things. While computers are thought to advance society by providing access to diverse research on websites, have you ever considered if they actually ruin people's lives?  People who use computers often become engrossed in them, neglecting necessary physical activities that can be obtained outdoors. They also interact less with friends and family than they normally would. Moreover, teens and children face a major threat on the internet from potential predators who may pose a danger to them.  To promote people's well - being, we need to recognize the negative effects of computers. When you go to a park or a field, you'll likely see people enjoying outdoor activities like playing soccer or frisbee. Those who engage in such activities instead of sitting in front of a computer screen keep their bodies healthy. When on the computer, no healthy activity is taking place. Would you rather be healthy and active or lazy and sluggish?  During the summer, my friends and I usually go to the field to play soccer or to the beach to enjoy the pool. In winter, we engage in activities like sledding and snowboarding. People need to tear their eyes away from the computer screen and go outside to breathe in the fresh air. The outdoors can lift one's spirits and make one feel alive.  Have you ever gone home, retreated to your room, and then decided to go on the computer to escape your troubles? When a family member tells you that dinner is ready, you might ignore them because you're so into the computer. Computers interfere with your relationships with family and friends. Many people sit in a trance - like state at the computer, blocking out outside communication. They do not bring families together; instead, they separate them, creating an unhealthy family environment. Studies show that the average person spends five hours on the computer, which takes up a significant amount of time that could be spent with family.  In addition, children and teens are at risk from ""child predators"" on the internet. Research indicates that @PERCENT1 of children encounter these predators. No one wants to see their child hurt. Computers, along with the internet, are the cause of such risks.   In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people and their lives. They prevent people from being active and going outside, disrupt family relationships, and expose children and teens to potential danger."
1311	1315	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, has this ever happened to you? There was an exchange where one person asked ""@PERSON3, did you do your research?"" and another replied ""@CAPS3, my computer crashed."" Then someone asked ""@PERSON1, did you practice typing @TIME1?"", and again the response was ""@CAPS3, my computer crashed."" Later, someone questioned ""@CAPS5, why weren't you online @TIME1? I really needed that sales report!"", and the answer was ""I'm sorry @PERSON2, my computer crashed.""  @CAPS6 and @CAPS2, it is evident that computers bring significant benefits to people. Whether it is for completing a class project, practicing for a computer class, or exchanging business ideas, computers are of great help to society.  Firstly, in a school's computer class, computers are highly useful. There may be a required typing speed to pass the class, and teachers often assign home - practice on personal computers. In fact, @PERCENT1 of kids with personal computers at home achieve @CAPS7 A's in their computer class. I can attest to this. In my computer class, the teacher emphasizes the importance of home - practice to improve typing speed. Once, when I was supposed to practice @TIME1, my computer crashed, and I couldn't practice for the entire period. As a result, on the final exam on @DATE1, instead of getting a @CAPS8 or A, I got a @CAPS9+. I attribute this grade to not having a working computer at home.  Secondly, computers can be used for learning various things. For instance, if you need to write a class report about the traditions of @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, you can simply open your laptop and search on the internet instead of going to the library and wasting time with books. Not only does it save time, but searching on the internet will yield far more results than searching in a library directory. Moreover, using computers, you can learn about the customs of foreign countries or find programs to learn a new language. You can not only gain knowledge about your own country but also about foreign ones.  Thirdly, computers can enhance many skills required in the modern business world, such as socialization, communication, and understanding the younger generation. If someone doesn't use instant messaging or video - chatting programs, they may struggle in today's world. People need to learn to interact with each other and solve problems. Those who are not used to interacting may not make good businesspeople. Communication is also essential. If people don't communicate, they may face difficulties in running businesses or holding meetings. For example, I once needed to plan a project with my group. I went online hoping to find my partners, but they never showed up. I ended up doing all their work.  In conclusion, I hope you have seriously considered my opinion on the benefits of computers. As mentioned, computers are helpful in computer classes, researching foreign affairs, and communicating with others. Thank you for reading this letter."
1312	1316	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I share the view of those who believe that technological advancements, specifically computers, have a positive impact on people. Computers are remarkable devices that enable people of all ages to explore the world and its inhabitants. They allow individuals to communicate with distant family members, friends, or business associates.  Technology also plays a crucial role in education. Socializing and learning are two fundamental aspects of daily life. Learning becomes more engaging when you can visualize the information. While books can be useful, their relevance may depend on their publication date. Internet websites, on the other hand, offer updated pictures almost weekly, which can help you plan your next trip. Although books can provide a wealth of information, the thousands of websites available at any given moment offer far more. For example, if you want to learn Spanish, it's fast and easy to look it up on the internet, rather than searching through numerous books for a single fact.  Throughout the day, chatting with friends is a great way to relax and have fun, whether it's with a close friend or a colleague. There are now multiple ways to communicate, including phones, texting, instant messaging, and video chat. While it may take some time away from family, it's easy to end the conversation and reconnect with family later.  Finally, learning is of utmost importance today. Thanks to advanced technology, we have found enjoyable ways to educate students. Colorful and interactive websites can teach kids basic skills like multiplication and reading. Approximately @PERCENT1 of children are more attracted to colorful objects than plain text - based books. Therefore, parents and guardians should recognize that computers are not bad; in fact, they are very beneficial.
1313	1317	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, do you love computers but worry that you or your loved ones spend too much time on them? If so, perhaps we should take action. Many people experience vision problems due to prolonged computer use. Additionally, they miss out on outdoor activities. Moreover, those who work on computers for their jobs may neglect important aspects of life, such as interacting with family and friends, enjoying the outdoors, or simply spending quality time with loved ones.  Now, are you in favor of or against the phenomenon of people getting ""hooked"" on computers? In my opinion, people should enjoy life's experiences rather than spending most of their time in front of a computer.  Since people are highly dependent on computers, working on one can be detrimental to vision. The bright white computer screen filled with countless emails can have a significant impact on eyesight. My dad, for example, often gets headaches, and his vision has deteriorated after long - hours of computer work.  Staying indoors and using a computer all day means missing out on outdoor activities like sports, enjoying nature, or riding a bike. Only those who are energetic and enthusiastic about life engage in these activities.  Lastly, do you enjoy spending time with your loved ones but find yourself too busy because you're constantly on the computer? If so, get up and have some fun! Take your family on a hike or a bike ride. It's a great form of exercise for everyone and is actually enjoyable.  So, the choice is yours. Do you want to stay at home on the computer all day, or do you want to be energetic and spend quality time with family and friends? More importantly, do you want to be healthy, free from vision problems and headaches? Without a doubt, getting up and being active is the best decision you can make. So, get up, gather your family, and start living an energized, pain - free life."
1314	1318	1	2	Dear editor, I am in favor of having computers at home. I believe computers are beneficial for several reasons.  Firstly, computers contain a vast amount of information. You can look up various things on a computer. For school or work, you can search for information about words, cars, or historical events. For example, you can find details about events that occurred a long time ago, like @NUM1 or @DATE1. You can also trace your family tree and discover your ancestors. Additionally, you can access your bank account or check your email on the computer. This ability to access a wide range of information is one of the key advantages of computers.  Secondly, computers can store many important things. You can save memories from your past, school or work reports, and pictures from special occasions. You can also add your favorite websites to your bookmarks for easy access. This storage capacity makes computers a valuable tool for anyone.  Finally, computers enable communication with people who are far away. You can keep in touch with family members through email, social media platforms like MySpace and Facebook. You can have video chats with friends or family living in different locations. You can also participate in online meetings with colleagues or your boss.  In conclusion, as demonstrated, computers are useful because they allow you to look up information, store important data, and communicate with distant people. This is why I believe computers are a great addition to any household.
1315	1319	1	2	Dear local newspaper, in my opinion, the impact of computers depends on how much they are used. However, I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on people.  One reason is that computers make homework easier for kids. Instead of searching through books, we can simply use a computer. For example, if you have an essay to write about @PERSON1 in @LOCATION1, you can go to @CAPS2.com. All kinds of past @CAPS2 related to this topic will appear. By searching for @LOCATION1, you can get the right information, which can easily earn you an A+. It's much more convenient than reading numerous books.  Another reason is the entertainment value of computers. There are many fun things to do on a computer, such as playing games, watching YouTube videos, or checking social media like MySpace. If you don't want to play games, watch TV, or go outside, you can turn to your computer. You can check your MySpace page, watch funny videos, or chat with friends online. These activities are not possible on a TV, a game console, or outdoors, which is why I think computers have a positive impact.  Lastly, computers are also popular among adults. Many adult jobs require the use of computers. For example, cashiers use computers to process checks, teachers use them to enter grades, and scientists use them to conduct research. This shows that computers are useful in the adult world as well.  In conclusion, based on the above reasons, I am convinced that computers have a positive effect on people.
1316	1320	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, a significant portion of the @ORGANIZATION1 population uses a computer at least once a day. In modern society, computers have become so ubiquitous that some individuals find it challenging to live without them. They have become a reliance for people, which, however, raises concerns. When people overly depend on computers, they lose valuable skills they once possessed, spend less time exercising outdoors, and become more distant from family and friends. Computers have become an integral part of people's lives. They can perform certain human tasks that are difficult for us. Before the computer age, obtaining information on a topic or place was much more arduous. We had to use encyclopedias or search for relevant books. Sometimes, we even had to travel to a place to learn about it. Today, people use technology to access this information. You @MONTH1 might wonder, ""@CAPS3, how is this a negative thing?"" The issue is that people are losing the ability to use tools like encyclopedias, atlases, or simple maps. Previously, most of the population could use these to navigate information or find their way. From personal experience, I struggle to read a map and determine my location. We have become overly dependent on @CAPS4's and computers, causing us to forget valuable knowledge. What if someone gets lost without a working @CAPS4 or phone signal? They would be lost and unable to read a map. As is evident, the human population has become overly reliant on computers. Additionally, people worldwide have become addicted to the internet. Activities on platforms like Facebook, @CAPS6, and even @CAPS7 baseball have become addictive time - consumers. When people spend most of their time on these websites, they exercise less and grow more distant from family and friends. This problem is particularly prevalent among teenagers. A survey of students with Facebook or @CAPS6 accounts would likely show a majority. These accounts are known to be addictive, and it will cause problems for students, parents, and everyone. America is one of the leading nations in obesity. Has anyone considered that excessive time spent on these websites might contribute to this? If the internet were not as dominant, there would likely be fewer overweight people. Moreover, people become more and more distant from their loved ones. My sister spends so much time on her laptop that my parents had to take it away. For a while, the only way to talk to her was through Facebook. Clearly, computers can be dangerous. Think of the people you know who spend hours on the computer. You can probably name quite a few. Computers are addictive and can lead to less exercise and communication, which are essential for a healthy lifestyle. Also, excessive computer use causes people to lose valuable skills. Remember this the next time you or someone you know sits at a computer for a long time. You can help them."
1317	1321	1	2	"Dear newspaper readers, @CAPS1, picture this! You're sitting at home on the couch, munching on a bag of potato chips. The @CAPS2 shows a beautiful image of the @LOCATION1, and you can almost feel the rain on your skin. You're eager to learn more about it. Suddenly, the remote slips from your hand and falls to the ground. Your hand - eye coordination is so poor that you completely miss it when you try to grab it. On top of that, you remember you were supposed to meet your sister, whom you haven't seen for years, but you can't! If you had a computer, you could learn about more places and people, improve your hand - eye coordination, and interact with others without having to meet them in person! Computers definitely have positive effects on people. First, computers enhance hand - eye coordination. It's a fact that households with one or more computers have members with better hand - eye coordination than those without. Don't you want good hand - eye coordination too? My friend @PERSON4 had the worst hand - eye coordination in our school. After her parents bought her a computer, she became much quicker and now has significantly better hand - eye coordination. She said just looking at the screen and trying to interact helped a great deal. Also, research indicates that computers have been proven to improve hand - eye coordination over the course of a year. That seems quite straightforward. Next, computers allow people to learn about distant places and people. Local middle - school teacher @PERSON2 uses computers to teach her students about the @CAPS3 culture and geography. It sounds a lot more engaging than just lecturing. My cousins saw an article about @LOCATION3 and were amazed. They learned a great deal about the local culture and even took a trip there. Furthermore, vacations.com claims that computers are the #@NUM1 reason people travel, as they see pictures and articles about different places. You can learn about any place you desire on a computer. Isn't that great? I'm sure there's a place you've always wanted to know more about. Finally, computers enable people to interact with others around the world. You can talk to your long - lost friend in @LOCATION2 with just a click of the mouse. A recent study shows that over @PERCENT1 of people prefer to chat online with their friends rather than meeting them in person. How convenient! Expert computer teacher @PERSON1 says, ""Computers are great. If you can't meet someone, you can just talk online."" Have you ever had to cancel a meeting? Computers are really useful for busy people. Now, dear readers, @CAPS1, you're still sitting on that couch, looking at the @CAPS2 showing @LOCATION1. You quickly type it into your laptop, and an article appears in front of you. You read it, learning something new with each paragraph. Suddenly, you almost drop your laptop, but you catch it just in time. What great hand - eye coordination! Then you remember you were supposed to meet your sister @PERSON3, but you have a hair appointment. You quickly tell her via computer that you can't make it. She says it's okay, and you keep chatting. It all works out! It's so simple! Computers teach hand - eye coordination, let you learn about more places, and help you interact with more people. So, what are you waiting for, readers? Get a computer."
1318	1322	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, I'm curious about your thoughts on the advantages and disadvantages of owning a computer. In my opinion, computers are helpful in numerous ways. They improve hand - eye coordination, aid in learning, and enable us to communicate with friends and family online. Have you ever considered how a computer can benefit you physically? Many parents complain that ""@CAPS2 spend too much time on the computer!"" However, they may not realize that the computer is actually teaching hand - eye coordination. Some parents argue that kids gain weight because they sit inside using the computer. But if parents set certain limits, like restricting access to certain games, limiting computer time, or making kids play outside for the same amount of time they spend on the computer, kids can learn while staying fit. Thus, a computer can be an important part of a child's life when used properly. What's your preferred method of learning? Maybe you read books, go to school, or watch @CAPS3. But what if you're not at school, don't have any books, or the @CAPS3 isn't providing the information you need? With a computer, you can look up almost anything with just a few clicks. If you don't have time to go to the library to find a book, how else would you learn? As a teen in school, I know I couldn't complete much of my schoolwork and projects without my computer. Many home - based jobs today rely on computers. Without them, the work wouldn't get done. That's why I believe computers benefit our society and expand our knowledge. Do all your friends and relatives live in the same area? Probably not. That's why websites like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are gaining more members every day. The internet helps us stay in touch with relatives, friends, and even meet new people. I know it helps me keep in touch with old friends. In conclusion, computers have many positive aspects. They offer a convenient way to learn, enhance physical skills, and maintain social connections. Despite the concerns, when used correctly, they can be a valuable asset to our lives."
1319	1323	1	2	Dear, @CAPS1 - @ORGANIZATION1, computers are like people; they have both good and bad sides. Computers are useful for finding information and making work easier. However, they can also be unhealthy for you and your family. With the vast amount of information available on computers, newspapers may become obsolete in the future. You won't have newspapers tossed on your front porch anymore. Instead of just getting local news about what happened yesterday, with a computer, you can learn about interesting events around the world. Thanks to computers, life becomes a bit simpler. For example, if someone has a science project on cells, the computer can be extremely helpful. You don't have to write messily; you can just type about cells, find information on the internet, and print it out. This saves a lot of time that could be spent playing with friends and family outdoors, compared to searching for information in books. But as I said, computers can be bad, just like people and drugs. When people visit websites like MySpace, Twitter, Facebook, communication platforms, or game websites (there are too many to list), they can get addicted. It's like a drug because people stay on these sites day and night, can't get enough, and some won't stop. This harms their relationships with family and friends and, most importantly, their health, just like drugs. In conclusion, it's clear that computers have both positive and negative impacts. We need to be aware of these and use computers in a balanced way to maximize their benefits and minimize the drawbacks.
1320	1324	1	2	Dear local Newspaper, I believe that the use of computers has a positive effect. Computers can assist people in various ways. You can communicate with people globally, stay organized, and create useful things like brochures or PowerPoint presentations. Communicating with people worldwide is extremely useful. Suppose you have family members living in @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2. You can keep in touch with them via email or video chat. Also, if a governor needs to seek advice or assistance from other governors around the world, they can do so quickly and easily. Computers also help with organization. My uncle uses a computer to file taxes. He ensures that all files are saved correctly and in the right places. Imagine the amount of paper and space he would use if he had to do it manually or without a computer. Teachers also benefit from computers. They can enter grades, email parents, and create tests or quizzes. They know that everything will be neatly organized in computer files rather than in messy paper files on their desks. Teachers can also create PowerPoint presentations. These presentations can display a large amount of information on the screen, which helps students learn, a definite positive effect. If you have a small startup business, you can create a brochure for advertising. Additionally, you can use Microsoft Excel to create schedules. This helps employees know their work shifts or students know their class schedules. In conclusion, computers are very helpful in daily life for many different people. Global communication helps you maintain connections with others. They also help business people stay organized. And they assist teachers in creating educational materials that aid students' learning. Clearly, computers have a positive impact on society. Moreover, typing newspaper articles on a computer makes them more organized and quicker to print.
1321	1325	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper, the topic of @ORGANIZATION1 has been a subject of discussion in @LOCATION1 for decades. There is a divide among people regarding whether computers are a boon or a bane to society. In my view, computers have a positive impact on individuals. They enhance hand - eye coordination, provide knowledge about global cultures, and facilitate communication. Hand - eye coordination is a skill that is developed over time through practice. Computers play a significant role in this process. Biologist @PERSON1 states that ""@PERCENT1 of people who frequently use @ORGANIZATION1 were initially poor at catching a baseball but improved significantly after using it."" This improvement is not limited to baseball; it extends to other sports like juggling, golf, and tennis. Proficiency in these sports can be a source of entertainment or even a professional career. According to ""Time"" magazine, computer users are better at focusing on tasks such as schoolwork because it trains the hands and eyes to work in tandem. Good academic performance can open doors to various job opportunities, leading to a well - paid career and a fulfilling life. Computers also offer easy access to a vast amount of useful information. For instance, when assigned a culture project in @LOCATION3 history class, one can quickly find relevant details on @ORGANIZATION1. This is especially beneficial for those with busy schedules, like students involved in extracurricular activities. @PERCENT2 of people rely on computers for informational work about distant places as it is faster and more accurate compared to searching through books, which may have outdated information. In addition, computers have revolutionized communication. Platforms like Facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 allow people to stay connected. An @LOCATION2 @ORGANIZATION1 expert mentions that ""@PERCENT3 of people don't chat online,"" but most of those who do, do so for practical reasons such as discussing homework or catching up. Online communication can even be a gradesaver. In conclusion, considering the benefits of hand - eye coordination, access to information, and communication, it is evident that computers have a positive effect on society. It's hard to imagine life without them."
1322	1326	1	2	"Dear trained readers, don't you agree that an increasing number of people are using computers? I do, as it provides us with the information we seek. However, I've noticed that some individuals don't use computers. I firmly believe that those who don't should start, but I also understand their reasons. One reason is the lack of knowledge about using a computer. I recall when my friend came over and saw me using a computer. He said, ""Do you know that some people don't know how to use a computer?"" When I asked who, he replied, ""Me, I don't know how to use one."" I offered to teach him, and since then, he has become an avid computer user. He even expressed his desire to work with computers in the future. Another reason is that some people have better things to do. For example, I often have basketball games or practices. After a tiring day, the only thing I want to do is go to bed. Parents may also feel the same way after a long day of work. This is why they may not have the inclination to use a computer. The third reason is financial constraints. Some people don't have enough money to buy a computer. They have to save for basic necessities like housing. When their children ask for something, parents may buy it to avoid hurting their feelings. When I become an adult, I'll ensure I have the means to afford a computer. Otherwise, it might not be possible. It's important not to brag about having a computer as some people can't afford one. In fact, @PERCENT1 of the pupils at @ORGANIZATION1 don't have computers. In conclusion, these are the main reasons why some people don't use computers: lack of knowledge, having other priorities, and financial limitations."
1323	1327	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, I'm writing to share my thoughts on the impact of computers on society. While computers are useful tools for learning and communication, I believe that people today are overusing them. Many gamers, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 addicts spend excessive time on the computer. This often leads to a lack of real - life social interaction. Using a computer is a solitary activity, typically involving one person with a mouse, keyboard, and monitor. Some may argue that online social networks exist, but how often do we actually meet these online acquaintances in person? Computers can steal precious time that could be spent with family and friends, which is not beneficial for society. Another drawback is that using a computer usually requires us to be indoors. We can't enjoy the beauty of the outdoors while chatting online, playing games, or checking emails. Although laptops can be used outside, it's questionable whether we're truly appreciating the outdoors. The combination of computers and the outdoors is as ill - fitting as chocolate milk and fillet mignon. Lack of exercise is also a significant issue. It's difficult to use a computer and engage in physical activity simultaneously. When we become ""computer vegetables,"" we don't get enough exercise, which can lower our quality of life. It's true that if we use the computer sparingly and only when necessary, we can avoid these ""side effects."" However, computers can be addictive. Whether it's waiting for a friend to come online or trying to reach level @NUM2 of ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8"", they can easily hook us. The purpose of this article is not to discourage computer use but to encourage responsible usage. We should use computers like we eat double fudge brownies with walnuts and cream cheese frosting – in moderation. When used correctly, computers are valuable tools, but overuse can cause problems, such as preventing us from spending time with loved ones, getting exercise, and enjoying the outdoors. I'm sure you'll agree with these points."
1324	1328	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are a positive addition to our lives for several reasons. They enable communication, help us meet new people, and assist in planning. Computers are excellent for communication. My parents frequently use email to talk to my grandparents, friends, and even arrange events. I've seen them use it to learn about magazine subscriptions and other things to buy. One of my favorite things is when they use email to discuss my birthday presents with my grandparents. Another advantage is the ability to meet new people. There are numerous websites that match individuals based on their interests. We can also use email to connect with friends, and these interactions may lead to in - person meetings. Social media platforms like Facebook and MySpace, as well as chat websites, offer countless opportunities to meet new people. Computers are also invaluable for planning. For example, when my family went on vacation to @LOCATION1, my mom made all the reservations from our home computer. Many people use computers to book hotels during vacations. In fact, it's estimated that @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people use a computer for hotel reservations. If we didn't have computers, we'd have to rely on the post office to send mail, which could be time - consuming. Important events like the birth of a new baby might go unnoticed by the time the mail arrives. We'd also have to handle bills and taxes without the help of software, which would be a much more laborious process. In conclusion, computers are beneficial because they allow us to communicate with distant family members, meet new people through online services, and simplify planning. More than half of Americans use computers, and it's clear that they have become an essential part of our lives.
1325	1329	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers do not benefit society. This view is based on the lack of social skills, absence of exercise, and their addictive nature. Spending excessive time on the computer does not help in developing social skills. Online, people can think before they reply and often behave differently than they do in person. They can even pretend to be someone else. Online, we can erase what we've written, but in real - life conversations, we can't take back our words. Therefore, spending all this time chatting online does not contribute to the development of social skills. Computers also lead to a lack of exercise. On a beautiful @DATE1, one could be outside getting exercise instead of sitting indoors on the computer. Sitting online and doing nothing but talking makes a person lazy. As we grow older, we need to be physically active, and we can't spend all our time on the computer. It's important to allocate time for both computer use and exercise. Computers are highly addictive. Some people can spend hours watching videos online. Seven out of ten teenagers prefer to be on the computer rather than meeting new people in person. I think parents should limit their children's computer time. The time spent on the computer could be used for studying or other activities that will benefit them in the future. In conclusion, due to the lack of social skills, absence of exercise, and addictive nature, I believe that computers do not benefit society. I think people should limit their computer time and focus on more important activities.
1326	1330	1	2	Dear editor of the @LOCATION1, it's quite astonishing that @PERCENT1 of people in @LOCATION3 own computers. One can hardly fathom a life without them. Undoubtedly, computers bring numerous benefits to society. I can scarcely recall the last time I went a single day without using a computer. All the discussions about computers being detrimental to society have truly made me think. It's simply impossible for computers to be bad.  For instance, computers are beneficial for developing motor skills. Typing on a computer enhances hand - eye coordination, which is essential for sports. The act of typing also provides exercise for the wrists. As someone who once injured both wrists simultaneously, during my rehabilitation, I was advised by medical professionals to type as a way to regain normal function, along with calcium intake.  Computers are also invaluable for schoolwork. Imagine forgetting your homework log at school. Instead of calling a friend, it's far more convenient to access the teacher's webpage online, where all assignments are usually listed. And if you forget your math book, online textbooks are readily available, saving you the trouble of going back to school. Moreover, when working on a big project, you can conduct research on any topic in the world, from ants to @LOCATION2.  In terms of social interaction, social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace allow you to leave comments on friends' profiles and chat with them. Chatting on the computer, whether through dedicated platforms or social media, enhances our social connections. You can even catch up on the news online if you can't watch it on TV.  I sincerely hope that the @PERCENT1 of computer - owning people, as well as those who don't own one, will support the view that computers are beneficial for motor skills, schoolwork, and social networking. Let's prove to the public that computers are indeed a positive social force.
1327	1331	1	2	Computers were initially developed to simplify and expedite human tasks. Over time, they have undergone continuous updates to reach their current state. Today, computers are an integral part of most people's daily lives and are essential for the majority of businesses. A common question in our society is whether computers truly benefit us. In my view, the answer is a resounding yes.  Computers contribute to our development in multiple ways. Firstly, they enhance hand - eye coordination. As stated by an expert, @PERSON1, in a magazine I read, touch - typing is an excellent method for improving reflexes. Continual practice can increase typing speed. Additionally, learning to click and respond effectively to various on - screen elements also improves hand - eye coordination. I often find myself enjoying computer games. Although these games can be challenging, my improving hand - eye coordination enables me to play them better. My father always emphasizes the importance of mastering computer skills as they represent the future. With the rapid advancement of technology, it's inevitable that computers will play an increasingly important role in society.  Secondly, computers revolutionize the way we conduct research and complete schoolwork. My grandfather often remarks on how much easier my generation has it. Instead of visiting the @CAPS2 to search for books, I can simply use Google, which provides an entire search engine at my fingertips. In high school, a computer is almost a necessity for organizing essays, conducting effective research, and presenting clear, legible typing. My brother considers his computer the best investment he's ever made. For example, when we had a science assignment last year to explore how the heart beats faster, I typed the question into the search engine and found hundreds of ways to increase my pulse rate.  Finally, computers make communication effortless. A couple of weeks ago, my coach emailed us to inform us of a change in our game time. This seemingly minor event could have led to us missing the game if not for the computer. My cousin @CAPS3, who is from @LOCATION1, and I only meet once a year. With a webcam, I've been able to chat with him weekly, making it feel as if he's right beside me. Webcamming is a fantastic communication tool.  In conclusion, with the continuous development of computer technology and the emergence of new products, it's clear that computers are highly beneficial to our society. They improve hand - eye coordination, transform research and schoolwork, and enhance communication.
1328	1332	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to share my thoughts on computers and technology. Computers have become an indispensable part of our society and culture, and their importance can be attributed to several reasons.  Firstly, computers enable us to surf the internet at any time and from any location, which is extremely convenient. Consider Jane, who lives @NUM1 miles away from the town library. If she needs to write a research paper, her mother may not always be available to drive her to the library. In such a situation, the computer comes to the rescue. Jane can simply go online to conduct her research. Moreover, according to ""www.internetsocool.gov"", the amount of information available online is approximately five times that of a regular library.  Secondly, computers facilitate online communication and video - chatting with people both near and far. This is particularly useful for me as I live alone in @LOCATION1 and miss my family dearly. Thanks to the internet, I can communicate with my family whenever I want. Additionally, students can video - chat with their lab partners to improve their lab reports. As @PERSON1, the author of ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"", mentions in his book, over @NUM3 million people use the internet for educational video - chatting.  While some may argue that computers have negative aspects, such as people spending too much time on them and neglecting exercise and family time, the ""The @DATE1 survey of what people do"" indicates that @PERCENT1 of computer users are both physically and emotionally healthy. Using computers to simplify our lives does not mean we don't value family time.  In conclusion, computers are crucial in our culture. They allow us to access a vast amount of information online and help us interact with people from afar. Their benefits far outweigh the potential drawbacks."
1329	1333	1	2	"Do you think computers are useful? I firmly believe they are. Computers offer a plethora of features, including online shopping, chatting, and live sports streaming.  Online shopping is incredibly helpful. If you don't have a car, you can easily purchase whatever you need from the comfort of your home. Services like People, offered by @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, allow you to order your @CAPS5 online and have it delivered. Whether you need clothes, shoes, or games, you can simply find the items online, click ""buy"", and choose your shipping option.  Chatting on the computer is also a great advantage. Social networking sites like Facebook, @CAPS6, and @CAPS7 are extremely popular. On @CAPS6, you can follow famous people such as @PERSON1, the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 receiver. Facebook has fan pages for celebrities, and @CAPS7 may even have accounts of famous people. Chatting has become a common activity, with almost @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS13 using it. You can also use webcam @CAPS1 to have face - to - face conversations. It's especially useful if you're always on the move and can't talk on the phone; you can send messages through @CAPS1.  @CAPS17 is a new trend that has taken the @CAPS13 @CAPS11 @CAPS15 by storm. There are sites like @LOCATION1 or @CAPS16 @CAPS17 where you can buy @ORGANIZATION1 league @CAPS18 or @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS17 and watch live sports games from your computer. It's also convenient during long road trips; you can turn on your laptop and watch any show you want. This on - the - go technology represents the pinnacle of convenience.  In summary, computers are not only helpful but also a necessity in our lives. They are incredibly convenient, and next time you need any of these services, remember this and explore the top - rated sites."
1330	1334	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, computers are truly remarkable technological inventions. However, some people are starting to misuse them.  There are numerous benefits to owning a computer. In my opinion, computers are extremely helpful. They can be used to look up directions or chat with old friends. Nevertheless, many people are abusing their computer usage and don't know when to stop. While the computer can be a lot of fun, spending excessive time on it means missing out on family activities and time with friends.  I believe that there should be a time - limit for everyone's computer use. If there were a device that could automatically shut down the computer while saving all ongoing work, people would be more likely to go out and be more active. Although people can learn a great deal on the computer, it's important to know when to step away.  There are also useful aspects of the computer, such as websites where you can watch exercise videos or purchase exercise equipment. The computer can be a handy tool, but long - term use should be avoided.  In conclusion, having a computer is both cool and useful when needed. However, to ensure a balanced lifestyle, time limits should be set for computer usage. This way, we can fully enjoy the benefits of computers without sacrificing our physical and social well - being.
1331	1335	1	2	Dear Local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1, and I'm part of the middle - class community. I read in the local newspaper that there's a debate about whether widespread computer use benefits society. In my opinion, it does so in multiple ways. Firstly, computers offer the flexibility to work from anywhere. Nowadays, cellphones and iPods come with internet access and the necessary tools for work, just like a computer. Laptops are also portable, allowing work on - the - go. Secondly, computers facilitate family connection. There are numerous programs that enable communication with family members in different states or cities, such as @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @LOCATION1. Finally, computers provide the opportunity to learn about other places and people. Through photos, information, and websites, one can gain knowledge about events in other regions, like the strategies employed in @LOCATION4. This is my view on why computers are beneficial to society. Thank you for reading, and have a nice day.
1332	1336	1	2	Dear local newspaper, a question that's come to my attention is whether people spending too much time on the computer is a good thing. I firmly believe that computers are a valuable electronic device. They aid in learning. For instance, students can visit @LOCATION2 and type in any question they have. A child embarrassed to ask her parents can simply use the computer to get hundreds of answers. In the past, my mom didn't always have access to a computer, so she had to rely on others for answers. If more people had computers, they'd have access to more knowledge. Computers are also great for staying in touch. Programs like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and AIM are popular. My dad uses his iPhone to email business contacts, which helps him manage his work. I surveyed ten adults, and all agreed that everyone should have a computer. Even if people don't own phones, they can still use computers to stay connected with those far away. Computers also help with organization. People with poor handwriting often use @ORGANIZATION1. They have folders and programs to store information neatly. My friend's office was a mess before she got a computer. After that, she typed everything neatly and stored papers in computer folders, which led to her promotion. Her mom also became more organized after getting a computer. In conclusion, computers are good and helpful as they assist in finding information, keeping in touch, and maintaining organization. Please consider this in the newspaper.
1333	1337	1	2	In modern times, the question of whether people are spending too much time on computers and its impacts is worth discussing. My view is that excessive computer use affects people in several negative ways. Firstly, it harms health. People who spend long hours sitting in front of a computer are at risk of weight gain. They may also neglect to eat a balanced diet as they're too focused on the screen and may not go out to get fruits and vegetables. Secondly, it impacts social life. Spending too much time on the computer can lead to less interaction with real - life people. Thirdly, it has a negative effect on education. If someone is constantly on the computer, they may not engage with non - computer - related learning materials. In conclusion, these are the reasons why I believe people shouldn't spend an excessive amount of time on the computer.
1334	1338	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper, I'm writing to share my opinion on the positive effects of computers on people. After reading this letter, I'm confident you'll agree with me. Firstly, computers are excellent study aids. Students and others can use them to prepare for tests. For example, if you have a @CAPS1 test, you can print practice sheets. For a vocabulary exam, you can quickly find definitions. A statistic from @ORGANIZATION1 shows that @PERCENT2 of students in the @ORGANIZATION2 consider computers their best study tool. I recently used my computer to study for a test on the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and found many useful websites. Secondly, online shopping through computers saves time. Many stores now allow online purchases, which eliminates the need to drive to physical stores. In @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 across the @ORGANIZATION2 said online shopping made their lives less hectic. Finally, computers are a powerful communication tool. Instant messaging, email, and platforms like blackboard are commonly used. I surveyed @NUM1 kids, and @NUM2 said computers were their main source of communication. In conclusion, computers positively impact people by helping with studying, saving time on shopping, and enabling communication. Their benefits are undeniable, and they make people's lives easier.
1335	1339	1	2	Would you rather spend hours searching through books or find what you need in minutes? I believe computers have a positive impact on people in three main ways. Firstly, they help you learn about places you want to visit. For example, @PERSON5 changed his travel plans for @DATE1 after learning about an earthquake in @LOCATION2 online. @PERSON2 also decided to visit @LOCATION3 this @DATE1 after researching it on Google. Secondly, computers allow you to find what you need quickly. @PERSON3 searched for a cake recipe in cookbooks but couldn't find it. He then used his laptop and found it in under five minutes. Computer expert @PERSON1 also recommended using the internet instead of rummaging through books. Thirdly, computers enable online communication with friends. @PERSON6 was sad to leave her best - friend when she moved from @CAPS4 to @LOCATION1, but now she can talk to her on @CAPS5. @PERSON4, who was sick in bed, used @CAPS7 to stay in touch with friends. As computer expert @PERSON1 said, it's much easier. In conclusion, computers are beneficial as they help with travel planning, quick information retrieval, and online communication.
1336	1340	1	2	Computers have become an integral part of many people's lives. They offer access to a wealth of information and news that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. Additionally, computers provide an easy means of communication with friends and family without the need for a phone. Moreover, they are highly useful for writing. One of the most significant advantages of computers is the ability to stay informed about global events. For example, a simple search on a search engine can yield hundreds of articles on recent disasters and other current news. It is also possible to discover interesting facts, such as the number of people who have sailed around the world in the past decade. However, some critics believe that computer use reduces the time spent with friends and family. In reality, computers can have the opposite effect. There are numerous websites, like Facebook and ChatMe.com, that allow for safe communication. Video chatting is also available, making it feel as if you are in the same room. Unlike phone calls, using these websites is free and accessible to everyone. Finally, computers are excellent writing tools. They enable efficient and neat writing, and programs like Microsoft Word offer spell - checking and the flexibility to edit and add text as needed. Clearly, computers are a valuable and beneficial part of society, facilitating global awareness, easy communication, and effective writing. It is hoped that after reading this, the many uses of computers are more apparent.
1337	1341	1	2	In today's world, technology is ubiquitous, and computers are among the most commonly used devices. The question arises: are computers truly beneficial to society? The answer is yes, as computers serve as a means to connect with the world, enhance personal responsibility, and support education. Regarding global connection, computers allow users to access any information on the web. People can find details about places of interest or potential travel destinations. According to @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people check the internet for places to @ORGANIZATION1 before visiting. Computers also enable communication with distant friends. For instance, a friend moved to @LOCATION1 in @NUM3 grade, but regular email exchanges have maintained the friendship. Additionally, computers are one of the fastest ways to stay updated on current events through news websites. These connections broaden people's perspectives. Computers also promote responsibility. When using a computer, users face various choices, such as which websites to visit and what to download or watch. Making these decisions helps individuals learn to choose wisely and learn from mistakes. Moreover, computers are delicate and require careful handling. Avoiding liquids and preventing objects from hitting the computer are ways to increase responsibility. Finally, computers are beneficial for education. Teachers can use them to create more engaging lessons, such as presentations. Students can review what they learned at school and access homework and class information online. A friend once said that without the computer, they would be failing. School websites provide information about classes, events, and clubs, making it easy to research schools. In conclusion, computers are beneficial to society as they connect people globally, enhance responsibility, and support education.
1338	1342	1	2	I believe that people, both kids and adults, spend too much time on the computer, engaging in activities like tweeting, using Facebook, and MySpace. There are several reasons why people should reduce their computer time. Firstly, they should spend more time outdoors. For example, my friend @PERSON3 spends @NUM1 hours a day on the computer and rarely goes outside. My neighbor @PERSON2, who is now @NUM2 years old, is so afraid of the sun that he still doesn't go outside because of excessive computer use. Secondly, people should interact with real - life individuals. There was a kid named @CAPS2 who only played with virtual friends and is now extremely shy around real people. @CAPS3, who had only virtual friends, is very depressed due to the lack of a real best friend. Thirdly, people should spend time with their families. There was a person named @CAPS4 who was too busy writing emails and didn't spend time with his family. @PERSON1 says that kids who don't interact with their families miss out on certain benefits. In one family, the kids were so focused on the computer that they never met their grandparents before they passed away. In conclusion, people should prioritize going outside, playing with real people, and spending time with their families. Only after fulfilling these aspects should they consider using the computer.
1339	1343	1	2	The use of computers is widespread, and opinions on their impact on society vary. Some experts believe that people are spending too much time on computers, leading to less exercise, outdoor play, and family time. However, I hold a different view. Computers are beneficial as they help with hand - eye coordination for jobs, enable us to stay in touch with family and friends, and facilitate learning. In the workplace, many jobs rely on computers. To be successful in these jobs, one needs hand - eye coordination, which can be developed through computer use. Computers prepare us with the skills necessary for employment. Computers also play a crucial role in maintaining relationships. @PERSON2 @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1 shared that without computers, she wouldn't have been able to see her niece and nephew open Christmas presents or witness her nephew's first steps. She values the ability to stay connected with family through technology. Moreover, computers are excellent learning tools for people of all ages. They contain a vast amount of information, allowing users to learn about new things. My younger sister @PERSON1 learned to read on the computer and is at a high reading level in first grade. In conclusion, computers are a wonderful addition to society. They assist in job - related skills, keep us connected to loved ones, and expand our knowledge. Experts should not be concerned about the increasing use of computers as it brings many positive benefits.
1340	1344	1	2	In today's technological era, I firmly believe that the use of computers is a positive development for society. Computers offer multiple benefits, including easy access to information, tree - saving capabilities, and effective communication with distant individuals. For research purposes, computers are superior to traditional books. A few years ago, students would head to the library for school projects. Now, with a click of a button, they can access information about any place in the world. They can learn about a destination before visiting or explore far - off places. It's truly remarkable how much knowledge is at our fingertips. Using computers also helps save trees. There is no longer a need to cut down large numbers of trees for books and paper. Books can be sold and read online, and students can complete homework, tests, and quizzes digitally. It's amazing to see how much the world has changed in about @NUM1 years. Finally, computers are invaluable for communicating with people far away. Those with family members in the military, on business trips, or living in other states or countries can stay connected. Emails are delivered instantly, and video calls allow for face - to - face interaction. In conclusion, computers are extremely helpful, especially in today's world. They enable online research, tree conservation, and long - distance communication, clearly benefiting society.
1341	1345	1	2	Dear local newspaper, in my opinion, computers have a positive impact on society and individuals. They facilitate communication with people in other places, whether it's family, friends, or individuals from other countries, allowing for the formation of new friendships. Moreover, computers enhance hand - eye coordination and enable online shopping.  Computers are excellent communication tools. Those proficient in using them can connect with family abroad or meet new people who may become friends. Communicating with family via computers also helps save money on costly international phone calls.  Regarding hand - eye coordination, computers are beneficial. For kids with big projects, the improved coordination helps them complete tasks on time. After finishing a project, they can go out and play with family and friends. This coordination also aids in mental development.  Online shopping is another advantage of using computers. One can purchase a wide range of items, including clothes, shoes, cars, and houses.  In conclusion, I believe people should use computers more frequently for shopping, socializing, and improving physical coordination. I hope you agree with me.
1342	1346	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, people use computers constantly, and computers bring numerous positive impacts. They assist us in searching for information, communicating with people worldwide, and shopping from the comfort of our homes. In this technological era, the possibilities are limitless.  I have a cousin in @LOCATION1, and I communicate with him via webcam. Many others also use computers to talk to their relatives in other places. In fact, almost every soldier communicates with someone back home. Doctors claim that such communication gives soldiers more willpower to survive.  Since everyone goes to school, everyone has projects. When kids are working on projects and need information, the computer is a great resource. It has trillions of websites, and one can find information on almost anything, from the origin of humans to other topics.  If you're a sports enthusiast and want free content online, there are websites like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6. If you like a song, you can go to @CAPS7, @ORGANIZATION2, LimeWire, or other stores to download it to your @NUM1 or @CAPS8.  In this age, I hope you've learned more about computers and changed your perspective. Just because there are bad people and bad websites doesn't mean computers are bad.
1343	1347	1	2	It's truly amazing how computers can affect people. Every day, people around the world learn new things on computers. Thanks to computers, everyone can read and learn something new. There's also a lot of fun stuff to do on the computer, like choosing from a wide variety of music videos and music.  There are multiple ways to communicate with others. Just like using a cell - phone to talk on the phone, computers offer numerous communication options. Social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook, and @CAPS2 are great for chatting with family and friends, and there are many other websites too.  However, I'd like to point out that while computers are a lot of fun, we need to take breaks. We can't stay on the computer all the time. We also need to exercise and enjoy nature. Going for a walk or riding a bike is a great idea. We should understand that computers are good for learning, but they shouldn't be the only focus of our daily lives. We should also get some fresh air.
1344	1348	1	2	To the Newspaper, computers are an essential part of society. They serve as valuable learning tools, facilitate communication, and teach skills that are useful for life.  Students, like me, often use computers for various reasons, and our teachers encourage us to do so. All projects require research. For instance, last week in social studies, I was researching the amendments to the constitution for a project on whether capital punishment is unusual. I went to @ORGANIZATION1 - on the web and found a wealth of information. I learned that not only is it legal in @LOCATION1 but that @LOCATION1 received approval from the international council of human rights for allowing it. Without the internet, which provides the latest information instantly, it would have been difficult to find such up - to - date facts. It would have been more costly and taken over two hours to find the same information that I got in five minutes using a computer. The internet has millions of websites and photos on a wide range of topics and is faster than any other research method.  In school, besides research, we use computers to type papers. This makes it easier for teachers to read and provides useful features like spell - check. Also, the internet offers many communication benefits. E - mail, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 are some commonly used websites that make communicating with friends and family easier and faster than ever.  Last @DATE1, my friend went on a @NUM3 - week business trip. I missed him a lot, but thanks to @CAPS4 mom, I was able to communicate with him easily, almost as if having a telephone call. It comforted me during the @NUM4 days when I couldn't see him, and it was incredibly quick.  Computers allow people to interact with others simultaneously, even when they're physically apart. This communication aspect is crucial, and it also prepares us for the future. Many jobs involve using computers, and mastering computer skills in advance has many advantages. In the near future, computers will be used more in high school and college for paper - writing and research. If we already know how to use them, it will be much faster and easier for us.  In conclusion, the benefits of computers and the internet are countless. Schools can use them for projects and learning, people can communicate virtually when face - to - face interaction is not possible, and they can contribute to the future. Therefore, the use of computers should be encouraged.
1345	1349	1	2	I firmly believe that computers have a positive influence on people. People learn on computers every day. Thanks to computers, everyone can read and discover new knowledge. There's also plenty of fun to be had on the computer, such as enjoying a wide selection of music videos and music.  Computers offer multiple ways to communicate. Similar to using a cell phone for calls, there are numerous communication methods available on computers. Social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook, and @CAPS2 enable us to chat with family and friends, and there are other websites as well.  However, I must say that although computers are a lot of fun, we need to take breaks. We can't be glued to the computer all the time. We also need to exercise and enjoy nature. Taking a walk or riding a bike is a great way to do so. We should understand that while computers are good for learning, they shouldn't dominate our daily lives. We should make time to get some fresh air. In conclusion, we should strike a balance between using computers for learning and having a healthy, active lifestyle.
1346	1350	1	2	To the esteemed Newspaper @CAPS1, in today's era, the widespread popularity of computers often leads us to assume they are beneficial and exert a positive influence on users. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that the detrimental effects of computers on users outweigh the positive ones, and I base this view on several reasons. Firstly, computers detract from the time spent with real - life individuals. In contemporary society, people frequently use social networking platforms like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 to communicate with distant acquaintances. They can spend hours chatting with strangers they may never meet, completely disregarding the people who care about them. Moreover, online communication can be perilous as the person on the other end may not be who they claim to be. In contrast, actually spending time with real people creates memories that will be cherished for a lifetime, an experience that the internet cannot replicate. Secondly, continuous computer use has resulted in a lack of exercise for many. People who spend long hours on computers remain sedentary, with only the slightest finger movement to click the mouse. This minimal activity is far from sufficient to maintain a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle. Studies have indicated that since the advent of computers, young people, in particular, have been getting less and less physical activity, and this situation is likely to worsen if excessive computer use persists. Lastly, computers are highly distracting and waste time. For instance, while I was conducting research for a school project online, I came across an interesting - looking website advertisement. Clicking on it led me to a site full of funny stories and pictures. I ended up spending half an hour on that site, forgetting all about my project. As a result, I had to rush to complete my research and received a lower grade than I would have without the distraction. In conclusion, computers do not have a positive impact on users. They reduce the time spent with family and friends, lead to less exercise, and are a source of distraction and time - wasting.
1347	1351	1	2	Dear local @CAPS1, people, especially @CAPS2 individuals, have been using computers for a long time. However, we need to question whether it is actually good for their health. We often overlook the power that teens hold with the internet. If we need information, there are plenty of great books available. For communication, we have phones. And we should go outside and exercise. Is the computer another factor contributing to America's rising obesity rate? First, teens can engage in harmful activities on the internet, either towards themselves or others. Platforms like Facebook and MySpace have been created, and almost every teen in America has a Facebook account. There is now a phenomenon called cyberbullying, where people humiliate others on the internet. We can never be certain that the person we are talking to is who they claim to be. Teens tend to disclose excessive personal information, and some have even gone missing as a result. The internet is a powerful tool, but can teens handle this kind of power? Second, although the computer is a convenient device, we should not forget about books. We cannot believe everything stated on the computer. We can obtain all the necessary information and more from books. People in the Middle Ages managed without computers but had books. Why can't we? Have we become too lazy to get up and search through a book? Finally, if our goal is communication, why not opt for a simple text or call? We go through the trouble of turning on the computer and opening pages just to chat online. We have become lazy due to the devices that provide everything we need at home. While it has its advantages, it also has its drawbacks. It seems that the computer is yet another reason for America's increasing obesity. We need to get up, take a walk, hang out with friends, and participate in sports. But how can we do this when we are addicted to computers? It's like a powerful drug. In conclusion, I believe that computers are not good for us. Teens with access to platforms like Facebook, the presence of false and dangerous information when we have books, and the impact on our health all lead me to this conclusion. At this point, I ask you, is the computer really worth everything we think it is? The answer is no.
1348	1352	1	2	Dear Newspaper, over the years, the streets have become less populated with people interacting, exercising, and enjoying nature. This prompts us to question whether this is a positive or negative development. With the rapid advancement of technology, it might seem more appealing to stay home and use the computer rather than take a walk in the park. However, computers actually have a positive impact on people. Computers are filled with excellent advertisements. Some ads encourage people to join a gym and exercise. Statistics show that <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of kids without computers do not get enough exercise, while only @PERCENT1 of kids with computers face the same issue. These figures suggest that computers are more beneficial for people's health than commonly believed. In addition, computers feature numerous advertisements that inspire people to travel around the world. Traveling can enhance people's intelligence as they learn new facts about different places. It also makes people happier as they enjoy the experience of exploring new destinations. Moreover, if a person's business relies on online advertisements, their job can benefit from this. Finally, modern computer technology enables people to communicate with friends from almost anywhere in the world. Social networking sites like Facebook allow users to view pictures of their friends' travels. Webcams facilitate face - to - face conversations, such as discussing a newly joined gym. <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of people claim to have a better social life online, especially when their friends may not be available in person. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. The advertisements on computers encourage exercise and travel, and they enable global communication. Technology is designed to make the world a happier, healthier, and more social place, which clearly demonstrates the positive impact of computers on people worldwide.
1349	1353	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, we are witnessing the regrowth of our main forest, enjoying services that take only a few seconds, and being able to find answers to practically any question. What is the cause of this phenomenon? The answer is computers. These electronic marvels assist us and our planet in numerous ways, as they are eco - friendly, efficient, and rich in information. Let's first explore how computers are eco - friendly. They help reduce paper waste. For example, the @LOCATION1 cuts down approximately @NUM1 million trees annually for books. Instead of sending a physical letter to the police chief to inquire about a new driving law, one can send an email and save paper. Similarly, if you want the newspaper staff to interview survivors of a power plant explosion, you can send them an email with instructions to the survivors' house instead of distributing maps individually. Computers are also highly efficient. My Dell laptop at home takes about @NUM1 minutes to load, @NUM3 seconds to connect to the internet, and @NUM4 seconds to access another webpage. Suppose I want to know how many legs a centipede has. Without a computer, it would take @NUM5 minutes to reach the library, @NUM6 minutes to find a parking spot, and @NUM4 minutes to locate a book about centipedes, totaling at least @NUM8 minutes. In contrast, my computer would only take about @NUM1 minute and @NUM10 seconds. Also, if you want to ask a friend what they are doing on @DATE1, it only takes a few seconds to send an email, and they can respond quickly as they are likely on the computer. Lastly, computers are a vast repository of information. In a @CAPS3 library, I might find @NUM4 books on a particular subject, but on a computer, I can find thousands. When I was doing a report on monarch butterflies, I found @NUM12 books in the @CAPS3 library, but @NUM13 websites on the internet. Books usually provide general information, while the internet offers specific details. In conclusion, computers are beneficial not only to humans but also to the environment. Their eco - friendliness, efficiency, and wealth of information make them an invaluable asset.
1350	1354	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I am firmly of the opinion that computers have a positive impact on society. There are several reasons to support this view. Firstly, computers enable us to learn about far - away places. We can discover their history and landscape. This knowledge can be used for various purposes, such as planning a vacation, completing a school report, or learning about our heritage and culture. Secondly, computers are extremely useful for communication. They allow us to stay in touch with friends and family all over the world. In today's society, the computer has become the primary means of communication. A study has shown that @PERCENT1 of people around the world use a computer as a communication tool. Lastly, computers are a great source of entertainment. There are countless activities to do on a computer, such as playing games, surfing the web, or watching videos on platforms like YouTube. With so many options, one will never get bored. In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial to society. They facilitate learning about distant places, enable global communication, and provide entertainment. These aspects clearly demonstrate the positive influence of computers on society.
1351	1355	1	2	I firmly believe that computers do not bring as many benefits to society as most people assume. When individuals spend the majority of their time on computers, they lack the time to be with their families. Moreover, excessive computer use leads to insufficient exercise, which in turn causes obesity. Additionally, there is a risk of meeting dangerous people through social media platforms such as Facebook or MySpace.  The primary reason computers are not beneficial is the lack of family time. If one is constantly on the computer, there is no time left for family and friends. I believe that families should have dinner together and spend at least an hour interacting. Activities like playing games, going for a walk, or a bike ride are great ways to bond with family.  Computers also have a significant impact on obesity. If a person is at school from 7:00 to 15:30 and then spends seven hours on the computer after school, they will have no time for exercise. Without exercise, the body cannot burn off the fat from the food consumed.  Another danger is the potential to meet harmful individuals on social media. These platforms allow users to arrange meetings with strangers, who could be killers, kidnappers, or rapists. Therefore, email is the safest way to chat online if one uses a computer.  In conclusion, computers are not beneficial to society as they lead to a lack of family time, contribute to obesity, and pose a risk of encountering dangerous people. It is important to be aware of these issues and use computers in a more balanced way.
1352	1356	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper,  Computers are indeed unique and advanced devices that offer entertainment, pleasure, and knowledge to some. However, I do not concur with the view that they are an entirely positive addition to society, despite their necessity.  There are certain advantages to computers. Typing is faster and neater than handwriting, and the internet provides a platform for advertising, purchasing essential items, and communicating with people worldwide.  Nevertheless, there are compelling reasons to consider computers as a negative influence. Firstly, the information stored on computers can be hacked by unauthorized individuals. Secondly, cyberbullying is a prevalent problem associated with computer use. Thirdly, online games can lead to addiction, laziness, and ultimately, obesity.  In my opinion, if computers had never existed, the world would be a better place. They have created a dependency where people struggle to write a hand - written report or visit a store to make a purchase.  I sincerely hope you will take my concerns into account. It is crucial to recognize that computers can take over our lives and change us for the worse. We should make a wise decision regarding their use. I wish you a fulfilling life and hope you find value in my letter.
1353	1357	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 editor,  I recently saw on Channel @NUM1 news that you are interested in understanding the impact of computers on people. In the past, computers have become ubiquitous, and people have been obtaining knowledge from them. A survey conducted at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 found that @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 believe computers are helpful to us.  In my view, computers have a positive impact on people for several reasons. Firstly, they play a crucial role in developing hand - eye coordination. Without this coordination, people would face difficulties in performing daily tasks. Dr. @DR1, an expert in human - computer relationships, stated that ""People without computers can't do what others can. They are unable to have fast reaction time."" A recent survey at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 showed that @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 agreed that computers are the main source of hand - eye coordination. The computer engages the relevant muscles, enabling us to live happily.  Secondly, computers allow us to learn about far - away places. Without them, we would have limited knowledge about different locations around the world. We might not even know where these places are on the map. With computers, we can research potential vacation destinations or gather information for reports. @PERCENT2 of the adults surveyed at the public library said that computers are a valuable source of information, containing more data than books.  Thirdly, computers facilitate online communication, which expands our friendships. We can interact with people not only at school but also from different parts of the world, such as @LOCATION1. This interaction helps us meet new and diverse individuals. A poll of parents in @ORGANIZATION1 revealed that @PERCENT1 of them want their children to learn about different cultures through the use of computers.  In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people as they enhance hand - eye coordination, enable learning about distant places, and support online communication. I encourage you to carefully consider these perspectives before making a decision."
1354	1358	1	2	@CITY1 @CAPS1,  Computers are extremely helpful devices. Life would be incredibly challenging without them. They are not only useful but also fun and easy to operate.  I firmly believe that computers have a great impact on people. One of the main benefits is the ability to stay in touch with family and friends. I use several applications for this purpose. @ORGANIZATION1 is a free online application that allows me to download it to my computer, add friends, and have video chats. I use it to communicate with my @CAPS4, a friend who moved away, and a friend from @LOCATION2. @CAPS2, which is @ORGANIZATION3's instant messenger, functions like text messaging but through the computer. I can send messages to friends and receive instant replies. @CAPS3 is a website where I can add friends from all over the world. I am connected with many family members I rarely see, a friend who moved to @LOCATION3, and others who have relocated.  When I am home sick from school and need to catch up on schoolwork, I find the school's webpage very useful. All teachers should have their own websites where they post homework, quiz and test schedules, favorite links, projects, and their email addresses. This way, even if I don't understand my homework, I can email my teacher. School websites also provide lunch menus, upcoming events, the school's address and phone number, and more.  Search engines are another great feature of computers. Google can provide answers to almost any question, including web pages, videos, pictures, and translators. There are also other search engines like @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION2!, @LOCATION4, @CAPS7, and @LOCATION1. I often use them for school projects, research, checking Spanish homework, and sharing videos with friends.  In conclusion, computers are extremely helpful, easy, and fun to use. They make it easy to stay in touch with others, maintain a good education, and find answers quickly. I hope you agree that computers have a great impact on people.
1355	1359	1	2	Dear Newspaper,  Computers have a profound impact on society. It's hard to imagine where we would be without them. They are invaluable for communication, learning, and shopping.  In terms of communication, computers have revolutionized the way we interact with co - workers, family, and friends. Social networking sites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 - In are integral to our daily lives. We use these platforms to access information, make weekend plans, and stay connected. For children, the internet is their primary means of communicating with peers, making them more social. Moreover, the internet allows us to communicate with people from around the world, giving us the opportunity to experience different cultures. Communication was far more difficult before the advent of computers.  The internet is also a vast source of knowledge. We can learn about people through video - chatting platforms like @CAPS5 or @ORGANIZATION2, which allow face - to - face interaction that is not possible on a phone. School research would be nearly impossible without the internet. A recent survey showed that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teenagers use search engines like @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS6, or @ORGANIZATION3 at least once a day, and @CAPS7 of those @NUM1 use them for school. Clearly, computers provide numerous ways to research and learn daily.  In the realm of shopping, in @DATE2, @PERCENT1 of shopping was done online. The internet is often the first stop for those starting a business, and people are making money with the help of computers. It is much easier to click a mouse than to deal with crowded malls and long lines. There are also countless online sites offering great sales.  In conclusion, computers have had a positive impact on our lives. They have made communication easier, learning more accessible, and shopping more convenient. Although some may have concerns about computer use, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.
1356	1360	1	2	I whole - heartedly support the advancement of computer technology. Using a computer offers numerous benefits, starting with the development of hand - eye coordination. This skill is crucial as it sharpens our reflexes in daily life. For instance, in sports like baseball, football, or basketball, hand - eye coordination is essential. In a real - life scenario, when driving on the highway and suddenly facing an oncoming car that has swerved into the wrong lane, quick reflexes enabled by hand - eye coordination can be life - saving. Without exposure to computers, many people might lack this important skill.  Computers also provide a window to the world. Through the internet, which is an integral part of having a computer, one can easily research foreign countries or learn about different people. For someone planning to visit a foreign land but having no prior knowledge, the internet can offer all the necessary information.  Moreover, computers facilitate online communication. People can chat with friends they know in real life or make new friends online. This expands their social circle. However, it's important to remember that in - person socialization should not be neglected. Some individuals find it easier to communicate online, and while this can lead to forming new friendships, it can be risky for younger people, so caution is necessary.  In conclusion, the advantages of computer technology are undeniable. It enhances our reflexes, allows us to explore far - off places, and provides a platform for online interaction. These benefits make computers almost a necessity in every home.
1357	1361	1	2	"In modern society, it's rare to find someone who can't operate a computer. According to the ""Shift Happens"" statistics project on YouTube, a staggering @PERCENT1 of children in @LOCATION1 have used a computer by the age of four. I firmly believe that computers are one of the greatest technological advancements for the human race, as they have positively impacted education, reconnection with old friends, and even the environment.  In the education system, computers have been a game - changer. At my school, there are three computer labs with about twenty - five computers each, a library with twenty computers, and each teacher has two computers in their classroom. Teachers can effortlessly assign research projects to students, and there are websites where absent students can get their next - day assignments. Teachers can also store grade books on their hard drives, which saves paper and ensures accurate final grades. As a student, I've witnessed firsthand how computers have improved schools in multiple ways.  When it comes to reconnecting with old friends, computers have made the process much simpler. Social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and @CAPS2 are invaluable for finding friends from @DATE1 camp. For example, if you've been promoted and want to share the news but only have an old friend's email address, you can send an instant message and even ask for their phone number.  Computers are also playing a role in environmental conservation. My friend recently bought a Sony laptop that is energy - star rated, meaning it's eco - friendly. Online encyclopedias, newspapers, and journals save paper, and modern computers consume less electricity.  In conclusion, computers are clearly a boon to @LOCATION1. They have revolutionized education, made reconnection easier, and contributed to environmental protection. We should embrace this technological advancement and recognize it as a remarkable invention."
1358	1362	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I strongly believe that computer usage should be limited. Recently, it has become evident that computers have a negative impact on society, and they should be a hobby rather than an addiction.  Take my step - mom, @PERSON1, as an example. She used to be a size six and exercised for two hours every day after work. But when my dad bought her a lime - green, @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 laptop for her birthday, she got addicted to @CAPS3 (a computer game). She started cutting down on her exercise routine, and within six months, she gained over ten pounds and is now a size fourteen. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people gain weight because they reduce their exercise time to spend more on the computer.  My step - dad, @PERSON4, is another case. After work, he goes straight to the computer instead of interacting with the family. He gets angry when @PERSON2 (@NUM1 years old) wants to play with him. He spends hours from three o'clock till ten o'clock playing chess with strangers online, unknowingly breaking the bond with his loved ones.  Cyber - bullying is also a major issue. My cousin @PERSON3 joined @CAPS4 @CAPS2 last @DATE1. Soon after, she started receiving threatening messages from girls aged thirteen to twenty. One day, she was even physically attacked by a gang of girls on the street. Thankfully, she survived and deleted her @CAPS4 account. Studies indicate that @PERCENT2 of teenagers are involved in cyber - bullying.  In conclusion, the negative effects of excessive computer use are clear. The issues of cyber - bullying, reduced exercise, and less family interaction are significant. I urge you to take my suggestion seriously and consider measures to limit computer use.
1359	1363	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper, the debate on whether computers benefit society is ongoing, and in my opinion, they definitely do.  First, computers are a great source of entertainment. On a rainy day, when going outside isn't an option, the computer can be a fun alternative. It brings joy to children and can also be a source of motivation. For example, if a child wants to play a new game on their favorite website but has unfinished homework, parents can use the computer as an incentive. They can set a time limit for computer use as well. For teenagers and adults, social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace are popular means of communication. Although some people misuse these platforms, users can customize their pages to avoid problems, and overall, children become more social.  Second, computers are highly informational. With just a few keystrokes and a click of the mouse, one can access a wealth of knowledge from around the world. Whether you want to learn about a particular person, place, or how to prepare for something, the computer can provide all the necessary information. You can then share this knowledge with others.  Third, computers make life less stressful. Typing on a computer is much easier than writing @NUM3 pages by hand. They also help in organizing work, making it easier to find files. For example, you can simply go to ""@CAPS2 documents"" to locate your work.  In conclusion, computers are an indispensable part of our lives. They offer entertainment, provide information, and simplify our tasks. It's hard to imagine a world without them. I hope you'll consider the points in this letter."
1360	1364	1	2	I concur with those who believe that computers benefit society. They serve as a learning tool, a way to pass free time, and a means of communicating with distant friends and family.  As a learning tool, computers are invaluable. Many computer users utilize them to gain knowledge and complete work. There are numerous educational websites covering every subject imaginable. For example, if you're interested in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 culture, you can find all the information you need. Additionally, there are programs designed to simplify writing papers and presenting information. Using these programs, it's easier to stay ahead in work and present facts clearly. Moreover, the work is saved on the computer, so it's unlikely to be lost.  Computers are also a great way to spend free time. There are websites for gaming, watching videos, and more. While some people may spend too much time on these, many know how to moderate their usage. There are also videos on important issues, like the president's messages shared through @CAPS4 videos, as people are more likely to be on their computers than watching TV.  When it comes to communication, computers are a boon. With email and social networking websites, it's easy to stay in touch with distant friends and family. My immigrant family finds this extremely valuable for communicating with relatives back home. People also make and maintain friendships through the internet. Scientists use it to publish ideas and experiments, enabling faster dissemination of information.  In conclusion, the benefits of computers are manifold. They aid in learning and work, provide entertainment, and facilitate communication. These advantages clearly show that computers are a positive force in society.
1361	1365	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I believe that when either children or adults acquire computers, they may not utilize them for beneficial purposes. Once people own computers, they tend to spend more time indoors, engrossed in these devices. They should venture outside and engage in physical activity. For example, if one is going to a friend's house, they could jog there instead of riding a bike. When individuals spend more time on their computers than interacting with friends, their social skills may deteriorate, and over time, they may struggle to communicate effectively. All they need to do is set a time limit for computer use and only use it for work when necessary. Computers can also serve positive functions. For instance, if a student has a school project and needs to type it or search for pictures online, the computer becomes a valuable resource. Those whose jobs involve working with or fixing computers will naturally spend a significant amount of time on them. Moreover, computers enable interaction with people across the globe and offer opportunities to learn about interesting facts and places. However, computers can be misused. People might use them solely to play new and exciting video games, which can lead to obesity. They can also be employed for sexual harassment, stalking, or even for conducting illegal activities such as drug dealing or purchasing. In conclusion, it is evident that computers pose risks in many aspects. I hope you will carefully consider these important points and understand the reasons behind my concerns. Thank you and have a good day.
1362	1366	1	2	Dear Local newspaper, I am of the opinion that computers have a negative impact on people. They lead to a lack of exercise, less time spent with family and friends, and can impart wrong ideas to younger children. The primary reason for the negative impact of computers is the time wasted on them that could be better spent on exercise for maintaining good health. Take my mother as an example. She runs @NUM1 miles every day and still finds time to use the computer. Excessive computer use is harmful, but moderate use is less so. My mother allows me to use the computer but also insists that I go outside and run around. There is much discussion about obesity, and computers are contributing to this problem among both children and adults. Instead of being active outdoors, they simply sit in front of the computer. Another significant issue is that children and adults will have less time to create memories with their families. My mother often tells me that the best part of childhood is making memories with loved ones. My friends and I enjoy going to playgrounds and having fun outdoors, which makes us laugh. Laughter is known to promote happiness and health. Finally, computers can give younger children the wrong ideas. I have @NUM1 younger sisters who love using the computer, but some websites are inappropriate for them. For example, @CAPS2 has videos posted by bad people that can mislead young children. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on people. They reduce the time available for maintaining health, spending time with family and friends, and can lead children astray. I hope my points have made it clear that computers can be detrimental.
1363	1367	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I wish to inform the public that using computers is not as bad as it may seem. One of the reasons computers are beneficial is the ability to meet people through platforms like @CAPS2, Yahoo, @ORGANIZATION1, or Gmail. For example, we can connect with someone from @LOCATION1 and learn about their culture and beliefs. Another reason is that computers provide access to news. If someone doesn't have @CAPS3 or a newspaper, they can still stay informed about current events through websites such as nbc.com or fox.com. In conclusion, computers offer valuable opportunities for communication and information access, making them a useful tool in our lives.
1364	1368	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I wonder what percentage of people worldwide believe that computers have a positive impact on them. Approximately @PERCENT1 of the world's population thinks that computers are an excellent means of communication with friends, family, and people from different parts of the globe. They also note that computers improve hand - eye coordination for both adults and students and serve as a wonderful educational resource in schools and workplaces. Computers are a great way to communicate because they are equipped with programs that use digital codes to connect users across the world. Platforms like Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace are popular communication tools that help people become more social, which is beneficial for a healthy life. More than half of the world uses these communication sources because they are convenient and allow people to express themselves more freely. Additionally, these platforms are useful for seeing loved ones who live far away. For example, I live in @LOCATION1, and I use MySpace and Facebook to stay connected with my family and friends in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION3, etc. Moreover, computers enhance hand - eye coordination for adults and students. In conclusion, computers clearly have numerous positive aspects, including facilitating communication, improving coordination, and providing educational value. They have become an integral part of our lives, helping us stay connected and learn.
1365	1369	1	2	When using a computer, one has the ability to do virtually anything. The internet, with millions of users, has made life much easier. It allows us to communicate with people across the globe, search for information on any topic, and even encourages us to explore the world outside. In @DATE1, it is as easy to contact someone in @LOCATION1 as it is to reach someone in the next neighborhood. As long as there is an internet connection, we can stay in touch with friends on business trips or anyone else. Some may argue that a phone is sufficient, but the internet offers video chat, enabling us to see people thousands of miles away as if they were right in front of us. Staying connected has become the norm, and it's harder not to stay in touch. In the past, @NUM1 or @NUM2 years ago, obtaining information required a trip to the library, finding the right book, and hoping to find the relevant content. Today, we simply type a query into a search browser and get thousands of websites on the topic. The internet allows us to learn about any subject we're interested in. Although some people may spend too much time on computers, the internet also has positive effects. Seeing beautiful places and pictures online can inspire people to go outside and experience them firsthand. A recent poll showed that @PERCENT1 of people went on a hike after watching a YouTube video about the joys of outdoor activities. The internet also has the power to bring families together. For example, at dinner, we can find millions of great recipes on the internet. The internet was an amazing invention, and many would argue that it was the greatest. While it can be dangerous, with proper education, it is a valuable source of information and a great pastime if used responsibly. Decades ago, it seemed impossible to see and talk to people so far away, and getting information was a difficult task. We are fortunate to live in an age where the internet is readily available at our fingertips.
1366	1370	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 post, it has come to my attention that people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers instead of engaging in outdoor activities. This has led to a concerning rise in computer addiction. People are glued to their computers due to addiction, which in turn causes weight gain and a lack of exercise. It is imperative that we address this issue promptly. @PERSON1 reported that in @DATE1, @NUM1 people were using computers. By @DATE2, this number had nearly reached @NUM2 million, indicating a significant increase over the past couple of years. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have further exacerbated the addiction. Yale data shows that in @DATE3, only @NUM3 thousand people were on Facebook, but by @DATE4, over @NUM4 million people were using it. To me, this clearly suggests an addiction to computers. The problem of obesity is also closely linked to computer addiction. People often sit in front of their computers, consuming large amounts of food without giving their bodies a chance to burn off the calories through exercise. Dr. @PERSON2 has noted that in the last @NUM5 years, the average person's weight has increased by @NUM3 pounds due to this sedentary behavior. Doctors claim that they can't effectively address the weight issue unless people turn off their computers, which they believe is unrealistic. Exercise is crucial for maintaining good health. However, by sitting in front of a computer and eating, people are not getting the necessary physical activity, leading to weight gain. Dr. @PERSON3 emphasizes that people need to be aware of this problem. He points out that in the last @NUM7 years, the amount of exercise people get has decreased by @PERCENT1, which is a major factor contributing to obesity. In conclusion, the excessive use of computers, resulting in addiction, weight gain, and lack of exercise, is a significant problem that requires our immediate attention. I hope @CAPS1 post will take this matter seriously and consider possible solutions.
1367	1371	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that the negative impacts of computers on people far outweigh the positive ones. In @LOCATION1, computers have contributed significantly to the rising obesity rate, and this trend is worsening daily. Moreover, computers can be incredibly time - consuming, and they pose serious dangers to children, sometimes even resulting in death. I am convinced that computers are too harmful to society and should be restricted. Obesity is one of the most pressing issues in @LOCATION1, and its prevalence is increasing steadily. Over @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 population is obese, and computers have played a major role in this. Imagine being a computer addict. It's dinner time, but you don't want to waste time away from your computer. So, you rush to the nearest fast - food joint, buy a cheeseburger, fries, and a soda, and then go back home to eat while still on your computer. The fast food is unhealthy, and without exercise, your body has no chance to burn off the calories and carbohydrates. Computer addicts repeat this pattern almost daily, and before long, they can gain up to @NUM1 pounds. Computers not only contribute to obesity but are also extremely time - consuming. People waste hours on their computers without even realizing it. They get caught up in activities like checking emails, responding to notifications, and changing account settings. Before they know it, @NUM2 or @NUM3 hours have passed. This wasted time could be better spent with family, exercising, or finding a romantic partner. Time is precious, and we should not squander it on computers all day. In addition, computers can be very dangerous, especially for children. Across the country, kids are being victimized through computers. They expose themselves on chat sites, share too much personal information, and end up facing serious consequences such as being killed, raped, or bullied. Cyberbullying can be as harmful, if not more so, than traditional bullying. It can cause severe mental and emotional distress, leading to poor academic performance and even suicide. Moreover, the explicit content available on the internet can have a detrimental effect on a child's developing mind. Given these risks, computers are simply too dangerous and time - consuming. To safeguard the well - being of society, steps should be taken to limit their use. I hope the Local Newspaper will raise awareness about these issues and encourage action.
1368	1372	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 Local newspaper, I understand that you're concerned about people's excessive use of computers. In my opinion, computers are actually quite beneficial. They serve multiple purposes, including education, work, and entertainment. Many people use computers for school - related research and accessing various resources. It's much more convenient compared to using traditional books, which can be cumbersome and time - consuming. When you're on vacation, you can easily check hotel prices, find restaurants, and discover interesting places online, instead of making phone calls or driving around aimlessly. Computers are also valuable for work. People can store important documents and handle tasks like filing taxes on their computers. Additionally, they offer a lot of fun. There are chat platforms, games on Facebook, and other engaging activities. However, I'm also aware that some people spend too much time on computers. It's important to balance computer use with other activities. For example, instead of relying solely on electronic maps, we should also know how to read paper maps. Some individuals can spend @NUM1 hours on the computer, engaging in activities like Facebook and gaming. During @DATE1, when the weather is cold and sometimes snowy, many people tend to stay on their computers. While it's understandable, they shouldn't spend all their time indoors. It's essential to go outside and socialize with friends. In @DATE2, when the weather is nice, we should prioritize spending time with family and friends rather than being glued to the computer. In conclusion, computers are useful tools for directions, work, and schoolwork. But we must not overuse them. Electronics are not the entirety of life. I hope you'll agree that a balanced approach to computer use is the best way forward. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
1369	1373	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am of the opinion that computers are highly beneficial to society, despite some people's concerns. They offer significant advantages in communication, learning, and business operations. In terms of communication, computers have revolutionized the way we interact. Through platforms like @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and @CAPS6 - mail, we can easily connect with others. Families living far apart can communicate with just a click of a button. @CAPS5 allows students to chat with their friends after school and plan their evenings. Traditional long - distance calls can be expensive, costing @MONEY1 per call if made frequently. Over the past @NUM1 years, communication has advanced significantly, and computers are at the forefront of this evolution. Computers also enhance our learning capabilities. We can quickly look up facts about foreign places and people. For instance, if we want to know who was the @CAPS7 of @LOCATION1, we can find multiple relevant websites within minutes. This ability to access information expands our knowledge and allows us to learn things that we might not otherwise have the opportunity to. In the business world, computers are indispensable. They help store and manage a vast amount of data, including work - related information. Approximately @PERCENT1 of businesses rely on computers to file reports and communicate with other branches. I learned in class that before the widespread use of technology, jobs were much more difficult. Some people argue that using computers discourages people from going out and exercising. However, checking emails or looking up information only takes a few minutes. Overall, computers make our lives much easier. Without them, our daily lives and business operations would be far more complicated. In conclusion, the benefits of computers in communication, learning, and business are undeniable. They have become an essential part of our society, and we should embrace their use while being mindful of potential drawbacks.
1370	1374	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I strongly believe that we should have computers as they offer numerous benefits. Firstly, the internet provides a vast amount of information. Secondly, many websites contain historical data. Lastly, email is a convenient and cost - effective way to send messages to distant places. The internet is a treasure trove of information. If you don't have a newspaper on hand but have a laptop, you can still access the news. In fact, over @NUM1, @NUM2 people use their laptops for information rather than games. Even if the newspaper doesn't have the specific article you're looking for, you can find it on the internet using search engines like Yahoo and Google. There is also a wealth of historical information available on the internet. Instead of visiting a museum every day to learn about history, you can simply access historical websites. For example, when I had to do a project about the @CAPS4 with only four days to complete it, I found all the necessary information on a historical website and got an A+. People can easily find historical facts on the internet whenever they need them. Email is another great advantage of computers. Instead of texting people from far - away places, which can be costly, you can use email. It's free, and more than @NUM3 million people around the world prefer email over texting. Creating an email address is quick and easy, and you don't have to spend money to communicate with someone across the globe. In conclusion, the availability of information on the internet, the presence of historical data on websites, and the convenience of email make computers an essential tool. I hope that this perspective convinces you of the importance of having computers in our lives. Thank you for reading this article.
1371	1375	1	2	New computers from @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 are a valuable asset to society. Although many individuals may not initially recognize this, there are numerous compelling reasons to support this view. With a computer at hand, people will never find themselves bored, as there is an abundance of activities to engage in, knowledge to acquire, and tools to stay organized. When boredom strikes, a computer offers endless entertainment options. It allows people to communicate with friends, regardless of geographical distances, through various communication platforms. Additionally, there is a vast array of games available on numerous websites, catering to all interests. Concerns about game addiction can be easily addressed by setting a timer on the computer, which provides a warning before shutting down. Computers are not just for entertainment; they are also a rich source of knowledge. They are like a collective brain of @NUM1 scientists and mathematicians, offering quick access to information on any topic. For students working on school assignments or individuals seeking information for work, the computer provides a wealth of resources through numerous websites. Moreover, daily news updates keep users informed about global events. Staying organized is another significant advantage of using a computer. There are numerous software programs available that enable users to write documents, create graphs, and manage tasks efficiently. Approximately <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of working individuals rely on computers to perform their jobs and keep track of their work. Without computers, these individuals would face significant challenges, either losing their jobs or having to rely on paper - based systems, which would be highly inefficient. To safeguard data, users can back up their photos, files, and music to a @CAPS4. This ensures that important data is not lost in case of a computer malfunction. In conclusion, after considering these points, it is evident that computers are indeed a great benefit to society. The world as we know it today would be vastly different without the contributions of computers.
1372	1376	1	2	Dear @PERSON1, I am writing this letter to express my strong belief that computers have a negative impact on the average American. There are several reasons for this view. Firstly, excessive computer use leads to people spending less time outdoors. This lack of time spent in nature has far - reaching consequences. When people do not interact with the natural world, they tend to care less about the environment. For example, instead of going outside and enjoying the fresh air, they keep their air - conditioners running, wasting energy and money. If they were to step outside, they could not only save resources but also spend quality time with friends. Secondly, a sedentary lifestyle associated with long hours on the computer results in a lack of exercise. Sitting in front of a computer all day is not exercise; it is simply laziness. Exercise is essential for good health as it boosts self - esteem, gets the adrenaline flowing, helps in staying fit, and reduces the risk of health problems. Finally, computer use often disrupts family interactions. Instead of having family dinners together, one family member may be on the computer while others watch @CAPS1. This lack of communication can lead to frequent arguments and strained family relationships. Encouraging family members to sit at the table and discuss their day can help improve these relationships. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on people. I hope you will agree with my reasons, and together, we can find ways to ensure that people can use their computers while also leading active and socially - engaged lives.
1373	1377	1	2	Who wouldn't want to find a @NUM1 - star hotel or restaurant with just a click of a button? I certainly would, and I believe this highlights the question of whether we should continue to use computers for the betterment of society or limit computer use to increase physical activity. Computers are incredibly useful tools. They can perform tasks neatly and efficiently, which is essential for work that requires precision. Additionally, they provide access to the internet, allowing users to explore a vast amount of useful information. Computers are not just the traditional bulky boxes; they are also integrated into various electronic devices. For instance, if you forget to turn off the lights while on vacation, you can use a handheld computer to control them. Communication is also made easy with a computer. All you need is a computer, a microphone or headset, speakers, and special software. Once you have these, you can connect with people all over the world. You can talk to your loved ones and family members. If you want a more personal touch, you can add a webcam, which allows for face - to - face communication. And if you don't have the necessary hardware, you can still communicate through texting using the computer keyboard. Computers offer more than just work and communication. You can play video games on them, but your computer must meet the right specifications, which might come at a high cost. In conclusion, despite the potential drawbacks such as reduced physical activity, the benefits of computers in terms of work, communication, and entertainment are undeniable. They have become an integral part of our lives, and we should continue to use them while also being mindful of maintaining a balanced lifestyle.
1374	1378	1	2	Dear newspaper, I am certain that you have a computer, as it is an indispensable tool for gathering information. I firmly believe that computers are beneficial, and everyone should own one. Computers are a great source of knowledge. They allow users to learn new things and search for any information they desire. In a school setting, students can use computers for research, which is also applicable in the workplace. People from all walks of life can use computers to work, learn, and acquire new skills quickly and easily. Instead of spending hours searching through books for information, a computer provides instant access to a vast amount of data. Another significant advantage of computers is their role in communication. If you have family or friends living far away or in another country, you can stay in touch with them through computers. Web - camming and emailing are convenient ways to maintain close relationships. This is also useful for online business, as it allows you to conduct your job and communicate with colleagues and clients efficiently. In case of an emergency meeting, sending an email is a quick and effective way to inform everyone. Computers are also an excellent way to learn about disasters in other countries. If you miss the news, you can access it on your computer and stay informed about global events. If you live away from your hometown, you can check what's happening there and plan visits for special occasions. You can also explore new places if you're considering moving or going on vacation. In conclusion, based on these reasons, it is clear that computers are highly beneficial. They facilitate learning, communication, and the acquisition of knowledge about the world. If you don't have a computer yet, I strongly recommend getting one, as it can enhance your life in many ways.
1375	1379	1	2	"Dear @LOCATION1, it has come to my attention that an increasing number of people are spending excessive amounts of time on computers. A recent study reported that ""@PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's population uses a computer for more than @NUM1 hours a day"". This trend has several negative consequences for society. One of the major issues is the impact on health. Spending too much time on computers leads to a lack of exercise. Take @LOCATION3 as an example. She used to play soccer and get six hours of exercise a week. However, since she started spending more time on Facebook, she now only gets one hour of exercise a week, which has resulted in weight gain and a decline in her health. Unfortunately, there are millions of children like @LOCATION3 who are not getting enough physical activity due to excessive computer use. Another problem is that people are spending less time enjoying nature. Instead of going outside and experiencing the beauty of the natural world, they choose to surf the web. This lack of connection with nature leads to people caring less about the planet and its animals, which is truly a shame as nature is both important and enjoyable. Furthermore, excessive computer use has a negative impact on family relationships. Children are interacting less with their family members. They no longer help with cooking, cleaning, or spending time with siblings. A mother reported that since her daughter got a new laptop, she has stopped playing with her baby brother and friends. This is a common problem among teens today, as computers have limited the time families spend together. In conclusion, computers are causing harm to society. They keep people isolated in their rooms, preventing them from exercising, enjoying nature, and having quality time with their families and friends. As a result, computers have become a nuisance to society. It is crucial that people who spend more than an hour a day on computers use that time more productively, such as exercising or socializing. Overall, it is clear that computers are no longer a beneficial part of society."
1376	1380	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, it has come to my attention that there is a disagreement among us regarding whether computers have a negative or positive effect on people. I firmly believe that computers do not benefit society. In today's modern world, many individuals spend an excessive amount of time on the computer instead of engaging in activities such as exercising, spending time with family and friends, and enjoying nature.  Computers are becoming a significant problem in society as they interfere with our physical well - being. The obesity rate in the @LOCATION1 is continuously rising. It's not the population size that's growing but the size of the people themselves! According to a recent survey, @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people in the @LOCATION1 are overweight or obese. @PERSON1, a surgeon at @ORGANIZATION1, after dealing with a severe case of obesity, stated, ""The main culprit of the @ORGANIZATION2's obesity percentage is not overeating; it is actually electronics, especially computers."" Obesity can be addressed easily. Instead of sitting for hours staring at a screen, people in America should go outside. Simple activities like riding a bike or walking the dog can make a difference. Just get off the computer and go outside or to the gym for exercise.  Secondly, computers disrupt relationships with family and friends. From personal experience, I know that parents are frustrated when their kids miss family dinners or decline to go out with friends because they ""need"" to finish a game level or look something up on the internet. Family and friends should hold great importance in our lives, but unfortunately, for most people, this is not the case. Psychologist @PERSON2 has discovered that having reliable family and friends by your side makes you a happier and more enjoyable person. By eliminating computers from our lives, we can create a happier and more pleasant society in the @LOCATION1, benefiting everyone.  Furthermore, reducing our computer usage gives us a better chance to experience the wonders of nature. Most people don't realize what they're missing by not going outside. There are amazing things right in our backyards that we may never experience due to our computer addiction. @NUM3 years ago, people managed to function well without computers, and we should be able to do the same. @PERCENT1 of people have never even been camping! So, the next time you're tempted to spend another @NUM4 hours on the computer, take a walk and you'll likely be amazed by what you find outdoors.  In conclusion, computers do not contribute positively to society. They keep people from going outside, enjoying nature, and spending time with loved ones. I hope this convinces you to see my perspective. Thank you for your time."
1377	1381	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I'm of the opinion that computers have a negative impact on people. One reason is that people need exercise. They shouldn't be sitting at a desk all day playing computer games. Kids, in particular, should be outside playing and being active. If people just sit at a computer all day and eat junk food, more and more will become obese. If more people exercise, they'll start eating healthier food, and many will lead healthier, happier lives.  Another reason I think computers are negative is that some kids @MONTH1 get cyber - bullied. Cyberbullying is when someone is bullied online. Kids do this so they don't have to say mean things in person, and the victim @MONTH1 not even know who the bully is. Also, kids @MONTH1 meet strangers online who seem nice but whose true identities are unknown. These strangers can trick kids into doing things they normally wouldn't do. Many girls have been in danger because of this.  Lastly, people may miss out on fun activities with family or friends, like swimming on @DATE1 or sledding in winter. If you're at home on the computer, you can't enjoy these outdoor activities and get exercise at the same time.  These are the reasons I believe computers have a negative effect on people.
1378	1382	1	2	"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I firmly believe that the advantages of computers far outweigh their disadvantages. Computers provide an additional avenue for learning about the world and serve as an excellent research tool. If a child or anyone spends what a family member considers an unreasonable amount of time on the computer, it seems to be an issue within the family rather than a broader social problem.  Some people may argue, ""Look in the encyclopedia to learn about the world,"" but using a computer is faster, easier, and more time - efficient. In fact, most people in the current generation may not even own an encyclopedia set. For instance, if I want to learn more about @LOCATION1, instead of searching through a dictionary or encyclopedia, I can simply go on the computer, type in @LOCATION1, and find a wealth of information and resources.  When it comes to research for projects or reports, whether in school or the workplace, a computer is extremely useful. While a dictionary and a thesaurus are helpful, they are separate tools. Compared to a computer, which combines a dictionary, thesaurus, encyclopedia, and more in one, these traditional research tools can be cumbersome. So, the next time you need to research something, reach for the keyboard instead of the bookshelf.  The problem of excessive computer use appears to be more of a family matter than a social one. Technology has transformed our world. Since the invention of computers, they have become smaller and increasingly useful. Computers have opened numerous doors for our society. For example, space travel, which seems normal in this generation, would not be possible without computers.  In conclusion, I don't believe that computers harm our society. Instead, they are the building blocks of our world. As you read this, I hope you recognize the many benefits of having computers. A computer is a valuable learning aid, the ultimate research tool, and an integral part of our society today. I encourage you to consider what our world would be like without computers."
1379	1383	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 register, I am writing to emphasize that computers have a positive impact on people. They are helpful in providing directions, supporting the economy, and enabling instant messaging.  Computers can offer valuable directions. Imagine you need to go to a far - off place and have no @CAPS3 in your car. The computer becomes your best option. For example, @DATE1 when I was traveling south, we didn't have a @CAPS4.P.S and didn't know the way. We logged onto Google and easily found our directions.  Computers also play a crucial role in helping the economy. In today's economic situation, instead of people driving to pay their bills, they can pay online. This saves money as the state doesn't have to spend as much on fuel for cars or on rebuilding infrastructure. For instance, a gas station near my house is being rebuilt due to pipe problems, which is costing us all about @MONEY1. This shows that online bill - paying is a way to save the economy.  Instant messaging is another great advantage of computers. If you don't have a house phone or a cellphone and need to tell a family member or friend about something serious, instant messaging (@CAPS5) is a reliable option. For example, my friend didn't have a house phone or cellphone when someone tried to break into her house. She instant - messaged me on my cellphone, and I was able to inform her mom.  After considering how computers help with directions, support the economy, and enable instant messaging, I hope you can agree that computers are beneficial. It's still your opinion, but I urge you to think about what I've presented and not dismiss it.
1380	1384	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, in my opinion, computers do not have a positive effect on people. Online, you can communicate with various people on different websites, but most of the time, you don't know who you're actually talking to. Also, not all the information available online is true. Moreover, computers prevent people from engaging in productive activities.  Online communication has its risks. There are multiple ways to contact people on the internet, such as chat rooms, blogs, and email. However, you can't be sure if the person you're talking to is who they claim to be. In the past, it was rare for someone to be caught for kidnapping a child by pretending to be someone online, but nowadays, more cases are being discovered. My friend is being stalked online by an unknown person who hasn't been caught. We never thought such a thing could happen, but it did. Additionally, once information is posted online, it can always be retrieved, even if deleted. So, one should be cautious about what they post.  Not all information found online is accurate. Professionals state that @PERCENT1 of kids who researched a project online and then used a print source found the online information to be false. On websites like Wikipedia, anyone can change the content, and @PERCENT2 of websites allow such open editing. Also, posts and pictures on the internet may not always be appropriate, and there are valid reasons to keep children away from such content.  Computers also keep people from being productive. While they may help with hand - eye coordination, they don't contribute to physical fitness. In @CAPS4 alone, @PERCENT3 of the population is overweight, which is a significant number. Dr. @DR1 says that online games prevent kids from getting the necessary exercise and fresh air that every growing child needs.  In conclusion, the internet keeps children from going outside to play. Not all the information found online is true, and not everyone you meet online is who they seem to be. This is why I believe that computers have a negative impact on society.
1381	1385	1	2	"In a recent poll within the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, it was found that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 use computers on a daily basis. Computers exert a highly positive influence on individuals. They promptly provide information about news, traffic, and weather, facilitate interaction with others, and enable the acquisition of new knowledge. It is nearly impossible to fathom how arduous life would be without computers. They have become an indispensable daily tool for millions of people.  One way computers benefit people is by keeping them informed about news, traffic, and weather. For instance, if there are signs of a hurricane approaching their homes, people can immediately be aware of it by simply accessing the internet. Similarly, in the event of a nearby shooting, individuals can stay well - informed by reading online articles. By providing information about potential dangers, computers safeguard people and their families. Moreover, computers also play a significant role in people's daily lifestyles. Take my father as an example; he commutes to work every morning and always checks for traffic updates online to avoid congestion and reach work safely and on time. Without computers, people would be oblivious to the various harms and difficulties they might encounter.  Another positive aspect of computers is that they allow people to interact with others. Video chatting and instant messaging are popular means of communication, with @PERCENT2 of the world engaging in these activities. It enhances people's social lives. For example, if one hasn't seen a close family member or friend for a long time, video chatting and instant messaging can help them catch up and strengthen their relationship. No one wants to let long periods of silence come between them and their loved ones.  Computers also serve as a valuable educational tool. For students, the computer is a primary source of education. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 stated, ""Computers are instrumental in the growth of my students. I have them use computers daily for reports and to expand their learning."" The internet now offers digital textbooks, eliminating the need for students to carry heavy books and worry about forgetting them. Additionally, if students have difficulty understanding classroom material, they can seek extra help and guidance online, thereby deepening their knowledge.  In conclusion, computers have a profoundly positive impact on people's lives. They provide direct access to news, traffic, and weather information, enable social interaction, and support learning. Since @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are already using computers positively, there is no reason to stop."
1382	1386	1	2	"Dear @LOCATION1 Harold, the use of computers is on the rise, yet not everyone believes it benefits society. Supporters of technological advancements hold that computers have a positive effect on people. However, computers can also have negative consequences. They can prevent children from exercising, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends.  Firstly, computers can impede children's physical activity. A high - school student remarked, ""@CAPS1 I can never get outside after school because I'm checking my email."" A recent study indicates that @PERCENT1 of students at a middle school go straight to the computer when they get home. This shows that nearly half of the middle - school students are glued to their computers, highlighting how computers can be a problem.  Secondly, some children spend more time indoors than outdoors. A middle - school student said, ""I spend most of my time breathing in air - conditioning (or heat) rather than fresh air."" Picture a child sitting in front of a computer screen, playing a game or using social media, while outside it's a beautiful day in the middle of @DATE1. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students admit that they spend more time indoors. Clearly, computers can have a negative impact on a child's well - being.  Finally, computers can disrupt a child's time spent with family or friends. An elementary student said, ""I @CAPS1 spend an entire evening at a family party on the computer."" @NUM3 out of @NUM4 homes have a computer, and children use it @NUM5. This means that little @PERSON1 of the @PERSON2's household has time to play outside with friends.  In conclusion, computers can do more harm than good in a household. They can prevent children from exercising, enjoying the outdoors, and spending quality time with family. I urge you to encourage your children, grandchildren, nieces, or nephews to reduce their computer time."
1383	1387	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, it is evident that an increasing number of people are using computers. While some express concerns about the impact on people's health, I firmly believe that technological advancements bring about positive effects.  One reason is that technological progress enhances our intelligence. When we encounter questions, we can search for answers on the computer. This not only helps us acquire knowledge but also enables us to share it with others. The computer provides a wealth of useful information that can be beneficial in the future.  Secondly, technological advancements grant us access to helpful websites. Not all information can be found in libraries. The computer offers access to biographies, educational websites, and important educational resources such as online tutoring for students with academic difficulties.  Finally, technological progress facilitates online communication. Many people, like teachers, use email for educational purposes. If a student is facing difficulties with their work, they can simply email the teacher to seek assistance.  In conclusion, the advancements in technology have numerous benefits. They enhance our intelligence, provide access to valuable resources, and enable effective communication. I hope you will consider these points.
1384	1388	1	2	I firmly believe that computers have a highly positive impact on our lives. They are extremely helpful, teaching us essential life skills, assisting us with daily tasks through their technological capabilities, and enabling us to stay connected with others and make new acquaintances.  Computers are excellent teachers. Learning to use a computer is a crucial life skill. In most workplaces today, computer proficiency is a necessity. Moreover, computers help develop hand - eye coordination, which is also useful in sports. For example, catching a ball requires good hand - eye coordination.  The technology provided by computers is invaluable in our daily lives. If we need directions, we can easily look them up on the computer. Without this assistance, we would have to call restaurants or rely on other less convenient methods. For students, writing papers and reports without a computer would be a nightmare. They would have to read countless books to gather information.  Computers also play a vital role in maintaining relationships. When loved ones move far away, it can be difficult to stay in touch over the phone. However, through platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and @ORGANIZATION1, we can chat, share pictures, and keep updated on each other's lives, even from @LOCATION1.  In conclusion, computers are remarkable machines. They impart lifelong lessons, assist us in various tasks, and keep our relationships intact. I truly believe that computers are essential for the smooth running of the world.
1385	1389	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper, there is a significant number of people addicted to computers. While computers can be beneficial for work and education for some, most children are addicted to computer games. In fact, @PERCENT1 of children are computer - addicted.  Computers have multiple effects on people, and not all of them are positive. They can negatively impact children's education and cause an increase in electricity bills. Moreover, they can be dangerous, as millions of teenagers have lost their lives due to online interactions with strangers.  Computers can be detrimental to children's education. Although they can be useful for studies and projects, many children use computers mainly for gaming. As a result, they learn little at school but a great deal about computer games. Parents are naturally concerned about this and do not want their children's education to be affected.  Another issue is the increase in electricity bills. Computers run on electricity, and having a computer at home can lead to a significant rise in costs. For example, if a family spent @MONEY1 on electricity @DATE1 when they didn't have a computer, the bill might increase to @MONEY2 after getting a computer.  Most alarmingly, computers can be dangerous. @PERCENT2 of teenagers have been killed because of online interactions with strangers. Many websites, such as @CAPS2, have become risky. For instance, @DATE1 months ago, a husband and wife were killed due to an incident on @CAPS2. The husband killed his wife because of her ""single"" relationship status on the site and then committed suicide.  In conclusion, computers can be both good and bad. Parents should only have computers at home if they are used appropriately and kept in a place where children cannot access them without supervision. It is time to seriously consider whether we really need computers at home. We can engage in other activities with our families, exercise, go on picnics, or take vacations. I urge you to spread the message to encourage people to limit their computer use and spend more time with their loved ones."
1386	1390	1	2	Dear Editor of the newspaper, I am aware that you believe computers have no impact on people. However, computers do indeed have an impact. Firstly, computers enable people to quickly access information. Most individuals use search engines like Google or Ask to find details such as the location of a store, a restaurant's contact number, or the price and availability of a product on sale. This information - finding ability is one of the significant positive impacts of computers on people.  Secondly, computers play a crucial role in work. For job - seekers, there are numerous job opportunities available online. Both adults and children use word - processing software on computers for work reports or school essays. You may have also used a computer to type information for your newspaper.  Finally, communication is another area where computers shine. Many kids use platforms like Facebook, [Specific App], or Oovoo to stay in touch with friends, especially those who have moved away. These platforms also allow people to communicate with far - away family members at any time.  I understand your perspective, but it is evident that computers have multiple positive impacts on people. They assist in finding what people are looking for, aid in work, and are an excellent means of communication. Before making any decisions, it is essential to carefully consider these effects.
1387	1391	1	2	I firmly believe that computers have a positive influence on people. When people use computers, they do not spend excessive amounts of time continuously. Although they might spend a total of [Number] hours on the computer in a day, they engage in other activities such as going to school, having meals, and participating in various events in between.  Some people rely on computers for their [Profession]. News media companies need computers for editing and printing newspapers, as well as for posting news on their websites. It is hard to imagine what most people would do without computers.  The new technology associated with computers is also a significant advantage. It facilitates interaction among people. For those with long - distance friends or family members, there are numerous ways to communicate, such as using [Specific App], Skype, Oovoo, [Another App], or email. When I use the computer, I don't just passively watch [Video Platform] videos. Instead, I interact with my friends. A significant percentage of the population between the ages of [Age Range] have a [Specific App], and another percentage use Skype or Oovoo to communicate with those who are too far away to visit.  Computers are also beneficial for schoolwork. If students encounter something they don't know, they can simply search for it on the internet. For example, if they need to translate [Language 1] to [Language 2], they can use the computer. A considerable percentage of people have learned new words using the internet. Even if a word is not in the dictionary, it can usually be found online.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people. People do not spend so much time on computers that they neglect outdoor activities or socializing with friends. In fact, computers are necessary for some professions, and the new technology allows people to interact globally. They are useful for schoolwork, finding definitions, and translation, and they are far from being negative influences that take away from our lives.
1388	1392	1	2	Dear [Newspaper Name], I wonder if you remember when you were a kid. Back then, aside from the telephone, there were no computers or other electronics. Today, computers are highly advanced and bring many benefits to society in various aspects, including hand - eye coordination, communication, and learning.  Computers help improve hand - eye coordination in an unnoticeable way. When typing an email or an essay, people's hands are actively engaged, and this skill can be transferred to other activities. [Name], a [Age] - year - old tennis player, said that regularly using the computer and then playing tennis helped him improve in his favorite sport. A survey of [Number] people found that [Number] of them considered hand - eye coordination an important skill and believed that daily activities like using computers helped them enhance it.  Communication on computers has also become extremely popular. Typing emails is a fast, fun, and efficient way to communicate. There are many other popular and quick communication methods online, such as email, AIM, Facebook, etc. It is convenient to talk to friends and family online, especially when other options are costly. For example, [Person 1] lives in [Location 1], and her sister [Person 2] in [Location 3]. Due to expensive calling plans and high - cost plane tickets, they could not stay in touch easily until webcams became available. Now, they can see each other almost every week. Some people argue that letters can be used for communication, but they cannot convey video - taped moments like a baby's first steps or cute YouTube videos. Moreover, people can meet new friends online and maintain close relationships.  Computers also make learning and working easier. Online, people can learn about a wide range of topics, from the meaning of words to information about natural disasters like the earthquake in [Location 4]. Keeping track of everything on a single computer is very convenient. [Teacher's Name], a [Subject] teacher at [School Name], said that to protect the planet and reduce paper waste, more things are being made electronic. A large percentage of the homework for [Grade] students is now online.  In conclusion, computers have significantly changed society for the better. In the [Time Period], they have become an integral part of people's daily lives, offering benefits in terms of hand - eye coordination, communication, and learning.
1389	1393	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, in my view, computers are having a negative impact on people. They consume a large amount of time that could be spent on exercise, and as a result, people have less time to enjoy nature. Moreover, they disrupt the time spent with family and friends. I am certain that if more people were to limit their use of [Device 1] and [Device 2], many of these problems would be resolved.  Obesity is a major issue in [Location]. One in five children is obese, and I believe that computer use is contributing to this problem. I recall instances when I wanted to go outside and exercise, but the allure of fun games and videos on the internet kept me glued to the computer. While moderate computer use is fine, many people abuse this privilege. Obesity can lead to serious health problems such as clogged arteries and strokes. No parent wants to see their child suffer from such issues at a young age, but it is difficult to find a solution when taking away the computer is a challenge for many.  In addition to health problems, computers also rob us of precious family time. People today put in a lot of effort in their daily lives, and it would have been great if they could have more quality time with their loved ones. Memories that could have been created with family and friends are being stolen by the computer.  In conclusion, I see the computer as an addiction. Millions of people who spend excessive time on the computer gain weight. It blocks the opportunity to enjoy nature and puts relationships with family and friends on hold. It is high time we recognize how detrimental the computer can be when misused.
1390	1394	1	2	I believe that computers have a negative impact on society. Firstly, they allow kids to be bullied at all hours of the day. Experts state that [Number] out of every [Number] kids have tools to communicate online, and [Number] in [Number] of these kids are bullied online. News reports have shown that half of the kids have experienced online bullying. Since kids can access the internet at any time, they are vulnerable to bullying even in the supposed safety of their homes. Some children are only happy when they get home thinking they are safe from bullying, but the computer has invaded this safe space.  Secondly, computers replace exercise. A [Football Scout's Title] football scout mentioned that each year, fewer people play sports due to video games and computers. In America, the obesity rate among kids has increased, and many attribute this to computers taking the place of physical activity. Contrary to the belief that computer use improves hand - eye coordination, most experts agree that it is not the case as it is the mouse that moves, not the hands in a way that truly enhances this skill.  Finally, students' grades are lower than ever. Most teachers claim that [Number] in [Number] students get good grades, and these are the students who do not spend excessive time on the computer. A Discovery Channel report stated that most kids spend [Number] hours on the computer but less than [Number] hour on studying or homework. Computers were originally designed for storing information and learning, but they have devolved into tools for [Negative Activity], creating lazy kids, and hindering learning.  In conclusion, it is clear that the negative impacts of computers on society, including bullying, reduced exercise, and lower academic performance, are significant. We need to take steps to ensure that computers are used in a more responsible and beneficial way.
1391	1395	1	2	Are you hearing your children respond with “Okay mom, one second” and the sound of clicking when you call them for dinner more often than usual? If so, you need to pay attention to the following message. We at @ORGANIZATION1 believe that children and adults are spending excessive time on laptops or computers. They are not engaging in outdoor exercise, enjoying nature, or interacting with their families. These issues can lead to more significant problems that have already manifested in @MONTH1, such as @CAPS2, financial difficulties, and eventually depression. Keep reading and consider if any of these situations have happened or could happen to you. @CAPS2 is a major concern as kids all over @LOCATION1 are spending more time on their computers than outdoors. Every day, I see my nephew on his computer, and I notice him getting fatter. Studies have shown that children and adults with Facebook or MySpace accounts gain about @NUM1 pounds every @NUM2 months. If they spend @NUM3 to @NUM2 hours a day on these platforms, they will gain @NUM5 pounds every month. Sooner or later, the percentage of @ORGANIZATION1 people who are obese in the state will increase from @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2. This can lead to job loss and laziness. When people spend most of their time on Facebook and MySpace, they may lose their jobs. More than @PERCENT3 of the state's citizens have a Facebook or MySpace account. When people become addicted to these platforms, they spend more time on them than on their work - related tasks. As a result, they may get fired, be unable to pay bills, loans, and mortgages, which can all lead to depression. Depression is widespread in the state and even the country. People are losing jobs because of their excessive use of computers and the internet. Some are even committing crimes like murder and attempting suicide due to job loss or the breakdown of family relationships. Some people are so addicted to the internet that they neglect their newborn family members. This depression needs to stop. So, fight for the right to end internet addiction and live a great life. Put down the computer, pick up a book, meet with friends and family, and keep your job. Don't let these reasons come between you and a fulfilling life.
1392	1396	1	2	Some @CAPS2 people think that the invention of the computer and the internet is a terrifying thing, and in truth, it is a significant time - consumer. A local newspaper is conducting a survey on people's opinions about technology. People spend far too much time on computers when they could be outside, enjoying nature, exercising, or interacting with others in person. Technological advancements are often just a waste of time. When the weather is nice, people should be outdoors. Although the sun can be harmful to the skin, it can also boost energy. Meanwhile, the carbon dioxide in buildings makes people sleepy. @PERCENT1 of the people surveyed by @ORGANIZATION1 said they feel better when they go outside. @CAPS2 people are becoming obese while they could be exercising. Obesity is a problem as people sit at the computer all day, and excessive computer use contributes to this issue. @PERCENT2 of the people surveyed reported that @CAPS3 computer usage has led to less interaction with friends in person. People may forget their manners because they are not used to real - world communication when they spend so much time online. Those who support computer usage might argue that there are ways to communicate online, such as through @CAPS3 @CAPS4, etc. However, online chatting is not always safe. You can't be sure who is on your buddy list unless you can see their face. Computers have become a major distraction in society. They have caused people to forget how to use manners and communicate effectively in the real world. It's time for responsible townspeople to take action, get up, and find something else to do!
1393	1397	1	2	In my opinion, people should only use the computer when they really need to, such as typing reports or checking emails. What's the point of going on the computer just to play games? It gets boring for me. I use the computer to chat with friends, check my email, and then I go outside to play. You should limit your computer use to @NUM1 minutes a day and then go get some exercise. If you stay on the computer all day, you'll start to smell bad, gain weight, become lazy, and no one wants these things. Instead, you can play basketball, go on a bike ride with friends, or go swimming. I do these activities every day, and that's why I'm in good shape. I stay healthy and fit instead of sitting on the computer all day, especially on sunny days. Going outside gives you a chance to be more active and hang out with neighborhood kids. When I get home every day, I do my homework first, then I go outside to play. Later, I use the computer for @NUM1 minutes, and then I'm done. I go to bed, and I follow the same routine the next day. I'm sure everyone will agree with me because I know I'm right.
1394	1398	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, some people claim that computers are fun, smart, and harmless. But is that really the case? Do computers cause harm? Well, I know for a fact that computers can consume a great deal of people's time. For instance, many people don't go outside as often because they are usually on their computers. What do people do on the computer? There are numerous activities. It can be for fun, like chatting with friends on various sites, which often takes up a lot of time. People can talk for hours on the computer instead of going outside. Another major issue is computer games. In my view, computer games are one of the biggest problems. They can be so addictive that people, both kids and adults, might find themselves playing all the time. This not only takes away their time for outdoor activities but can also ruin their lives. They may fail in school or get fired from work because they don't complete their tasks. On the other hand, many people use computers for work and school. Besides internet chatting and gaming, people type up their work or send it to their email to work on at home. This is both a good and a bad thing. It's good because it allows people to get their work done faster. However, it's also a bad thing as it gives people another reason to stay inside. At work, people rely on computers to save work and build things, such as programming robots. Although computers are used for valid reasons, people should make time for the outdoors. Spending too much time on the computer can be harmful. People can get sick if they don't take breaks. Going outside, exercising, and getting fresh air are extremely important. So, everyone out there, get off your computer. Stop chatting, pause your game, take a break from your work, and go outside. Enjoy nature. Most of your day should not be spent on the computer. Thank you for your time.
1395	1399	1	2	Do you think computers have a positive effect on you? I don't. I believe that computers have a negative impact on people for several reasons: lack of exercise, high electricity bills, and interference in daily life. First, I think people don't get enough exercise when they are on the computer all day. If you don't go outside, ride a bike, or engage in physical activities, you won't burn any calories. You'll become a couch potato, which can be fatal to your health in the long run. As you get older, you may develop problems like diabetes, high cholesterol, and heart issues. Also, sitting in front of a computer for @NUM1 hours can injure your back, adding to the list of health problems caused by insufficient exercise. Second, if you're constantly on the computer, your parents will have an extremely high electricity bill. They may be angry with you, and you could even end up in debt to the electricity company. Before you know it, the bill will be so high that you won't be able to pay it, and you may end up without electricity at home. In my opinion, computers aren't worth putting a family in such a situation. Finally, computers can interfere with your daily life. If you're always on the computer and never outside, your friends will feel ignored. You'll start to lose friends who have been there for you. Computers can also ruin your social life. You'll miss opportunities to meet new people and develop your social skills. In conclusion, I've presented my ideas and opinions about computers. I've explained my reasons - lack of exercise, high electricity bills, and interference in daily life. I've provided facts and details about the consequences of excessive computer use. Now, it's up to you to decide whether computers have a positive or negative effect on people.
1396	1400	1	2	Are you tempted to immerse yourself in the digital world and squander your life away? Well, some individuals are already doing just that. Spending excessive time on the computer can lead to obesity, erode your ability to interact with friends and family, and even prevent you from exploring the real world! The time to decide whether you want to waste your life on a computer is now. Excessive computer use puts you at risk of obesity for multiple reasons. While sitting in front of the screen, you're not exercising. Moreover, as you sit idle, you tend to munch on a large number of snacks. Eventually, you may even lose the ability to walk properly because your legs aren't getting any exercise and the obesity makes movement difficult. In addition, if you waste your time on the computer, you can lose the knack for interacting with your family and friends. If you have children, you might miss out on watching them grow into adults and could even push them away. You may also lose your friends because they won't want to hang out with someone who is always glued to the computer. In the end, you'll be all alone because no one will be there when you finally try to interact with your family. Finally, while you're on the computer, checking your social media accounts, there are countless things happening in the real world. Instead of rummaging through your hard - drive, you could be visiting famous landmarks, or going on a family trip. In conclusion, wasting your life on the computer is detrimental and can harm your life in numerous ways. It can make you obese and take away your ability to walk. It can prevent you from spending quality time with your loved ones and even drive them away. And you'll miss out on exploring the real world. The time has come to decide whether you want to waste your time or not. My opinion is clear!
1397	1401	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, I'm certain you enjoy relaxing and surfing the web. After all, the internet is an incredible invention. However, the fact is that some people spend far too much time on the computer. We miss out on all the other important aspects of life simply because we're glued to our laptops. Excessive internet use can lead to a lack of exercise. Electronics are a major cause of obesity, especially among kids. They sit on the computer all day instead of going out to exercise and stay fit. Of course, it's still okay to surf the web, but you need to limit your time. We could enforce this by setting a time limit at home. I personally love using the computer, but I make sure to get off after about an hour. The concept of the ""internet"" is a vast topic with endless things to explore, but we need to keep an eye on the clock. There are numerous forms of online chat, like @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, etc. Many people are constantly on these platforms instead of having face - to - face conversations. As a result, we can become anti - social. Although you can communicate online, it's essential to talk to people in person. Websites such as @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 also contribute to this problem. People get addicted and are on them constantly. These ""@CAPS5"" websites actually take away time that could be spent with friends. So, instead of chatting over the computer screen, plan to meet people in person. Don't let the computer make you lose your social skills. I love going outside each season to enjoy the beautiful nature around us. If you spend too much time on the computer, you won't have time to appreciate it. You'll miss out on so many wonderful things. Take some time out of your day, which you'd normally spend on the computer, to go for a walk outside. Trust me, the real world is much prettier than your computer screen. Once you gradually reduce your computer time, you'll realize there are many other things that are more worthwhile. So, the next time you think about surfing the web or playing a new computer game, I hope you'll consider my opinions. Spending too much time on the computer can lead to a lack of exercise, make you anti - social, and prevent you from enjoying nature. Moderate computer use is fine, but you need to be aware of how much time you're spending on it. Hopefully, my reasons have given you a different perspective on surfing the web."
1398	1402	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers are both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, computers allow us to play a wide range of games. We can play classic games like chess and solitaire, as well as a vast number of online games. I can think of at least three different websites that offer online games, with each site having at least @NUM1 different games. Hundreds of thousands of people play online games every day. Without computers, they'd be at a loss. Computers also enable us to search for any topic from anywhere. This is an amazing feat. Imagine if no one had a computer; how would we research and acquire so much knowledge? Using a computer is much faster than traditional methods. You can also print out important information, while with a book, you have to copy it down. However, the excessive use of computers has its drawbacks. Kids are getting bigger and bigger because they spend too much time sitting in front of the computer instead of getting exercise. Computers are truly amazing, and society benefits from them significantly. But like everything else, they have their downsides. So, please inform both adults and kids about the advantages of computers, but also warn them about the potential problems that can arise if they spend too much time on the computer and not enough time outside.
1399	1403	1	2	Have you ever spent a long time on the computer? I'm writing to you because I'm worried about the health of the town. Many people have computers and use them daily. While it can be fun, it can also harm your health. Computers can be addictive, causing us to spend hours in front of the screen. As a result, many people don't exercise at all. Most are too busy on their computers. You should get at least @NUM1 minutes of exercise each day. According to @CAPS2 sereno, “Kids should have anywhere from @NUM2 minutes of exercise on average per day. But a lot of kids are now playing video games on the computers instead of exercising.” Many kids also don't go outside enough. You should get a minimum of @NUM3 minutes of sunlight each day to get most of your vitamins. When was the last time you went for a bike ride, camping, or to the beach? These are all fun activities that you might miss out on if you're too busy on the computer. I love going to the beach. The sound of the waves, the feel of the ocean water, and the cool breeze are just heavenly. If I were on the computer all the time, I wouldn't be able to enjoy these things. Do you like having fun or spending time with your family? Communicating on the computer isn't the same as being with the person in real life. Can you imagine never actually seeing or hearing the person you're talking to? That's what it's like with online communication. A large percentage of communication is lost when we rely too much on computers. Wouldn't you rather talk to someone on the phone or face - to - face? I think people should spend time exercising, going outdoors, and spending time with friends and family. Remember to get @NUM1 minutes of exercise and @NUM3 minutes of sunlight each day to stay healthy. Please consider this and write an article to improve the town's social and overall health. It's up to you!
1400	1404	1	2	Readers, imagine a world without computers. Communication would be severely hampered, schoolwork would become far more difficult, and we'd lose a major source of entertainment. Do you really want such a world? The advantages of computers clearly outweigh the disadvantages. Computers have a definitely positive impact on society. With just one click, a message can be sent anywhere in the world. This has revolutionized communication. People can not only send emails but also have live chats, either through text or videos. Online communication has been a great help in my life and the lives of my peers. For instance, when I forget my homework or have questions about schoolwork, I can quickly reach out to my peers and get help. Moreover, computers help me stay in touch with my friends and family. So, those who think computers make us spend less time with loved ones are wrong. Computers connect the world and enhance communication. In addition to communication, computers also greatly improve education and learning. They make it possible to complete projects and assignments faster and easier, thanks to software like Microsoft Word. It's been proven that @NUM1 students find it easier to learn when they use computers for schoolwork. Online encyclopedias and other resources assist students worldwide with their schoolwork or just for the sake of learning. Online tutors and help sites are also available, making it as if you always have a teacher nearby. I can't imagine completing any assignment without a computer. Computers are also a great source of entertainment. Online movies and TV shows allow you to keep up with the latest episodes of your favorite shows. Online gaming brings joy to people all over the world. You can spend hours playing in detailed @NUM2 - @CAPS1 worlds. You can also have a good laugh watching historical videos on YouTube. And with a computer, you can always stay updated on the latest news. Whether you like relaxing and watching videos, playing games, or reading the news, you'll always find something fun to do online. With such a positive impact on the world, computers are truly amazing technology. You can communicate with friends or family instantly, work on your school assignments, learn something new, or simply have a great time! It's clear that computers make life better and much easier.
1401	1405	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper, I've heard that some individuals dispute the benefits of computers to society. In this letter, I'll present three reasons demonstrating how computers are advantageous to our society: facilitating connections with friends and family in other states, helping people stay organized, and aiding in learning.  Computers benefit society as they enable people to stay in contact with family and friends in other states. While one could use the phone, long - distance calls incur costs, whereas emailing is free. I can attest to this from personal experience, having friends and family in multiple states in the [LOCATION1]. As [PERSON3] from [ORGANIZATION1] said, ""Computers help me stay in contact with my family all over."" Many people use computers daily to connect with loved ones, and some even rely on them to stay in touch with family members at war.  Secondly, computers benefit society by helping people stay organized. Although this may not seem significant, many people use computers to keep things in order. Without computers to manage appointments, chaos would ensue, such as double - booking or receiving repetitive items. As [PERSON1] stated, ""I [CAPS3] [CAPS4] on my computers.""  Lastly, computers benefit society as they help people learn more. While not everyone uses computers for learning, it doesn't mean they don't gain knowledge. For example, [CAPS6] allows users to learn song lyrics, dance moves, etc.; [CAPS8] helps people understand others' likes and dislikes. Facebook lets users see what others are doing daily. As [PERSON2] put it, ""People learn everything from the computer.""  I hope this letter convinces you that computers indeed benefit our society."
1402	1406	1	2	Dear local Newspaper, in my view, computers have a positive impact on people. They allow for communication, learning, and online shopping.  Communication via computers is excellent. For instance, I finally got to chat with my cousin from California. It saves money as there's no phone bill. Most companies use email for co - worker communication. Dr. [DR1], a scientist, says that co - workers who communicate through computers are safer as they can stay home. There are numerous social networking sites. By talking to people daily, individuals can improve their mental health and self - esteem. Moreover, this form of communication is eco - friendly as there's no need to travel.  Computers are also great for learning. There are over [I] information sites. Programs can be used to create graphs and tables to display data. Mrs. Can claims that presenting information on the computer, like using graphs, can increase knowledge by [PERCENT2]. Learning on the computer doesn't require reading books, which saves paper. Most databases are free, saving money and allowing users to find information in seconds, on average [NUM1] seconds.  Online shopping is another advantage. It saves time as there's no need to travel. Consumer Reports states that buying products online can save [PERCENT1] of the cost. With today's technology, users can compare prices by clicking a button. Online product reviews are popular as they let consumers hear others' opinions.  In conclusion, computers have greatly helped people. They enable online shopping, communication, and learning, truly changing the lives of most citizens.
1403	1407	1	2	Dear [CAPS1], computers are an outstanding invention. They offer a wide range of functions and have a highly positive impact on people. They can enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about distant places and cultures, and provide a platform for online communication.  Computers help teach hand - eye coordination. When using a computer, one can look at the screen while moving the mouse without looking at the hand. This skill is transferable to everyday activities like sports. For example, good hand - eye coordination is essential for hitting a baseball. By being able to do two things simultaneously, such as looking at the screen and operating the mouse, computers train this important skill.  Computers also allow people to learn different things easily. They provide a wealth of resources to explore different cultures, people, and places. Suppose you're interested in [CAPS2]; a computer can provide all the information you need. You can find recipes, learn about various topics, and expand your knowledge.  Online communication is another significant benefit of computers. Platforms like [CAPS4] allow you to chat with people by typing. Social networking sites such as [CAPS5], [CAPS6], or [CAPS7] give you your own page to post opinions and view your friends' updates. These sites help people reconnect with old friends. Webcam technology, as seen on sites like Skype, lets you see and talk to the other person, making it feel like they're right beside you.  In summary, computers benefit people worldwide. They help people learn new things physically and mentally, and they are not taking over but rather assisting people in leading better lives.
1404	1408	1	2	"Dear [ORGANIZATION1], [CAPS1] is filled with a lot of technology, with computers being the most prominent. I firmly believe that computers have a more positive effect on people. They teach hand - eye coordination, enable learning about far - away places, and allow online communication.  Regarding hand - eye coordination, slower typers generally have poorer hand - eye coordination, while faster typers have better coordination. [PERCENT1] of people, including teachers, agree with this. This is likely why [CAPS1] offers typing lessons in elementary school computer classes.  Computers also provide more resources for learning about far - away places compared to books. Using multiple websites on a computer is easier and can lead to a higher education. A teacher said, ""using websites is so much easier for everyone. Using them for homework and having students take notes is a lot less difficult,"" and I wholeheartedly agree.  Online communication is another great advantage of computers. Through platforms like [ORGANIZATION2], [CAPS2], [CAPS3] - mail, and video chat, people can chat with friends living far away, ensuring that friendships are not lost. Losing relationships can be very sad, as I know from personal experience.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people. They help with learning, chatting, and improving hand - eye coordination. I believe the positive effects of computers far outweigh the negative ones."
1405	1409	1	2	I firmly believe that computers simplify everyday work. They enable communication with people in far - off places, expedite work, and provide access to a college education without leaving home.  Consider having a relative living miles away, where calling or traveling is expensive. Computers allow us to communicate via email or video chat at no extra cost. Communicating with far - away family is just a few clicks away.  Computers also make work easier and faster. Typing a term paper on a computer is quicker than writing it by hand. College students find that computers help them complete tasks more efficiently. A significant number of people, including teachers, support the idea that computers reduce the burden of work.  Education is crucial, but what if the desired college is too far and unaffordable to relocate to? Thankfully, online college courses are available. These courses allow eager students to learn without straining their finances or leaving their children if they are parents. Without computers, many people would be deprived of the education they deserve.  In summary, computers have enabled us to communicate with distant family, complete work in a timely manner, and over [NUM1] citizens to obtain an education at an affordable price. Without this technology, our lives as of [DATE1] would be very different, and we wouldn't be able to reach our goals as easily.
1406	1410	1	2	Dear @PERSON1, the utilization of computers does not bring benefits to our society. I'm concerned that numerous children will suffer from childhood obesity due to the inactivity of many teenagers of my age. They could be enjoying outdoor life and staying active, yet they choose to sit in front of a screen all day, every day. Researchers have proven that the inactivity is largely attributable to many users of Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter. These websites are nothing but trouble. Apart from being unhealthy, teenagers around the world are being cyberbullied to the verge of suicide. Many are unaware of the numerous pedophiles and creepy individuals these sites harbor, which can lead to abduction, rape, or worse. Staying active and spending time outdoors with friends can save you from these perils. Go outside and run a little; you'll be astonished at how much a bit of exercise can benefit you. Additionally, I firmly believe that time should be spent with your family, engaging in family activities and having dinner with your parents. By doing so, you'll become closer as a family, and it can assist you in making healthier choices and maintaining an exercise routine. I believe that by adhering to these simple steps - staying active, staying away from the computer, and spending time with family - is far more beneficial than learning how to type or chatting with your friends. Using the computer leads to cyberbullying and exposure to dangerous people. Living a healthy life is the way to go.
1407	1411	1	2	"Dear Newspaper, what's your take on computers? I firmly believe they're wonderful, and we're fortunate to have them. However, they should be used in moderation because exercise and maintaining good health are essential. I hope you'll share my views in your next article to persuade readers of my perspective on computers. In my opinion, the best aspect of computers is that they're an excellent source of learning. The internet can connect us to the entire world, enabling us to learn about other cultures. You can gain comprehensive knowledge about a country without ever visiting it! Alternatively, you can use it to explore your family's history. Many record - keeping systems are now transitioning to computers. When we went on a field trip to @LOCATION1, they had databases containing the names of everyone who passed through there. Studies indicate that @NUM1 people find the internet easy to use and quicker than any other method. Another advantage of computers is their utility in the workplace. Suppose you have a job designing houses. In the past, you'd have to draw the designs by hand using numerous instruments and tools, but now you can create the design using just one tool - the computer. It's a much more efficient way to do your job, and it benefits customers too. Previously, if they wanted a different house design, you'd have to redraw everything. Now, you just need to make an adjustment on the computer, and in seconds, the new design is ready. Nowadays, if not @PERCENT2, then @PERCENT1 of house designers use computers. Computers also play a social role. On the internet, you can connect and chat with friends. You can share pictures of both of you at a baseball game on @DATE1 to preserve memories. Or you can send them a website with a really funny video of someone getting hit with a soccer ball. Experts conducted a study, which showed that @NUM2 times, the reason a teen goes on the internet is to connect with friends. ""@CAPS2 @PERSON1 (computer expert and developer), what do you think the number one reason teens use computers is?"" @CAPS3, I'd have to say it's to chat with friends. I don't see why they wouldn't; it's simple and almost effortless. Computers are a remarkable advancement in our technology. They assist us in our daily lives and simplify difficult tasks. However, they shouldn't be overused, and you need to maintain a healthy mind and body. All the knowledge we can acquire from them supports this argument. To me, the computer is as significant a step forward as the light bulb was. Computer usage is found @PERCENT3 in @LOCATION2, and I believe they'll be in every home. Some families find them @CAPS2 useful and have more than one in the household. They come in various shapes and sizes to meet your needs and can connect you to anything in the world."
1408	1412	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Readers, some of you might think that people overuse computers. They don't spend enough time outside or interact with family or pets. You might also think that they're not getting enough exercise. Well, you're partly right, but I'm going to explain why you're also wrong. You can use computers to learn, socialize, and actually improve your health. First, you can learn. While on the internet, you can visit learning websites. Some of these websites can teach you about far - off places like @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2, and many more. You can also learn about people and their cultures. Take @CAPS3 @CAPS4 as an example. You can learn about their culture, the @CAPS5 they celebrate, and the reasons behind them. Another option is to take online classes if you're having difficulties in school. Second, you can socialize using the computer. You might think that when you're on the computer, you can't socialize with family and friends. But that's not true. There are websites like @CAPS6 and Facebook where all you do is talk to family and friends. Now, you can use webcams. When using a webcam, you can see the person you're talking to, hear them, and they can hear you through the microphone on the webcam. Additionally, you can enter chatrooms like @CAPS7 (AOL Instant Message) and talk to people while on that site. Finally, you can become healthier. It might seem surprising, but you can visit websites that teach you how to eat right and exercise on a daily basis. Websites like @PERSON1 esang.com can provide you with a suitable eating schedule. After referring to such websites, you can go out and get the necessary items. The computer also offers hand - eye coordination. While looking at the screen, your hand controls the ""mouse,"" which in turn controls your movement on the worldwide web. Lastly, after visiting websites that showcase the beauty of the world's landscapes and gardens, you'll eventually want to go outside. So, hopefully, you now agree with me that computers actually bring benefits to some aspects of life. I've shown you what you can learn, how to talk to people and socialize, and how they can help with your health."
1409	1413	1	2	Computers have undoubtedly had a profound impact on society, transforming the world. People now live smarter, quicker, and more easily. Those living on opposite sides of the globe can communicate instantly and for free. But what kind of effect does this have on people? Something of this magnitude and with such a long - standing history can't be beneficial for everyone. I personally don't think it is for some individuals. To begin with, some people become overly obsessed with computers. When they face life problems, they might seek the solitude and privacy of the unfiltered and limitless internet. Even if you use a computer to chat with others, it can never replace real - life interactions. In fact, studies have shown that non - personal forms of communication such as text messaging, email, or chat rooms can severely restrict a person's ability to connect with others. Don't misunderstand me. I do use sites like Facebook to talk to people. So, I'm not saying that online communication is bad. I think it's a great way to keep in touch with those you can't meet in person. It's also a good way to support your friends. However, it should be done in moderation. Obtaining information from the computer is a controversial topic. Some may argue that informing people is a positive thing, and I agree. Others may claim that knowing too much will inflate our egos and make us ignorant. I also concur with this view. I'd say that learning some things is good, but we should be cautious about over - knowledge. One area where I find computers to be great is in terms of originality. In a world where creativity is often stifled, I see computers as having an artistic side. It has personally helped me discover the kind of music, drawings, and creations that I like. I can also share my work so that others can see, listen, or try it. In conclusion, I believe that computers are an excellent tool when used in moderation. For those who are overly obsessed, it can cause problems. However, I think they're a great addition to society.
1410	1414	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, an increasing number of people are using computers, but not everyone believes this is beneficial to society. I'm in favor of technological advancements and believe that computers have a positive impact on people. Computers enable people to learn about distant places and people, allow online communication, and offer games that can aid in schoolwork. Do you think computers give people the ability to learn about far - off people and places? You can use google.com to explore different cultures and find out how their practices differ from ours and what kind of food they eat. For instance, in @LOCATION1, people sit on the floor while they eat, whereas we sit at a table in our dining rooms or kitchens. @PERCENT1 of people there sit on the floor. Undoubtedly, computers allow you to connect with my cousin on the computer. It's also important to note that you can play games on computers that are beneficial for your schoolwork. You can visit sites that teach you about your @CAPS4. They can show you how your body functions for @CAPS5 and tell you about the Revolutionary War for @CAPS6 @CAPS7. These sites aren't boring; they're a lot of fun! Who would have thought that learning could be enjoyable? I certainly didn't. The time is right! Some may think that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. But regardless, people will always find time for these things.
1411	1415	1	2	Dear computer experts, consider this: A family of four is seated in a small, dimly - lit room. They aren't chatting or laughing; instead, they sit listlessly in their chairs, hunched over and bored. They aren't in touch with their friends and aren't engaged in any meaningful activity. They just sit there, motionless. This is what could happen if we banned computers!  Computers undoubtedly have a positive impact on people. They provide a continuous flow of knowledge, enhance hand - eye coordination, and enable users to communicate with others. Clearly, they are a valuable addition to our world.  First, computers offer a constant stream of knowledge. My close friend @PERSON1 recently told me that while doing her homework at home, when she needs to look up something, she simply grabs her computer, and with a click of a button, the information is at her fingertips. Without a computer, she would never be able to access such knowledge.   Second, in a survey by @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of total computer usage is for looking up information and gaining knowledge. This statistic shows that computers are extremely helpful when it comes to information - seeking. A recent @ORGANIZATION3 article on computer usage also states that if people didn't have computers, half of the world's discoveries would not exist today. The knowledge that computers provide is truly invaluable.  Next, using computers improves hand - eye coordination. Children's specialist @PERSON3 says, ""Children need to play video games on the computer, despite the common discouragement. These games build excellent hand - eye coordination and are beneficial for many aspects, including @ORGANIZATION1 - related activities and sports."" Without computers, this hand - eye coordination would never develop. At @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1, when computer use was limited, the sports teams there had losing records. Could this be due to the lack of hand - eye coordination among the students? Additionally, a recent survey at @ORGANIZATION1 found that @NUM1 students who play video games on their computers perform better in gym class because of the enhanced hand - eye coordination.   Lastly, computers allow people to communicate through email and other social networks. A poll from www.@CAPS6.com revealed that millions of users communicate daily using the computer and @CAPS6. We wouldn't want to deprive them of this, would we? My friend @PERSON2, who attends @ORGANIZATION4, says that she mainly communicates with her friends and makes plans with them via computer. Without a computer, this wouldn't be possible. Furthermore, a teen specialist @PERSON4 from @ORGANIZATION5 states that when people can't communicate with the outside world due to the lack of computers, they are more prone to diseases like depression or anorexia. Communicating through computers is clearly very important.  Now, consider this: The same family is sitting in a bright, sunny room with their computer screens flashing cheerfully. One of the boys calls out, ""Hey, look at this,"" and the rest of the family rushes to his side. Their faces are glowing with the @ORGANIZATION3 information. It is evident that computers have a positive effect on people as they bring knowledge, improve hand - eye coordination, and facilitate communication. So, computer experts, what are you waiting for? Go to your computers right now and learn some @ORGANIZATION3 things!"
1412	1416	1	2	The advancement of technology has reached a point where it has become an integral part of our daily lives. It is commonly used in households, workplaces, schools, and businesses. We rely on it for sending emails, conducting research, and seeking answers about the world around us. Technology is almost a prerequisite for every job application, schoolwork, and various other aspects of life. It is the complete age of technology.  Computers have become a daily necessity. For example, email is something we use without a second thought, and it is also used for filing tax returns and creating reports. In schools, students use computers for writing reports, conducting studies, and doing some homework. Businesses utilize computers to communicate with corporate offices. @LOCATION1 has a wide range of technology; they recently acquired a large number of Apple devices.  Computers are required in most jobs. They are used in state - related work, schools, military defense, jobs involving missiles, and satellite communication. In the event of a disruption in all communications, such as cell phones or on airplanes (like in the case of the Twin Towers attack), computers are crucial for tracking and other operations. Some information about computer - related military and security applications is classified.  In conclusion, computers are essential in modern society. They are widely used and required on a daily basis. Their presence is felt in every aspect of our lives, from education to business, and from personal communication to national security.
1413	1417	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, technology has made remarkable progress in recent years. Computers have become ubiquitous in almost every business and home in @LOCATION1. Everyone seems to think that computers are nothing but wonderful and can only have a positive impact. However, do they really consider both sides? Most likely not.  That's why I'm here to point out that computers discourage exercise, reduce the time spent bonding with family, and are a waste of money and space. I firmly believe that people should re - evaluate their dependence on computers.  Take @LOCATION2, for example. It has more than @NUM1 million fast - food restaurants currently in operation. It is the fattest country in the world and spends the most on unhealthy food. With over @PERCENT1 of the population being obese, something needs to change. According to studies by @ORGANIZATION1 (@CAPS2), @PERCENT2 of people spend over @NUM2 hours a day on the computer, and @PERCENT3 of them are overweight or obese. There's an obvious correlation. Exercise is essential for strengthening muscles, improving lung function, and burning calories. People should get off the computer and exercise more; they might even enjoy it.  Spending time with family can be extremely enjoyable. I recently discovered that playing outdoor team games brings out our competitive side, while board games challenge our minds. @CAPS4 @PERSON2 said, ""@CAPS3 who spend time with their family are @PERCENT4 more likely to do better in school."" But what's stopping people from spending time with their families? Computers. Kids now find online sites more interesting than hanging out with family and friends. We need to turn off the computers, bring out the board games, and keep families together.  Economist @PERSON1 said, ""In this economy, people cannot afford to waste money they don't have."" And she's absolutely right. @PERCENT5 of @CAPS6 are wasting money on computers. The average monthly bill is @MONEY2, which amounts to @MONEY1 a year for something that isn't really necessary. Computers also waste space. You need to find room for the monitor, printer, hard drive, and all those wires.  In conclusion, although technology, especially computers, can be useful, we need to acknowledge their negative impacts. People aren't getting enough exercise, families aren't spending enough time together, and money and space are being wasted. We should take steps to reduce our dependence on computers."
1414	1418	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I'm writing to you on @DATE1 because I believe computers have a negative impact on people.  When you spend a lot of time on the internet, you don't get enough exercise. This is bad because you won't be healthy. For example, in gym class, you need to be fit to get good grades. If you don't exercise, you might become obese.  Spending too much time on the computer can also lead to addiction. Once you're addicted, you'll likely neglect your homework, and your grades will drop. You might even have to repeat a grade, which will make your parents angry. This is one reason why computers are bad for people.  Another problem is that when you're on the computer, you often don't know who you're talking to, unless they're your real - life friends. There have been many cases where kids have been abducted because of social media sites like Facebook and MySpace. If your kids use these sites, they're always at risk. Cyber - criminals can find out personal information about you, including where you live. For instance, there was a case on MySpace where a girl thought she was talking to a @NUM1 - year - old boy, but it was actually a @NUM2 - something - year - old man. Then the girl went missing for several weeks. You can never fully trust the computer.  In conclusion, computers aren't as good as they seem. You won't get enough exercise, your grades will suffer, and there are real risks associated with online communication. Even though you can communicate with friends, the negative aspects outweigh the benefits.
1415	1419	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am convinced that computers and other modern technologies are having a detrimental effect on the world as we once knew it. They are a major cause of people lacking exercise, reducing interaction with family and friends, and potentially harming mental health.  In @LOCATION1, the high rates of obesity and the large number of overweight people can be attributed to the excessive time people spend on computers instead of exercising. In the @DATE1's, the average family had one computer (or sometimes none), but nowadays, the average family has @NUM1, @NUM2, or even more computers. Correspondingly, the percentage of obese people has skyrocketed as people are constantly on the computer instead of being physically active.  Technology has also led to a significant decline in family communication and interaction. Families are arguing more frequently, and the divorce rate has increased. In @DATE2, @NUM3 out of @NUM6 marriages ended in divorce, but now, @NUM3 out of @NUM1 marriages end that way. The rapid advancement of technology, with people spending more time on computers, phones, and other devices, is tearing families apart.  When children are in their formative years and need to expand their minds, they are often just sitting on the computer, missing out on the mental stimulation they need. The students in schools today are the future leaders of the world. Parents should consider whether they want their children to succeed in life. If so, they shouldn't let their children sit on the computer all day filling their heads with nonsense. While computers can be educationally useful, @PERSON1 from the @ORGANIZATION1 states that ""@PERCENT1 of the time, neither children nor adults use them in an educational way.""  In conclusion, it is clear that computers are causing more harm than good in families worldwide. People aren't getting enough exercise, aren't interacting with their families, and these devices can be harmful to mental health. If families can reduce computer - related activities, parents can better ensure their children's well - being and development."
1416	1420	1	2	I believe that the increasing use of computers in society is a matter that deserves our attention. While computers offer numerous benefits, such as assisting in business, facilitating communication with family and friends, and providing entertainment, their overuse can lead to negative consequences.  One of the primary concerns is the impact on physical health. Spending excessive time on computers can discourage people from engaging in physical activities and exploring the natural world. This sedentary lifestyle can contribute to health issues, including obesity and a lack of overall fitness. Moreover, individuals may become addicted to computer use, which can further disrupt their daily routines and well - being.  Another aspect to consider is the balance between computer use and other important aspects of life. We should find ways to integrate the enjoyable aspects of computer use with activities that are beneficial for our health, like exercise. For example, people can use their computers to organize outdoor activities with friends and family.  It is important to recognize that computers are not inherently bad. They can enhance hand - eye coordination and provide opportunities for learning about the world. However, to ensure a healthy and balanced lifestyle, there should be a limit on the number of hours people spend on computers each day. By implementing such a limit, people can enjoy the advantages of computers while also having time for other essential activities.  In conclusion, while computers have brought significant positive changes to our lives, we must address the potential negative impacts of their overuse. By promoting a balanced approach to computer use, we can create a more healthy and productive society.
1417	1421	1	2	In my opinion, computers have both positive and negative effects on people. On the positive side, for those who don't like writing, computers provide a convenient way to type. However, the negative aspects are quite evident.  I've seen firsthand how parents and kids get overly engrossed in the computer. Kids stay up all night on the computer, ignoring their schoolwork and the fact that they have school the next day. I have proof from my friends' experiences, research findings, and my mother also agrees with me. A high percentage (about @PERCENT1) of my friends have gone through similar situations and can't wake up for school.  Dr @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1's research shows that parents hardly spend time with their families. Fathers, for example, are often on the computer, either working or looking up things. My mom told me that when she was younger, she was so into the internet that she never wanted to get off.  I sincerely hope that you'll agree with my view on this matter. Computers are becoming a real problem in our daily lives, affecting both our family relationships and our well - being. We need to be more aware of their negative impacts and take steps to limit their use. Thank you for taking the time to read my opinion.
1418	1422	1	2	I would like to address the question of whether computers have a positive or negative impact on our lives. Despite their relatively short existence, the debate over their effects is highly controversial. While computers do aid in research, I firmly believe that they are not a necessity and can be quite harmful.  Firstly, people spend an excessive amount of time on computers. After using a computer for an hour or an hour - and - a - half, negative effects start to emerge. One may experience eye strain and headaches, which can become so severe that it feels like one's head is on fire. This occurs because the brain struggles to process the brightness of the screen along with the information being read. Many people end up taking breaks in a dark room but then return to the computer, repeating the cycle. Clearly, computers act as an obstacle to our normal lives.  Secondly, computer use leads to a lack of exercise. After long hours on the computer, people only have time for basic activities like eating, sleeping, and going to work or school. This sedentary lifestyle deprives them of outdoor activities, increasing the risk of obesity. Obesity, in turn, brings about various health problems, such as reduced physical strength, limited mobility, and for children, stunted growth. It also shortens life expectancy.  Finally, computers are harmful to the environment. With billions of people using electronic devices globally, the heat generated by computers contributes to the depletion of the ozone layer and global warming. The heat from computer fans creates holes in the ozone layer, which is crucial for protecting us from the sun's ultraviolet rays. If this trend continues, it will have catastrophic consequences for our planet.  In conclusion, computers, despite their useful features, are a nuisance to our society. We need to be more aware of their negative impacts and take appropriate measures to reduce their overuse.
1419	1423	1	2	In my view, computers have significantly benefited our society. Despite the common belief that computers and technology can be harmful, I firmly believe that their advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.  Computers simplify our daily lives in numerous ways. In the shopping context, they are essential. At places like Stop & Shop, computers are used for checkout, and even though the lines are already long, without them, the lines would be even longer as cashiers would have to add up the money manually. Additionally, in grocery stores, computers enable us to weigh goods quickly. Without them, we would have to hand - weigh items, making shopping a much more time - consuming process.  When it comes to navigation, computers are a game - changer. Without computers, we would rely on large paper maps, which can be easily lost, and it's easy to lose our place or mark the wrong spots. With @CAPS1 and online directions, we can find the fastest and easiest routes to our destinations. Moreover, using online directions saves paper and reduces deforestation.  Computers also play a vital role in maintaining social connections. For those who want to visit family members out of state but lack the funds, video - chatting and social networking on the computer offer a cost - free alternative. This way, we can stay in touch with our loved ones without having to spend money on travel and harm the environment.  In conclusion, computers have had a profound and positive impact on our society. They have made our lives more convenient, efficient, and connected. We should continue to embrace and make the most of this technology.
1420	1424	1	2	I am convinced that computers bring numerous benefits to people in today's world. The invention of the computer has revolutionized the way we communicate, study, and entertain ourselves.  One of the most significant advantages of computers is in the realm of communication. Before computers, people had to rely on mail or phone calls to send messages and information. The computer has greatly accelerated this process. For instance, I was able to send an email to my friend about homework much faster than if I had written a letter. A study shows that people receive information about @PERCENT1 at a much quicker rate with the help of computers. Clearly, computers have made communication between people more efficient.  Computers also have a positive impact on students' academic performance. In the past, students used typewriters to write papers. When they made mistakes, they had to start over from scratch. However, with the advent of computers, the situation has changed completely. A study by the board of education indicates that students write papers faster and better using computers compared to typewriters. My grandfather's experience also serves as an example. It took him about an hour and a half to write a paper on a typewriter, but only a half - hour on a computer at most.  Finally, computers provide entertainment for kids when they can't go outside. A study by @CAPS2 - obesity shows that a high percentage (@PERCENT2) of kids would rather be outside playing and exercising. However, during certain weather conditions, when they can't go outside, computers offer a way to keep them entertained. Another study by @ORGANIZATION1 reveals that @PERCENT3 of kids turn to their computers when they are confined indoors.  In conclusion, the benefits of computers to society are immense. They have improved communication, enhanced students' academic abilities, and provided entertainment for kids. I hope this letter has convinced you of the many advantages that computers bring to our lives.
1421	1425	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 post, computers have been around for some time now. Removing them would be akin to disregarding all the technological progress we've made. In fact, computers are ubiquitous; seven out of ten families on my street own at least one computer. So, why would we want to get rid of them? Computers are incredibly useful. They are not only entertaining but also highly resourceful. Anyone with a question can easily access a computer, search on google.com, and find the answer within minutes. I recall when I had an oddly - looking cut on my arm, and my mom, who wasn't sure how to heal the wound, used the computer to research and find out how to make the mark go away. The computer only brings benefits. You might be staying at a place in two weeks and realize it doesn't have a pool, but the computer can still enhance your experience. Lastly, without computers, communication with new or different people would be impossible. Computers are excellent for communication. People can communicate through Twitter, @CAPS2, and even YouTube. These platforms help people make new online friends, almost like internet pen - pals. Also, if most of your family lives in @LOCATION1 and you're stuck in @CAPS3, you can easily talk to them via email or instant messenger. Hopefully, now you better understand how much of a lifesaver the computer is. Maybe you could make the next @STATE1 about how resourceful, beneficial, and social computers are!
1422	1426	1	2	To whom it may concern, the @NUM1's marked the beginning of a new era. Computers had just emerged and were captivating people with their intelligence. However, now more and more people consider them a waste of time. I firmly disagree. There are several reasons for my opinion. Firstly, the computer is an information powerhouse. It allows artists to expand their creative work and enables engineers to plan buildings and bridges on their @CAPS1. Thanks to the Internet, students and people gain knowledge every day. The Internet is essential for those writing essays. In fact, the superintendent of schools in @LOCATION1 has stated that over @PERCENT1 of students use the Internet to assist them in writing essays. We no longer need to visit the library for research as we have a vast library of information at home in the form of a computer. Moreover, people can now communicate globally, enabling us to learn about other cultures directly from the source. Artists are also benefited. A new art form of video games has emerged. Artists can express themselves more freely. Music mixing has become popular, and artists can add or remove tracks easily. They no longer need to use a type - writing machine; they can simply use a computer keyboard, take advantage of spell - check, and edit or undo actions instead of discarding unwanted ideas. Engineers can plan out how a building or bridge might look, which also aids in video - game making. They can assess how certain structures will perform under natural disasters using new software, allowing them to choose the most suitable design. I hope you can see things from my perspective and agree that computers are truly amazing tools that provide access to information and offer numerous other benefits.
1423	1427	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students in @NUM3 grade use the computer each night to complete homework and connect with friends and family? I believe that the impact of computers on people is highly beneficial. Computers can be used for communication, education, and accessing important information quickly, such as local news. When I was in elementary school, I had a close friend who moved away. Using a computer was a convenient way to stay in touch. There are various forms of computer - based communication, including email, instant - messaging, video chat, and online chat groups. This helps people maintain connections, and I think communication is the most significant effect of computer use on people. Additionally, computers are great for learning. At school or work, both children and adults need access to information for research projects, learning about different topics like vacation spots, animals, food, cultures, and even complex scientific chemicals. For instance, when my class researched the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the computer's Internet was our primary source of information. We learned about customs, foods, dressing styles, traditional holidays, and entertainment. Kids also come home and continue typing their essays on the computer, which helps with hand - eye coordination and typing skills. The computer is not just for communication. It is an excellent educational tool, and the Internet can disseminate important local and global information. Expert @PERSON1 says that “@CAPS6 and adults often check their email and homepage daily for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy.” The Internet provides a fast and easy way for citizens to stay informed about local, state, national, and global events. For example, it can alert us to shootings in @LOCATION1 or house robberies in our town. As @CAPS7 citizens, we want to be safe and well - informed. I logged on the computer three days ago, and it notified me about the earthquake in @LOCATION2. There are numerous benefits to using a computer. It allows people to stay connected, learn, and stay updated with the latest news. I hope you'll consider my ideas and share them with others.
1424	1428	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to society. Computers can perform a multitude of tasks, including teaching. Nowadays, most things are accomplished using a computer. It helps develop good eye - coordination, the ability to focus, and exposes users to new knowledge. Without a computer, it's extremely difficult to get things done. Computers are useful for various purposes such as job applications, tax filings, or operating a grocery - store register. Using a computer is a form of exercise for the hands and the brain. In our daily lives, most activities involve some form of computer use. I think those who claim people shouldn't use computers are wrong. Computers enable people to interact with distant family members. You can also enjoy nature by simply looking at pictures online without having to go outside. In conclusion, computers are positive and helpful tools that enhance our lives in many ways.
1425	1429	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I am convinced that computers have a positive impact on people. There are three main reasons for this. Firstly, computers allow you to communicate with friends, family, and people around the world. Without this means of contact, it would be sad not to be able to reach out to your loved ones. You can email them to check on their well - being. For example, if you have a friend in @LOCATION1 and want to know if he's doing @CAPS2, you can send him a message. Communicating on the web is enjoyable as you can see what others are doing, even when playing games together. On platforms like Facebook or MySpace, you can add friends and expand your social circle. Secondly, shopping online is faster and more convenient than traditional shopping. If you're shopping for clothes and there's a long line, it can be frustrating. Online shopping eliminates this issue. Finally, computers are a very useful tool. You can talk to relatives from @LOCATION2 and shop without having to wait in line. In conclusion, computers enable communication with people worldwide, offer a convenient shopping experience, and truly have a positive effect on people's lives.
1426	1430	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I would like to discuss whether computers have a positive or negative effect on people. In my view, computers have negative impacts on us. This is due to the fact that they lead to less exercise, less time to enjoy nature, and reduced interaction with family and friends. If one spends most of their time at home on the computer, it becomes difficult to get exercise. One would be constantly sitting at the desktop, which can lead to obesity due to lack of physical activity. Moreover, individuals with heart problems who need exercise may see their condition worsen as they get distracted by the computer. Staying home on the computer also prevents one from enjoying nature. Instead of going outside in pleasant weather and having fun, people choose to stay indoors. This is not ideal as they should be out enjoying themselves rather than being glued to the computer all day. Missing out on time with family and friends when using the computer is unacceptable. One is supposed to keep their loved ones company, not be engrossed in what they are doing on the computer. This can result in missing family gatherings or leaving friends lonely. People are often too busy on the computer to pay attention to those around them. In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people because they cause less exercise, less time to enjoy nature, and reduced interaction with family and friends.
1427	1431	1	2	Dear Local newspaper, technology is an ever - evolving phenomenon, and an increasing number of people are utilizing it. As more individuals make use of computers, the greater the technological benefits for our society. Through computer usage, people can develop hand - eye coordination, gain knowledge about distant places, and communicate online with others. Using computers helps people develop hand - eye coordination, which is an effective skill with outstanding benefits. Those with great coordination are likely to outperform those who do not use computers. Advanced coordination enables individuals to achieve more, such as fast typing. Moreover, better hand - eye coordination increases the likelihood of obtaining a job in a field that requires good coordination. In conclusion, the use of computers offers significant advantages, including the development of hand - eye coordination, educational opportunities about distant places, and the ability to communicate with others. Their role in enhancing our lives and society is undeniable.
1428	1432	1	2	The @ORGANIZATION1 Newspaper has discovered a significant argument regarding whether computers are beneficial to society. On one side, there are those who claim that computers do not benefit society, while on the other side, supporters of technological advances believe that computers have a positive impact on people. The @ORGANIZATION1 has chosen the side that computers have a positive effect, and there are three reasons to support this view. Firstly, computers are a great source of information about far - away places and people. Instead of spending hours searching through a library, one can simply use a computer's search function. For example, I once spent a long time looking for a book about the @CAPS2 calendars in the library but couldn't find it. However, I found the information I needed on a computer in less than a minute. Secondly, computers are an excellent source of entertainment. When one is bored, they can play numerous fun games on the computer, such as @CAPS3 @CAPS4, dragonwars, and many others. With so many games to choose from, one will never get bored. Thirdly, computers provide a fun way to communicate with friends and family. There are many platforms like @CAPS5, @CAPS6, or @ORGANIZATION2 where one can chat, send videos, and pictures. In conclusion, I hope you will consider these reasons and agree with the @ORGANIZATION1's decision that computers have a positive impact on people.
1429	1433	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on people. Many individuals become overly addicted to computers. They spend a large amount of time on the computer, often doing nothing productive or buying things they don't need. This addiction also leads to less time spent with family. People are supposed to share good times with their family, but instead, they are glued to the computer. They miss out on family gatherings, playing outside with friends, or having a picnic in the park with their loved ones. Moreover, computer addiction reduces physical activity. People don't exercise as they spend all their time sitting in front of the computer. This can lead to health problems such as obesity and heart issues. On the computer, one can do many things like shopping, chatting with friends, and visiting interesting websites. However, some people can't stop using the computer even if they want to. They may play games or download music from unauthorized websites. In conclusion, the effects of computers on people are very bad. People spend excessive time on them, neglect their family, and become addicted. Computers take away the time and love that should be shared with family, and the resulting addiction is difficult to overcome.
1430	1434	1	2	Did you know that @PERCENT1 @LOCATION1 people use their computers extremely frequently? Nowadays, most people have computers, and it can be hard to stay away from them. I believe that while most people can control their computer use, computers are extremely important and have a positive effect on people. I use the computer to communicate with friends and family, assist with my homework, and yet I remain an active person. I take dance lessons twice a week and engage in activities like riding my bike, playing outside, or running on the treadmill whenever I can. I consider myself a healthy person. Although it may seem like I'm on the computer a lot, I use it purposefully. Many of my friends also use the computer a great deal, and some of them are even more active than me. Most people who spend a lot of time on the computer are still healthy and involved in other activities. I interact with my family quite a bit. In a family setting, it's natural to do so. I also hang out with my friends whenever possible. The computer allows me to talk to them when they're not around. Most of my extended family lives in @LOCATION1, and the computer enables me to communicate with them and exchange digital pictures. There have been times when my friends and I were too busy to meet or the weather was bad, but we still had nice conversations on the computer. Some people have to be on the computer all day for work. My mom manages a company's accounts and many other things, so she spends a lot of time on the computer whether she likes it or not. Teachers also use computers to teach classes and prepare materials. I use it for homework, such as checking assignments, researching topics, or getting help. In conclusion, the computer is an absolutely necessary and irreplaceable piece of technology. As long as people balance computer use with fresh air and family interaction, computers have a very positive impact on people's lives.
1431	1435	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, a recent survey indicated that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 doctors believe the technological and computer - related advancements are beneficial rather than harmful. I wholeheartedly concur that computers are having a positive influence on us. Technological progress has enhanced our efficiency. Moreover, computers enable us to research places and things that we might never have the chance to experience in person. We can also engage in online conversations with individuals we might not otherwise meet.  The most significant aspect is the technological advancements. I recently saw a news segment about how @ORGANIZATION2 is using robots to make surgeries more efficient. This results in smaller incisions and faster recovery times.  Another area where technology has advanced is crime - solving. Before the advent of computers, blood testing, fingerprinting, and X - rays were either non - existent or very difficult to perform. Computers have made these tasks much more accessible.  Computers also allow us to explore far - off places and various topics. Some people may never visit @LOCATION4 or @LOCATION3, but with computers, it's as if they have. For instance, someone in @LOCATION2 interested in @CAPS1, a less - popular sport there, can use the computer to find a rugby event in @LOCATION1.  In addition, computers facilitate global communication. Through platforms like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, we can converse with people across the world. I could be sitting at home in @LOCATION2, chatting with someone across the country or even across the ocean, or simply with a friend in the neighborhood.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that the benefits of computers far outweigh the drawbacks. Technological advancements have greatly assisted us in areas such as gaming and robotic surgery. They also provide us with the ability to research topics of interest and communicate with others globally. I hope my explanation helps you understand my perspective.
1432	1436	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, picture this: you settle down at the computer with a glass of water and a snack, whether it's an after - school or after - work treat. You log into your accounts, open chat boxes with friends, and start researching for a project. As more people embrace technology, new computer - related features keep emerging. However, some people overlook the negatives, like failing social relationships, procrastination, and a lack of learning.  Suddenly, a new @CAPS2 message beeps in. While the computer allows us to communicate with friends and family, excessive use can lead to real - life relationship problems. You can't rely on typing an @ORGANIZATION1 message or hiding behind a screen in real - world interactions. For kids growing up, many jobs require customer - service skills. If you're only good at chatting online, it won't help you in the workplace.  On the internet, anything you say can be read, posted, and shared anywhere, at any time. In contrast, real - life conversations are more personal. School and learning are crucial, but I often find myself procrastinating. I'll say, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4, I'll do it later; I need to check this out!"" This halts my learning process.  Success in life requires a balance of school, learning, computer time, exercise, and possibly work. While computers can be useful for research, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter can slow you down.  Chatrooms, @ORGANIZATION2, email, and other online tools can be dangerous. There are predators waiting for unsuspecting users. Also, spending all day on the computer without exercise can lead to obesity and carpal tunnel syndrome.  In conclusion, it's essential to find a balance in life. Don't ignore the negative impacts of computers, or you could end up getting hurt. Computers are useful, but be careful not to waste all your time on them."
1433	1437	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I'm writing to you on @DATE1 to address the issue of people's computer usage. You're concerned that computer owners aren't spending enough time exercising, enjoying nature, or interacting with their families. I completely agree that the presence of computers has made many people lazy and less likely to engage in activities.  One day in @CAPS1, I conducted a survey. @PERCENT1 of the people I asked agreed that computers are causing a lack of real - world interaction, while others didn't seem to care.  I visited the website @CAPS3.com, which specializes in weight management. An article on the site, specifically in paragraph @NUM1, section @NUM2, states that obesity in the @LOCATION1 is caused by computer use and laziness. Of course, some athletes may disagree, as they manage to balance both. I had a chat with @PERSON1, a professional @CAPS4 player. He said, ""@CAPS5, when I was a kid, we didn't have computers. We either did our homework or played outside with friends."" Even athletes recognize the issue.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that the widespread use of computers is making people lazy and reducing family interaction. It's important to be aware of this and find a better balance in our lives."
1434	1438	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, isn't it time we give more thought to the digital age? Computers have been a significant contributor to society for years, and I believe the world would struggle to function without them. Some people claim that computers aren't good for society, but let me explain why that's incorrect.  Firstly, without computers, there would be no internet, and many jobs would be at risk. Architects rely on computers to design buildings and houses. Most offices use computers for various tasks. Writers need computers to write books, as hand - written works may be difficult to read. My mother works on a computer, and she would lose her job if computers didn't exist.  Secondly, computers are essential for education. Writing a paper without internet research would be extremely challenging. Some teachers only accept typed papers, making computers a necessity for homework.  Lastly, computers allow us to explore new places. Google @LOCATION1 provides a map of every place on @LOCATION1. We can use it to find locations, get directions, and look up definitions.  In conclusion, it's clear that computers bring numerous benefits to society. While some people may spend too much time on computers, that's a personal choice. Overall, the positive impacts of computers far outweigh any potential drawbacks.
1435	1439	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I'm certain you'll agree that we should keep computers in our world. Computers are incredibly helpful in education. When I don't understand a word, I go to dictionary.com. It's much faster than using a traditional dictionary. Looking up a word in a dictionary can take @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes, while on the computer, it only takes @NUM3 seconds.  Computers also enable us to communicate with friends and family when we can't meet in person. I use platforms like MySpace, Facebook, or MSN to chat and send messages. We can also share pictures, music, and more.  In school, computers are indispensable. They assist with math through formulas and online calculators. In science, websites like @LOCATION1 can answer our questions. For English, they help with spelling, writing, typing, editing, and revising. They can even change the way we write, like converting to cursive.  In conclusion, computers are vital for education, communication, and completing academic tasks. They enhance our projects, correct our spelling, and make our work look better. I firmly believe that we should keep computers in our world to continue reaping these benefits.
1436	1440	1	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I've noticed that an increasing number of people are using computers, yet not everyone believes this benefits society. I firmly hold the view that computers do bring benefits to society for three reasons. Firstly, computers are an excellent resource for schoolwork. They enable users to access a wealth of information. Moreover, they serve as a great means to stay in touch with friends and family. It's evident why computers have positive impacts on both individuals and society.  Computers are a valuable tool for school - related tasks. For instance, if a science teacher assigns a typed assignment, it's nearly impossible to complete without a computer. Also, when there's no time to visit a library for a project that requires information gathering, the computer comes in handy. Many people even pursue college courses online. A @NUM1 - year - old @PERSON1 said, ""My parents can't afford to send me to college, so I take free online courses, and they work really well.""  In addition to schoolwork, computers are a great source of information. Suppose you've just bought a new house and want to know more about the area. The computer allows you to view updated pictures and learn about your new hometown. Sixty - nine percent of people use computer - sourced information when buying a home. Whether you want to learn basic facts about bears or bees, the computer is a reliable source.  Lastly, computers are useful for maintaining contact with family and friends. @PERSON2 of @STATE1, @NUM2, said, ""My mom's side of the family lives in @LOCATION1. When I use the computer to keep in touch with them, I feel like a part of a big happy family."" People with family in other states or countries can use computers to stay connected. For example, if your parents are away for a while, email or instant messaging can be used to talk to them frequently.  In conclusion, computers benefit society and have positive effects on people. They are great for schoolwork, provide information, and help in keeping in touch with loved ones. It's clear why I strongly believe that computers have a significant and positive impact on people and society. Thank you!"
1437	1441	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I've recently heard the idea that computers aren't very productive. It's true that people get information and talk online, but this can be a negative thing. I agree that computers are over - used and often misused.  To me, online chatting has become the main form of communication. I even chat online frequently. However, it can be terrible if misused. Children around the world talk to strangers they've never met. People are being deceived because they assume the person they're chatting with is genuine. Online chatting is a good way to communicate, but only when used correctly.  Plagiarism is a widespread problem. People take information they haven't created and use it as their own. If caught, one can go to prison. Although there are ways to combat plagiarism, the internet, with all its information, is often misused. I've seen papers with copied information. You can tell because the formatting is different from the rest of the paper, and serious consequences follow. Teachers may require you to talk to a supervisor if plagiarism is detected.  I'll do my best to avoid plagiarism by gathering my own information. Everyone loves computers and technology, but if we all reduce our computer usage, issues like plagiarism and the misuse of online chatting can be minimized.
1438	1442	1	2	I believe that students should use computers as they can assist themselves through computer use. Students can use computers to take notes. Typing on a computer is faster than writing by hand. All you need to do is type.  Computers are also great for looking up information. For example, if a teacher asks the class to look up information about a giraffe, the computer is the most convenient place to find it. It's much easier to search for information on a computer than using other traditional methods.  Moreover, when working on a project that requires pictures, you can simply search on the computer and find what you need.  In conclusion, students should be allowed to use computers in classrooms and schools so that they can get easy help with their studies.
1439	1443	1	2	Computers, once thought to be a means of spreading ideas and connecting with far - off places, have actually become one of society's downfalls despite being a great technological advancement. They are dangerous devices, especially targeting young and innocent kids, and are a major reason for the current state of society, threatening to build the future generation on an unstable foundation. These devices must be removed from society immediately as they deprive people of the true joys of life, harm our health, and facilitate the actions of some of the country's most dangerous predators.  Firstly, computers are associated with the loss of childhood pleasures. Since @DATE1, the number of adolescent computer users has increased by @PERCENT1. Remarkably, @PERCENT2 of parents surveyed admitted that their children spend at least @NUM1 hours on the computer daily. This reduces time for reading, exercising, spending time outdoors, and socializing with friends and family. These negative impacts have an adverse effect on society, especially on teenagers, who are the most frequent users. As a result, diet and exercise are restricted, leading to a @PERCENT3 increase in obesity rates, and the lack of outdoor or family activities has promoted anti - social behavior. At this alarming rate, our future generation will indeed be on shaky ground.  Secondly, computers emit electromagnetic radiation as long as they are plugged in. This radiation is linked to various diseases and cancers, such as brain - tumors, leukemia, brain disorders, and other cancers. Leukemia, when contracted at a young age, is difficult to cure and can stunt a child's development. Children exposed to at least @NUM2 hours a day of @ORGANIZATION1 are @NUM3 times more likely to develop such conditions compared to those who spend more time outdoors. The best way to prevent these risks is to completely avoid using computers.  Lastly, computers are harmful because they expose adolescents to child predators. When teenagers access the web and chat rooms, they are at risk of being targeted by thousands of predators. Computers contain sensitive information like names, birthdates, genders, and social security numbers. With a single click, accepting a stranger's invitation, predators can hack into a child's computer and obtain this valuable information. In some cases, predators may directly interact with children. For example, a local @CAPS2 girl unknowingly chatted with an online stranger who invited her to the mall. Weeks later, her remains were found burned.  In conclusion, it's astonishing that the computer, a great technological advancement, can have such harmful effects. By removing computers, we can prevent the lack of engaging activities, protect our health from radiation, and eliminate the threat of online predators.
1440	1444	1	2	"A large number of people use computers every day, but not everyone thinks this technology benefits society. I firmly believe that computers enhance our way of life in numerous ways.  Computers have a positive impact on people as they allow for easy sending, receiving, and researching of a wide range of information. @PERCENT1 of people use computers to obtain information more quickly than reading a book on a specific topic. They find this technology to be more effective and faster. For example, my cousin and I were given the same research paper. I used the computer and completed it in @NUM1 days, while he used several books and took a whole week. Computer programming expert @PERSON1 said, ""Computers have made receiving information much faster. I strongly believe that everyone should own one.""  Computers also play a crucial role in communication. There are multiple ways to stay in touch with people worldwide, such as email, chat rooms, and websites like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. These platforms are great for keeping in touch with family, friends, or fans. @PERSON2, the lead singer of the band @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, said, ""@CAPS1 allows us to talk to fans directly and post updates about upcoming tours and albums."" It's also beneficial for college students. My older brother, a college student, and I communicate through these websites, making him seem closer.  In the business world, computers are equally useful. Meetings can be held via @ORGANIZATION2 or other web - chat services, and emails are an excellent way to send information. @NUM2 of business meetings are now held over the internet, which has improved work ethics.  In conclusion, I encourage you to heed my advice and make use of the internet and computers. They will enhance your communication and information - gathering abilities."
1441	1445	1	2	Every single computer in the world should have internet access. The internet offers numerous benefits to people. Anyone can complete their homework on a computer. You can also communicate with friends, send emails to anyone globally, or play games. Teachers utilize computers as they are the most efficient tool for finding necessary information. Students can use computers to conduct research papers, for example, in history. With internet access, a computer can provide information on any person or topic. Some computers come with a useful application called Microsoft Word, which allows users to write freely and correct any typing errors. Some schools even supply students with their own personal computers. Students can then complete their homework at their convenience and send it to their teachers via email. Computers can store far more information than any book in the world due to their large storage capacity. Additionally, there are websites that enable users to communicate with nearby friends without having to visit their homes. You can also share pictures on platforms like Facebook, MySpace, or other similar sites. Moreover, these platforms offer a variety of games for entertainment. Schools should incorporate computers as they are the optimal means to obtain the information required for various tasks, such as science, math, or history homework. They can also be used for leisure or to learn new knowledge. You should concur with me as the points I've presented are factual, and computers are one of the best methods to access pictures and information for any purpose, including staying in touch with long - lost friends.
1442	1446	1	2	Dear local newspaper, while some people believe that computers prepare individuals for the future, I firmly believe that they actually harm both children and adults. Firstly, children are so engrossed in computer games that they rarely engage in outdoor exercise. Secondly, if you ask a child about nature, they may be at a loss for words, which would not be the case if they spent less time on the computer. Finally, many families today rarely interact because both children and parents are overly occupied with their computers. These three reasons clearly demonstrate that computers do not benefit society. Obesity is a significant issue among children in @LOCATION1. The root cause is that they spend excessive time online and insufficient time outdoors exercising. Lack of fresh air and physical activity can lead to severe health problems. Parents sometimes fail to address this issue as they face the same problem themselves. This shows that computers and other technologies are causing weight - related problems in families across the country. Children are often ignorant about nature. Although people claim that computers educate, knowledge of nature and the environment is a crucial part of our lives. We need to learn about and protect it. Given the current situation, if we continue to rely so heavily on computers, the state of the Earth may worsen. Thus, people need to gain knowledge about nature and the environment. From my personal experience, computers rob us of time with friends and family. Instead of playing computer games at home, we could be spending quality time with our families in the park or at the pool. My father used to spend all his time on the computer, leaving little time for our family. However, after realizing this, he adjusted his schedule, allowing us to have more time together. Spending time with family is vital as they are an integral part of our lives, and reducing computer usage can facilitate this. As evident, reducing computer use can help children stay fit and healthy, educate them about the environment, and enhance family interaction. If it could transform my family's lifestyle, it can do the same for others. I hope you agree as it will undoubtedly have a positive impact.
1443	1447	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, computers are an extraordinary tool that has a profound positive impact on society. Computers have revolutionized communication, research, and entertainment. One of the significant ways computers benefit people is by providing diverse means of communication. Instant messaging programs like @CAPS5 have enabled us to engage in real - time conversations with individuals around the world. A recent survey indicated that @PERCENT1 of people prefer instant messaging over other forms of communication, excluding face - to - face interactions. Additionally, most modern computers are equipped with webcams, allowing users to see the person they are communicating with. For instance, when my friend moved, we could still maintain our friendship by seeing each other's daily activities, and I'm certain many others have had similar experiences. Moreover, Facebook has completely transformed communication, allowing people to stay updated on each other's lives. Despite some drawbacks, computers have established remarkable communication channels. Another reason computers have a positive influence is their role in research. Search engines like Google have made vast amounts of information accessible to us. Schools now utilize computer resources such as @CAPS6 for research, as there is an abundance of information available online. Studies have shown that @PERCENT2 of people have found relevant online information that is more useful than books. Computers have been instrumental in the growth of research and the continuous discovery of new knowledge. Finally, computers offer excellent entertainment options for people of all ages. Video websites like YouTube provide a platform to watch music videos and creative films. If you can't attend a concert, watching music videos online is a cost - effective alternative. Online gaming websites offer free games, and websites with funny stories can provide entertainment without leaving home. Wouldn't it be more appealing to stay home and have fun when it's not necessary to go out? Computers are an outstanding way to obtain quick and inexpensive entertainment. In conclusion, computers have had a far - reaching positive impact on society by revolutionizing communication, research, and entertainment. I invite you to recognize the incredible power of computers.
1444	1448	1	2	Dear Newspaper, have you ever considered the contributions of modern technology? Computers are a prime example. Many people use computers to book vacations, build relationships, and discover new ideas. The sweltering sun might make you eager to book a vacation to a tropical island. Many individuals plan their vacations by researching hotels and making bookings on the computer. In fact, modern technology has enabled people to visit their desired destinations. Over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1's have chat accounts to communicate with family and friends. The long distance between Europe and @LOCATION1, over @NUM1 miles, makes phone calls costly. Modern technology has shifted from traditional phones to computers for long - distance communication. Moreover, computers have facilitated relationships for over @NUM2 single people. Some critics argue that computers reduce face - to - face interaction with family and friends. However, computers have also connected people, allowing them to communicate and plan activities like @CAPS3. While it's true that excessive computer use can be an issue, we can make decisions to improve our well - being by limiting usage. Setting standards for computer use can address these problems and encourage physical activity. I strongly disagree with the critics and support the positive uses of computers. If computers were removed, not only would people's files be lost, but in the long run, everyone would become disorganized. Additionally, exploring new places and websites can teach even the most knowledgeable individuals something new. After reading this, I hope I've convinced you that @CAPS4 should be appreciated by many.
1445	1449	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, computers have a remarkable impact on people. Technological advancements in computers have brought numerous benefits to society. Computers provide a platform for people to interact with others, access educational resources on school websites, and develop hand - eye coordination. Computers are transforming the world. They offer a space for people to communicate. There are thousands of websites with chat features and online chat rooms, which allow users to exchange ideas and stay informed about global events. Chat rooms also help friends maintain close relationships. Studies show that ninety percent of @CAPS1 with access to chat rooms tend to have more friends. Clearly, computer - mediated interactions have a positive influence on people. School websites are also extremely beneficial. They enable us to deepen our understanding of school subjects and learn new things. Since most schools in @LOCATION1 have their own websites, they assist students who are struggling academically. From my own experience, when I forget my homework or need to prepare for a quiz or test, I can easily find the necessary information on my computer. This clearly demonstrates the benefits of computers in education. Computers also contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination. Whether playing games or performing other tasks, using a computer requires quick mouse movements and focused attention on the screen. I always enjoy using the computer as it allows me to have fun while improving my hand - eye coordination. Ninety - five percent of computer users enjoy using them, which means that a large proportion of people are enhancing their hand - eye coordination. If this doesn't benefit society, then nothing does. In conclusion, it is evident that computers have a positive impact on people. They provide a means of interaction, educational resources, and help develop hand - eye coordination. Computers play a significant role in our lives today.
1446	1450	1	2	In today's digital age, computers have become an integral part of our lives. I firmly believe that they have a profoundly positive impact on people. Firstly, computers serve as a powerful tool for learning about foreign places. Take my uncle as an example. Before his trip to @LOCATION4, he utilized the computer to research @CAPS1 culture. This way, he was well - prepared and could avoid any cultural faux pas. While some may argue that one can read a book about a country, not everyone has the luxury of time to sit and read. Computers break down geographical barriers and enable us to understand different cultures, which I find incredibly positive.  Secondly, computers are excellent for connecting people. More than @PERCENT1 of those who move away from their loved ones reconnect through computers. Social networking sites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 have made it possible to stay in touch with family and friends living far away. When I moved from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1, I thought I'd lose touch with my best friend. However, through @CAPS3, I found her again. We exchanged contact information and now talk daily. Also, the computer is the only way I can communicate with my aunty in @LOCATION3, as phone calls would be too costly. Moreover, it helps people find their biological parents or siblings, bringing families back together.  Lastly, computers are a boon for work. Any @CAPS6 of a company relies on laptops to store data, files, and important information. They are essential for keeping track of the company, even when on vacation. Imagine owning a company and going on a trip without being able to monitor its operations due to the lack of a computer.  In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits, including learning about different places, maintaining relationships, and facilitating work. I hope more people will recognize and appreciate the great uses of computers.
1447	1451	1	2	"Dear @PERSON4, I am convinced that the use of computers is highly beneficial to the community. One significant advantage is that computers can enhance hand - eye coordination and other skills. They provide access to games that are useful in @ORGANIZATION2 training. For instance, @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, started incorporating these games into their training this @DATE1. Instructors have reported that trainees and students have far better @ORGANIZATION2 skills compared to previous years. Computer games can also improve reflexes. Two years ago, a @NUM1 - year - old man named @PERSON3 was in a life - threatening situation. As a train was approaching, he fell onto the tracks but managed to leap to safety. When asked how he did it, he credited his years of playing computer games since he was @NUM2 years old. Additionally, computers make us more intelligent. A @DATE2 study by @ORGANIZATION1 found that brains were @PERCENT1 more active after computer use. Researchers obtained this data by attaching electrolytes to patients' brains before and after computer use. These facts clearly show that computers enhance hand - eye coordination and other skills.  Another reason computers are beneficial is their ability to facilitate online communication. They allow us to connect with family members who live far away, strengthening our relationships. I recently reconnected with my cousin in @LOCATION3. Letters were expensive and slow, but email and Skype provided a great alternative. Computers also improve social skills. @PERSON1, a local resident, said, ""I love using computers because I can talk to my friends whenever I want, and it really helps us communicate."" Moreover, computers can improve mood. In a test by @ORGANIZATION3 in @DATE3, @NUM3 people were placed in separate rooms with personal computers for @NUM4 hour. Afterward, @PERCENT2 reported an improvement in their mood.  Finally, computers enable us to learn about other places. Virtual tours are becoming increasingly popular. At @CAPS2.org, you can take virtual tours of over @NUM5 different countries, such as @LOCATION5, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION6. You can also learn about other cultures through online videos on YouTube and articles on Wikipedia. You can even learn new recipes. Celebrity chef @PERSON2 posts her recipes on mstewart.com and has found many of them online. In an interview with @CAPS3 magazine, when asked about her famous @CAPS4 chocolate cake, she admitted to finding most of her best recipes online, stating that the internet is a powerful resource that more people should use.  In conclusion, computers offer a wide range of benefits, from improving skills and mood to facilitating communication and learning. Their positive impact on the community is undeniable, and I hope more people will embrace their use."
1448	1452	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I understand that you think people are spending too much time on computers instead of exercising or socializing in person. However, I hold the opposite view. Computers are incredibly useful for several reasons.  Firstly, most computer users interact with others online. @PERCENT1 of people have accounts on platforms like Facebook, MySpace, or Skype. Through these sites, we can meet new people from different parts of the state or country. We can also stay informed about local events. For example, if there's a missing child, we can get the description and potentially help in the search.  Secondly, computers are great for research. I once had to do a project on teen mothers. I first went to the library and took out some books. When I couldn't find all the information I needed in the books, I turned to the computer. We can also learn about far - off places like @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1. One time, when my mom told me to clean my room or she'd give my stuff away, I went online to see how other people lived. Some had nice houses, while others lived in very poor conditions. This experience changed my perspective and made me feel empathetic towards them.  Lastly, computers help people earn money and support their families. @PERCENT2 of people found their jobs through computers. They can visit websites to find safe and well - paying jobs. Moreover, having a computer allows people to work from home. Some people can't afford babysitters and need to watch their kids, so they can work from home to make money. People can also apply for jobs or community service online. My sister, @PERSON1, got her first job by applying on the @CAPS4 museum's website using the computer.  In conclusion, computers are beneficial as they enable online interaction, provide a means for research, and help people find employment. They play a vital role in our lives, and I hope more people will recognize their value. Do you use computers for any of these reasons?
1449	1453	1	2	Dear Newspaper, in this era of rapid technological advancement, the world has truly become a small place, thanks to the widespread use of computers. I firmly believe that the impact of computers is overwhelmingly positive.  One of the key benefits of computers is the improvement of hand - eye coordination. A recent study by @PERSON1 showed that children aged @NUM1 to @NUM2 who used educational computer programs like @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for half an hour a day had significantly better motor skills compared to those who didn't. Hand - eye coordination is essential in our daily lives, from simple tasks like eating and brushing teeth to more complex activities such as typing, drawing, and playing the piano.  Computers are also excellent communication tools. Phone calls may not always be possible, but email allows us to send messages that can be accessed anytime, anywhere. We can also send documents via email, which is difficult to do with a home phone and challenging for most cell phones. Video - conferencing programs like @ORGANIZATION2 have revolutionized communication, enabling us to talk to people around the world face - to - face. I use the computer to keep in touch with my family on the @LOCATION2.  Finally, computers are powerful research tools. We can find information on anything, from the local zoo's schedule to the average lifespan of the @CAPS4 elephant. Instead of spending hours searching through books, we can get instant answers by using search engines like @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS5. We can take virtual tours of different countries on @CAPS2.org and learn about various cultures through online resources.  In conclusion, computers are often misrepresented as a negative influence on society, but this is far from the truth. They enhance hand - eye coordination, facilitate communication, and provide a wealth of information. They are an excellent tool for people of all ages, and we should not view technology as our enemy.
1450	1454	1	2	The rhythmic clicking sound often accompanies the opening of yet another information page on your trusty @LOCATION4. These smart, reliable, and user - friendly devices are truly indispensable. However, some people now claim that these handy desktops are detrimental to our well - being, arguing that we don't get enough exercise or outdoor activities. But I firmly disagree.  Computers are an outstanding entertainment system. They offer a vast amount of entertainment, far surpassing televisions, radios, and @NUM1 players. You can access family - friendly movies, iTunes tracks, and even create your own movies on certain websites. With just a click of the mouse, you can post pictures on the @CAPS1 and send them via email. The internet makes family movie nights a breeze.  In addition to entertainment, computers are a rich source of information. Google, Wikipedia, and dictionary.com are among the top information sites of the @DATE1. Whether you're researching how to tie a tie or working on a history report, the @CAPS3 can provide easy - to - access information. I'd rather explore the sunny beaches of @CAPS2 or the great landscapes of @LOCATION1 through the computer than engage in other activities.  Moreover, computers are excellent for socialization. They allow you to communicate with friends and family across the globe. Platforms like Skype, Facebook, and MySpace are readily available on your @CAPS3. Many of these sites have a no - fee policy, making it cost - effective to stay in touch. I can now talk to my cousins in @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION1 thanks to Facebook. Why go through the hassle of traveling across town when you can connect instantly online?  In conclusion, the internet offers a multitude of benefits, including entertainment, a vast source of information, and social interaction. I hope more people will open their eyes to the great uses of computers and appreciate their value in our lives.
1451	1455	1	2	To the concerned parties in @MONTH1, I've noticed there's a debate about whether computers are beneficial or harmful. In my view, computers are truly remarkable. They enable us to communicate with people globally, offer us the means to learn new things, and help us save money. These are undeniable benefits, aren't they?   Computers provide us with the opportunity to talk to people around the world. Many of my family members live in different @CAPS1, and the computer is how I keep in touch with them. If you move away from your friends and family, you'd surely want to maintain contact, and the computer makes that possible.   Moreover, computers allow us to learn about various things. For instance, if I visit ""@CAPS2.com"", I can type in any query and obtain relevant information or answers. As a parent, you can check your child's school grades on the school website.   Lastly, computers save us money daily. Without a computer, looking up information for a project would require a trip to the library and potentially buying a book. With a computer, you can easily access information from the comfort of your home.   In conclusion, it's evident that computers benefit us in numerous ways. They facilitate communication with friends and family worldwide, provide quick and easy access to information, and save us money. I hope this letter has convinced you that computers are a positive addition to our lives."
1452	1456	1	2	Imagine getting a ""@CAPS1"" on your social studies report. Or not being able to see your school friends after school. Or being extremely bored with no TV or games to play. Some experts are worried about people spending too much time on computers and not enough time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with loved ones.   However, I believe the idea that people are on computers too much is silly. Let me share how a computer can change your life. One time, I had a history report due the next day. I'd forgotten my history book at school and knew nothing about the report. I was on the verge of failing, but then I turned on my computer and opened the internet browser.   I remember @TIME1 year when I was doing a report about the @CAPS4 @CAPS3. I knew nothing about them and had left my book at school. I opened the internet, typed in @CAPS4 @CAPS3 on @ORGANIZATION1, and @DATE1 I got a @NUM1 on the report.   You can also use the computer to look up information for school. @TIME1 @DATE1, I was reading about the @CAPS6 @CAPS7. A few days later, we discussed how the @CAPS7 might have been made, and I was the only one in my grade who knew the answer.   Computers can also be used for educational games, like timed multiplication or division problems. With a computer, you can improve your grades, which can lead to a good college and a good job.   Computers also allow you to chat with people. You can use @CAPS8 for messaging or @ORGANIZATION2 for free conversations. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of computer users have either @CAPS8 or @ORGANIZATION2 installed.   In conclusion, computers can significantly enhance your life. They can improve your grades, help you learn, and keep you connected with others. So, the idea of limiting computer use is unfounded."
1453	1457	1	2	Dear Local @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers do not have a negative impact on people. Instead, they bring numerous benefits to our lives. Computers are not just for games; they can be used for entertainment, jobs, research, and projects.   Computers are essential for many jobs. For example, if you're a lawyer, you often need a computer to type up documents. Poor penmanship can be a problem when referring to important documents, but a computer solves that issue.   In school, computers are also beneficial. Some students may not have easy access to a library, so using a computer to gather information for projects or homework is a great alternative.   Moreover, if you have a @CAPS2 or @CAPS3, you can meet people from all over the world through the computer. This allows you to learn about different lifestyles and cultures.   In conclusion, computers clearly benefit rather than harm people. I hope you will reconsider your stance on this matter after reading my letter.
1454	1458	1	2	In light of the ongoing debate regarding whether computers benefit society, I am writing to present my perspective. I contend that the advantages of computers far outweigh their drawbacks, primarily due to their contributions to online communication, learning, and employment.   Computers have revolutionized online communication. This includes social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace, as well as email, blogs, and chat sites. These platforms enable long - distance communication, effectively bringing people closer together. For instance, my uncle lives in @LOCATION1, and my mother can communicate with him and other relatives through Facebook at any time. Email, although slower than some forms of electronic communication, is also a useful means of interaction.   Computers also enhance learning in multiple ways. They expedite the flow of information to students. Students can visit school websites to obtain details about school events, retrieve homework assignments, and read daily announcements. Teachers may post helpful hints and detailed explanations of assignments. Additionally, computers assist with research projects. For example, in my health class a couple of weeks ago, we gathered information for an illegal drug project using the computer and created a variety of brochures.   In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in society by facilitating communication and enhancing learning. Their benefits are substantial and should be recognized in the ongoing debate.
1455	1459	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Some people think computers are beneficial to society, but I strongly disagree. People who spend too much time on computers miss out on exercise and the beauty of nature. Do you really want to get fat sitting in front of a computer all day?   Moreover, computer users often neglect visiting friends and family, who are the most important people in our lives. You have a choice: be physically fit through exercise or just move your fingers on the keyboard. Exercise not only keeps you fit but also teaches you valuable lessons.   Yes, computers can teach you things, but nothing compares to the real beauty of nature. Pictures of nature on the computer are just pixels, while the real world is full of natural beauty. All the cool and fit people are outside enjoying nature. You can explore exotic plants and beautiful animals with your friends and family.   Studies show that @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 love their family and friends. Friends and family can support you through tough times. If you keep sitting on the computer, you'll not only get fat but also risk losing the support of your loved ones.   In conclusion, it's time to get off the computer and go outside. Don't miss out on the beauty of nature and the company of your friends and family. Go have some fun!
1456	1460	1	2	I have realized that there has been a disagreement regarding the positive and negative effects of computers on people. In my view, computers have more negative impacts on people than positive ones. I believe that people are spending excessive time on computers, neglecting exercise, not spending quality time with family and friends, and missing out on fresh air and nature. Although computers are remarkable technological tools, many people stay indoors with their computers instead of going outside to enjoy nature and fresh air. This is detrimental because exposure to sunlight outdoors benefits skin health, and breathing fresh air is good for the lungs. Additionally, taking a walk outside to enjoy nature can relieve stress and be relaxing. Moreover, when people are on the computer, they often ignore what their friends and family are saying. They can lose track of time and spend hours on the computer. Instead, this time should be used to be with loved ones. Spending time with family can strengthen the bond between family members and improve relationships. Also, having a nice family time is an excellent way to enhance family ties. A significant proportion of experts say that having a family dinner can improve a child's grades and prevent them from using drugs or dropping out of high school or college. Finally, kids are becoming more obese as they do not get enough exercise. Recent studies show that at least a certain percentage of kids are obese. This can lead to serious health issues such as bone and joint problems, heart disease, lung problems, diabetes, and asthma. If kids exercise instead of being on the computer all day, the number of obese kids will decrease significantly. Exercise can boost kids' self - esteem and help them get in shape. They can play sports, take a walk, or go for a run. There are numerous ways to exercise, and it can be fun for kids. Undoubtedly, there are more reasons indicating the negative effects of computers on kids and adults. Computers prevent people from enjoying nature and fresh air, hinder family and friend interactions, and stop kids from exercising, which can lead to obesity. In conclusion, we should be more aware of these negative impacts and make a conscious effort to balance our use of computers.
1457	1461	1	2	I agree that computers are useful for various things like researching vacation spots, finding jobs, shopping for presents, and more. There are so many applications for the computer. However, the creators of computers are concerned that people are spending too much time on them. Mainly, both the concerned individuals and users often complain about not having enough time with family and friends. We can't be sure if users are looking up vacation trips for their friends and family. What the concerned people don't understand is that computers can teach us a great deal, including history, mathematics, and science experiments. Computers are also used in schools to assist students with their work, and teachers use them for grading. It's true that people are not going outside to get fresh air or take a walk in the park. Spending an excessive number of hours on the computer is just crazy. So, I see both sides of the issue. It's better to enjoy life rather than looking up things that aren't really necessary. We should only use the computer for essential tasks like paying bills and shopping for furniture for our homes. That's the original purpose of the computer. In conclusion, we need to use computers in a balanced way, focusing on their useful aspects while not neglecting real - life experiences.
1458	1462	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, imagine a world where the unemployment rate rises significantly, people's communication and learning speeds slow down, and everyone is stressed out. That's what the world would be like if computers suddenly disappeared. I believe that computers are more beneficial to society than some people realize. They teach us new knowledge and improve our hand - eye coordination. Many jobs, such as accounting, involve the use of computers. Computer games and certain applications can help people relax after a hard day. Schools are the foundation of society as they educate kids and teens to become successful adults. Computers have greatly accelerated the teaching process. Teachers can now access grades instantly. My computer also helps me in many ways. In conclusion, computers play an indispensable role in modern society, and we should recognize and make full use of their benefits.
1459	1463	1	2	Dear Newspaper: I've just read your recent article about whether computers are helping or ruining society. I think they are helpful. Without the internet, I wouldn't have learned how to do things like clearing something in the proper way. It usually takes time to learn such skills, but I learned it quickly through the internet. If done incorrectly, there could be dangerous consequences. There are many other useful applications of the internet. When you're in a difficult situation and your family is counting on you, you have two choices. You can either panic and let everyone down or turn to the internet for solutions. However, the computer does have an impact on people's exercise habits. I know what you might be thinking, but it's a fact. The internet has both pros and cons in this aspect. It can teach us better and more effective ways to stay healthy, but there are also negative factors. All these can lead to different outcomes. It's only a bad thing when we over - rely on it. In conclusion, as long as we use the computer and the internet in the right way, we can be healthier than ever.
1460	1464	1	2	Dear Readers in the area represented by @ORGANIZATION1, in today's world, almost everything revolves around technology. With the rapid changes in various aspects, do people still have time to slow down and enjoy the simple pleasures of life? People are no longer spending time at well - known places to admire the beautiful scenery in the fall, or participating in sports like @CAPS7 or baseball. Instead, they are sitting on a chair, watching videos on @CAPS8 or playing games like @CAPS9 or @CAPS10. In @LOCATION5, health problems have become an epidemic. The reason is that instead of enjoying the fresh air and open fields that @CAPS13 offers, people are engrossed in @CAPS14, @NUM1, or our @ORGANIZATION4 - related activities. In @LOCATION5, the situation has changed significantly. From a certain date @DATE1, the obesity rate has increased from @PERCENT2 in a particular area to a much higher percentage. This is a significant increase. Another rate that is increasing is the number of homes that own computers and the corresponding rate for each home. Dr. @DR1 found that in the last @NUM4, the number of a certain type of diabetics has almost doubled. A researcher at @ORGANIZATION6 wrote an article for @ORGANIZATION3. In his article, he stated that a large percentage of households own more than one computer. @CAPS14, @CAPS15, and @ORGANIZATION5 are thriving in this economic slump, while sporting goods, books, and exercise equipment are not doing well. People at @ORGANIZATION6 see this as a major cause of the growing lack of exercise and the increased time spent on home computers. It's also important to note how this time on computers is affecting children. As a writer for @ORGANIZATION4 put it, children are spending less time playing sports and more time on their laptops playing video games. I, who have been involved in @CAPS7 in @LOCATION3 for a long time, have witnessed a significant decrease in the number of people interested in the sport. When I was younger, it was difficult to make the travel team, but now, there are so few participants that the try - out process is almost non - existent. When I grow up, I'm likely to have a job that involves working on a computer. But for now, I want to enjoy being a kid. We shouldn't let kids waste their time on video games. In the future, they will spend enough time behind a computer. We are talking about the health of the future generation. Do we want a world where everyone has diabetes and is constantly on a computer? Despite the rapid changes around us, we need to keep one thing the same: we need to get out and stay active. We can't achieve this by sitting behind a computer screen. Thank you for your time.
1461	1465	1	2	Dear @PERSON1, I firmly stand on the side of computers. You might think I'm only saying this because I'm @NUM1 years old and computers are my main source of fun. However, I truly believe that computers bring numerous benefits to society.  Computers are not just the @CAPS1 but also include the @CAPS6 processor and @ORGANIZATION1 and related components. They offer a wide range of games suitable for people aged from @NUM2 to @NUM3. On a rainy day when your parents are at work and you're alone with nothing to do, simply turn on the computer and play a game. There are countless fun websites for everyone.  Moreover, computers are an excellent source of communication. There are various types of @CAPS2 - mail, and platforms like @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION4, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 are great for chatting with friends. Since not everyone has a cell phone, communicating via these platforms is really nice.  In terms of education, computers are invaluable. If you're working on a history project and need more information and pictures, just log onto a computer and search on @ORGANIZATION3. At our school, edline tells us all our homework assignments, which is extremely handy. And now, there are also online schooling tutors.  For work, computers are indispensable. Companies like @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION5, and other @ORGANIZATION2 - related businesses rely on computers. Workers can find information and create useful outputs, which is highly beneficial for business operations.  As you can see, computers have so many great uses. I whole - heartedly believe that computers have a positive impact on people, enabling us to have fun, communicate, pursue education, and carry out work. Having a computer around is definitely a good thing. Don't you think so?
1462	1466	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1, minute man, I've noticed that people are complaining about how computers interfere with their family and life. But in my opinion, computers teach both adults and kids new things. Being on the computer is a unique experience where you can almost search for anything. You can learn about history or the present.  For example, one time I was searching on @CAPS1.com about how to fix a PlayStation @NUM1 controller. I managed to find out how to do it, and it actually worked! While on the computer, you can interact with friends, check the weather, and find out about your homework.  The computer also teaches you how to do different things. I once learned to do a hardflip through the computer. It can also help with your homework. If you have science homework and can't figure out a word, you can search for it. Or if you're looking for a book for @LOCATION2, you can search websites for good books or ask a friend.  I know some people say computers are bad, but think about it. If you have a TV for a game system, it's kind of like having a computer, right? But don't go overboard looking for a cheap one. In my view, everyone should have a computer because they are both helpful and fun.
1463	1467	1	2	In the @LOCATION1, the majority of individuals utilize computers at some point in their lives. Computers serve as a medium for teaching hand - eye coordination through programs, games, and typing. The internet, a significant feature of computers, allows users to research distant cultures as well as aspects of their own lifestyles. This well - crafted and compact piece of technology has become increasingly intricate.  One of the most fundamental and evident outcomes of computer use is the development of hand - eye coordination. From a young age, children in grade school start learning to type on a keyboard. Specialized programs facilitate the acquisition of this necessary skill in an enjoyable manner. For instance, the author recalls being five years old and being excited to pick up new typing programs like ""Type to Learn"" and @CAPS1 typing lessons at Barnes and Noble. Typing skills, which teach hand - eye coordination, are essential not only in high school and college but also in the job market. Young adults and adults are expected to type papers, resumes, and applications, and in the current technological era, typing has become a necessity.  Another way to enhance hand - eye coordination is through computer games. Simple games such as solitaire, Bejeweled, or car racing can teach this skill, while more advanced games like World of Warcraft require perfect coordination. Both typing and gaming on the computer contribute to the development of this skill.  Although some experts are concerned that ""people are spending too much time on the computer and less time enjoying nature,"" computers also offer opportunities to learn about geography, travel, and nature. The World Wide Web, a remarkable feature of computers, consists of millions of websites, pages, search engines, and vast amounts of information. Whether you are preparing for a geography exam, planning a trip, or looking for a definition of a word like ""cognitive,"" a legitimate website can provide the required information with a simple search. Instead of incurring the high costs of travel to learn about specific wonders, users can simply click and type to access amazing information. Through computer searches, one can learn about long - ago cultures and rituals, similar to the information one would find in a museum.  In conclusion, computers, with their complex yet user - friendly technology, provide a world of pictures, art, and history at one's fingertips. They play a significant role in teaching hand - eye coordination and offer a wealth of educational opportunities, despite the concerns raised by some experts."
1464	1468	1	2	Did you know that four out of five households have a computer? I think it's because computers have a huge positive impact on our lives.  With computers, you can easily contact people in different parts of the @CAPS1. You can also search for unlimited amounts of information on the internet. For example, if you're doing a report on @LOCATION3 or need to find a definition for a word, just search on @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2. There's so much new information added daily, and you never know what you might discover.  Computers are also great for business. Imagine a hard - working businessman in the @LOCATION1 who works for a @CAPS1 - famous company and has to meet the big boss in @LOCATION4. It would be so much easier to set up a video chat instead of dealing with the hassle of a plane voyage.  In addition, computers are beneficial for other electronic equipment. How would you download music to an @NUM1 without a computer? You can't. You can also download videos, print out photographs, and charge @CAPS4 and other electronics.  When it comes to communication, the internet makes it possible to talk to people all over the world. You can learn about different cultures and lifestyles and might even make new friends. It's amazing how easy it is to stay in touch with others through platforms like @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION4, and more.  In my opinion, technology has given birth to the much - used computer, and it has greatly improved our lifestyle. We can contact others more easily, find information instantly, and make other electronics work. Having a computer around is definitely a good thing. Don't you agree?
1465	1469	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1, I've been thinking about whether people spend too much time on computers. In a survey, @PERCENT1 out of @NUM1 people would rather go on the computer than take a walk. I believe this shows that computers have a negative effect on people.  When it comes to exercise, many people only exercise for @NUM2 minutes. But when you're distracted by computer games or social media like Facebook, you might only exercise for @NUM3 minutes because you're eager to get back to the computer. The computer on your desk seems so inviting, while the yoga mat or weights on the ground are ignored. The computer is more fun and less worrisome, so you're more likely to choose it over exercise. It makes it hard to focus on exercising properly because your mind is filled with thoughts of computer games, emails, and other things on the computer. Clearly, computers are not healthy for people.  Nature is so beautiful. The trees sway in the wind, butterflies fly in the air, and each season offers different and beautiful scenery. But when people are on the computer all the time, they're stuck in a stuffy room with a desk and some pictures. They're missing out on the fresh air and the beauty of nature. They're not walking on the beach, taking a long hike in the woods, or strolling in the park. Instead, they're sitting in a chair, staring at a computer screen. How can that compare to enjoying the beauty of nature?  Hanging out with friends and family is a great thing, but how can you do that if you're glued to the computer? People who are addicted to the computer are missing out on having fun with their loved ones. This could have a negative impact on their future. They might grow up sad and lonely and not know how to interact with people when they get a job that involves working with others.  In conclusion, I'm really against the over - use of computers. They cut into people's exercise time, prevent them from enjoying nature, and get in the way of spending time with friends and family. I hope you can see the bad effects that computers have on people.
1466	1470	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on society for several reasons. Firstly, they facilitate communication with others. Through online social networks such as Facebook, MySpace, and [CAPS3], over [NUM2] million people can keep track of their friends' lives and stay informed about global events. These platforms offer users the opportunity to engage in a virtual adventure, providing the information they crave and enticing them to return daily. I consider these websites to be a significant asset that can only enhance society.  Secondly, computers serve as a valuable source of news and information. Many news channels maintain their own websites, where they update viewers on the latest events, accompanied by pictures, stories, and videos. This enables us to stay informed about what is happening not only in [LOCATION1] but also around the world.  Lastly, computers are an excellent learning tool. They provide access to a vast amount of information on virtually any topic. For instance, if a student is struggling with science homework, they can simply type their question into a search engine like Ask.com and receive a comprehensive answer. Parents and teachers recognize the benefits of computers in helping children succeed academically.  In conclusion, I have presented three well - thought - out reasons why computers are beneficial to society. Communication, global updates, and educational resources are all integrated into this remarkable piece of technology. I sincerely hope that you will share my view that computers have a positive effect on society.
1467	1471	1	2	Hey, local newspaper! I really think computers are a big help to our society. For one, we can talk to friends online. Facebook is a super common website, and [NUM1] people use it, that's [PERCENT1]! You can not only catch up with old school friends you hardly ever see, but also make new friends by chatting about games or popular [CAPS1.V] shows. My mom says that's how she stays close to her friends, and it's the same for me.  If you want to learn about far - off places without spending a fortune, just search for websites that explain different cultures and details about other parts of the world. You can even get a quick history lesson on some webpages. And if you're planning a trip but don't know where to go, the internet is your best friend.  Computers also help with hand - eye coordination. You can practice typing essays and work projects. Around [PERCENT2] of computer owners type faster than they write. It's almost everyone! And typing is definitely faster than writing. You see the words you're typing and press the keys with your hands.  Thanks for reading my essay on why computers are good for our society. Remember, we learn more every day from computers, we can talk to friends, and we can plan our trips.
1468	1472	1	2	Dear [CAPS1], computers have a positive impact on people. They offer better communication with friends and family. For example, if you miss an important business call on your cell phone, the person can easily contact you via email. Also, if you have a Facebook or other interactive websites, you can always stay updated on your friends' lives without constantly reaching out to them.  Computers also provide instant news. Suppose an adult usually watches the news at night before bed to find out what has [CAPS2], but they go to bed early. They can simply go online to check what they missed. This could include events in [LOCATION2] and [LOCATION3], wars in [LOCATION1], or local tragedies.  In addition to communication and news, computers offer advanced education. If a student is working on a science project and needs more information, the internet is a great resource to expand their knowledge.  In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people as they enable us to stay connected, keep up with the latest news, and receive an advanced education.
1469	1473	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I'm going to explain why I think computers can be bad. First, when the weather is nice and warm, people who are glued to their computers don't have time to enjoy nature. Second, they neglect spending time with their families and friends. They only get off the computer to pay bills or buy computer games.  Third, computer - obsessed people may have trouble getting a job. They're so caught up in having fun on the computer that they don't want to get up and look for work. When they run out of money, they might do foolish things to pay their bills so they can get back to playing. This creates a vicious cycle.  Not everyone is affected the same way. Some people love playing computer games, while others don't. But in my opinion, computers can be a problem for some individuals. I'm sure there are many others who share this view. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
1470	1474	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are a great asset to people. People can use them to do their work, and children enjoy playing games on them. Adults also appreciate the convenience of doing their jobs online.  Those who own computers are likely to be happy because they can do almost everything on them. You can play games, visit social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter, and explore countless other websites.  In conclusion, based on these reasons, I am convinced that computers are extremely beneficial to people as they offer a wide range of functions and entertainment options.
1471	1475	1	2	In my view, computers are not entirely detrimental to people; they can also bring about positive impacts. For instance, computers enable people to communicate instantaneously across the globe and provide access to new information for everyone. However, a significant drawback is that some individuals spend excessive time on computers and thus fail to engage in physical exercise.  Computers are beneficial as they allow news and information to reach the entire world within seconds. During the recent war in @LOCATION1, news reporters were prohibited from entering towns and cities where battles were taking place. Every day, social messaging sites like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 disseminated news to the world through cellphone videos and pictures, which would have remained unseen without computers and the internet.  Secondly, computers empower people to acquire knowledge on various topics within minutes. For example, if one needs information about a particular country, they can find it using a computer. If a recipe for an @CAPS3 dessert is required, it can be looked up on a computer. Additionally, checking the weather forecast is also made possible with a computer. With a computer, anyone can access the world's knowledge.  The main argument against computers is that people do not get enough exercise because they are constantly on the devices. Some claim that people become so engrossed in their computers that it affects their lives. However, evidence shows that the majority of heavy computer users do get sufficient exercise. A recent statistic indicates that among internet users with an average grade of A or better, they also engage in at least [specific activity].  In conclusion, computers are neither completely good nor completely bad for society. Their strengths lie in communication and the ability to quickly gain knowledge. The primary downside is that a small number of computer users do not exercise enough. In my opinion, the benefits of computers far outweigh the drawbacks.
1472	1476	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I am aware that the use of computers is increasing daily. I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on both adults and children.  Computers are valuable as they offer information about other countries, states, and towns. They can also assist children with their school homework. Moreover, they facilitate communication with friends and family members who live at a great distance.  Computers provide information about the latest events in other towns, countries, and states. If one wants to find out something that happened @NUM1 years ago or more, it may not be available on @CAPS1.V., but it can be retrieved from the internet. Without the internet, such information would be difficult to obtain.  Another significant advantage of computers is their usefulness in helping kids with homework and schoolwork. Typed work is neater and more understandable. I understand that some parents may be reluctant to let their kids use computers for homework, as they might engage in other activities or seek answers that they could figure out independently. However, using a computer for schoolwork can ensure the accuracy of the work.  Finally, computers can help people reconnect with friends and family. If someone wants to find out the whereabouts of their friends or family members, a computer can provide relevant information. Although this may pose risks for those with malicious intent, such as stalkers or abusers, in most cases, it is beneficial for reuniting families and maintaining close friendships.  What are your thoughts on computers? Some people may dislike them, but they have valid reasons. While it is important to spend time with family, I believe that one can allocate time for using the computer as well as for family activities and exercise.  I hope you find my views on computers insightful and develop a greater appreciation for these devices.
1473	1477	1	2	I believe that computers have multiple effects on people, particularly on their eyes, bodies, and minds.  Regarding the eyes, sitting too close to the computer screen can have a negative impact. Prolonged exposure may lead to vision problems, and one may even lose their eyesight, which would prevent them from seeing, reading, or engaging in enjoyable activities. It is a choice whether to sit too close to the computer or not.  In terms of the body, spending an entire day sitting at the computer without exercise can result in weight gain. One's body may become fat, and they will find it difficult to run or participate in other physical activities. It is up to individuals to decide whether to spend the whole day on the computer.  As for the mind, when people watch videos or play new games on the computer, their minds may become fixated on these activities. When they go to school, they may only think about what they did on the computer and forget about their tasks. This can be a consequence of excessive computer use.  Finally, I urge everyone not to spend too much time on the computer. Instead, they should engage in exercise and other fun activities while also focusing on schoolwork and homework. I hope everyone can lead a healthy and fulfilling life.
1474	1478	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I pose the question: have computers ever hurt anyone? In my opinion, the effects of computers on people are decidedly positive.  Computers enable people to communicate and socialize regardless of geographical distances. For example, if a friend or family member moves to another country or state, they may be separated for months or even years. Without computers, they would constantly miss each other. However, with the help of computers, they can communicate as if they were neighbors.  Computers also have practical applications in business. They make it easier for people to monitor their stocks, income, and sales trends. Suppose one needs to change the price of their goods but their car breaks down and the incorrect price information is far away. Without a computer, they would either have to wait for a mechanic or run a long distance to use a phone. But with a computer, they can simply log on and make the change from the comfort of their home.  In addition, computers serve educational purposes. They allow people to explore the world without leaving their seats. One can take a virtual tour of the safari, venture into the rainforest, admire the beauty of the great plains, or witness the changing sands of the Sahara Desert. With a computer, one can learn about various topics, from ancient Greece and Archimedes to ancient Egypt or even Pac - Man.  In conclusion, I view computers as an incredibly positive invention. They enable us to do things that were previously unimaginable, allowing us to traverse the world in seconds and communicate with people across the oceans. So, we should seriously consider whether computers are truly harmful.
1475	1479	1	2	In my opinion, computers should be used for a multitude of purposes. One of the key uses is online chatting with friends and family. If you are traveling to a distant place and someone can provide you with directions, you can chat with them while on the move. Also, if your family members live far away and you cannot visit them, you can still stay in touch through computer - based communication.  Computers are also useful for checking the weather. If you are planning to go somewhere and want to know the next day's weather, you can easily find this information online. Moreover, for those who want to exercise, they can go on YouTube through their computers and follow exercise routines.  If you want to keep up with @CAPS1, you can search for relevant content on your computer. Some people may think it's not right for others to have computers, but they should try using one to discover the numerous things they can do. They will surely be amazed.  Computers are great for chatting, watching @CAPS1, and engaging in many other activities that one might not even imagine. While it may be a concern for kids to have computers, they can get one as they grow older. For school - related research, kids can also use computers effectively.  There are numerous reasons why people should own computers. In my view, the benefits they offer make them a valuable addition to our lives.
1476	1480	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I wish to convey the adverse effects of computer usage on individuals. Consider this: how would you feel if you lacked the time to exercise, enjoy nature, or spend time with loved ones? Many individuals are unaware that they are sacrificing these opportunities due to excessive computer use.  The phrase “no time to exercise” precisely describes the situation. People waste hours daily on the computer, whether playing games or chatting. As a result, they miss out on activities they truly desire, often exercise.  Regarding nature, if you're someone who appreciates it, you'll understand the problem. Time flies when people are engrossed in the computer, and they may not realize they've missed the chance to take a stroll in the forest and soak in nature. While they might say they'll do it later, they often keep postponing it, thinking it's okay.  What about spending time with family and friends? All that valuable time has been squandered on the computer. People fail to recognize that they're so consumed by it that they don't even have time to sit down and talk with family, have fun, or go out with friends to watch a movie.  As we've seen, more and more people are using computers, and I firmly believe it has a negative impact. They're losing time for essential activities like exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. The time spent on the computer is replacing these meaningful experiences, and that's not a good thing. We should find ways to reduce our computer usage.
1477	1481	1	2	Dear Local [Newspaper Name], I advocate for the use of computers as they bring significant benefits to our society. They enable us to learn about countries around the world and stay informed about global events. For instance, if one wishes to know about a country's sports scene, simply typing in the relevant name can provide the information.  Computers also play a crucial role in education. When working on a homework assignment and in need of assistance, one can turn to the computer. Moreover, they offer entertainment for students. On a cold, rainy day with nothing to do, children can have fun playing games on the computer.  In terms of communication, platforms like Facebook, [Another Social Media], Twitter, and email are excellent means to stay in touch with friends. Additionally, for those with an Xbox or a [Game Console], a computer is necessary to connect a card and play online with friends.  Computers are also valuable in schools. Teachers can use them to direct students to educational websites, and they are helpful when students are working on significant projects.  In conclusion, these are all good reasons to have computers in our society. They benefit us in numerous ways, and we should embrace their continued use.
1478	1482	1	2	Nowadays, more people prefer using computers over going outside to enjoy the weather. In my opinion, people should reduce their computer time and increase real - world interactions. Most people spend a large portion of their time chatting with others on websites or playing online games. This, I believe, is a bad habit. People of all ages engage in this behavior instead of doing something more enjoyable.  Parents should take responsibility for their children who spend all day on the computer. They need to monitor what their children are doing because it can be dangerous. There have been many cases where people have been harmed, such as being raped, on websites like [Website 1], [Website 2], and other dangerous platforms.  Many children and adults talk to strangers online, thinking they know them well. They may arrange to meet these strangers and end up in life - threatening situations because many people lie about their age. The person they think is a teen could actually be a fifty - year - old man or woman.  That's why parents should limit their children's computer use. While you're reading this, I hope you understand the wrongness of excessive computer use and take my suggestion to heart. By doing so, you can help us young kids have a safer and more fulfilling life.
1479	1483	1	2	To: [Recipient], this letter is about the role of computers in our lives. Computers have become an integral part of our daily routine. We can perform a variety of tasks on them, such as playing games, watching videos, surfing the web, and communicating with people globally.  They are extremely useful for students as they can complete and save schoolwork. While some people may be addicted to computers, others use them only when necessary.  Computers have a profound impact on people's lives. Spending all day sitting in front of a computer can be harmful, but it also offers many informative benefits. Every time we log on, we have the opportunity to learn new information.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that the positive effects of computers on people far outweigh the negative aspects. They have become an essential tool in our modern world and contribute significantly to our learning and communication.
1480	1484	1	2	Over [Percentage] of [Organization] households own at least one computer. Computers are beneficial to society as they help protect the environment and are an efficient way to spread important information. They also allow us to communicate with friends and family.  It's true that some people think we're spending too much time on computers. However, these machines are essential for our daily lives. A poll by [News Organization] revealed that more than half of [Location] schools are now using computers to assign homework, which saves paper. If we start using computers for tasks that typically require paper, we could save millions of trees. For example, sending an email instead of a traditional letter is faster and saves paper.  People concerned about the environment create websites on computers to inform others about how to [Action]. Also, if we use computers to chat with friends instead of cell phones, we can save bees. Cell phone waves kill approximately [Number] bees a year.  There have been instances where parents forget to check the school website on a snow day, and their children end up outside in the snow. Without computers, this could happen to every student during snow days. Computers also serve as a reliable source to check the weather and keep our families safe during storms.  Moreover, computers have calendars that can remind us of important events like birthdays and weddings. [Organization] citizens spend over [Amount of Money] on phone bills each year. By using computers to communicate with friends and family, we can save thousands of dollars. Parents without phones often rely on computers to stay in touch. Children can also have video chats with friends who have moved away, making it feel like they're still together.  It's time for the citizens of [Location] to recognize the benefits of computers. They help the environment, spread information quickly, and allow us to connect with others. We should write to our local newspaper to highlight these advantages.
1481	1485	1	2	To the local newspaper, approximately @PERCENT1 of the population in @LOCATION1 own computers and use them daily. As one of these users, I am puzzled by the claim that computers are ruining our country. While it's true that we may spend slightly less time with family and friends, the benefits of computers are substantial. They play a crucial role in monitoring weather and natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and earthquakes. Without this technology, over @PERCENT2 more people would perish from these disasters due to lack of warning.  In addition, computers offer us the opportunity to explore distant places, learn about the world, and communicate with others. They are also invaluable for education. Over @PERCENT3 of kids in the @CAPS2.S attend school, and computers enhance their learning experience, allowing them to gain a better understanding of the world and society.  Moreover, computers help children develop hand - eye coordination and typing skills, which are essential in adulthood. In the real world, those who lack typing skills may face limitations.  In conclusion, we need computers for three main reasons: to track natural disasters, to learn about far - off places and society, and to teach children hand - eye coordination and typing. The @CAPS2.S truly needs computers.
1482	1486	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I recognize that the use of computers is on the rise, and this trend has both positive and negative aspects. Have you ever spent hours on the computer every day? That might not be a good thing.  In my opinion, computers are a good invention, but only when used appropriately. By the end of this, I hope you'll understand my perspective.  Nowadays, almost everyone uses computers. The problem is that many people are overusing them. They claim to be improving hand - eye coordination, but in fact, they're just sitting on a chair, wasting their lives away. They communicate less with family members, which doesn't contribute to a happy family environment. Also, while they say they're getting important information, they may actually be exposed to false information and viruses. There are malicious people out there who might hack into your computer and spoil your day. Platforms like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 could have individuals trying to gather personal information to harm you. Clearly, there is a dark side to computer use.  However, there is also a bright side, as long as usage is moderated. Playing the right games on the computer can improve hand - eye coordination. It can also be an educational tool, as many websites offer accurate information about various places and things, allowing you to learn without having to visit. It's also a convenient way to shop; you can simply place an order. Most importantly, it can be a source of entertainment.  So, where do you stand on this issue? Do you think too many people are overly reliant on computers, or do you believe that computers can be great as long as you're cautious? I choose the latter. What's your choice?
1483	1487	1	2	Studies indicate that @PERCENT1 of computer - addicted individuals are unfit and do not engage in sports. I have a computer at home, and I know how enjoyable it is to chat with friends on @CAPS1. However, if you're unfit and don't appreciate nature, you won't know how to lead a fulfilling life. I'm not saying you can't achieve anything, but life will be less interesting.  I'm an avid sports enthusiast. I'm fit, and although I do enjoy chatting with friends on @CAPS1, I believe that breathing fresh air and playing sports with friends are far more important.  Computers have their pros and cons. You can learn about far - off places without traveling, but where's the fun in that? For instance, if you go snowboarding in @LOCATION1, don't you feel amazing when you're speeding down that @CAPS3? I certainly do, much more than I would sitting at home on the computer.  Nature is beautiful, and I'm grateful to God for bestowing this beauty and all the animals upon us. It makes life better and more wonderful. I love taking hikes with my family up a @CAPS3. The fresh air is unparalleled, and even riding your @CAPS5 on a trail offers a beauty that can't be found anywhere else.  Doctors have found that @PERCENT2 of people who spend more than @NUM1 hours a day on a computer wear glasses or have poor vision. These people didn't want poor eyesight, but the computer has caused this unfortunate outcome.  As you can see, computers can significantly impact your life. The choice between right and wrong is yours. Make the right decision.
1484	1488	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are highly valuable and beneficial to many people. They should be utilized for gathering information that can assist students with their homework or test preparation. Adults can also use them to look up directions, addresses, and prices of clothes and other items. Additionally, computers facilitate communication with friends and help people plan activities together.  However, some individuals need to limit their time on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Some people spend excessive time on these sites and should restrict themselves to just @NUM1 minutes a day.  One of the reasons computers are useful is that students can use them to find answers to homework questions when they're unsure. For example, if a student has a science quiz on mitosis and cells the next day and doesn't fully understand the concepts, they can use the computer to study and perform well on the quiz.  Computers are also great for communication. Some kids are shy and not very good at face - to - face interaction. Social networking sites can help them come out of their shells, become less shy, and make more friends. But as mentioned earlier, some people get carried away and spend too much time on these sites, so they should set a daily time limit.  Moreover, computers are used for important tasks such as online shopping and getting directions. If someone wants to go to a store in another town but doesn't know the location, they can look up the address and directions. People can also buy groceries and clothes online, and sometimes they can save money by taking advantage of online sales.  In conclusion, the computer has numerous positive aspects. Therefore, I encourage you to support the use of computers as they are extremely useful and valuable.
1485	1489	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I think that too many people are spending excessive time on the @ORGANIZATION1. This over - usage is causing people to gain weight and become obese. Children are neglecting their homework in favor of using the @ORGANIZATION1. There could even be a situation where a family member is ill, but someone chooses to spend time on the @ORGANIZATION1 instead of being with that loved one.  It's astonishing that over @PERCENT1 of the people in New @CAPS1 claim to be gaining a lot of weight and becoming obese. When I asked them what they thought was the cause, @PERSON1 said that computers are taking over people's lives. The computer is the enemy of those it affects the most.  As a child, the @ORGANIZATION1 is interfering with my homework. I used to get A's and B's on my report card, but now my grades have dropped to @CAPS2. The @ORGANIZATION1 is changing my life drastically, and not for the better. Your child might be going through the same terrible situation.  You should start checking your child's homework instead of letting them use the @ORGANIZATION1 and forget about their studies. I made the mistake of not focusing on my work because of the @ORGANIZATION1, and I don't want others to make the same error.  Imagine the regret of having a loved one pass away without spending time with them because of the @ORGANIZATION1. The decisions made due to the @ORGANIZATION1 can haunt you for life.  We who own computers should realize that they were not created for a completely good purpose; they distract us from spending time with family and friends.  So, say no to the @ORGANIZATION1. Don't let it ruin your life. You still have time to change. Don't you feel bad at the thought of letting something so seemingly insignificant ruin your life? Make the right choice and live your life to the fullest.
1486	1490	1	2	Dear local newspaper, the effects of computers on people are concerning as individuals tend to rely on them excessively. This over - reliance is detrimental as it leads to less time spent on exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Less time for exercise is a significant issue. According to @PERSON1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people end up struggling with obesity. Clearly, one would not want to be part of this statistic. Enjoying nature is a far better alternative to computer use. By spending time outdoors, one gets a daily dose of fresh air and has a great deal of fun, as @LOCATION1 pointed out. Interacting with family and friends is an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. As @PERSON3 said, spending time with family allows one to go to different places, and @PERSON2 noted that going out and spending time with friends on weekends is something most people love. In conclusion, the effects of computers on people are not positive, and we should strive to balance our computer use with these important aspects of life.
1487	1491	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and readers of @ORGANIZATION1, the @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, ending the use of technology such as computers would be a step back to a barbaric era. In a world without computers, tasks like getting groceries would be arduous, entertainment would be dull, and accessing learning materials would be difficult. Computers offer job opportunities, educational advantages, and a means of communication. During the economic crisis, the development and manufacturing of computers create thousands of jobs. In the @CAPS5.S alone, @NUM2 @ORGANIZATION3 jobs are created each year in line with computer development. As the @ORGANIZATION3 stated in a cover - page article, without computer technology development in @DATE2, @DATE3 more people in the @LOCATION4A would be unemployed. Computers are also essential for education. They provide an easy way to research and gather information. A group of teachers led by @PERSON3 at the @ORGANIZATION1 has implemented a program using computers, allowing students to view world cultures in videos. @PERSON2, the superintendent of schools in @LOCATION1, plans to implement this program in all @LOCATION1 schools during the @NUM3 year. Communication is another vital aspect. The internet, accessible only through computers, offers a fast way to communicate, even more so than telephones. As @CAPS13, a computer expert for @ORGANIZATION2, said, computers offer more than telephones, enabling web - chatting, file exchange, and marketing. My personal experience shows the importance of computers in communication. When my mom bought me a laptop, I could talk to my sister in @LOCATION3 again. In conclusion, computers are integral to our modern, civilized world. We should continue to use them as they provide jobs, educational opportunities, and a means of communication.
1488	1492	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers can have a negative impact on people, especially from the age of thirteen through adulthood. People often spend hours on the computer when they could be exercising or engaging in outdoor activities. Excessive computer use can make some individuals feel as if life is slipping away. Moreover, it can severely damage a person's posture. When people sit at a computer, they often enter a state of comfort, slouching with their backs bent for extended periods. To illustrate, imagine being cramped in a tight space for eight hours. When you finally get out, your joints and muscles are stretched from the tension. This is exactly what happens to our bodies when we spend long hours on computers. In conclusion, we need to be aware of the harmful effects of excessive computer use and find a balance between screen time and physical activity.
1489	1493	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am of the opinion that computers bring numerous positive benefits to society. Without them, our social lives, educational opportunities, and business operations would be severely hampered. Social interaction is an important part of life, and computers play a crucial role. Platforms like Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and Skype allow users to make new friends, reconnect with old ones, and chat daily. I use Facebook and Skype regularly. I workout and lift weights daily and still manage to use these platforms, disproving the claim that computer use reduces exercise time. Computers are also essential for education. I use them to do research for school and type up papers. My handwriting is poor, so typing on a computer ensures that my teachers can read my work. Computers also help in creating graphs and data tables for science lab reports, making them more presentable. Overall, computers are indispensable in school for research and homework. In the business world, computers are what keep operations running smoothly. They store important data such as expenses and income, and they simplify tasks that would otherwise be time - consuming or impossible to complete by hand. In conclusion, computers are an integral part of our society. They enhance our social lives, improve our education, and support business operations, and we should continue to embrace their use.
1490	1494	1	2	Dear editor, I wholeheartedly believe that computers are one of the greatest inventions for the human race. They offer a multitude of positive effects on society, including facilitating learning, improving eye - hand coordination, and enabling cost - free communication. Computers are a vital learning tool. I use them to check the weather daily, ensuring I'm dressed appropriately. On snowy nights, I check the school's website to confirm if school is on. I also use computers to access the news, with just a click of a mouse to find out election results or TV schedules. Another remarkable aspect of computers is their ability to improve eye - hand coordination. This benefits people of all ages, from my mom who checks her email frequently to my three - year - old sister who loves to play with the mouse and type on documents. This improved skill will be invaluable for her in the future when she engages in sports and other physical activities. Finally, computers enable millions of people to communicate with friends and family at no cost. Classmates can email teachers for homework, and I experienced the importance of this when my dad went to @LOCATION1. We used video - chat to stay in touch during his thirteen - day trip. In conclusion, computers offer a wide range of benefits, such as education, improved coordination, and communication. We should recognize and appreciate these positive impacts in our daily lives.
1491	1495	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I concur with the experts' view that people are spending excessive time on computers. Instead, they should engage in activities such as exercising, reading, or spending quality time with friends and family. Regrettably, many individuals are inclined to laziness and prefer to sit and use the computer. If they do not shift their focus away from constant online activity, they risk becoming overweight.  One significant reason why people should reduce their online time is the necessity for exercise. People ought to take walks around the neighborhood, visit the gym, or participate in sports rather than idly playing on the computer all day. Failure to exercise can lead to weight gain and a sedentary lifestyle.  Another important aspect is the time spent with friends and family. Ignoring them while engrossed in computer activities is impolite. People should organize family game nights, go out for meals, watch movies, go skating, or visit the park with friends. These activities are far more enjoyable than being online constantly.  Lastly, everyone should allocate time for reading. A simple trip to the local library to borrow a book can be highly beneficial. Reading is far better for the brain than engaging in mindless computer activities.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that people should spend less time online. Lack of exercise can result in weight gain and laziness, neglecting friends and family is disrespectful, and reading offers numerous cognitive benefits. Therefore, it is crucial to limit computer usage and embrace a more balanced lifestyle.
1492	1496	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 points out that humanity, like technology, has its advantages and disadvantages. Technology, in particular, has its ups and downs, yet it has propelled our society to greater heights of advancement. It provides us with the opportunity to become more sophisticated and set ambitious goals. Through technology, we initiate great undertakings.  Computers are valuable learning tools and can offer guidance. Clicking on the right link can open up amazing opportunities, while a wrong click may expose us to viruses. Moreover, computers can serve as a refuge from the stresses of life, transporting us to a pleasant virtual space and enabling us to discover new knowledge.  In conclusion, despite its drawbacks, technology, especially computers, has had a profound and largely positive impact on our society. We should continue to harness its potential while being mindful of its limitations.
1493	1497	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, are you aware that more than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 families own a computer? Additionally, at least half of that @PERCENT1 face family - related issues. The question at hand is whether computers have a positive or negative impact on humanity. In my opinion, this invention is having a negative effect on society.  One major concern is the presence of inappropriate websites. There are countless adult websites that children as young as @DATE1 access daily. No responsible parent would want their @NUM1 - year - old on such sites, and computers make it difficult for parents to prevent this.  Computers also take away valuable time from family interactions. When I had a computer, @CAPS4 was constantly on it, and we rarely spent time together. She once said that if I didn't use the computer so much, I would be more involved in daily life, and she was right. Whenever @CAPS4's brother and I were on the computer, we would stay in the room all day.  Furthermore, there have been serious issues related to @CAPS3. I was informed at the office that a group on @CAPS3.com befriended someone and was involved in using boys and girls for drugs and prostitution. People take advantage of computers to access personal information, which could have been prevented.  In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on society due to the easy access to inappropriate content for children, the loss of family time, and the potential for criminal activities facilitated by the internet. It is essential to address these issues to mitigate the negative effects of computers.
1494	1498	1	2	Dear Newspaper editor, I would like to discuss the benefits of owning a computer. Firstly, computers offer a vast amount of knowledge that one might not otherwise access. They also provide chat rooms where people can communicate with friends and others. Moreover, they simplify the teaching process.  In many countries, computers are a standard part of learning. Even in remote tribes in @LOCATION1, once people learn to use computers, it can open up new perspectives. Many individuals in such areas are unaware of significant events like the moon landing.  Computers are also useful for financial matters. They allow people to pay bills such as taxes, insurance, and credit card payments. This is especially beneficial when one cannot leave home or when the relevant offices are closed, as it helps avoid late fees and can save money.  Socializing is another area where computers excel. People use platforms like @CAPS1, Twitter, and MySpace to communicate, view pictures, and keep up with friends. On @CAPS2, messaging friends is also possible.  Gaming on computers is extremely popular. There are single - player games as well as online games with millions of players. One can also connect other gaming systems to the computer and access hints and cheats.  In the educational field, computers have revolutionized schools. For homework, students can complete assignments on the computer, print them out, or email them to teachers. They also make research for projects and homework more accessible, reliable, and provide a broader view of the topic. Teachers often use computers to teach and show videos, which makes learning easier and more engaging for students.  In conclusion, the computer is an excellent invention. It has transformed various aspects of our lives, including education, socializing, and entertainment. Every family and school should own a computer to reap these benefits.
1495	1499	1	2	Dear @PERSON2, while I found your latest article on the pros and cons of computers in society informative, I believe you overlooked some major reasons why technology, especially computers, is doing more harm than good. If people do not recognize the consequences, the future of our world is uncertain.  First, there are significant health issues associated with technology, particularly computers. Dr. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION2 has stated that since the internet became popular with the emergence of websites like '@CAPS3' and '@CAPS4', there has been a sharp increase in obesity - related heart disease and diabetes. Due to the rise of electronics, more people prefer sitting on the couch with their laptops or @CAPS5 instead of engaging in physical activities. This sedentary lifestyle puts them at risk of heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and bone problems that can lead to paralysis.  Second, although the internet may seem like a great place for socializing, it can actually lead to the loss of friends. Despite sites like '@CAPS6' claiming to help people connect, the ease of online conversation is causing people to lose their real - world social skills. Spending too much time chatting online without face - to - face meetings causes friendships to deteriorate. @PERSON4, a @NUM1 - year - old at @ORGANIZATION1, and his best friend now only communicate over @CAPS3 and no longer feel like true friends.  I have a request. The next time you turn on your laptop, think about whether it is worth sacrificing your health and friendships. When you feel the urge to update your status, consider reaching out to a friend in person instead.  In conclusion, we need to be more aware of the negative impacts of excessive computer use on our health and social lives. We should strive to find a balance between the digital world and the real world.
1496	1500	1	2	Dear local newspaper editor, while the use of computers is on the rise, not everyone views this trend positively. Those in favor of technological progress believe that computers have a beneficial impact on individuals, but there are dissenting voices among experts. In my opinion, computers do offer positive effects. They provide access to a vast amount of knowledge about the world, enable online communication, and help develop hand - eye coordination.  The ability to research any topic from anywhere in the world is a remarkable feature of computers. Search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Ask are invaluable tools. I often rely on them when working on school projects or writing papers. The internet is a reliable source for academic research and answering simple questions alike.  Online communication is another significant advantage. Platforms such as Facebook, email, MySpace, and web - caming allow us to connect with people globally. For instance, during Christmas, when my aunt in @LOCATION1 couldn't be with us, we used my cousin's webcam to see and talk to her. These platforms also let us share pictures and chat with friends and family around the world.  Playing on the computer is also a great leisure activity. There are numerous fun games, some of which allow us to compete with others globally. Internet checkers is one such example. With so many websites offering a wide range of games, it's clear that computers offer endless entertainment options.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on research, communication with loved ones, and leisure activities. I hope you share my view.
1497	1501	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are excellent. There are several compelling reasons for this stance. Firstly, they have a positive influence on people, bringing joy and enabling learning. Secondly, they help develop hand - eye coordination, a crucial life skill. Lastly, they facilitate online interaction with others.  Computers are a source of happiness and knowledge. They can make us happy and are a great way to learn. You can gain a wealth of information from them. For example, if you want to be well - informed, computers are your go - to online resource.  Hand - eye coordination is essential. Imagine wanting to play baseball without proper hand - eye coordination. You might trip on @DATE1 and get injured. However, by using computers, you can improve this skill. If you had better hand - eye coordination, you'd be less likely to fall.  Online interaction is another key benefit. You can use platforms like @CAPS1, chat rooms, gaming sources, and even try online dating. It's a great way to meet people with similar interests.  In today's world, having a computer is almost a necessity. People with jobs often use or own computers. If you don't have one, it's time to get one. In conclusion, computers are indispensable as they offer learning opportunities, help with hand - eye coordination, and allow for online socializing.
1498	1502	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I am of the opinion that excessive computer use has negative impacts on people. Although computers are not entirely bad and life might be a bit more difficult without them, the problems they bring are significant.  One major issue is addiction. Online poker, for example, is extremely addictive. I recall a show about a man who got hooked on it. He entered his credit card information and spent all day playing. Before he realized it, he was in debt. It was incredibly hard for him to stop once addicted. A recent study indicates that @PERCENT1 of online poker players become addicted within two weeks. Other games are also addictive, and many people seem unaware of the impact this addiction has on themselves and their families.  Another concern is energy consumption. Approximately @PERCENT2 of electricity in @LOCATION1 is used by computers. In the current economic crisis, it's wasteful to use so much energy on computer games when it could be used for more essential purposes. The number of computers sold has increased by @PERCENT3 since @DATE1. While I understand the need for emailing and using Facebook, we should not overdo it.  Obesity is also a consequence of excessive computer use. Many people in @LOCATION1 are obese because they sit in front of the computer all day instead of exercising. I remember when I was young, my friend's dad was always sitting at the computer playing poker and games. He became out of shape and lazy, and his parents eventually divorced.  In conclusion, if we don't control our computer use, it can lead to addiction, energy waste, and health problems. We should seriously consider whether the short - term pleasure of computer games is worth the long - term negative impacts on our lives and relationships.
1499	1503	1	2	I believe that we should have internet and computers at home. There are multiple reasons to support this view. Firstly, they allow us to communicate with friends and family. Secondly, they provide a platform for learning new things. Lastly, they offer entertainment, preventing boredom.  Communication is a vital aspect. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in our school think having a computer is beneficial. For example, when my friend moved to @LOCATION1, long - distance phone calls were not feasible, but I could talk to her on Facebook. There are numerous communication platforms like Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, and Skype. Skype, with its webcam feature, enables face - to - face conversations. My mom's friends also frequently chat with her online, regardless of age.  Learning is another advantage. There are many educational websites. @PERCENT1 of the things on the computer are valuable. Whether you're old and can't attend school or a student doing homework, the computer is a great resource. I always rely on it for my social studies homework.  Entertainment is also a plus. The variety of games on the computer ensures that you won't get bored. Many parents complain that their children are getting into trouble on the streets because they're bored. If children had computers, they could play games or chat with friends instead. States like @STATE1 and @PERSON1 have a high number of computer users.  In conclusion, having internet access and a computer at home is a great idea. It allows for communication, learning, and entertainment. I hope you'll agree that it's not a waste of time.
1500	1504	1	2	When people think of computers, games often come to mind first, but computers have far more to offer. They are incredibly useful in various aspects of our lives.  In an educational context, such as at @ORGANIZATION1, computers are a boon. They assist students with homework and projects. When assigned a project, the fastest and easiest way to conduct research is via a computer. At @ORGANIZATION2, especially for @NUM1 - graders, typing essays on a computer is quicker and more convenient. Additionally, if you forget your homework at school, you can look it up online, which is very helpful for both students and teachers.  Computers are also excellent for finding things. Technology has advanced significantly, and now we can look up directions to places we can't find. Websites like the Yellow Pages are reliable resources for finding names, numbers, or addresses. When planning a vacation and looking for accommodation, there are websites where you can find a place quickly or a nice hotel at a low price.  Computers also add fun and interest to our lives. When you visit places like the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and want to share your experiences, you can post pictures online. If you haven't talked to an old friend in a while, you can search for them on @CAPS3 or other websites and reconnect. You can also play games and interact with friends online.  In conclusion, whether it's for educational purposes, finding information, or connecting with friends, computers have everything we need. Even if they get damaged, there are people to fix them. Moreover, the resources on computers are often more up - to - date than those in books.
1501	1505	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students and staff members at @CAPS3 @CAPS4 School consider computers extremely important. Computers are beneficial not only in school but also at home. I am certain that readers of this article will concur that computers are highly useful. They educate us about distant people and things and are excellent for online chatting. Most individuals use computers daily. Computers are very helpful tools in daily life. They have a program that corrects spelling mistakes. There are also dictionary websites on computers where people can look up words. I know this is very useful because my brother is writing his college essays, and no college will be impressed by a grammatically incorrect essay. Computers also assist in quickly finding things we need, such as restaurants, the nearest malls, or even jobs. Moreover, computers can teach us about far - off places. They can show and tell us about wonderful places beyond our direct experience. Many families in normal society have gone on vacations. To find an interesting place to visit, they can search on the internet. Even if a family cannot go on a vacation, they can find cheaper and closer activities using their computer. When computers are used to find places and things around the world and nearby, they also offer teens the opportunity to chat with friends online. Many students at @CAPS3 Hallow School have a Facebook account. Most use it to talk to friends online. I also have a Facebook account and use it almost every day to talk to my cousin from @LOCATION1, whom I haven't seen since I was @NUM3. However, computers are not just for fun chatting; they can also be used for school blogs. In my language arts class, we have a reading blog that every student must participate in. This blog allows the class to discuss recently read books without wasting class time. In conclusion, computers should be taken seriously as they benefit society. They help us daily, educate us, and can be both fun and educational. Remember what @PERSON1 from the Department of Technology at @ORGANIZATION1 said: ""@CAPS5 can only improve if society accepts it."
1502	1506	1	2	"Computers can have multiple impacts on people. A large number of people spend excessive time on computers, which can affect their health and those around them. People should go outside and be more active. In America, there is an increasing obesity problem, and people often don't obtain truly useful information from computers. Some individuals mindlessly sit in front of their computers while eating. This makes the situation worse because they not only don't exercise but also gain weight. This is the opposite of what a person should do. It's true that some people exercise every day, and using the computer isn't always bad. Sometimes, you might want to find information about nature, but wouldn't it be better to go outside? Even if you don't live near a forest, your front yard is full of nature, and you can get some exercise at the same time. Families often face problems when family members have no time to talk and even punch holes in walls after losing a video game. Dr. @PERSON1, also known as ""The Studies of the Human Mind,"" says, ""I found that technology and online gaming increase anger in most people."" This shows that video games can cause problems in families everywhere. So, please make sure to spend time with your family. In conclusion, while computers can be fun, they can also be dangerous."
1503	1507	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 writers, on average, there are @NUM1 computers per household. This is excessive. I believe society spends too much time on computers. Computers are taking over our lives. Spending time on the computer drives up the electricity bill. Computers are one of the main causes of weight - related issues, and when you're on the computer, you become less engaged with society. If you spend too much time on the computer, you'll increase your electricity bill. Do you really want to spend @NUM2$ a month on electricity, or would you rather use that money to buy groceries or pay bills? ""On average, a family that uses fewer computers saves @MONEY1 compared to a family that spends more time on their computers,"" a gamer says. ""If I had known how much I could save, I would have cut down on computer use. I didn't realize how much my hobby was costing me."" @CAPS5 @CAPS3 is the root of the problem in our lives. The most significant issue with computers is that if you spend most of your time on them, you won't interact much with society and will have few real - life friends. You might have online relationships, but in real life, it's different. I think society is spending far too much time on computers. Computers cause problems such as high electricity bills, weight gain, and social isolation. So, get off that computer and engage more with the real world."
1504	1508	1	2	Computers are fun, but they also have a downside. People spend more time on computers than they do outside, exercising, or getting together with friends and family. On the other hand, they're also enjoyable, beneficial for kids, and can even help people connect through dating sites, making them happy. Computers are truly fun. They offer a wide range of games, some of which are educational and others just plain entertainment. You can play role - playing games (which I find very fun as I play a few myself), or educational games like those on certain islands or other downloadable educational games. These games, @CAPS1, are not only fun but essential for a child's growth and development. They can also teach kids various skills at an early age. Some adults also use computers for different purposes that I can't quite recall at the moment. @CAPS2, computers bring people together and make them happy. People use computers hundreds of times a day. If computers were taken away, people would feel lonely and sad. In conclusion, I believe computers are fun, help kids, and assist older people in connecting. Read this, and @CAPS3, I'm sure you'll see it from my perspective.
1505	1509	1	2	Hi, my name is @CAPS1, and I'm writing to the local newspaper to emphasize that computers are extremely beneficial for people. They help in numerous ways, such as finding directions from one place to another, learning about black history or famous people who have made an impact on the world, getting news and weather information from home or work, and maintaining businesses. Without computers, many jobs would be hopeless. For families trying to make it in life, computers are often the only way to stay in touch. Computers are everywhere; even doctors use them in hospitals to keep people alive, diagnose problems, and determine patients' backgrounds. Employers also use computers to check if a person is suitable for a job by looking at their background information. Without computers, it would be difficult to secure a good job. Here are some reasons why computers are important. Firstly, we need computers to plan our trips. If you're planning a trip for @DATE1, you can search on the computer to find the perfect destination. If you're unsure how to get there, you could use a @CAPS2, but the computer is better as it shows the distance and estimated travel time. Secondly, computers are useful for learning about black history month and famous people. While black history is in books, not many books have comprehensive information. On Google, for example, you can get more details and see images of the people, like a famous singer or rapper you might like but know little about. Thirdly, computers help us find out the news and weather. If you miss the news on TV, you can go to a news website and watch the aired programs or even your favorite shows. Fourthly, businesses rely on computers. Without them, businesses would struggle to survive. They wouldn't know their profits, and it would be impossible to manage operations effectively. There are many other reasons that prove the importance of computers, but I'll keep it short. Schools also need computers, especially for students to take tests. In conclusion, these are the reasons why we need computers and why they are so valuable.
1506	1510	1	2	I firmly believe that computers bring numerous benefits to society. With just a simple click, one can access all the necessary information. Entertainment is also readily available through internet searches. Most importantly, computers enhance communication among people. Firstly, computers make it convenient for everyone to obtain information, which is particularly useful in educational settings. For instance, students can easily gather details about the subjects in their reports. Additionally, in an emergency, one can quickly find a hospital's phone number using a computer. Secondly, computers provide easy access to various forms of entertainment, which is what a large portion of society relies on. Many individuals use computers to play games, listen to music, and watch online videos. When feeling bored, one can turn to the computer for amusement. If the room seems too quiet, music can be played. Without computers, our lives might be rather dull. Finally, and most significantly, computers improve communication. Nowadays, one can send an email to friends within seconds, share and view family photos, and use instant messaging to communicate with friends in real - time. Without computers, communication would be extremely difficult. In conclusion, computers offer easy access to information, abundant entertainment, and enhanced communication, making them highly beneficial to our lives.
1507	1511	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The computer has been a useful resource for many years, providing information and pictures. However, this does not mean people should be constantly glued to it. People can engage in face - to - face conversations or use the webcam to see loved ones, such as those in Iraq. But there is also a need for physical activity. They don't always have to leave the house; they can exercise to a fitness tape or use a treadmill. Instead of sitting idle all day, people should move around. The rise in obesity is due to a lack of exercise. So, put on your shoes and go for a jog in the neighborhood. Small activities like this can make you feel better than sitting in front of the computer. Most people are oblivious to the beauty of nature because they are constantly on their computers. This situation needs to change. The world's beautiful landmarks are being overlooked. Visit @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, or @CAPS1 to breathe in fresh air. You can go to the park and observe the birds. In conclusion, by stepping away from the computer and engaging with the real world, you can improve your health, energy, and mental state.
1508	1512	1	2	Dear Local @CAPS1, I've been informed that some claim computers prevent people from socializing, enjoying nature, and exercising. However, I believe computers benefit our lives. Firstly, computers are excellent for communication. People can use platforms like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 to talk with friends, whether they are nearby or far away, and also conduct research. Just because people use these internet sites doesn't mean they can't go outside. With the advancement of technology, more portable electronics such as @CAPS5, @CAPS6 phones, and @CAPS7 are available. For example, with the @CAPS8 created by @ORGANIZATION1, people can access the internet and music for various purposes. I once visited my grandparents while using my @CAPS6 phone to stay in touch with friends. Secondly, exercise is essential. Staying cooped up inside is not fun. People should go outside, play sports, and join activities. There are also online videos that can guide people on how to exercise or do yoga. In conclusion, people can make use of computers and electronics while still enjoying the outdoors and getting exercise, which can lead to better health and continued communication.
1509	1513	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are a great asset. They facilitate communication, create numerous job opportunities, and assist with homework. People can communicate via email, AIM, Facebook, and other platforms. There are also many jobs that rely on computers, such as court reporters, tax - retailers, and salespeople. Moreover, kids can do their homework on the computer and look up @CAPS1 - related information. In conclusion, computers are beneficial for education, work, and communication with friends and family.
1510	1514	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, In my opinion, I wholeheartedly support technological advances. These advances offer several advantages. Firstly, computers and phones help us access the information we need. We need to stay informed about our surroundings, the weather, traffic conditions, school closures, and important messages from bosses or co - workers. Secondly, we can chat with friends and family online. Even if they are on the other side of the world, we can keep in touch and ensure their well - being. I know this from personal experience as I communicate with my family and friends online. Staying connected strengthens our relationships. Thirdly, computers can improve our reading and hand - eye coordination skills. When we don't have time to go to a bookstore, we can read books online for free. Also, using a computer helps our fingers move faster and perform tasks more efficiently. In conclusion, the advances in technology are highly beneficial as they provide information, enable online communication, and enhance our skills.
1511	1515	1	2	"Dear newspaper editor, we are living in the technological age, where numerous useful devices facilitate our daily lives. The computer, in particular, is of great assistance. It enables us to communicate with relatives from different regions and access the internet to acquire new information. Moreover, we can play games with people worldwide. The computer is an excellent device. Nearly everyone has relatives living in other states or countries. Usually, we rarely see them due to the long - distance separation. However, with a computer, we can talk and even have face - to - face conversations, bringing our families closer. For instance, my family recently got a new computer. We have relatives in Florida whom we hardly ever see. Thanks to the computer, my dad talks to them almost every day. Some people I've spoken to are excited about seeing their relatives or friends more frequently, as the computer has strengthened their relationships. The internet is a wonderful resource. We can search for information for school projects and learn about various topics. When kids are working on a project and the required information is not in their textbooks, they can search the internet, which saves time. A significant percentage of kids claim that the internet is the best tool for projects. Additionally, it allows kids to work more efficiently, giving them more time to play outdoors or hang out with friends. We can also stay updated on recent events. Most local newspapers have websites, and if not, we can visit other sites like ""@CAPS3"" to access national and international news. The internet is useful in many ways and enhances our daily lives. On rainy days, when kids get bored, they can play games with people from around the world on the computer. There are numerous websites offering fun and enjoyable games. We can even make friends with people from other countries. My friends @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 play computer games and have many friends from other countries. It's exciting to play the same game as someone in @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2, and most of these games are safe and fun. We can also play with friends in our hometown. I've played games with @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 many times. It's a great way to spend a boring, rainy day. In conclusion, the computer is a useful device that benefits us in our daily lives. It allows us to connect with distant family, access new information on the internet, and play games with people globally. It's a wonderful device, and we should make more use of it."
1512	1516	1	2	Dear local news, as more and more people use computers, the question of whether computers truly benefit society has arisen. In my opinion, they do. Computers offer entertainment, easy access to daily utilities, and numerous platforms for social interaction. Here's why I believe computers are beneficial to society. First, computers provide entertainment. Many people enjoy watching funny videos or their favorite TV shows on the internet. YouTube is one of the most popular video - watching websites. Video games are also a great source of entertainment. People can either buy video games or play them on websites. Compared to traditional TV, where programs are scheduled at specific times, the computer allows us to access entertainment whenever we want. Second, computers provide access to daily utilities. The internet can provide local weather information. Instead of waiting for the local news, we can access it immediately on our computers. We can also access encyclopedias and dictionaries on websites like @CAPS5, which offer convenient and instant resources for daily use. Third, there are many social - interaction websites. For example, @CAPS6 allows us to upload pictures of people or family events and video - chat with others, enabling us to see the other person's face. This is something that phones or text - messaging can't offer. Some experts argue that computers reduce the time spent with family and friends, but websites like @CAPS6 actually increase such interaction. In conclusion, the reasons mentioned above support my view that computers benefit society. They offer entertainment, easy access to information, and platforms for social interaction. Without computers, life would be much more difficult, which is why I firmly believe that computers are a boon to society.
1513	1517	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, computers are a great benefit. They assist us in numerous ways, making our lives easier to manage. We can keep in touch with old friends and family members. It also simplifies work, and when we're bored, we can play fun games. It's really tough having family members we can't see or communicate with regularly. With a computer, we can send messages and photos to interact with them, eliminating the worry of losing contact. Moreover, we can meet new people from all over the world, regardless of their race or culture. Computers are an excellent means of interacting with others, whether they are family or friends. When we're struggling with work and have no idea where to start, we can look up information on the computer. We can learn how to do things or gain more knowledge about a particular item. When we have homework and don't know the meaning of a word, we can quickly look up its definition. Computers also serve as a storage for our information. Instead of dealing with a large number of papers, we can simply save our work on the computer and print it out when needed. This makes work more efficient and helps us organize better. Computers also offer amusement. When we have nothing to do, we can play a wide variety of fun games or watch music and funny videos to have a good laugh. There are practically endless options, so we're unlikely to get bored. As we can see, computers are a great benefit to people. They help us stay in touch, assist with work, and keep us entertained. Without computers, life would be more difficult and dull.
1514	1518	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, computers are a valuable asset in people's lives. They offer a wide range of benefits and contribute significantly to various aspects. Firstly, computers are useful for travel. They help people find ideal travel destinations. One can book a flight anywhere in the world within minutes on a computer. It would be extremely difficult to travel to far - off places without the convenience of online flight - booking. Moreover, computers help us learn about different cultures. After booking a trip to a particular destination, we can research and learn about the local customs and traditions. My family has traveled to many parts of the world, and these trips would not have been possible without the help of computers for research and flight - booking. Computers make it possible to explore new territories and are essential for travelers. Secondly, computers play a crucial role in communication and making friends. We can easily meet and befriend others using social media platforms like Facebook. Facebook simplifies the process of building friendships. For example, I wanted to get to know a student better, so I looked him up on Facebook, and now we are acquaintances. Programs like A.I.M. on the computer allow us to communicate on various topics, from homework to personal matters. Additionally, by reading someone's blog, we can start a conversation and develop a friendship. Lastly, computers improve hand - eye coordination. Typing on a computer while looking at the screen exercises our hand - eye coordination, which is beneficial for sports. In baseball, for instance, good hand - eye coordination is necessary for catching and hitting the ball. Improved hand - eye coordination also helps kids fit in, as they can participate in sports and make friends. It can even lead to job opportunities, such as writing for a newspaper or a book. In conclusion, computers are beneficial in the long run. They assist with travel, help us make friends, and improve our hand - eye coordination, enhancing our overall quality of life.
1515	1519	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that people are spending too much time on their computers and not getting enough exercise as they should daily. According to @CAPS5 @CAPS3, a certain percentage of people worldwide are spending excessive time on the computer and not enjoying nature. As a result, they don't get the same amount of exercise as others. @CAPS5 @CAPS4 states that those who go outside instead of staring at their computers will lead long and healthy lives. I claim that a significant percentage of people who are constantly on the computer often go blind and miss out on the changing world around them. I also believe that a certain percentage of people who don't spend excessive time on the computer will have a better life than those who do. My @CAPS5 advised me to use the computer, but not for long periods. Spending too much time on the computer is not good for us. We should limit our computer use to a short amount of time and only use it about @NUM1 time a week. People with @CAPS6 book accounts should also reduce their usage to @NUM1 to @NUM3 times a week. My @CAPS5 @CAPS8 says that a certain percentage of people in the world have @CAPS9 and often go blind because of excessive computer use. Additionally, if we use the computer for too long, it may overheat and break. I sincerely think that people shouldn't spend too much time on the computer because every minute spent on it is a minute missed in real life. So, please, limit your computer usage.
1516	1520	1	2	I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on individuals as they offer numerous benefits. One can send emails to friends worldwide, access essential information, and conduct business online. Computers present a wealth of fascinating content for learning and discovery. A significant number of computer users leverage this technology to stay in touch with friends. Sometimes, when your closest friends are far away, an email can bridge the distance and make them feel valued.  Another reason computers are beneficial is that they have become indispensable from middle school through college and beyond. Students often require specific information for assignments, and not all of it can be found in books. In today's digital age, computers are gradually replacing traditional books.  Moreover, computers enable those who are ill or unable to commute to work to earn an income. For instance, a new mother can use her computer to work online and support her family.  In conclusion, I am of the opinion that computers have a positive effect on people. They are used for emailing friends, obtaining important information for educational or professional purposes, and enabling remote work. In my view, computers are a valuable asset to modern society.
1517	1521	1	2	Dear editor of the @PERSON1, I am aware that you are writing a section about computers in your newspaper, and I would like to share my perspective. In my opinion, computers have a highly positive influence on people.  Firstly, computers allow us to learn about distant places from the comfort of our homes. There are numerous websites that provide information on the geography, languages, and traditions of different countries. For example, my friend @PERSON3 was planning a business trip to @LOCATION1 but had no knowledge of the local language. I recommended the website www.Indianow.com, and within two weeks, she was speaking proficiently. Similarly, my sister @PERSON4 was visiting her in - laws for the first time. They were @CAPS1, and she found a traditional recipe on the web to bake for them. The ravioli she made was a hit.  Secondly, computers are an amazing invention for students. My brother @PERSON5 was having trouble learning about the seasons, but with a simple click, he gained a wealth of knowledge. Additionally, there are now online tutors and online colleges. Professor @PERSON2 states that @PERCENT1 of passing college students are earning their degrees online.  Lastly, computers are significant for social interaction. Through video - chat, chatrooms, and social media platforms like Facebook and @CAPS2, people can make long - lasting friendships. There are also online dating sites and matchmakers. My aunt, after her divorce, was hesitant to date again. I advised her to try an online dating site, and she met a wonderful man. They have been dating for @NUM1 months, and he proposed on @DATE1. Now they are happily engaged.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are a fantastic invention. They enable us to learn about far - off places while at home, assist with schoolwork, and facilitate communication with others. I sincerely hope you will consider my opinion for your article. Thank you for your time.
1518	1522	1	2	@CAPS1, we all like computers and use them for various purposes such as chatting, working, and searching for information. However, I think computers can be quite harmful, especially if they become the center of your life.  One reason is that when you spend a long time on the computer, you tend to get hungry and reach for snacks. By the time you finish using the computer, you may have gained a pound. Imagine how much weight you could gain if you do this every day!  Another drawback is the physical strain. Prolonged computer use can cause eye pain, hand cramps, and other discomforts. Staring at the same screen and typing for extended periods can lead to eye problems and hand issues, making it difficult to use your hands for a long time.  Finally, computers can malfunction due to over - use. They may overheat or crash, and they are also vulnerable to viruses. In case of a virus infection, you may have to buy a whole new computer.  @CAPS1, as you can see, there are several reasons why I believe computers can be rather bad. We should be more cautious about our computer usage to avoid these negative effects.
1519	1523	1	2	In the @ORGANIZATION1, there has been a lot of discussion about computers. Networks such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS2 claim that computers are making people lazy and useless. However, I hold a different view. I firmly believe that technological advancements, especially in computers, are a positive development.  I have @NUM1 reasons to support my stance. Firstly, computers give people the ability to learn about far - away places and people. Instead of going to the bookstore to find information for a project, you can simply go online and look up almost anything, from general knowledge to specific details about @LOCATION1.  Secondly, computers make life better. They simplify many tasks and provide us with a more convenient way of living.  Finally, using computers can improve hand - eye coordination.  In conclusion, I am convinced that the development of computers is a good thing. Despite the negative views expressed by some, the benefits of computers in terms of learning, convenience, and skill development far outweigh the potential drawbacks.
1520	1524	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, there has been much debate among @CAPS3 about whether computers are beneficial or not. In my opinion, computers are not as great as many people assume. Since the invention of computers, people have become less physically active, fewer children are reading, and family time has been sacrificed.  Take a moment to think about when you last saw a child outside running or playing a sport. Chances are, they are inside, glued to a computer screen. Exercise is crucial for maintaining good health, yet more and more children are becoming overweight, and computers are partly to blame. I have a friend who used to spend all her time on the computer. She became extremely lazy, reluctant to exercise, and gradually gained weight. This is a widespread problem that needs to be addressed.  Regarding reading, @CAPS3 students in @NUM1 grade have a @NUM2 grade reading level. One reason is that they prefer to use their free time on the computer rather than picking up a book. Schools have implemented a program called @CAPS5 @NUM3 to improve students' reading levels. I believe that if students would turn off their computers and engage in @CAPS5, this program might not be necessary. My mom ensures that I @CAPS5 for at least @NUM4 minutes every day, and I think all students should do the same.  Family time is also being eroded by computers. The saying “family time is golden time” holds true, but nowadays, people of all ages are sacrificing family time for computer time. I last spent quality time with my family about @NUM5 weeks ago when my grandparents visited. After that, everyone went back to staring at their computer screens.  In conclusion, while computers have their uses, their negative impacts on physical activity, reading habits, and family relationships cannot be ignored. We need to find a balance and use computers in a more responsible way.
1521	1525	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I read an article about computers and concur that both kids and adults are spending insufficient time enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends. They should engage in more outdoor activities for fun. However, computers are useful for information - searching. Kids and adults need to be more active and healthy. Nowadays, kids prefer video - games over outdoor play. When I was a child, I often played hide - and - seek, but now my mother, influenced by technology, would rather be on the computer or phone. Kids globally are proficient in using computers and avoid going outside. Computers are only truly helpful when doing important tasks like reports. For instance, business people need computers, and when a teacher assigns a project, a computer is necessary for information - gathering. Moreover, many kids are not taking school seriously. They wrongly assume that computers can teach them everything, as the information on computers can be fabricated. Also, excessive computer use is making their lives unhealthy. In conclusion, computers have both positive and negative aspects. They are great for information - searching, but the fact that kids don't play outside anymore due to them is a concerning issue. Don't you agree?
1522	1526	1	2	Dear @PERSON1, even today, a large number of people use telecommunication devices such as computers. Some believe that computers have a positive impact on people, while others worry that people spend too much time on them. In my opinion, both views are valid. Although using a computer can become an addictive and unhealthy habit, it also educates users daily, is enjoyable, and helps protect the environment. I know millions of people use computers every day and would find it difficult to live without them. For example, my family has four computers, and each of us has our own reasons for using them. My mom usually uses it for work or checking emails. My sister and I use it for researching and typing homework, and for communicating with friends on Facebook. When my mom is working or my sister and I are researching, we learn. Before computers, people used books, but now with the internet, there's often no need to get a book. Usually, people either have to go out and buy a book or borrow one from the library, which is inconvenient. So, using the internet is a quick and easy alternative. People also use computers for communication, like on Facebook, @CAPS1, or email. It's fast, easy, and fun, and it saves paper, which is beneficial for the planet. We used to send letters, but now with these digital sources, that's not necessary. Computers are also fun for kids as they can play many games on them. However, there are negative aspects too. Many people use computers every day, which is bad for their physical and mental health. People can easily get addicted and spend all their time on them, neglecting activities like going outside. Lack of exercise can be harmful to physical health, and staring at a screen all day is bad for the eyes and brain. In conclusion, people should use computers for learning but also go outside and be active because excessive computer use can lead to physical and mental health problems. Thank you, and I hope you agree with my statements.
1523	1527	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, despite many people thinking that computers are bad, there are numerous reasons why they are good. Computers are environmentally friendly, and so are many people today. They allow us to type assignments and other important papers. Also, they are not the worst option on the market. While computers do take away time that people should spend on exercise, they are not the only culprit. More people spend time watching @CAPS5 than on any other activity. In @DATE1, @PERSON2, the head of @ORGANIZATION1, conducted a survey. His survey showed that out of the @NUM1 people questioned, @PERCENT2 spent @NUM2 hours a day watching @CAPS5, @PERCENT3 spent @NUM3 hours on the computer, @PERCENT4 spent @NUM4 hours reading, and @PERCENT5 spent @NUM4 hours exercising. Clearly, computers are not our biggest problem. Many people today are ""environment - conscious"". Instead of buying newspapers or magazines, most people go online to research current events. @PERSON1, @CAPS9 of the @ORGANIZATION2 says that if we use computers instead of newspapers, @PERCENT6 of the trees we cut down each year will be saved. So, computers are environmentally friendly. Today's youth is messier than ever. Teachers are having a hard time grading papers and tests because of kids' handwriting. So, kids make it easier for teachers by typing their work. Recent studies show that @PERCENT7 of teachers find it easier and better for kids to type papers. This indicates that kids are better off typing papers and assignments. In conclusion, computers are not as time - consuming as people think. They assist with research, are environmentally friendly, and help the youth in our world become neater, one click at a time. I hope you now understand my stance on computers."
1524	1528	1	2	Dear @PERSON1, I firmly believe that computers can be extremely helpful. For example, my teacher assigned my class some homework about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the @NUM1. Without the computer, I wouldn't have known anything about it. Additionally, computers can help people find long - lost family members. When my grandfather passed away, my mother found her sister using the computer. Moreover, I can learn about other states on the computer, and it can teach me many things that my mother and teacher can't. In fact, computers can teach us about a wide range of things that most people are unaware of. In conclusion, computers are a valuable source of knowledge and connection, and their benefits are undeniable.
1525	1529	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I recently researched the effects of computers on people and discovered some shocking facts. I don't think computers benefit society at all. There are three main reasons for this. Firstly, computers make people lack exercise. In @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 (a rising problem) is largely caused by computers. Statistics show that people who exercise more and spend less time on electronics live longer. Exercise is essential for life, and with the prevalence of computers, people are exercising less than ever. Exercise not only keeps us fit but also makes us happy. If people exercise instead of engaging in violent activities on the web, it will lead to a less violent future. Secondly, computers cause a lack of appreciation for nature. Nature is a wonderful place with serene lakes, the lovely smell of balsam fir, and thousands of creatures. Because of computers, thousands of kids are missing out on the fresh air and adventures that nature offers. My parents didn't have computers when they were young, and they enjoyed running around their neighborhoods and playing sports. Finally, computers reduce face - to - face interaction with friends. In the past, we used to call friends to hang out or have sleepovers, but now, thanks to computers, people can just @CAPS2 or email. You can have a conversation without even seeing the other person. In conclusion, computers lead to a lack of exercise, a failure to enjoy nature, and less interaction with friends. I sincerely hope you can help and encourage others to join me in curbing the over - use of computers. Thank you for your time, and I hope this letter has informed you of some shocking and interesting facts.
1526	1530	1	2	To @ORGANIZATION1, technological progress is rapid, and they have made numerous new inventions. They developed a computer that aids people in their work. However, a significant issue has emerged: people, especially teenagers, are spending excessive time on computers. I firmly believe this is a terrible idea. Teenagers are becoming less active, interacting less with friends and family, and @CAPS1, it poses a danger to them. Yet, many people in @MONTH1 disagree with me. There are countless teenagers and adults wasting time on computers instead of playing outdoors, enjoying nature, exercising, and having a good time.  I have a friend who used to go outside every day to play. I really miss those days. When you want to spend time with your family, you often find them glued to the computer, squandering time instead of being with you. This is not good because it disrupts family gatherings, and family members may stop visiting. It's truly sad to see families growing apart.  Moreover, there are real risks. For instance, a @NUM1 - year - old girl might meet a boy on MySpace who claims to be the same age. In reality, he could be @NUM2 years old. He might abuse or even kill her. Clearly, computers can be dangerous for kids.  In conclusion, I think having computers is a bad idea as it reduces our time in nature, with family, and exposes us to dangerous situations. People in @MONTH1 may not agree, but if it were their child in danger, how would they feel? Everyone should seriously consider the implications of computer use.
1527	1531	1	2	"No one in the world would claim that a computer is useless. In fact, computers are among the most useful devices ever created. I am convinced that computers are perfect as they can help us build skills, provide fast information, and offer entertainment.  First, let's talk about skill - building. Skills are essential for a successful career. We can acquire skills from books, TV, and computers. I learned to type rapidly on a keyboard through a computer game called ""Type to Learn"". After just a week of playing, I was typing like a professional. Additionally, chess on the computer helps develop strategic thinking. My highly intelligent English teacher, @PERSON1, says that chess builds character and strengthens the mind.  Next, computers allow us to access information instantly. Experts agree that it is the top way to obtain information when needed. I can attest to this. When studying for a test on @LOCATION1 Carver, I found a page missing from my book. Using my computer, I not only got the information quickly but also more than what the book provided. As a result, I passed my test with @NUM2 percent. This shows how useful computers can be.  Finally, computers are a great source of fun. While they are excellent for skill - building and information - gathering, they are also perfect for entertainment. There is no one in the world who can say that computers aren't fun. People all over the world use computers for online games, watching videos, and chatting with others.  In conclusion, based on these reasons of skill - building, information access, and entertainment, it's clear that computers are an invaluable part of our lives."
1528	1532	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, computers have been extremely beneficial to humanity in many ways. They can be used to look up information, communicate with family and friends, listen to music, and so on. However, I can't help but wonder if people are spending too much time on computers instead of getting exercise.  Computers are capable of almost anything we desire. But why waste time on a computer when we could be spending quality time with our families, playing sports, or enjoying fresh air?  In my view, computers have both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, they enable us to stay in touch with friends, especially when we can't see them often at school. It's a great way to catch up on the fun times we've shared.  Unfortunately, there are negative aspects as well. Many kids are bullied and picked on by others over the internet. This can lead to low self - esteem and potentially dangerous situations in the future.  Computers have also saved many lives. They help in finding cures for harmful diseases and provide information about approaching severe weather, allowing us to prepare. Undoubtedly, computers have played a huge role in our lives.  However, we should also take breaks from them and enjoy nature. In conclusion, we should have fun with technology but not forget to stay active and maintain a healthy balance in our lives.
1529	1533	1	2	Dear local Newspaper, have you ever pondered why people spend so much time on computers? The impact of computers on people is two - sided. On the one hand, they are great for communication. We can talk to people in far - off places, like those we went to @LOCATION1 with in @LOCATION1 or @CAPS1 @LOCATION1.  On the other hand, if we're constantly on the computer, we're neglecting time with our family and friends. Spending all our time on the computer makes us couch potatoes, which is very unhealthy.  For example, if a family member moves away, using a webcam to communicate is a great option. Suppose you live in @LOCATION2 and your family is in @STATE1. Sending letters and pictures is one way, but it doesn't allow them to see how you act. And on the phone, you can only hear voices.  Many people disagree, believing that computers are a waste of time. In conclusion, while computers offer certain advantages in communication, we need to be aware of the negative impacts on our social and physical well - being.
1530	1534	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 believes that people should use computers. Consider your children; as they grow up, they'll need to know how to use a computer for school and their future jobs. Additionally, computers teach hand - eye coordination, which is crucial for multitasking. Moreover, computers are fun and easy to use. I'm almost certain that you enjoy using a computer, as who doesn't?  The first reason is that computer use is essential in daily life. In a job interview, most @CAPS3 will ask about your typing speed, and you need to be proficient. At school, typing an assignment takes less time than writing it. As an @CAPS1, you use a computer every day.  Secondly, computers teach hand - eye coordination, which is similar to multitasking. You can type while talking on the phone, or even exercise while texting. Hand - eye coordination is a vital life skill. In a library, you need to find a book while talking to people. When driving a car, you must multitask by operating the brake, gas, and keeping an eye on the road.  Finally, computers are fun and easy to use. When I was @NUM1, I started using a computer and loved playing games. I wasn't good at typing at first, but I quickly learned because it was fun. Just like learning math, if you have fun while learning, it becomes easier.  In conclusion, it's high time people learned to use computers. They offer the opportunity to gain skills, have fun, and be more efficient. We need computers in our daily lives, and we should look past the unfounded concerns about them. Everyone should embrace computer use for a better future.
1531	1535	1	2	In my view, computers are highly useful. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, when kids are grounded, they can still talk to their friends on the computer. For example, on @DATE1, I was grounded for slapping my cousin in the face, yet I managed to talk to my friends. To deceive my parents, I just said I was asking my friend about homework. Secondly, when people are bored, they can turn to the computer. For instance, if a kid has completed all his games and is bored, he can search for new ones to buy, rent, or play downloadable computer games. Lastly, if someone needs to look up information for a project and the library is closed, they can simply obtain the necessary details on the computer. In conclusion, computers are essential for our lives. Without them, we would still be in a primitive state.
1532	1536	1	2	"Some individuals dislike computers for immediate reasons, while others are overly fond of them. I like computers, but I'm not obsessed with them. Computers can have a positive impact on people, including me. You can learn from them and develop good hand - eye coordination. One of the things I appreciate about computers is the ability to ""talk"" to others. However, many people use computers excessively, to the extent that they don't exercise, observe nature as much as they should, and don't spend enough time with their families. I prefer to spend only #@NUM1 (three) hours on the computer each day so that I can engage in other activities. I believe everyone should follow this example. In conclusion, while computers are beneficial, we should use them in moderation."
1533	1537	1	2	In my opinion, it's a great idea for people to use computers. If you haven't seen someone for years, the computer gives you a chance to see or talk to that person. Also, when you have a school project, you can get excellent information based on the project's requirements. I enjoy using the computer to talk to friends I haven't seen in a while, and you can even meet new people and make friends. Without computers, we'd have to search through numerous books for information or travel to the bank to check our account balance. On the computer, you can find workout routines to get fit, so you don't always have to go to the gym. My dad uses the computer to talk to his sisters or play games with people around the world, and my mom talks to her family in @LOCATION1 and other places. Without computers, we couldn't take tests or access information. They're also useful for paying bills. We can interact with friends and family online, especially on rainy or snowy days when we can't meet them in person. Some people think it's not a good idea because of computer addiction, but there's so much to do on the computer that you won't get bored. In conclusion, computers are a great and very important invention.
1534	1538	1	2	Nowadays, a large number of people use computers. However, not everyone believes that computers benefit society. In fact, computers are incredibly versatile. You can conduct research, play games, and most importantly, enjoy a great deal of freedom. Have you ever been assigned a school project but couldn't find the information you needed in books? The internet can solve this problem. Many computers are connected to the internet, where you can find almost anything. If you're looking for facts for a science project, just use your favorite search engine to search for your topic, and you'll get endless pages of information. Even when you're not doing schoolwork, the internet can provide answers. Forgot the number of your favorite football player? Search his name, and it'll appear on your screen. Curious about why the @CAPS1 won the @CAPS2 @CAPS3? The possibilities are endless. Even if your computer isn't connected to the internet, you can still play games, which is a great hobby. And if it is connected, you can play with people worldwide. There are various types of computer games, such as adventure games, shooting games, and multi - player games. You can even play poker. The best part of using a computer is the freedom it offers. You can go online, play games, talk to people, and customize your computer according to your preferences. For example, you can set a picture of your cat as your desktop background or change your cursor. In conclusion, computers offer endless possibilities for learning, playing, and having fun, but we should also balance computer use with other activities.
1535	1539	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, based on my personal experience, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. Many people enjoy using computers because modern technology enables us to accomplish numerous tasks more quickly. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have a computer at home, and I'm one of them. I find it extremely useful as I can get most things done in a short time. Computers have a positive effect as you can do almost anything with them. For example, I have family in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1, and @LOCATION4. Instead of making phone calls, I can video - chat with them, which makes me feel as if I'm right there with them. Moreover, you can pay bills online, avoiding the hassle of sending letters by mail, waiting for delivery, and buying expensive stamps. Most college students use computers for their homework. They type essays and save research materials for later note - taking. In essence, computers have become an integral part of everyone's life. They can be entertaining, fun, and useful for important tasks. Computers are a part of every teenager's daily routine. We can interact with friends, listen to music, and connect with family and relatives we don't usually contact, all on one device. Some people even pursue degrees through online education. Computers are so important that they can scan my test and give me a score. I hope you now agree with me that computers have had and will always have a positive effect on people. Thank you for considering my opinion.
1536	1540	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a significant impact on people. In my view, computers make kids lazy and inactive. When kids have access to a computer, they tend to just sit around and do nothing. You must be familiar with websites like MySpace, Facebook, and Formspring. These platforms entice people to stay on the computer instead of engaging in exercise and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  I understand that kids today want to stay connected with their friends. If the phone isn't an option, the computer becomes the go - to. Moreover, getting rid of excessive computer use can prevent homosexuals from approaching kids by pretending to be of their age.  I'll admit that computers can be useful, but spending the whole day on them is absurd. I have a [NUM1] - year - old brother who stays on the computer from the moment he wakes up until he goes to sleep. Compared to me, he's neither fit nor healthy, and it's the countless hours on the computer that have caused this. In fact, he's so active on MySpace that he has over [NUM2] friends, and he doesn't even know half of them. He even gives out his phone number and home address.  Don't you notice that many kids these days would rather waste time on the computer than go outside? I've always loved football, but I can rarely find the time to play with my brother because he's always on the computer. All he seems to care about are girls and the computer.  I'm not suggesting that we take away computers from people's homes, but we should limit the daily hours spent on them. Time is something that money can't buy. Some kids will look back on these days and regret the time they wasted on nothing. In short, life is precious, so don't waste it all on unproductive computer use.
1537	1541	1	2	Dear Newspaper, people are devoting an excessive amount of time to computers. Instead, they could be outdoors, enjoying nature, participating in sports, or traveling. Some claim that one can learn about animals and plants on a computer, but there's no substitute for the real - life experience of being among them.  Individuals who engage in hiking and truly savor the outdoors are [PERCENT1] smarter than those who don't. I prefer being outside and have straight A's. Sports are an excellent way to get outside. My favorite sport is baseball, and I'm quite good at it.  Some sources suggest that computers can enhance hand - eye coordination, but how can a computer achieve that? It's sports that truly help with hand - eye coordination. Playing sports also helps build strength. Thanks to baseball, I can bench press [NUM1] pounds. [PERCENT2] of kids who play sports aren't overweight, while [PERCENT3] of non - sports - playing kids are.  Traveling is another great way to be outside. I'm passionate about traveling. I'm fluent in English, French, and Spanish. My favorite destination is northern [CAPS1] in [LOCATION1]. Computers can show pictures of a place, but being there in person is truly captivating. A computer picture can't compare to the real experience. You can't walk on a computer, drink water from a stream, or climb a cliff.  In conclusion, computers are no match for real life and nature. We should spend more time outside, enjoying nature, playing sports, and traveling the world. Thank you for your time.
1538	1542	1	2	Dear Newspaper, the invention of computers has brought about numerous advancements. In the past, when working on school projects, one might have been bored, sitting in front of the TV or waiting in a doctor's office. Now, those days are gone.  Previously, the only way to research a country was to search through papers. With computer advancements, simply enter a country's name into Google, and you'll find [NUM1] pieces of information. In fact, [PERSON1], an expert on computers and the inventor of one of the world's most advanced computers, states that searching for information has become [PERCENT1] to [PERCENT2] easier, depending on the topic.  Typing has also become much more efficient. Instead of using a typewriter, which often led to mistakes that required re - typing, you can use [ORGANIZATION1]. When typing an essay, any misspelled words are underlined in red, minimizing spelling errors. From a learning perspective, this increase in knowledge shows that computers are extremely beneficial for mankind.  Secondly, computers are highly entertaining. On a new laptop, you can visit gaming websites like Miniclip or Addicting Games. These games are not only fun but also improve hand - eye coordination, which is useful for sports, driving, and writing. More advanced gaming computers, known as consoles such as the [CAPS2] - box [NUM2] by [ORGANIZATION1], the [NUM3], and the [CAPS3] by [CAPS4], offer an extreme gaming experience. One of the recent games for these consoles is [CAPS5] of [CAPS6]: Modern [CAPS7] [NUM4]. It has an online system that allows you to interact and play against people worldwide. Moreover, advanced games like [CAPS5] of [CAPS6] can improve eyesight. Studies indicate that playing a high - action game for [NUM4] hours a day can enhance eyesight more than eating [NUM6] servings of carrots.  Finally, computers eliminate boring waits. If you've ever been to [CAPS10], you know the line can be [NUM4] hours long. People used to just stand there waiting. Now, they can pull out their [CAPS11] or [NUM8] player to listen to music. The [CAPS11] can take videos and pictures, play music, videos, and games. If you're lucky enough to have an iTouch, you can check email, stocks, weather, and news right on your [CAPS13] and buy songs at a price [NUM9] cheaper than [CAPS14].  In conclusion, these technological advantages benefit us greatly. We can learn new things, have fun while improving our eyesight, and avoid long, boring waits.
1539	1543	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that while some people use computers appropriately, others are over - reliant on them. Some individuals use computers to check on the well - being of family members. They might want to know if a parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or a close friend is okay. People also use computers for financial matters. They can access their bank accounts to withdraw money, send money to family, or pay bills.  However, I also think that many people, especially kids, are spending too much time on computers. Kids often use computers just to play games. This isn't good for them because they may become so attached to the computer that they don't want to leave it. Parents then face the difficult task of getting their kids to eat or go to sleep.  I think people should go outside, exercise, and enjoy nature. I'm confident that if people do so, they'll not only improve their physical health but also strengthen their family bonds.  In conclusion, while computers have their uses, we should strike a balance and not let them consume all our time. We should make more time for our loved ones, exercise, and enjoy the beauty of the outdoors. Thank you, Local Newspaper.
1540	1544	1	2	People are spending far too much time on the computer. Many individuals are on the computer for almost the entire day. Instead, they should be spending quality time with family and friends and engaging in various activities.  First of all, people need to prioritize time with family and friends over computer use. For instance, if your parent asks you to go out for dinner and you decline because you're on the computer, it shows an obsession. Many families are being torn apart due to excessive computer time. If a friend comes over and says they're bored while you're just playing games on the computer, it's rude. You should get off the computer and spend time with them.  Secondly, people need to do more activities. A lot of people sit on the computer and eat, which leads to weight gain over time. If you're gaining weight because of computer use, you should do some activities to shed the extra fat. If you're a teen and you reject the idea of playing a sport because the computer is more important, it indicates a serious computer addiction.  The computer should be used wisely. It's meant for communicating with family and friends, doing homework, conducting research, working, and playing a few small games when you're bored. These are the most important functions of the computer. For example, if you have vocabulary homework and need definitions, you can go to www.dictionary.com.  In conclusion, people are spending too much time on the computer. They should spend more time with family and friends, engage in more activities, and use the computer only for useful purposes like homework and important research. Clearly, humans are spending too much time on the computer instead of focusing on more important aspects of life.
1541	1545	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, I am aware that many people claim that individuals spend excessive time on computers and do not get enough exercise. However, I believe that there are numerous people using computers and getting sufficient use out of them. In the following paragraphs, I will explain the reasons. First, it is beneficial that people are interested in computers and engage with them. This broadens their learning activities, enables them to acquire new knowledge, and contributes to their success in life. People play games, solve crossword puzzles, and riddles, among other things. Some also use the internet to find ingredients, car parts, etc. Second, the use of computers is highly advantageous to humanity. It has an impact on students' schooling, as well as that of parents, guardians, and teenagers. Many schools currently utilize computers, especially for students to complete their tasks. It also affects parents, as it helps them succeed in life and find employment. Finally, people are getting enough exercise as they go to bed, eat, attend school, go to work, or engage in activities that involve walking during the day. Nowadays, no one simply sits at home doing nothing. There is always something to do or somewhere to go. I hope you will consider what I have shared and take it into account. Thank you for your time. Remember, your work can also be accomplished on a computer.
1542	1546	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, computers are used worldwide for various reasons, and they are essential in our modern world. This is why computers have a positive impact on people today. They facilitate our communication with distant family members. Children rely on them for studying and completing homework, while adults need them for work, such as sending emails or typing proposals. Take me as an example. Many kids, like me, have family members living across the ocean or in different parts of the country. Contacting them can be challenging. In most cases, making phone calls can be costly, and sending letters takes a long time to reach the recipients. With email, messages can be sent quickly and for free, and conversations can be easily conducted. Additionally, platforms like Skype or using a webcam are effective ways to connect with family. You can see your loved ones from miles away in the comfort of your own home. Computers are also beneficial for children. I often have homework that requires the use of a computer, such as typing up a final draft of a paper or taking notes on a historical figure. While books can be used to gather information, they cannot type up papers. Kids and teenagers can also use computers for studying. I frequently use a website with worksheets and flashcards to practice Spanish. Moreover, computers assist adults. Many business - men and women in @LOCATION1 and other countries rely on computers for sending emails, typing proposals, etc. Without a computer, these tasks would be extremely difficult. My father, an electrician, has to send out emails and documents about his projects several times a week. In our daily lives, we also use computers for activities like ordering clothes and toys, and the most popular use is filing taxes online. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 complete their taxes online because it is quicker and easier. In conclusion, it is not just my opinion but a fact that computers have a positive impact on people of our age. They help us stay connected with distant relatives, support children's education, and aid adults in their jobs and daily lives. They are not only helpful but also necessary, and I hope you agree with me.
1543	1547	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I am writing this letter on a computer. I believe that only those who do not own computers have the right to claim that people spend too much time online instead of exercising. I have three main points to make: computers teach hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn, and allow for communication. First, computers are not just for entertainment. They can teach hand - eye coordination. For instance, they can teach you how to type without looking at the keyboard and offer typing lessons. Second, computers give people the ability to learn about other cultures or specific locations. @PERCENT1 of the American population is online for learning, and @PERCENT2 is online for work. Even for young children, parents can buy them educational online games. Finally, computers allow people to communicate with others. If there is a school closing or delay, you can find out through the computer. People can also use it to keep track of what is happening around the world or check the weather. These are the reasons why I firmly believe that people should be online at least twice a week.
1544	1548	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I think @CAPS2 have a positive impact on people. You can play games, have web - chats, and watch funny videos on computers. Moreover, you can use them for research projects or to find facts about @CAPS3 people like @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and @LOCATION1. I don't understand why anyone would want to leave their @CAPS2 to exercise. Exercising is so dull and unappealing. Also, enjoying nature is not that great. Walking through the woods is boring, with mud underfoot, ticks all over your body, and mosquitoes biting you when you sweat. As kids grow older, they prefer to spend time with friends rather than family and often use technology. They text on their cellphones when they don't feel like calling. Computers also improve hand - eye coordination. They teach you how to type without looking at the keyboard and how to place your fingers on the home row. Finally, @CAPS2 truly benefit society. They are used in middle school, high school, and college. As you get older, you will learn more about this technology. Kids can even teach their parents how to use computers, which is a great responsibility. In conclusion, @CAPS2 are very useful and have a significant positive impact on people.
1545	1549	1	2	To whom it may concern, almost everyone has a computer. Computers make it easier to find specific places using search engines like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, and they are also a means of communication. I believe that the use of computers benefits society. Scientists rely on computers daily to plan space missions or monitor experiments. Computers also help people stay organized. Many teenagers and children use computers for shopping and staying in touch with friends. Some people think that people spend too much time on computers. While this may be true, we should also consider the benefits they bring to society. The decision to spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends is a personal one. People are not being forced by @ORGANIZATION1 to use computers. In conclusion, despite the concerns about excessive computer use, the overall impact of computers on society is positive.
1546	1550	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, I am well - aware that computers are becoming an essential part of people's daily lives, and I firmly believe this is a positive development. When using a computer, typing enhances hand - eye coordination. Additionally, it offers opportunities to learn about people, places, and cultures, and enables online communication with friends and the chance to meet new people.  Take my cousin @PERSON3, a passionate baseball player. In his younger days, he struggled with catching the ball. Despite numerous attempts, he never gave up. For his birthday, his parents gifted him a computer. Initially, he was not proficient at typing papers. However, by practicing both baseball and typing, he significantly improved. This not only advanced his baseball career but also boosted his school grades.   @PERSON3 is not an isolated case. A recent study from Yale College indicates that @PERCENT1 of individuals who use the computer for at least a month develop some level of hand - eye coordination. @PERSON1, a high - school computer teacher, says, ""@CAPS1 freshmen in my class tell me that computers have made their sports careers easier due to better hand - eye coordination."" Computers offer a dual benefit of learning to type and enhancing hand - eye coordination. Can we afford to deny this positive aspect to @CAPS3?  Computers also facilitate learning about people, places, and cultures. I learned about an earthquake at @ORGANIZATION2 and a power - plant explosion in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 from the front page of @CAPS2.com. I'm not alone in gaining such knowledge. @ORGANIZATION1 conducted a poll, and @PERCENT2 of @CAPS3 reported using the computer for research. Should we deprive @CAPS3 of knowledge about the world and history?  Finally, computers enable communication with friends and relatives. My cousin @PERSON4 found me on Facebook after eight years, and now we talk regularly about family and future visits. Studies show that @PERCENT3 of @CAPS3 aged 11 - 18 communicate with friends on Facebook daily. Dr. @PERSON2, a teen psychiatrist, believes it's a great way for @CAPS3 to interact.  In conclusion, computers are invaluable. They improve hand - eye coordination, expand knowledge, and enable communication. We should embrace their use for the betterment of @CAPS3 and society as a whole."
1547	1551	1	2	I understand that there are debates about whether computers should be used, but I firmly believe that people need computers as they are highly important. Computers can search information rapidly and facilitate communication.  Many people have computers at home because they are necessary. Sometimes, it may take minutes to understand a single word, but with a computer, the information can be found in an instant. This is why we should continue to rely on computers. It is especially crucial for @CAPS1, as they may encounter things they don't understand and can quickly look them up on the computer. For example, when we have homework about an important person, it is much easier to learn about them using a computer.  Some people don't have a computer at home and have to go out to access information, which is inconvenient. While we should also spend time with our families, we can't ignore the need for computers. Some people use computers to play games, but more importantly, they are used for homework and work. Many jobs require the use of computers. For instance, if someone wants to be a police officer, they have a small computer in their car to search for information, which is essential for their work.  I know that family time is important, but we also need to consider our future. Computers can help us a great deal, and we need them for a better future. This is my opinion, and I hope you can agree with me.
1548	1552	1	2	Dear local newspaper, as the local media, you have the power to express your views on the impact of computers on people. In my opinion, computers bring numerous benefits, including improving hand - eye coordination, enabling people to learn about distant places, and facilitating communication with others. In fact, @PERCENT1 of people share my positive view on computers.  Using computers can enhance hand - eye coordination. My grandmother once told me that through typing and researching on the computer all day, she has improved her ability to use her hands and eyes in a coordinated way. A recent study from Yale College also shows that @PERCENT1 of people who use the computer for at least a month gain some level of hand - eye coordination. @PERSON1, a high - school computer teacher, has also heard from @CAPS1 freshmen in his class that computers have made their sports careers easier due to better hand - eye coordination.  Computers are a rich source of information about distant places and cultures. I learned about an earthquake at @ORGANIZATION2 and a power - plant explosion in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 from @CAPS2.com. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 said that he uses computers for work as it helps him learn new things and plan trips with his wife. Although some people claim that computers sometimes provide incorrect information, a reliable website will always offer accurate data.  Computers also allow people to communicate with friends and family around the world through online chatting or video calls. If you haven't seen your relatives for a long time and can't afford to visit them, video chat is a great alternative. It has brought people closer and changed the way we view the world. Instead of using up all your cell - phone minutes, it's more cost - effective to buy a computer or laptop with a camera for video chatting.  In conclusion, computers offer great benefits. They improve hand - eye coordination, help us research distant places, and enable us to stay in touch with family and friends online. I hope you can spread the word that computers are useful and that people can use them without any problems every day. By advocating for the positive aspects of computer use, you can bring smiles to people's faces and help them realize that spending time on the computer can be a valuable learning experience.
1549	1553	1	2	Have you ever wondered how a computer is made and how each small part is installed? Unfortunately, I don't have the answers to these questions. But I do have another question for you: Are computers bad for you? I firmly believe they aren't. Computers teach us hand - eye coordination, allow us to learn about unknown places and people, and enable us to communicate with distant relatives and friends.  Regarding hand - eye coordination, it's similar to learning to catch a ball. At first, people may not be good at typing on a computer, but with practice, they will become faster. This improvement in typing skills can also benefit us in school and at work.  Computers are a great source of knowledge about different places and cultures. For example, some people may not know about the waterfalls, trails, or local cuisine in @ORGANIZATION1. Others may be unaware that belly - dancing originated from @LOCATION1 or that the concept of the big dragon comes from @LOCATION2. The computer is an excellent tool to quickly learn such information, especially for elderly people in wheelchairs who may have limited mobility.  Moreover, computers make it easy to communicate with distant relatives and friends. Suppose a father is on a business trip abroad. Instead of relying solely on phone calls or letters, video - chatting on a computer can bring the family closer. It's wonderful to see how much relatives have changed and to stay connected with them.  In conclusion, computers offer multiple benefits. They enhance our physical abilities, expand our knowledge, and strengthen our social connections. I hope you'll agree with me on the positive impact of computers and make the most of this valuable technology.
1550	1554	1	2	Dear local newspaper, there is a view among some that not everyone agrees on the benefits of computers to society. However, in my opinion, computers are highly beneficial to society.  Firstly, there are numerous websites that can assist in finding information. When working on a project or needing to look up details, the internet, like Google.com, provides a vast amount of information on almost any topic. For teenagers without a driver's license and no one to take them to the library, computers ensure they can submit reports or projects on time. There are also websites like Mapquest.com that offer directions.  Secondly, computers make work easier for people. They can be used to communicate with colleagues and complete tasks efficiently. If a family member lives far away and phone bills are a concern, computers, through various communication platforms, help maintain contact. There are also websites that allow people to keep in touch with old friends. For soldiers in wars who can't use phones easily and sending letters takes a long time, computers are one of the few ways to talk to their relatives.  Thirdly, companies benefit greatly from computers. New companies can place ads on popular websites like yahoo.com to reach millions of people. They can also create flyers quickly and easily on computers. Manually making a hundred flyers can take hours, but on a computer, one template can be used to print multiple copies.  In conclusion, computers are a valuable asset to society. They enable people to easily find information, communicate effectively, and help companies attract business. These are just some of the reasons why computers are good for society, and their importance will only continue to grow in the future.
1551	1555	1	2	Computers have a wide range of uses, yet some individuals employ them for illegal activities. Certain music websites are illegal, and people may also obtain unauthorized content from the internet. Meeting people online can be perilous as some may lie about their age or use fake photos. In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, users must be vigilant to avoid engaging in illegal behavior and protect themselves from potential online risks.
1552	1556	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, computers have become integral to society, but I believe the excessive time many adults and children spend on them is detrimental. Instead of being glued to the computer, people should focus on more meaningful activities. Spending time with family is crucial; it allows us to learn more about them and strengthen our bonds. For example, teenagers often come home from school and immediately turn to the computer, missing out on the opportunity to communicate with their parents. Nature is also a precious resource. Although we can view nature pictures online, experiencing it firsthand through outdoor activities like walking, running, or hiking is far more rewarding and beneficial for our health. Moreover, schoolwork, jobs, and studying are essential aspects of life that should not be neglected in favor of computer use. In summary, while computers have their place, we should prioritize family, nature, and real - world responsibilities to lead a more fulfilling life.
1553	1557	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I'm appalled by the sight of tired, lazy people wasting their lives on the computer. The question at hand is whether people are spending too much time on it, and I firmly believe they are. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, excessive computer use leads to less exercise. People who sit at home on the computer all day are likely to gain weight and become lethargic, which can even lead to depression. For instance, a local resident's mother became depressed and committed suicide after spending excessive time on the computer. Secondly, many people miss out on enjoying nature. On a sunny day, some individuals stay indoors, glued to their computer screens. Another local resident described how his mother would sit in a dark room for hours on the computer, rarely going outside. Finally, computer use reduces the time people spend interacting with family and friends. A family member of mine, who was a “computer junkie,” often missed family gatherings. If this trend continues, more and more people will face these negative consequences. In conclusion, we need to raise awareness about the dangers of excessive computer use and encourage people to lead a more balanced life.
1554	1558	1	2	In the @LOCATION3, @PERCENT1 of all people own computers, indicating the widespread enjoyment of this technological advancement. Computers have a highly positive impact on us. They enhance communication; for example, if you want to talk to a friend in @LOCATION1, you can use a social networking site, and if you have relatives across the country, a webcam can facilitate communication. This global connectivity allows us to learn about different cultures and ways of life, strengthening relationships. The internet is a vast source of information. With search engines, we can find answers to various questions, from the height of a maple tree to weight - loss methods. Even if some claim that sedentary learning is bad, we can search for family activities, nature walks, and new exercises. Students can also use the internet for school projects instead of going to the library, making people smarter. Additionally, computers alleviate boredom. Kids and adults can play games, watch TV shows and movies, and conduct business. If you miss your favorite TV show, you can watch it online, and e - mail makes letter - sending faster. Moreover, online games improve eye - hand coordination. In conclusion, the benefits of computers in terms of communication, information access, and entertainment contribute to a happier and better world.
1555	1559	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I'm @PERSON1, and I'm going to discuss the positives and negatives of computers. On the positive side, the internet is a vast repository of knowledge, accessible at our fingertips. It answers the most complex questions, and using a keyboard and mouse, we can easily learn how to navigate it. Over the years, computers have evolved, and there are popular chatting websites like @CAPS3, Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr, which seem really cool. However, the internet also has a dark side. There have been reports in the news of teenagers committing suicide. Girls may do so due to a lack of [relevant factor], and boys for similar reasons. In our world, people are often judged by their [appearance or other criteria]. In conclusion, computers have both good and bad aspects, and we must be cautious and responsible in our use of them.
1556	1560	1	2	"Dear newspaper, do you want people to be so engrossed in computers that they miss out on the world around them? Do you want the kids in @LOCATION1 to spend hours each day on computers playing games when they could be outside breathing fresh air? The question then is whether computers have good or bad effects on people. The obvious answer is that they have a bad effect. People's constant use of computers teaches them bad habits and enables them to search for inappropriate things. If people are always playing games on computers, then when will they go out for a jog? The answer is never. People who are constantly on the computer do not get enough exercise. One reason why many people in @LOCATION1 are obese is that they do not get enough exercise. Computers are not helping this situation at all. Some people say, ""I'll just spend an hour on the computer and then I'll go work out."" But that one hour on the computer turns into two hours, and then two hours turns into three. Before you know it, you've wasted the whole day on the computer and haven't exercised at all. Also, there are so many really engaging games on the computer that you don't want to stop playing them. Yes, some games can be very entertaining, but you don't have to spend all day playing them. You can play a fun game for fifteen minutes and then go outside for some fresh air. As you can see, computers can mesmerize people so much that they do not get enough exercise. Second, people develop bad habits. For example, kids are always on websites where they can talk to their friends. The problem is that people use informal language too much on the computer and get too used to writing like that. Then, kids start doing that when writing in school, and most don't even realize it. Also, there are new websites where you can post personal information about yourself. This makes it easy for strangers to learn about you. Lastly, it is very easy for people, even children, to search for inappropriate things. Everything is on the internet, and little kids are going to be very curious about it. They can search for inappropriate words and pictures, and no one will ever know. People can post inappropriate information for others to see, and it can be impossible to take it back. And if parents don't know that their children are searching for inappropriate things, then the kids will keep doing it because they know they won't get caught. So, as you can see, computers have a very negative effect on people. They make it easy for individuals to access inappropriate things. So, go and limit the time you spend on the computer."
1557	1561	1	2	Dear Local @CAPS1, what are your thoughts on computers? Are they beneficial or detrimental? I firmly believe that computers are bad, and people spend too much time on them. I would much rather spend time outdoors where I can exercise. Wouldn't you? Computers are a waste of time, and they prevent family and friends from spending quality time together. Moreover, computers can be extremely dangerous. People could be lying, and you wouldn't know it. To begin with, computers detract from exercise and outdoor activities. I know that if I had to choose between staring at a dull computer screen all day and going for a run, I would choose the run every time. Computers do not keep people fit and healthy, so they should find alternative activities. I have noticed that the average teen spends @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours a day on the computer. That is @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours that could be spent exercising or playing outside. For instance, they could walk the dog or play soccer. You see, there are numerous activities one can engage in other than using the computer. Furthermore, computers reduce the quality time spent with friends and family. I understand that you can video chat and instant message them, but wouldn't you rather spend time with them in person? Too many kids are so engrossed in the computer that they are unaware of what is happening in their parents' lives. There are many things kids can do with their friends and families instead of using the computer. They could play a board game, watch a movie, and so on. I guarantee that they will enjoy these activities more than staring at a computer screen for @NUM5 hours. Finally, computers are extremely dangerous. People have lost their lives because they did not know who they were talking to. Kids post pictures and messages on MySpace, but they do not realize that everyone can see what they have said. Once something is posted, it cannot be taken back. It is also dangerous because when someone applies to a school, the school can see what they have posted and may reject their application. I hope you agree with me when I say that computers are bad. They prevent people from exercising, spending time with friends and family, and are very dangerous. In my opinion, we should eliminate computers from every household.
1558	1562	1	2	In the modern world, computers hold significant importance. Nowadays, computers are a ubiquitous technology. Initially, the invention of computers was like a large - scale calculator. They are now like an essential part present in every home. Many people own different types of computers, and these devices are becoming more advanced, faster, and of higher quality. Computers are continuously evolving in terms of technology. Every day, billions of people around the world purchase computers. However, this does not necessarily mean that all these computers are of the best quality. People are constantly in pursuit of better and more modern computer inventions. In conclusion, the development and widespread use of computers reflect their growing significance in our lives, and the competition for better models drives the continuous improvement of this technology.
1559	1563	1	2	Computers are one of the daily tools we use and interact with. Some experts are worried that people are spending too much time indulging in the allure of computers. I love computers, but as a teen, I understand the importance of managing computer time. You can't just sit there and waste your time on the computer. The time wasted on the computer could be spent having fun outside. There are so many things you can do outdoors! For example, you can play ball, run around, go to the park, or go exploring. Friends and family are really great to be with. I have a lot of friends, and I love them all. If you have some free time, you should hang out with them and have a good time. You could go to the mall! I always choose to go to the mall with my friends instead of playing on the computer for hours. So, get off the computer and go out! Have some fun in the sun today. In conclusion, while computers have their appeal, we should not let them consume all our time and miss out on the joys of the real world.
1560	1564	1	2	I disagree with what some people say about computers. Of course, they can teach hand - eye coordination, but they are not beneficial enough for people. Let me share my thoughts with those who believe that computers have a positive impact on people. People are becoming so overweight! Wonder why? It's because they spend too much time on computers and too little time exercising. In @LOCATION1, @PERCENT1 of the population is obese. And some people die each year due to being overweight. Think about it this way: baseball players and other athletes can earn about @NUM1 to @MONEY1 a year. Don't you want to be wealthy like them? Isn't nature wonderful when you experience it? I think so, and people don't think before cutting down trees. Think about the animals. Don't you think they suffer enough every year? Computers are a bad influence on people because people need to experience life instead of sitting lazily behind a desk or at home. Social media sites like MySpace and Facebook are not good. There are sexual predators all over the world who target kids and teenagers. You should not interact with friends on the internet for this reason. You should exercise at the park with your friends and family. Also, it's better to talk to new friends in person because you can get to know them better as you grow up. There are many reasons why computers are bad and sometimes even worse. Don't use computers for foolish reasons, or you might put yourself in danger. It can make you so lethargic that you won't be able to walk. People should keep these things in mind. In conclusion, computers have numerous negative aspects, and we should be cautious about our computer use to avoid the associated risks.
1561	1565	1	2	The computer has significantly benefited our planet. It restricts unnecessary car - driving, which helps reduce pollution. With computers, learning has become easier for everyone as there's no need to search through books. There are also various learning programs available, including those for learning different languages, and it can assist with homework.  Regarding business, some people have started their own enterprises using computers. Shopping is also more convenient; instead of driving to buy a T - shirt, one can simply make the purchase online. The more we drive, the more pollution is released into the atmosphere. Without computers, our planet would become @PERCENT1 more polluted each year.  Computers also save us from wasting gas. If computers were taken away, people might still choose the lazy option of driving. Communication is another area where computers shine. They allow us to talk to people, like the Japanese who speak English, enabling us to understand different lifestyles. We can ask questions or play mind - games. I've been able to chat with old friends, and it's the only way I can talk to them without my parents complaining about high phone bills.  In conclusion, computers are like a second brain. They help us avoid polluting the air, learn quickly, and communicate with others. Everyone should recognize that computers are indeed beneficial.
1562	1566	1	2	"Hello, my name is @PERSON1 @CAPS1, and I aim to convince you that computers with internet access benefit our society.  Computers are extremely useful for students in projects and reports. For instance, when doing a report on ""@CAPS2 Lincoln"", students can access information right at home. They can look up details, print pictures to make their projects more engaging, and type information to make it organized and neat. This way, they don't waste time on projects and can present a more vibrant and professional - looking report.  When it comes to job applications, the internet is a time - saver. Instead of going to places without knowing if jobs are available, one can search online. You can find out about the pay, regulations, and get a faster response on whether you've landed the job.  Computers also facilitate socializing. Platforms like Facebook and MySpace allow students to connect with school friends or online acquaintances. Adults without these accounts can use email, MSN, AOL, or AIM for chatting. This helps adults catch up on work - related matters and allows children to stay in touch with friends and family.  In conclusion, computers with internet access are a boon to our society, aiding in projects, reports, job applications, and socializing with loved ones."
1563	1567	1	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, on @DATE1, technology is ubiquitous and beneficial to many aspects of our lives. Many engineers work to enhance the popularity of technological devices, while others use them for communication or relaxation. A study by @ORGANIZATION2 University found that the computer is the most widely used machine.  Computers have a positive impact on education. At the middle school I attend, there are over @NUM1 computers in use during the school day. These computers help students complete research papers, typed assignments, and other teacher - required papers. Students save time that would be spent scanning library books and money on reading materials. They can also print pictures to make projects more appealing. Teachers can use computers to organize files and enter grades online, which is very useful considering the large number of assignments graded each week. The ""parent portal"" keeps students informed about school events.  In terms of the economy, computers are now more affordable, starting as low as sixty dollars. This is significant as the economy has been struggling since the depression. The decrease in computer prices has stimulated purchases.  For entertainment, instead of using a CD player, one can download and listen to music while chatting online. This is helpful for last - minute plan changes, especially for those without a telephone. Children can play games on the internet to relax after a tough day at school, and adults can unwind from work. Computers are also involved in producing the shows we watch at home and the video games we order. From social media platforms to classic movies, computers offer a relaxing entertainment option.  In conclusion, computers are invaluable in education, the economy, and entertainment, making them an essential part of our lives."
1564	1568	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are having a negative impact on people's lives. Instead of using time wisely and being active outdoors, people are often indoors, playing games or chatting on the computer.  If you're prone to weight gain or on diabetic medication, I strongly recommend going for a walk in the park with a friend. This way, you can enjoy nature, have a real - life conversation, and get some exercise. You're also doing your friend a favor, as both of you will benefit from the outdoor activity. Being more active can strengthen friendships and family bonds. You might also improve your self - esteem when you see your healthy new body in the mirror.  For those who are often depressed, lonely, or in a bad mood, outdoor activities and workouts can be the solution. They can give you energy you never thought you'd have.  In conclusion, I urge everyone to stop being lazy, get off the computer, and start enjoying life to the fullest.
1565	1569	1	2	The impact of computers on people, especially children, is unreasonable. Nowadays, computers are not good for us because people spend all their time on them. They don't realize that excessive computer use can damage eyesight and some people even become addicted.  People act as if computers are harmless, but in fact, the time spent on computers could be better spent with family and friends. Many don't understand that sitting in front of a computer all day can mess up their eyes.  I believe there should be a limit on the time people spend on computers. This way, we can protect our eyes and have more meaningful interactions with our loved ones. In conclusion, we need to be more aware of the negative effects of over - using computers and take steps to control our usage.
1566	1570	1	2	I firmly believe that computers bring numerous benefits to society. Firstly, they have advanced significantly from the old - fashioned typewriters. Computers are excellent learning tools. For instance, when faced with a project on the @LOCATION1, the internet can provide a wealth of information such as who and what rely on the @ORGANIZATION1 for water, the length and location of the @LOCATION1. They can also assist in real - life situations; if you have a new job interview and are unsure of the address, simply type it in and get directions. Moreover, finding out the schedule of your favorite show is just a keystroke away.  Secondly, computers facilitate communication. Platforms like Facebook and @CAPS1 are extremely useful. I found my best friend, who moved away in second grade, on Facebook just before Christmas. Now we catch up, even though we haven't seen each other for years. Additionally, for those with family members at war or overseas, computers, through email, Skype, Yahoo Instant Messenger, webcam, or telephone, enable communication. In a business context, webcam conversations with colleagues can help keep track of profits, stores, and other aspects.  Finally, technology has made remarkable progress with computers. In the past, typing on a typewriter was difficult. Nowadays, using @CAPS3 @CAPS4, you can type with ease, take advantage of spell - check, email documents, and customize the font, color, and size. With iPhones or iTouches, people can access the internet anywhere, whether it's to find an app, check the length of the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, or order a pizza.  In conclusion, computers benefit society as they allow communication, aid learning, and are a significant part of modern technology.
1567	1571	1	2	In my view, there are multiple perspectives on people's computer usage. On one hand, I think people should spend less time on computers and more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. When people are engrossed in computers, they tend to neglect activities like going to the park or the mall.  On the other hand, there are reasons why people should not stay off computers. If someone goes far away, computers can help with contact. For example, you can get a free laptop and use it on an airplane to North Carolina, Virginia, Washington @ORGANIZATION1, at a party, on a road - trip, or on a ferry to the Long Island Sound. Also, computers are useful for planning. You can use them to plan a trip to a far - away place, a new house, an anniversary, or a honeymoon spot like a peak hill or a heart - shaped - bed hotel. They can also be used to determine a location other than a person's house.  Furthermore, computers are helpful for social and event - related tasks. You can plan a birthday party for your child, arrange a visit to someone's house in Tennessee, or plan to watch a basketball game at @CAPS2 @CAPS3, where the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Lakers play against the Cavaliers.  In conclusion, considering all these aspects, it seems that having access to computers is beneficial, and people should not be completely off them.
1568	1572	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are a waste of time. In today's world, computers offer various functions like gaming, doing homework, and socializing. But there are far better things to do.  Exercising is crucial. When people spend excessive time on computers, they get less exercise. Sitting in front of a computer all day without burning calories can lead to weight gain. In contrast, exercise gives us energy and is beneficial for our health.  Nature is also something we often miss while on the computer. Every time I look out of the window, I'm struck by the beauty of nature - the trees, flowers, plants, and grass. When we're chatting online or playing games, we're missing out on these natural wonders. Some people don't appreciate the elements that make up our earth.  Moreover, while we're wasting time on the computer, there are homeless children wandering, perhaps looking for their families. We should cherish our relationships with family and friends. Even a simple conversation can show them that we care.  I understand that some people say computers are used for communication. However, in the past, people communicated without computers, and we can do the same. Computers make us spend less time exercising, prevent us from enjoying nature, and reduce our interaction with family and friends.  In conclusion, we should limit our computer use and focus on more meaningful activities.
1569	1573	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, how are you? I'm fine. I'm writing this letter to convince you that computers have a positive impact on people.  Firstly, computers enable people to contact friends and family from far - away places. People around the world often have family members in different locations. Without the internet, it's difficult to maintain good contact. For example, if you live in the @LOCATION2 and have a friend in @LOCATION1, a computer allows you to catch up. I have family in @LOCATION1, and it was hard to stay in touch until I started using the computer. Now I can have a great time chatting with them. Clearly, computers are essential for keeping in touch with loved ones.  Secondly, computers help us learn more about different parts of the world. If you know nothing about a country or place, you can research it on the internet. When I have a project or essay and lack knowledge, I turn to the computer for information. This not only helps me complete my tasks but also broadens my understanding.  Finally, computers assist us in understanding and learning more about life. If you're unsure whether something is right or wrong, you can look it up. They can also offer advice. For instance, when trying a new recipe and not knowing how to make it, the computer can provide guidance.  In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people as they facilitate communication, enhance learning, and offer life - related assistance. I hope you'll consider this view after reading this letter.
1570	1574	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION2, I've learned that your paper will write about how computers benefit society in @LOCATION1, and I wholeheartedly agree.  Computers are excellent educational tools. They help with studying for tests; websites like @ORGANIZATION1 provide valuable information. When it comes to homework, they are also extremely useful. I recall having to write a final draft for an important essay on its due date. Instead of spending an hour writing it by hand, I went to the library and typed it on a computer, which only took me half an hour.  Moreover, computers help with learning hand - eye coordination. For those who want to learn yoga but lack the time to attend classes, online videos on computers can be a great alternative. They also assist with sports; videos show you how to play and enjoy sports as if you were in real - life situations.  In addition, computers allow us to communicate with friends online. Websites like @CAPS2 - @CAPS3 (Myspace) are very popular for chatting. And for those interested in dating, online dating through computers offers a way to start a new relationship without leaving home.  In conclusion, having computers in our lives is highly beneficial. They enable us to communicate with friends, learn hand - eye coordination, and obtain an education. While this is just my opinion, it's clear that computers play a significant role in society.
1571	1575	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to discuss the impact of computers on people. As someone with two computers and a laptop, I firmly believe that anyone who wants to access information should own a computer. Computers are essential because they offer multiple benefits. You can search for a wide range of things, including places and people, as long as you're on the right website. For instance, I once wanted to check if there was a [specific thing] in [LOCATION1]. I went to ask.com, typed in the query, and it not only confirmed its existence but also provided detailed information such as the address, phone number, and the manager's name.  Computers are also great for gaming. You can play various games like checkers, solitaire, and freecall. If you're not into these, there are plenty of gaming websites to explore. I've been using computers daily since I was six. Back then, I could only play checkers because I didn't know the right websites. But one day, I logged onto a new site and played my first driving game.  Another advantage is the ability to chat. Instead of using your phone and increasing your bill, you can use your computer to chat as much as you want without wasting minutes. I remember one time when I ran out of phone minutes and didn't have internet on my phone. I asked my dad if I could use the computer, and he said yes. I went to a local chatroom where my friend had an account, and we chatted until [TIME1].  In conclusion, those who enjoy looking up information, playing games, and chatting should definitely have a computer.
1572	1576	1	2	Computers are fascinating technological tools that can be used at home or work. However, opinions about computers vary. Some people think they are a waste of time and not useful, believing that computers offer no real help. On the other hand, many people recognize the computer as a highly beneficial invention and are grateful for it.  In fact, the view that computers are a waste of time is inaccurate. When students are working on a paper for an [CAPS1] class, a computer is extremely useful. It has a keyboard, which allows for faster typing compared to writing by hand. Additionally, it comes with a grammar - checking feature to ensure correct spelling and grammar.  Computers also help in quickly accessing information. For example, when you're working on a school project and need to look up a person, you're likely to find more information on a computer than in books. They are valuable for everyone and make tasks more efficient.  In conclusion, computers are not a waste of time. They are useful and have a positive impact on our lives by making various tasks faster and easier.
1573	1577	1	2	"Dear [CAPS1] [CAPS2], computers have had a profound impact on people. Many individuals have used computers to learn about different cultures, and this has had numerous positive effects on society. Computers have changed the way people think, view the world, and even behave at home and in public, as experts have noted. They also assist special - needs individuals in learning to read and spell.  Learning about different cultures through computers has been beneficial for society. It educates the youth, helping them avoid mistakes related to racial issues. Moreover, computers have enabled people to learn about their own cultures, as reported by [ORGANIZATION1] news.  Some people claim that computers have led to a decrease in daily exercise among citizens. However, this is a narrow view. People use computers not only for studying but also to find different diets and stretching methods to keep themselves fit. Less than [PERCENT1] of the studied group found that computer - based diets and fitness information were ineffective. As [CAPS5] times stated, ""The computer not only aids in our fitness but also keeps us informed. With just one click, we can access a wealth of information in less than a minute.""  In conclusion, computers have changed not only society but also the world. Their impact is truly significant."
1574	1578	1	2	Dear [LOCATION1] [ORGANIZATION1], while computers are very helpful to society, they also pose problems. For example, there are people addicted to computers who will stay in a dark area for hours just using the computer. This addiction is not helping the obesity problem in [LOCATION2].  A computer junkie is someone who wakes up at [TIME1] in the morning and stays on the computer for over [NUM1] hours. Approximately [PERCENT1] of our [CAPS1] youth have this issue. I know from personal experience because my brother is addicted to his laptop. He spends hours in his room watching Japanese cartoons (anime) without eating and never leaves his room. My mom got so tired of trying to get him out that she gave up.  Obesity is a growing problem in our nation, and computers are making it worse. People can now order items online and have them delivered to their door, reducing the need for physical activity. Companies like [CAPS4] [CAPS5], Domino [CAPS4], and [LOCATION3] Jade are part of this issue. We should stop online [CAPS3] ordering.  In conclusion, while the computer is a great tool for learning, it can also lead to addiction and weight gain. We need to be more aware of these negative impacts.
1575	1579	1	2	Dear [CAPS1], I am convinced that computers have a positive effect on people. They offer several advantages that enhance our lives.  First, computers enable us to communicate with others online. It's not just about chatting with friends but also staying in touch with family members who live far away. For example, half of my family lives in [LOCATION1], and my mom uses the internet to keep in touch with them.  Second, computers are indispensable for doing work that can't be done by hand. This includes typing essays and working on school projects. They provide a more efficient and accurate way to complete such tasks.  Third, computers allow us to learn about distant places and people. When I first came to this country, I knew very little about it. But through online research, I was able to learn a great deal.  In conclusion, computers have a significant positive impact on people. They facilitate communication, enable us to complete non - handwritten work, and help us learn about the world around us.
1576	1580	1	2	Dear @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1, as a student from @ORGANIZATION2, I've noticed a debate about whether using computers is beneficial or a waste of time. I firmly believe there are @NUM1 compelling reasons to consider computers as good technology. Firstly, computers allow you to book destinations and attractions. This is a practical use as you can plan your route, print maps, and even go hiking, which is a great form of exercise. Secondly, online chats are a significant advantage. For example, if you have a family member living in @LOCATION1, you can communicate via email without incurring high costs, keeping you informed about their lives. Thirdly, computers are excellent learning tools. You can explore various cultures, understand different lifestyles, and gain in - depth knowledge. Lastly, staying updated on the @CAPS1 is made easy. You can get the latest news, such as earthquakes in Haiti, hurricanes, or breaking stories. In conclusion, despite the existence of some inappropriate content, when used correctly, computers are a valuable technological resource.
1577	1581	1	2	I concur with experts who are worried about people spending excessive time on computers. Many kids prefer to be on the computer, chatting with friends online or on Facebook. However, this means they miss out on exploring nature and spend less time with family and friends. If one is constantly on the computer, it's impossible to get enough exercise. Moving a hand over a mouse doesn't count as physical activity. A recent survey conducted by @CAPS2 showed that out of the @PERCENT1 of kids who own a computer, @PERCENT2 are overweight or at risk of being so. It's disheartening that technology is negatively impacting people's lives. I also use the computer, but I always make sure to engage in physical activities like biking or hiking with my family. Moreover, we're missing out on the beauty of nature. For instance, many of us have never seen day - lilies bloom at night. Kids should learn to balance technology with more important aspects of life, such as nature conservation and exercise. Some may argue that they're helping the environment through websites, but direct action, like neighborhood clean - ups or tree - planting, would be more fulfilling. Family and friends are the most important things in life, and technology should not come between them. Losing everything, the one thing you'll always have is the love of family and friends. So, kids should choose to be with their families rather than being glued to the computer. I firmly believe that technology is taking over and clouding the vision of what truly matters in life.
1578	1582	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I firmly believe that computers bring numerous benefits to society. One of the greatest advantages is the ease of interaction. Whether people are nearby or miles away, you can chat with them at the click of a button. For example, my friends and I use Facebook. I simply log in, open the chat box, click on their names, and we start talking. The best part is that you don't need to share personal details like phone numbers. In terms of entertainment, the computer offers endless options. Unlike traditional TV, where you might struggle to find something interesting, the computer always has content. You can visit video - sharing sites like @CAPS13, which has at least @NUM1 million videos, with @NUM2 being watched or uploaded daily. You can find various types of videos, from stand - up comedy to action. The computer is also extremely helpful. If you have a big test or report due, you can study online. A simple Google search can yield over @NUM4 results in seconds. Additionally, computers are profitable. The founders of Google are extremely wealthy, even more so than the @ORGANIZATION1, a major player in the computer system industry. In conclusion, computers enable interaction, provide entertainment, and are both helpful and profitable. Therefore, it's clear that computers are beneficial to society. Thank you for your time.
1579	1583	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe it's advantageous that people spend a significant amount of time on computers. Firstly, typing on a computer helps develop hand - eye coordination. This skill is useful in real - life situations, like catching a baseball on the street. While there are other ways to gain hand - eye coordination, typing is particularly valuable as it's a skill used throughout life. Secondly, using a computer can save money. For example, if you're having trouble paying your phone bill, you can use your computer for free calls. Also, a computer is less likely to be lost or stolen compared to a cell phone. Thirdly, computers can save a great deal of time. Searching for information in a book can take hours, but with a computer, it can be done in minutes. Similarly, homework that might take me hours can be completed in minutes with a computer. Considering the development of hand - eye coordination, cost - saving, and time - efficiency, I think it's beneficial for people to spend time on computers, and I hope you agree.
1580	1584	1	2	There are diverse opinions on whether computers benefit society. I am convinced that computers are useful for multiple reasons. In schools, students often need computers for projects. Typing on a computer can be faster and neater than writing by hand, especially for persuasive writing pieces. Additionally, computers offer many educational games. These games can help people learn in an engaging way. Moreover, computers are a great way to relax. After a long day at work, instead of just sitting on the couch, one can play a fun game on the computer. While some may claim that watching TV and using a computer are the same, playing an educational game once in a while can be a good alternative. In conclusion, computers are beneficial as they are essential for schoolwork, offer educational games, and provide a means of relaxation.
1581	1585	1	2	I firmly believe that computers have positive effects on people. When considering the stance of the esteemed members of this well - known newspaper regarding whether the impacts of individuals owning computers are good or bad, I must respectfully disagree if there is a negative view. I am confident I can convince you to share my perspective.  Computers offer numerous benefits. Firstly, they are excellent research tools. Everyone has questions, and often, we don't have the answers readily available. While traditional research at the library can be time - consuming, the internet on a computer enables users to find answers in seconds. This not only enhances people's knowledge but also boosts their performance at work or in school.  Secondly, computers are a great solution for boredom. Everyone experiences boredom at some point. Instead of sitting idle, one can engage in various activities on the computer. There are educational games and challenging puzzles that can stimulate the brain, eliminate boredom, and improve hand - eye coordination.   Finally, computers play a vital role in maintaining relationships. It is natural for people to want to stay in touch with friends and family. When a close friend moves away, traditional methods of communication like letter - writing can be slow. Computers, through instant messaging and email, allow for instant communication, keeping friendships strong and preventing families from drifting apart. It is also beneficial for couples and parents to stay connected with their partners or children when they are away.  In conclusion, I am strongly convinced that computers have positive effects on people. They are valuable for research, a great pastime when bored, and an effective means of online communication for maintaining relationships. I sincerely urge you to change your negative view to a positive one about the impacts of computers. I am confident that you will make a wise choice and agree with me.
1582	1586	1	2	Dear editors, I believe people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers, which is causing several issues. This overuse leads to less exercise, less time outdoors, and insufficient face - to - face interaction with family and friends.  Exercise is a crucial part of daily life. I have a friend who exercises daily, is very healthy, and rarely uses the computer. In contrast, she knows someone who spends @NUM1 hours on the computer each day, hardly exercises, and has been diagnosed with diabetes and obesity. Experts recommend at least @NUM2 minutes of exercise daily, but with the increasing time spent on computers, this is becoming difficult. Studies from @ORGANIZATION1 show that @PERCENT1 of kids under @NUM3 are obese or at risk of obesity due to lack of exercise.  Another problem is the reduced time spent outdoors. My friend @PERSON1 failed a science project because she was on her computer instead of doing outdoor research. Doctor @PERSON2 found that @PERCENT2 of kids prefer being on the computer to playing outside, which is a concerning trend.  Lastly, the lack of face - to - face time with family and friends is causing relationship problems. My friend @PERSON3 was ostracized at a family gathering because she skipped a reunion to stay on the computer. According to @ORGANIZATION1 guidance counselor @PERSON4, @NUM4 out of @NUM5 friendships are at risk because kids spend too much time on the computer and not enough in person with their friends.  In conclusion, reducing computer time and increasing exercise, outdoor activities, and face - to - face interaction with loved ones will lead to a happier and healthier life. I hope you will consider these points and encourage people to make better use of their time.
1583	1587	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 of The Local Newspaper, as @CAPS2 students are promoted to higher grades, more teachers will require research papers. In my view, a computer is extremely helpful in completing research papers to the best of one's ability. After all, what could make students and parents happier than seeing good grades on a child's paper?  Advances in technology are essential for several reasons. Firstly, they improve hand - eye coordination. A recent poll in TIME magazine indicated that @PERCENT1 of computer users experienced a significant increase in coordination. Professional tennis player @PERSON1 said, ""Before I started using a computer, I was poorly coordinated in tennis. I often missed the ball in matches. After using the computer more, my coordination improved, and now I rarely miss."" Clearly, technological advances can enhance hand - eye coordination.  Secondly, technology allows people to learn about distant places and people. Writer @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1 stated that people like to research destinations before a vacation or business trip. Knowing about a place in advance makes the trip more enjoyable, benefits airplane companies, and broadens one's perspective of different cultures. Thus, technological progress provides the opportunity to learn about far - off places and people.  Finally, technology enables online communication. @PERSON3, the creator of @CAPS9, said that online chat programs like @CAPS9 help people stay connected. It helps students with homework and allows people to reconnect with old friends. An article on @ORGANIZATION2 also confirmed the effectiveness of online chat for communication.  In conclusion, technological advances improve hand - eye coordination, facilitate learning about distant places and people, and enable online communication. I strongly encourage you to support these advances as they will be beneficial for everyone. Thank you for your time."
1584	1588	1	2	Dear editors of the @ORGANIZATION1, in the morning, my sister wakes me up for school using her cellphone's alarm. A few years ago, my mom would do this. Nowadays, we carry a single device that can do much more than just allow us to talk to people from different locations. Most people own cellphones, which can be used for gaming, web - browsing, and more. However, I believe these technological advances are making us selfish, and I do not approve.  Firstly, these new gadgets are time - consuming. There are many productive, fun, or helpful things we could be doing instead, such as going to the gym or studying. My aunt, @PERSON1, a former physicist, said that the increasing obesity rate among students and kids due to the overuse of phones and iPods is concerning. The more time we spend on these devices, the less active we become, and we start to waste our time.  Secondly, modern technological advances are pushing the boundaries of internet safety. Although people claim they can block others, information posted on the web may not always be well - protected. For example, one of my cousins was blackmailed last year through the internet and was kidnapped. The police took a long time to find her because the evidence was hidden. Moreover, my brother learned swearing from the advanced game @CAPS5.  I urge your company to make the right decision and encourage us to be more active. I hope you will take my advice, and I thank you for your time and effort.
1585	1589	1	2	I firmly believe that people should use computers less as it negatively impacts their lifestyle. Instead of being glued to the computer, individuals should exercise, spend time with friends and family, and enjoy nature.  Computers contribute to obesity in @LOCATION1 as they promote laziness and reduce the motivation to exercise. If people start exercising, at least @PERCENT1 of the laziness can be eliminated. Going for a walk is a simple alternative to using electricity on the computer, and it can also reduce the electricity bill by around @PERCENT2.  People should also spend more time enjoying nature rather than being on the computer. They should engage in recycling and focus on environmental issues instead of being preoccupied with social media. If we start recycling and caring about nature, @PERCENT3 of the earth will become greener.  Finally, there should be more quality face - to - face time with family and friends. Computers often cause people to disconnect from their loved ones as they are too focused on the internet. Around @PERCENT4 of people should reduce their computer time and spend more time relaxing with family and friends.  In conclusion, reducing computer usage will enable people to lead a more balanced life. They can exercise, enjoy nature, and strengthen relationships with loved ones. I hope people will take these points into consideration and make positive changes in their lives.
1586	1590	1	2	I'm currently sitting on the couch, pondering what to do for my vacation. I'm certain I want to take a trip somewhere to engage in some creative writing. However, my notebooks are all over the place, I'm unsure how to quickly find someone who can assist me, and I have no idea which country to visit. I take one last look at my notebooks scattered in the closet, which looks as if a tornado has passed through, and I spot the solution on the highest shelf: my laptop. First of all, I whole - heartedly agree with those who believe computers are useful. The three effects they have on regular users are truly remarkable. Compare a person with a laptop to one without. The person with a laptop might be a busy businessperson who needs to communicate with many people from afar. They use email and @ORGANIZATION1, enabling them to interact with others as if they were right there. In contrast, a person without a laptop might have to constantly move from place to place just to meet these people, leading to a chaotic schedule. Conversations through a chat system are fast and efficient. Take my experience for instance. My mom dislikes wasting resources, so instead of driving to a friend's place, we @CAPS2. This saves both money and time! Additionally, I'm a writer who fills numerous notebooks with my writing every day. Over the years, I've written so much that my notebooks are piling up all over my room. What could help me organize this mess? A laptop, of course! One laptop can store a large amount of data and makes editing a breeze. Anybody dealing with data and writing would be foolish not to own a computer! Would you prefer a room full of notebooks that you've purchased over time, or a single computer with ample space and backup? You decide. Computers encourage users to be more organized. Moreover, computers are a vast resource of millions of pages of information. They are similar to libraries, but think about the difference. In a library, you have to physically search for information, while with a computer, knowledge is just a click away. Some might argue that computer websites are not entirely reliable, but I strongly disagree. There are specific websites on computers with suffixes like '.org', '.gov', and even '.edu'. These websites contain verified factual information and excellent resources for research. By using computers, I've gained more knowledge and found them extremely beneficial. They've effectively made me a more intelligent person. In conclusion, I firmly believe that those who use computers only experience positive effects, including money and gas - saving conversations through @CAPS2 and email, better organization, and increased intelligence from reading. I've decided to take my creative writing on my laptop and, in the process, learned to manage the chaos.
1587	1591	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper, I've noticed that you've invited people to share their views on the effects of computers on people. In my opinion, computers do not have a positive impact. The reasons are as follows. Firstly, kids are spending too much time on the computer instead of doing their homework. There are many kids who stay on the computer all night and never get around to their schoolwork. I read an article stating that ""Computers are the number one problem for kids not doing their homework."" People get so distracted on the computer that they end up not doing anything else. Eight out of ten kids admit that they sometimes skip their homework because they get distracted by the computer. I interviewed a @NUM1 - grade student, and she said, ""@CAPS3 class usually gets all the homework done, but sometimes we forget when we're on the computer. That's really the only reason we don't complete @CAPS1."" Clearly, computers are not a good thing if kids are neglecting their homework because of them. Secondly, since people are constantly on computers, they don't get enough exercise. Instead, they sit and play games on the computer. I found a quote in an article: ""@CAPS5 since I started spending a lot of time on the computer, I have gained weight because I'm not out exercising."" Exercising and going outside are very important, but people can't do these things if they're always glued to the computer. Nine out of ten people say that since they started using the computer frequently, they haven't gone outside or exercised for a long time. I interviewed a woman who said, ""I had to stop using the computer for a while because I realized it wasn't good for me and I needed to exercise."" People get so distracted by computers that they no longer go outside to exercise. Thirdly, spending time with family and friends is crucial, but computers are getting in the way. I read in a magazine that ""People are not spending time with their friends and family because they are on the computer instant messaging."" Computers are preventing people from spending quality time together. Nine out of ten families have realized that they don't spend as much time together because of computers. I interviewed some kids, and they said, ""I don't spend much time with my family or friends. I'm mostly on the computer instant messaging."" In conclusion, these are the reasons why I believe computers do not have a good effect on people. Kids neglect their homework, people exercise less, and they spend less time with their loved ones."
1588	1592	1	2	Computers are really cool. You know, there's a website called @NUM1.com. We need to time something related to it, though I'm not sure exactly what. I really love computers. We should @NUM2 make computers that are more environmentally - friendly. In conclusion, computers bring a lot of fun and potential, and making them greener would be a great step forward.
1589	1593	1	2	As more and more people around the world start using computers, I firmly believe that computers have an extremely positive impact on people. Computers aren't just for entertainment; they offer many other benefits. For example, they can teach hand - eye coordination, provide people worldwide with the opportunity to learn about distant places, people, and cultures, and they offer another way for people to communicate with their friends online. Let me elaborate on the positive effects of computers for the millions of users. Having a computer at home is truly wonderful. It's not just for playing video games; it's also very useful for the education of young children, teens, parents, and even grandparents. When using a computer, there's so much to learn. Suppose you have a question in your social studies or history class about a particular country, and you know nothing about it. What should you do? You can log onto your computer, find a reliable website, and suddenly you're learning facts about @LOCATION1 that you'd never have known otherwise. Computers are also an excellent way to practice and improve hand - eye coordination. First, you need to learn the layout of the keys on the keyboard. Once you've mastered that skill, you should try to look at the computer screen instead of looking down at your fingers on the keys. Not only does looking down not help with hand - eye coordination, but it also slows down your typing speed. Computers are truly amazing. Are you one of those people whose parents won't let you have a phone because of the high cost, even without considering the cost of texting? Well, the computer can solve that problem! There are numerous ways to communicate with your friends and family on the computer. For example, you can use @CAPS1 to instant - message your friends or use Facebook to learn more about people. The computer is so convenient! To sum up, computers help people learn about different places around the world, improve hand - eye coordination, and allow them to talk to their friends. I think every household should have a computer.
1590	1594	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, many people claim that computers can have a negative effect on people, but I strongly disagree. Computers make our lives much easier. We can reconnect with people we haven't seen in a long time, learn about places we thought we'd never know about, and type up documents instead of writing them by hand. These are the reasons that prove computers don't have a bad impact. Imagine you're on Facebook and you type in the name of your high - school best friend. She pops up, and you're back in touch. The next day, she's happy to be connected with you again. This kind of thing happens every day. People reconnect not only on Facebook but all over the internet. Reconnecting with friends and family, communicating with your boss next door, or even sending a picture of your newborn baby to your mother in @CAPS2 are all made possible by computers. They allow us to reconnect with those we've lost touch with. Another important aspect is learning about other cultures. Without computers, if we knew nothing about other cultures, our lives would be very limited. With computers, we can instantly learn about different places. All we have to do is type in the name of the place and select the information we want to view. In the past, people had to write everything word by word and letter by letter. But with computers, we don't have to worry about that. For a @NUM1 - page paper, you can simply type it up, and with some software, you can even get it edited right away. This is beneficial not only for school - going children but also for adults. A business proposal can be completed quickly and easily with the help of a computer. Many people say that computers can have a negative effect, but with the advancement of technology, using computers becomes easier, and it gives us more time for other things. There is no negative effect of computers; they are just incredibly helpful.
1591	1595	1	2	To the local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people, making daily life more convenient. Firstly, computers enable long - distance communication. You can chat with friends across the country for free. If you can't reach them, sending an email ensures they'll get your message as soon as they log in. Moreover, it's a great help for students. When you forget your homework, you can simply ask a friend online. You can also do your homework on a computer. Creating a word document and typing is neater and easier than writing with a pencil. Additionally, for research, the internet provides endless information. Finally, computers offer entertainment. When you're bored, you can play games, which not only provides fun but also improves hand - eye coordination. There are millions of free online games suitable for all ages. In conclusion, computers are extremely beneficial as they facilitate communication, simplify homework, and offer entertainment, and I wholeheartedly believe they have a positive effect on people. Thank you.
1592	1596	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I wholeheartedly agree that computers have had a positive influence on people. They enhance hand - eye coordination, allow us to learn about distant places and people, and enable online communication. More individuals should recognize these positive effects. Using a computer is an excellent way to improve hand - eye coordination and typing speed, which is a crucial skill for most jobs. Schools even teach typing. When using a computer, you need to keep your eyes on the screen and move your hands to type, thus training hand - eye coordination. Computers also offer the opportunity to learn about the world. You can explore far - off places, view pictures of important cities, and gain knowledge about the people there. It's much easier and faster than using a social studies book. Moreover, computers are evolving rapidly and provide the means to communicate with others worldwide. You just need a webcam, which can be bought in computer stores or may already be installed. Online communication is a great way to learn about others, especially those from different countries. Some claim that computers have a negative impact, stating that people spend too much time on them instead of exercising or interacting with family and friends. However, these issues can be addressed by managing time properly. If people do so, everyone will acknowledge that computers have a positive effect and are one of the greatest inventions. I thank all the readers for their time and hope you support my views.
1593	1597	1	2	To the North @CAPS1 courier, I'd like to share my view on computer usage. I'm a pro - technology person and believe that computers have a positive impact on people. They are beneficial in three key aspects: improving hand - eye coordination, serving as a knowledge source, and enabling communication. In a sports - oriented country like the @LOCATION2, hand - eye coordination is essential. Using computers, especially through fun gaming sites like luniosity.com, can train this skill, which is useful for sports such as baseball and basketball. It can also contribute to the development of world - class athletes in the @LOCATION2. Additionally, with many drivers on the road in the @LOCATION2, improving hand - eye coordination through computers may reduce car accidents. These gaming sites also enhance concentration, memorization, and problem - solving. Regarding knowledge acquisition, computers, along with the internet, offer a wealth of information. You can learn about different cultures, places, and people by simply typing a subject into search engines like Google or Yahoo. It's a great resource for kids to find information for reports. Finally, computers provide a means of communication. Whether you're communicating with someone across the world or on the same street, all you need is a webcam. This is a fast way to learn about others, especially those from different countries. In conclusion, I firmly support technology as computers have positive effects on people by improving hand - eye coordination, providing knowledge, and enabling communication.
1594	1598	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I am convinced that computers have a negative impact on people and should be used more moderately. A large number of people, especially teens, are overly reliant on computers. According to @ORGANIZATION1, over @NUM1 billion people use computers globally. @PERSON1 states that about @PERCENT1 of teens spend most of their time on computers, often on platforms like Facebook, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. I know this well as I have a Facebook account. After getting one at my friend's suggestion, I found that more than half of my grade had one too. I believe computers can be addictive, especially global platforms like Facebook. Another issue is computer viruses. @CAPS3.com reports that the average adult gets about @NUM2 to @NUM3 viruses a year. My friend @PERSON2 lost his report due to a virus. About @PERCENT2 of viruses can cause a computer to shut down and be difficult to reboot. Even virus scans like McAfee and @CAPS5 sometimes fail to catch viruses, and @PERCENT3 of people with virus - scanned computers still face freezing and undeletable viruses. Moreover, people often neglect other activities. @CAPS6 reports that the average person aged @NUM5 - @NUM6 spends over @NUM7 hours on a computer. There are many alternatives such as calling friends, playing sports, reading books, or spending time with family. Teens who spend too much time on computers are more likely to enter lower - tier colleges. In conclusion, computers have a bad influence due to addiction, viruses, and the neglect of other activities. I hope you understand my point and respond soon.
1595	1599	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers are not necessary. Some think they aid learning, but books can do the same. Others claim they improve hand - eye coordination, yet playing catch can achieve the same result. When it comes to learning about far - off places, visiting them is better than relying on computer - typed information. Reading a real book is far more enjoyable than reading on a computer. Turning the pages of a paperback or hard - covered book is a unique experience. You can learn a great deal from real books. Typing on a computer with all the ""clickety - clickety"" sounds is not a natural way to learn hand - eye coordination. Going outside and playing catch is a more natural and fun way to develop this skill. When looking for a vacation spot, instead of surfing the web, you should just go there. For example, flip a coin to choose between @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION1. If you pick heads, stop searching online and go fly there to experience the real waves. In summary, while computers aren't all bad, they're not my preference. I encourage you to take time away from the computer, read a book, play catch, or take a trip to @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, or @LOCATION3. It will surely be an enriching experience."
1596	1600	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, I'm wondering if you truly believe we shouldn't have computers. In my view, we should. Computers offer a wealth of resources, including information, games, educational tools, and online shopping platforms. While some argue that computers are detrimental and addictive, I firmly believe they are appropriate and beneficial. Computers are invaluable learning tools. They provide access to a vast amount of knowledge, allowing us to explore topics beyond our immediate surroundings. I recall a time when I couldn't find a word in the dictionary, but a quick search on the computer yielded the answer. It was truly remarkable. Moreover, computers enable us to stay connected with loved ones, regardless of distance. I cherish the ability to communicate with my family members who live far away. It's a wonderful feeling to be able to talk to them whenever I want. In addition to learning and communication, computers keep us informed about current events and enhance hand - eye coordination. They truly have it all. Some critics claim that computers prevent people from enjoying nature, spending time with family, and exercising. However, I disagree. It's a matter of self - control and finding a balance. So, @CAPS5, I encourage you to recognize the many advantages of computers. After considering these points, I'm confident you'll agree that computers are a positive force in our lives. The choice is yours, and I believe it's clear that computers are a valuable asset.
1597	1601	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1, regularly reading your paper and staying updated on local events, I came across a controversy regarding the effects of computers. In my opinion, the computer is one of the greatest inventions in history, having positively transformed our society. One of the primary benefits of computers is the vast amount of knowledge they offer. Unlike traditional books or library research, which can be time - consuming, computers allow us to access information almost instantaneously. They can store a much larger volume of data than any library, covering nearly every imaginable subject. The information is readily available at our fingertips. Another significant advantage of computers is their ability to facilitate communication between people separated by great distances. Online chatting eliminates the need for expensive phone bills and the hassle of carrying a cell phone. It enables us to converse freely with friends and family around the world at no cost. However, the overuse of computers by children is a concern. While this is a significant issue, it is not the fault of the computer itself. Children should learn to set limits, and parents should establish rules regarding computer use, exercise, and social activities. In conclusion, I hope I've convinced you to recognize the numerous benefits of computers. I encourage you to give computers a fair chance; I'm certain you'll be satisfied with the results.
1598	1602	1	2	Dear editor, computers have a positive impact on humans for several reasons. They allow us to interact with friends and family, can be portable, and enable us to research vacation destinations. Regarding communication, face - to - face interaction is not the only way to stay in touch. Chat rooms and other online platforms on computers provide alternative means of communication. Take my friend @PERSON5, for example. He used to live in @LOCATION2 with his friends and family, but a business transfer took him all the way to @LOCATION1. Thanks to his computer, he can still communicate with those he left behind. Research by @PERSON4 shows that @PERCENT1 of computer owners talk to friends and family more often because they can do so at any time. A psychiatrist named Gene notes that families rely on computers when a member has to travel for business. Losing touch with loved ones is something none of us want. Computers can also be portable. My cousin @PERSON2, a teacher, used to be frustrated because he had to spend weekends grading papers indoors. But after receiving a portable computer for his birthday, he can now go outside, breathe fresh air, and enjoy nature while still getting his work done. @PERSON6's research indicates that @PERCENT2 of teachers buy portable computers for this reason. @PERSON1 has shown that teachers who don't get fresh air while working may make mistakes or get sick. Finally, computers are not just for work and communication. They can be used to research vacation destinations. My aunt @PERSON3 always wanted to go on vacation but couldn't find information about fun outdoor places until she got a computer. She was then able to find a great place and take a week - long trip. @ORGANIZATION1 reports that @PERCENT3 of people hesitate to travel because they lack information about destinations. In conclusion, the positive effects of computers on human life are clear. They enhance communication, offer flexibility, and open up new opportunities for travel and exploration.
1599	1603	1	2	To the local newspaper, I firmly believe that using computers does not have a negative impact on people; instead, it offers numerous advantages. Computers enable people to chat and make friends. Nowadays, people watch shows on websites like @CAPS1, and @ORGANIZATION1 allows users to search for and watch content on @CAPS1. People can also create emails, download music, and perform various other tasks. Even young children, as young as @NUM1, @NUM2, and @NUM3, are using computers to play games. My @NUM3 - year - old cousin plays games on the computer regularly and can even search for information. Some individuals may think that computers have a negative effect, but they need to face reality. We should embrace technological advancements as life progresses. Consider a girl whose parents believe computers spoil children. When her friends ask for her email, she has to make excuses to avoid the topic. Eventually, her friends may find out she doesn't have a computer, which could be embarrassing. Computers also save time. We can type instead of writing longhand and format our writing as we like. After reading this letter, I hope you understand my perspective. The next time you encounter someone who thinks computers have a negative impact, share the many advantages of computers and how they benefit society.
1600	1604	1	2	Many people enjoy playing video games and having cyber chats on computers, but they may not be aware of the potential drawbacks. Despite having a great time on the computer myself, I recognize its negative aspects. One problem is that computers can overheat if used for extended periods, which may cause them to malfunction. Another issue is the side effects on our health. Staring at the computer screen for too long can lead to headaches, which may worsen over time. It can also cause poor vision. Computers can be highly addictive. This addiction can lead to a breakdown in social relationships, as people may become less close to their family and friends. It can also disrupt daily routines, as addicts may feel compelled to play on the computer daily and more than the average person. Additionally, a person's personality may change due to the impact on their social life and routine. Computers can also be dangerous, especially for children. A child may accidentally access inappropriate or harmful websites, exposing them to pornographic content and other negative influences. This is unacceptable and should not be allowed. In my opinion, the addictive nature, problems, and dangers associated with computers are serious issues that need to be addressed. We need to think about how to manage computer use to minimize these negative impacts. What steps should we take to ensure that computers are used safely and responsibly?
1601	1605	1	2	I firmly believe that computers bring about positive effects. One reason is the vast knowledge we can access. For instance, if you wish to cook a special meal, an ordinary cookbook may not have the recipe, but you can easily find it on the internet via a computer. Also, when planning a car trip to a specific location, without a map, you can use the computer to get directions and print them out. Without a computer, such a trip might not be possible. Another benefit is the ability to stay in touch with friends and family. Suppose your sister graduates from college, and you're on a plane. With just your laptop and luggage, you can email her to offer congratulations. These are compelling reasons why I think computers have a positive impact, and I sincerely hope the local newspaper shares this view.
1602	1606	1	2	"Do you aspire for your child to achieve success in life? This is precisely why computers hold great value in daily life. Computers contribute to a child's education. A significant percentage, @PERCENT1, of children who use the internet for their studies are a grade ahead of their classmates. Dr. @PERSON1, a computer expert, shared, ""When I used the computer for research on @DATE1, I advanced significantly because of it."" Computers also foster a child's independence, as they learn to navigate different parts of the internet. A high proportion, from @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2, of children who use the internet are more likely to succeed in college as they know which websites to visit and how to reach them. There's also a good chance that these successful college - going children will land higher - paying jobs. Dr. @PERSON1 mentioned, ""@CAPS2 son at @ORGANIZATION1 was intelligent because he was constantly on the computer, exploring new facts and ideas."" Moreover, computers can assist in finding information about healthy eating. @PERCENT3 of adults who consume health foods are likely to have an extended lifespan as they maintain their bodies in good condition. Clearly, using the internet appropriately can be highly beneficial in helping one become a successful person in life."
1603	1607	1	2	"I am deeply concerned that people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers. This has led to a lack of exercise, as people prefer to stay indoors rather than enjoy the beautiful nature outside. A large number of households, with @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS2's @CAPS3 each having their own computer, are affected. A @NUM3 grader at @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON2, said, ""I would much rather be on the computer than outside."" Even students are neglecting physical activity for computer time. We have a limited lifespan, yet we're missing out on the wonders of nature. For example, @PERSON1 chooses to spend her days on the computer instead of appreciating the natural beauty around us. Only @NUM4 out of @NUM2 students enjoy nature weekly. A young girl of about @NUM6 didn't appreciate nature until her parents made her stay away from the computer for a month. Now, she loves it because the computer became boring. Family and friends are integral parts of our lives. Although the computer allows us to communicate with them at any time or share videos of important events, it would be far better for them to be present in person. When I was around @NUM1 @CAPS5, my grandparents used to attend my soccer games, but now they watch recorded videos. I much prefer their in - person support. Everyone wants to share important events with family, but computers are getting in the way. Computers are not as great as they seem. They keep us away from nature, limit exercise, and can lead to weight gain, which is unhealthy. I strongly urge you to reduce computer use, exercise, visit family, and enjoy nature."
1604	1608	1	2	In my opinion, spending too much time on the computer can be extremely harmful. Firstly, it can cause arthritis in the fingers. There's also a condition called carpal tunnel, which can severely affect one's ability to grasp things. My grandma has arthritis from doing dishes, and I believe using a keyboard would cause even more damage. My mom always warned me that sitting in front of a screen for too long could lead to blindness. A magazine stated that prolonged computer use can cause partial blindness, whether you're using it for Facebook or other activities. It's essential to go outside for fresh air and take walks to stay in shape. If you become obese by sitting in front of the computer all day, it can be life - threatening. Regular exercise is crucial for staying fit and healthy, rather than just consuming junk food and soda. Of course, it's okay to use the computer to look up health - related information. In summary, while the computer has its uses, sitting in front of it for extended periods can be very unhealthy. We need to maintain a balance to stay healthy.
1605	1609	1	2	Over the years, computers have become faster, smaller, and smarter, driving human progress. However, these advancements may have non - beneficial effects on the youth. Computers often prevent kids from playing outside and being active. A child in America might use the excuse of doing a @CAPS4 report while actually spending hours goofing around online. Thirty years ago, children were eager to go outside after finishing their assignments. Nowadays, many blame obesity on genetics, but it's likely due to computers attracting children. Kids are using less of their imagination because they're glued to the computer. In the past, children would act out their favorite TV shows with neighborhood friends for a week, but this is rare today. Instead, they quickly move on to video games like the Wii. Computers also waste a lot of time. The average kid spends up to four hours aimlessly on the computer, time that could be used for homework or other productive activities. People claim that computers represent the new generation, but does this mean the new generation should be lazy, unimaginative, and indifferent to how they spend their time? Most would say no. If you offer a nine - year - old the choice between playing on the computer and going outside, it's obvious which they'll choose. We want progress, but can't we find a compromise?
1606	1610	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, I recall my childhood when my parents purchased two laptops. Internet access was readily available, enabling online chat interactions, which greatly excited them. Meanwhile, I was confined at home, watching them have a good time. I couldn't go outside or hang out with friends because they were engrossed in the computers. I firmly believe that computers do not benefit society. People spend excessive time on the internet rather than exercising, missing out on the beauty of nature and reducing face - to - face interactions with family and friends. Despite the widespread use and purchase of computers, many problems are emerging. Our society seems to be deteriorating. People shouldn't be sitting at home, breathing recycled air while using computers. Professor @PERSON3, a health generalist, stated on @ORGANIZATION2 news that @PERCENT1 of people in @LOCATION1 would rather stay at home on the computer doing nothing than going outside or exercising. Can you envision so many unhealthy people only concerned about their computers? Nowadays, computers merely consume our free time. @CAPS2 waste @PERCENT2 of their spare time on computers. If the number of new games and websites decreases, people are more likely to leave home and engage in healthy activities. @PERSON1, the owner of @ORGANIZATION1, said, ""I've never seen so many people using computers and the internet. On a typical weekend, over one billion @CAPS2 are online."" @PERSON1 later mentioned, ""It's quite depressing to see how much time they spend on computers instead of enjoying nature."" Not only is exercise time being wasted, but our once - beautiful nature is also suffering. Many young kids watch @CAPS3, see computer game commercials, and their parents buy the games for them. Suddenly, they are constantly on the games. Since adults fail to encourage kids to go outside and be active, kids need to take the initiative. Did you know that global warming is related to low air density? If few children or adults are active outside, our world will not function properly. Our budget is low, and pollution is out of control; our nature is losing its beauty. @PERSON2, a government official, surveyed @NUM2 people from each state about the time they spend enjoying nature. The survey showed that only one in every @NUM3 people truly appreciates nature for at least @NUM4 minutes a week. That's truly pathetic. Maybe if we limit the use of computers and technology for a while, global warming can be mitigated. I remember when I was about @NUM4 years old, I never met most of my relatives except my siblings. It was sad because I was always told I had a large and well - known family in town, but I didn't know who they were. This is all due to the invention of technology. I rarely went outside to relax, except when getting on and off the school bus. My parents kept me at home while they used the computer. The other day, when my mom's computer broke, I got to know my relatives and had the freedom to go outside. Since then, my mom has more free time to spend with me. Technology ruined my childhood. Without it, we can discover the true meaning of life. Do you want to become obese, contribute to global warming, and miss out on family and nature? It's sad that @PERCENT3 of these problems are caused by excessive use of technology and computers. Let's get rid of them! Thank you for your time @CAPS1!"
1607	1611	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, computers are of great significance to many people. Almost everyone has used or is using a computer. Owning a computer is not a bad thing as it doesn't prevent people from exercising and carrying out daily activities. For instance, when you need to look up information, a computer is often the first choice. People in schools, industries, and homes use computers constantly. Teenagers usually use computers to chat with friends or play games; I'm no exception. It helps them avoid boredom. Exercising and being active are indeed crucial for teenagers, but they don't abandon computers. Computers are always there when they finish their homework or playing outside. I can't imagine my life without a computer. After soccer practice and finishing homework, I rush to the computer or @CAPS1 to relax. Computers should be regarded as our friends. They won't harm us but provide what we need and want. Research is a prime example. Everyone uses computers to find information. After research, they can have fun with games and friends. I believe the main purpose of computers is to provide information. When I get home from school, I finish my homework, stretch for cheerleading, and then watch @CAPS1 or use the computer to avoid idleness. It's not that I'm not active; it's just that I have nothing better to do. Many people do the same. Yes, computers are just boxes with keyboards, but if we integrate them into our lives, we'll find they are useful and won't rot our brains. They are placed in offices, living rooms, and bedrooms because people like them and use them to meet their needs. In conclusion, computers play an important and positive role in our lives.
1608	1612	1	2	"Dear Newspaper, when we need to write a report, communicate with business partners, friends, or family, computers come to our rescue. These electronic wonders enhance our lives daily. Nevertheless, some people are reluctant to accept that computers have become an integral part of our daily lives. Computers facilitate communication, research, and entertainment. They make communication effortless. Platforms like ""@CAPS2"" and ""Facebook"" enable us to interact with one another. Some might argue, ""Why not use a phone or go out?"" But what if we are on a trip or living far away? With computers, everything becomes easier. Computers also allow us to research topics for classes or work. We can obtain detailed information from numerous websites. Skeptics may ask, ""Why not go to a library?"" Some prefer to stay at home, or it could be snowy, or the library might be closed. Whatever the reason, computers make research quick and convenient. Moreover, computers fulfill our need for entertainment. Game sites like ""Facebook"" have gained immense popularity. They offer an emotional escape from the daily grind. One might ask, ""Why not go outside?"" However, the weather could be bad, or we might be sick. In summary, computers are a source of fun, education, and a communication marvel. We should recognize the benefits of computers and what they can offer us."
1609	1613	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on society. They offer a wealth of information, provide numerous fun games and music, and keep us informed about global and community issues. Firstly, computers are a great source of information. When doing projects or research, there's no better tool than a computer. We can search for information about presidents of the @LOCATION1, celebrities, and influential figures. We can also study different plants and animals and discover fascinating experiments. Secondly, computers are full of fun games and music. We can visit the @CAPS1 channel website and play games based on our favorite TV shows. There are also learning games on test - prep platforms like comprehension clinic to help us perform well in @ORGANIZATION2. Additionally, we can listen to various music, such as @ORGANIZATION1's album. We can preview music before buying. Finally, computers keep us informed about world issues. We can search for information on natural disasters like the @CAPS8 earthquake, @CAPS9 earthquake, or the tsunami that hit @LOCATION2 in @MONTH1. We can also search for information about @CAPS10 @PERSON3, our favorite artists, or community issues. In conclusion, due to their ability to provide information, offer entertainment, and keep us informed, computers have a positive impact on society.
1610	1614	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are highly beneficial to our society. Although they have some drawbacks, their advantages far outweigh them. Computers are extremely helpful in multiple ways. They assist in quickly spreading news and can teach us new skills. For example, have you ever lost touch with a family member for years and wished to reconnect? Computers can help you find them. Also, are you worried about criminals on the streets and want to get them off? Computers can aid the police in this regard. Notice how computers are helping the police protect many women today. Moreover, computers help us access information quickly. Suppose there's a hurricane, tornado, or earthquake. You can easily find all the relevant information on the computer. For instance, when there was an earthquake in @LOCATION1 and other sources lacked information, the computer could provide what you needed. Computers also teach us a lot. They improve hand - eye coordination. As you use the computer, you'll find that you type faster and become more familiar with the keyboard compared to when you first used a computer. Additionally, computers can introduce us to wonderful places like @CAPS2 falls and rainforests. Of course, I'm not saying that computers have no flaws or that people don't misuse them. However, overall, they contribute significantly to society. They spread news rapidly and educate people. So, please consider my opinion and think about how much computers have done for you. In conclusion, computers are an important and valuable part of our lives.
1611	1615	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, as a member of @ORGANIZATION1, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. Firstly, they promote hand - eye coordination. According to @PERSON1 from the @ORGANIZATION3 of the eye, when typing, one has to watch the keys, which helps the brain build a connection with the hands, thus enhancing hand - eye coordination. Moreover, millions of people in @LOCATION1 are involved in car accidents each year, and @PERCENT1 of these are caused by drivers lacking hand - eye coordination as they look down at the wheel. I believe that if every person in the world had access to computers, there would be fewer accidents annually.  Secondly, computers can transport people's minds to distant places and connect them with others. A study at @ORGANIZATION2 indicated that @PERCENT2 of the surveyed people can find information on the @CAPS3 faster than in a @CAPS7. Children of any age can use computers to obtain specific information within seconds. I've noticed that children are more familiar with using the @CAPS3 than a dictionary or encyclopedia. Additionally, computers allow people to communicate with others via the @CAPS3. This enables us to contact long - lost friends and talk to people halfway around the globe.  In conclusion, I sincerely hope that you, after reading this letter and sharing it within your company, will support my cause. Computers are beneficial as they improve hand - eye coordination, connect people with different places and individuals, and facilitate communication via the @CAPS3.
1612	1616	1	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, computers have propelled our world far into the future, making almost everything accessible with a single click. Over the years, experts have been amazed at how computers have enabled billions of people to complete tasks more efficiently than ever before. In the medical field, technology has assisted doctors in discovering new cures and diagnosing illnesses more effectively. Many professions rely on the vast knowledge available on the internet, and computers continue to evolve, redefining our way of life.  As a student at @ORGANIZATION1, I've found that computers are essential for daily assignments. Essays are now typed instead of handwritten, and projects are presented on flash drives rather than poster boards. These advancements have made our lives much easier. Moreover, computers allow us to virtually visit numerous countries, bringing foreign places closer to home. Modern technology has enhanced global connectivity and unity.  Doctors also benefit significantly from computers. Technology has revolutionized the medical world through X - rays, @CAPS2's, surgeries, and medicines. Computers enable doctors and nurses to view patients from a new perspective. Hospitals organize patient records digitally to ensure appropriate treatments. @PERSON1, the head surgeon at @ORGANIZATION2, stated, ""Without @CAPS3 technology, our @ORGANIZATION2 would be ineffective. We wouldn't be able to function."" His statement is valid, highlighting the crucial role of computers in the medical field.  Scientific studies have shown that the internet has brought people closer together. Families separated by great distances can now communicate via email, chat, or video chat. Email plays a vital role in business communication, with over @NUM1 million jobs relying on it. Without technological aid, our economy would decline rapidly due to the breakdown of communication between countries.  In conclusion, I strongly urge you to consider the benefits of modern technology and the numerous people it has helped. Thanks to technology, our culture has become more advanced, efficient, and united. I encourage you to educate others about these benefits and contribute to the further advancement of our way of life."
1613	1617	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I believe that the use of computers benefits our society. Firstly, computers enable people to learn about distant places and individuals. When I was in sixth grade, I had to do a project on @ORGANIZATION1. I knew nothing about him, but thanks to computers, I was able to research on @ORGANIZATION2 and gather sufficient information to get an A+ on the project. Similarly, in fourth grade, I had to do a project on @LOCATION1. I visited @CAPS1.com on a computer, obtained a wealth of information, and also received an A+.  Secondly, computers offer educational websites. Computer technologist @PERSON1 said that @CAPS2 percent of computer websites are educational. I recall in seventh grade, the whole class visited @CAPS3.com and learned math while having fun.  Lastly, computers allow people to communicate with others worldwide. There's a website called myspace.com that enables me and others to chat online. I surveyed my class, and ninety percent of them use myspace.com.  However, computers also have drawbacks. Some kids access prohibited websites not suitable for minors, such as @NUM1.com, which has violent games. Additionally, some people are computer addicts, spending almost all their time on computers.  In conclusion, despite the cons, computers are beneficial to society as they help us learn about far - off places and people, provide educational resources, and facilitate online communication. I hope you'll consider these points and form your own opinion on the matter.
1614	1618	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I recently read a letter about how computer technology is affecting people's lives. In my opinion, computers are an excellent learning tool. They offer a new and fun way to study. Traditional studying for tests or quizzes can be boring, but using a computer makes learning more engaging and memorable. I learn a great deal from the computer when I'm at home. My parents think I spend too much time on it, @CAPS1, but half of the time I'm studying for tests.  From a mental perspective, computers provide various learning opportunities. You can choose different topics and learn at your own pace. Physically, there's no pressure. You can simply log on and start learning.  Computers also help us stay connected with family and friends. Websites like @CAPS2, Facebook, and @CAPS3 allow us to interact with them, which is really amazing. It's the beauty of computers and technology that one device can serve multiple purposes.  Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share my opinion. I hope you'll take my thoughts into consideration.
1615	1619	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1 newspaper, I've overheard a debate about whether computers have a positive influence on people. In my view, computers have very positive effects on individuals, companies, places, and governments.  One of the most significant advantages of computers is that they are an excellent learning tool. The internet offers a vast amount of information, allowing people to learn almost anything they desire. People can also learn practical skills through simulators, such as flying a plane or driving a car. Moreover, many people are homeschooled via the internet, which is crucial for those who can't attend traditional schools due to various reasons.  Computers are also widely used as tools in many fields. For example, in the movie industry, special effects are created using software like Photoshop. Construction workers can create blueprints with high accuracy on computers. They are also useful for collecting and storing changing information.  In addition, computers provide entertainment. When people are bored at home, they can play video games or browse the internet. They are also important for obtaining music and videos. This has a significant impact on businesses, as the failure of these businesses could lead to job losses.  The government relies heavily on the internet for making plans, saving soldiers, and communicating with other countries.  Regarding the fitness and well - being of computer users, it's ultimately their decision. They can choose to use computers moderately or not.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in education, various industries, entertainment, and government operations. Despite potential concerns about overuse, their overall positive impact on society is undeniable.
1616	1620	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper, the question on everyone's mind is whether computers benefit society. In my opinion, they do not. When you're constantly on the computer, you miss out on exercise and the opportunity to enjoy nature. Moreover, it hinders interaction with friends and family. Lack of exercise is a significant issue. It's been proven that over half of the United States is overweight. If you're always glued to the computer, how can you get the physical activity you need? Exercising is far more important than using the computer. Given the choice between something beneficial like exercise and computer use, the former is clearly the better option. Interacting with people is crucial as it allows you to meet new individuals. While it's true that you can make friends online, it's not the same as meeting them in person. When you make ""friends"" on the internet, you can't be sure if they have malicious intentions, such as being a stalker or a murderer. Playing games on the computer has its appeal, but it's more enjoyable and meaningful to play with your family. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers do not benefit society. I hope this has encouraged you to reduce your computer use and spend more time having fun with your family."
1617	1621	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, if you believe that the advances in our technology are not good for our society, you might be misunderstanding. Computers have a positive impact on the people in our community. They enhance hand - eye coordination and enable us to seek and find information for learning. They also facilitate online communication. Hand - eye coordination is an essential daily skill. New technology, like computers, can help us develop this skill, so we should utilize it. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 stated, ""Computers do assist us significantly; nearly @PERCENT1 of active computer users improve their hand - eye coordination by using computers briefly each day."" Knowledge and education are crucial, especially in the present era. The more you learn, the higher your salary is likely to be. With new technology, you can earn degrees and acquire knowledge in a short time. My aunt obtained her @CAPS4 online about six months ago and got promoted at work as a result. Gaining knowledge online is beneficial for both adults and children. When they have a report on @CAPS5 or need homework help, these new technologies are among the most effective and fastest ways to learn and find information. @PERSON2, a doctor specializing in @CAPS6 emotions/feelings, said in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 last month, ""In this new millennium, preteens and teenagers love the new technological advances. If we want them to learn, we can use this tool."" Computers are also an excellent means of communication. They are fast and cost - free. I have an uncle in @LOCATION1, and due to the distance, we rarely meet in person. We stay in touch through social networks or emails, which is more economical than long - distance calls. Communication via computers is also beneficial for businesses. A company can contact customers to reschedule appointments, provide receipts, and advertise. In conclusion, computers are an essential and effective technology used worldwide. They improve hand - eye coordination, enable people to gain knowledge and education, and provide opportunities for communication. This is a great and useful advancement for communities globally."
1618	1622	1	2	There are numerous reasons why computers are a boon to the world. Firstly, they allow us to learn about distant places without leaving our homes. People from different countries may be curious about their origins, the governance, and economic situations of other countries. With computers, we can search the web and acquire knowledge much faster than through the news or weather channels. The speed of computers is remarkable. For instance, waiting for a stock update on the news channel can take ten or twenty minutes, while using the internet on a computer makes it quicker and easier. Also, news sources may not always be 100% accurate, and computers can provide more up - to - date and precise information. Secondly, computers help us stay in touch with family. Whether they live in a different country, state, or even next door, we can communicate with them. Webcams attached to or embedded in computers are a great way to interact. Once, my grandma was in the hospital, and as I was too young to visit, I used a webcam to see how she was doing. Webcams also prevent misunderstandings in discussions. For example, if your friend says something that might seem rude, you can tell whether she is being sarcastic when using a webcam. Lastly, computers teach us hand - eye coordination, a vital skill for success in life. It is useful for writing and in jobs that involve computers. Having good hand - eye coordination can open up a wide range of successful career opportunities. However, it's important to regularly update your computer to prevent it from becoming slow and crashing. In conclusion, computers are amazing machines that make life easier and more fun. They help us acquire knowledge, stay connected with family, and develop essential skills. Everyone in the world should have a computer to succeed in life.
1619	1623	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that people these days rely too heavily on technology. Everywhere you go, you see people on phones, texting, on computers, or using iPods. These individuals aren't necessarily bad, but they are under the control of technology. Computers, while seen by most as fast, easy, and fun, also pose problems. Not everyone has a computer, and people can become overly dependent and addicted to them. Although computers seem to work most of the time, they can be unreliable. Consider the large number of people using @CAPS4 or @CAPS5. With millions of users, the chances of a message reaching a friend reliably are not guaranteed. What if an important situation arises, and you can't reach a friend due to a system fault? You could end up waiting at the hospital for a ride home much longer than necessary. Another issue is the difficulty of contacting someone when you specifically need them. If you need to reach a person and they're not reachable via computer, calling may not work if they're outside with their dog. Also, relying on virtual thank - you cards instead of handmade ones may seem convenient, but a real, handmade card is more heartfelt. Addiction is a major problem. As I mentioned earlier, people are constantly attached to electronic devices. They no longer go outside to play like they used to. I admit that I use my computer frequently, but I manage my time to also go outside. Obesity and other problems can stem from overusing electronics. In conclusion, I believe that computers harm us more than they help, and we should reduce our dependence on them.
1620	1624	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION2, you may know that computers have been around since the @DATE1, and since then, many people's lives have improved. Computers are extremely helpful to the elderly. When they need to pay a bill, they can simply log in and complete the transaction. If they need to write a letter but their handwriting is poor, they can type and print it, ensuring the recipient can read it. Computers are a long - lasting and valuable technology. Doctor @PERSON2 of the @ORGANIZATION1 in @PERSON1 said, ""The children I work with use computers daily to develop hand - eye skills, and their skills have increased by @PERCENT1."" The corporate from @ORGANIZATION3 reported that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people agree that everyone should have a computer. Computers assist with projects, and I also think everyone should own one. If you're at home with nothing to do, consider buying a computer. They can do all sorts of things. If you like video games, you'll love computers as there are various game systems and websites available. A basic computer isn't too expensive, so there's no need to worry about the cost. Most college students have computers. They make research easier and faster. Instead of going to the library, you can simply search on the computer. When college students are stressed, they can play music from the computer to relax. In conclusion, computers have had a positive impact on the world, and I encourage you to buy one."
1621	1625	1	2	I firmly believe that computer technology has a positive impact on people. It can teach you to type faster, learn about distant places, and communicate with others online. Firstly, the computer can enhance your typing speed. For example, proficient typing skills can open up better job opportunities and secure a promising future. You can also send emails more quickly and improve your overall typing proficiency. Secondly, it allows you to learn about far - off places. You can explore other countries, understand their differences and similarities with your own. It is also useful for school projects, providing all the necessary information. Moreover, you can learn new things daily, such as news and weather. Thirdly, computers enable communication. You can check on friends and family, have fun chatting when bored, and plan outings with friends. In conclusion, computer technology is a great asset as it offers these benefits, and I hope others will also recognize its value.
1622	1626	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has made remarkable technological progress. Computers and other devices have contributed to this advancement. However, I believe that the computer, as a device, does not benefit society. One reason is the risk of cyberbullying. When using a computer, one can receive threatening emails, like someone checking their email at home and getting scared. Cyberbullying is an easy form of bullying that can make others feel bad with just a typed message. Another reason is that excessive computer use makes people miss out on real - life experiences. The average person spends @PERCENT1 of their day on the computer, and they often miss family time. For instance, my sister gets distracted during conversations because she is on @CAPS4. Lastly, the spell - check feature on @CAPS3 prevents users from learning grammar and spelling. Teenagers in @LOCATION1 often rely on spell - check when writing essays, which reduces their thinking ability. In conclusion, due to cyberbullying, loss of real - life experiences, and the lack of learning, computers have not truly benefited society, and their use should be reduced.
1623	1627	1	2	Dear local Newspaper, I think that using a computer has a negative influence on modern society. When people communicate via text or email, there is a lack of emotional connection. You can't see the person on the other side of the screen; all you know is their username, which is like wearing a disguise. Moreover, computers are harmful to health and a threat to privacy. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of teenagers use the internet more than three times a week, and more than half of teenagers in the @CAPS2.S.A spend over @NUM1 hours on computers, some even @NUM2 hours. It has become an addiction. My friend used to play outside but became addicted to @CAPS3, @CAPS4, MySpace, etc., and started coming outside less. Excessive computer use also leads to a drop in grades and makes people anti - social. In my opinion, computers are as bad as pouring gasoline on pancakes. In conclusion, computers have a detrimental impact on society and should be used more moderately.
1624	1628	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are a great asset to our society. They have a positive effect on people by teaching hand - eye coordination. For example, for piano players like me, computers help us look at the music while our fingers know where to play. They are also excellent for research. If a teacher assigns a paper on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and you can't go to the library, a computer allows you to research from home. It can also assist in vacation planning, like finding accommodation in @LOCATION1. Additionally, computers are great for communication. Through platforms like A.I.M., you can talk to friends and family. This year, my brother and cousin went to college, and computers let me stay connected with them. I can see pictures of their college life. In conclusion, computers benefit society by improving hand - eye coordination, facilitating research, and enabling communication. I hope the local newspaper will consider my opinion.
1625	1629	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I am writing to explain how more people in our society would benefit from using computers. They save time in work, allow for easy interaction, and provide entertainment. When it comes to work, say you need to write a five - page report with pictures and graphs. With a computer, you can type neatly, copy and paste images from the internet, and use graph - making software. Doing it by hand would be much more difficult. For communication, a computer enables you to chat with friends, either by text or video. You can talk to them regardless of location, and it's free. If you have a friend or relative far away, video conferencing is a great option. In terms of entertainment, you can play games or watch videos. Games can be played alone or with friends online, and videos can be watched without ads and paused at will. In conclusion, the benefits of using computers are significant. They simplify work, enhance interaction, and offer entertainment. Technology was made to make our lives easier, and we should take advantage of it.
1626	1630	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are an outstanding invention. They enable people to interact with those from distant locations. Computers offer a plethora of engaging games and serve as an excellent means to acquire information about various topics and far - off places. Maintaining communication with relatives from afar is of great significance. A significant @PERCENT1 of experts assert that a close - knit family increases children's likelihood of attending college. I can understand why some might question the value of computers. Growing up in a large family, I experienced the constant use of the phone throughout the day.  Some people might attribute children's weight issues to computers, but it is more about eating habits. Studies show that computer usage doubles in winter. Using the internet to learn new information is a valuable way to utilize resources. Consider a straight - A student who forgets to bring home the most crucial book for a major project. Without a computer, she may be in a panic, hyperventilating and searching everywhere. However, with a computer, she could complete the project and enter her dream college. Without one, she might fail the class, miss out on admission to Harvard, and settle for a local community college.  In conclusion, I have provided compelling reasons to purchase a computer. It allows kids to interact with distant relatives, offers fun games, and can facilitate academic success. The decision is yours, and I hope you choose to embrace the benefits of computers.
1627	1631	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am convinced that computers can have a positive impact. When considering their capabilities, computers can assist in learning through the numerous programs available. For instance, if one needs tutoring or advice, it can all be found on a computer. There are also websites and programs suitable for young children, which are both enjoyable and educational.  Some people complain that computers reduce time for exercise and interaction with family and friends. But if family members live far away, computers provide a means to stay in touch. Moreover, it is possible to exercise while using a computer.  If we can demonstrate that computers are educational and aid in learning, people may change their perception of them. With the current technological advancements, computers are far from being bad. There are tutoring programs and even online college courses.  For children, friends, or siblings looking for games, computers offer a wealth of fun learning games and websites. While they have fun, they are also learning, which can positively impact their school performance.  For those with family living at a distance, computers are an ideal way to maintain contact. Chatting, checking on each other, and seeing how everyone is doing can be easily achieved. A webcam can further enhance this connection, allowing face - to - face interaction.  In conclusion, after sharing my views on the positive aspects of computers, I hope you will agree that they are actually very helpful and not as bad as some may think.
1628	1632	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I am of the opinion that computers have a positive influence on our country. There are four main reasons for this: communication, @CAPS2, entertainment, and @CAPS3.  One of my favorite activities is talking. When my best friend moved away and I lost his phone number, I thought our communication was over. However, he sent me a friend request on Facebook, and since then, we have been communicating through platforms like Facebook, MySpace, and Skype.  Regarding @CAPS2, at my dad's house, I don't have a television, so I rely on the internet to stay informed about world events. For example, the website @CAPS4.com was the first to announce @PERSON1's death before anyone suspected it. Many news stories break on the internet first.  Entertainment is another significant benefit of computers. One can watch videos, play games, listen to music, and communicate with friends.  In terms of @CAPS3, many jobs in our community, such as accountant, manager, software designer, and computer programmer, require computer skills. Computers make these jobs more efficient by correcting mistakes, providing visual aids, and facilitating typing.  In conclusion, based on these reasons, it is evident that computers have a positive impact on our community in multiple aspects.
1629	1633	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, there is a great deal of concern regarding computers and whether people spend too much time in front of the screen. I firmly believe that people should be more mindful of their computer usage. Instead of straining their eyes, they should engage in exercise, enjoy nature, and spend time with family and friends.  Exercise is a vital part of everyone's life. Insufficient exercise can lead to obesity, which may cause people to face discrimination. However, regular exercise can help avoid such discrimination as one will look as good as or better than the average person.  Rather than fixating on the computer screen, one should take advantage of opportunities to observe the stars with a telescope at night or take a walk in the woods on a sunny day. Nature is far more beautiful than a digital representation of it. If one sees an image of a plant on the computer, it is much better to experience the plant in person.  Although there are computer programs that allow people to see each other, face - to - face communication is far more preferable. @PERCENT1 of the population in @LOCATION1 stated that they would rather talk to friends or relatives in person than on a computer screen.  In conclusion, I hope it is clear that exercise, experiencing nature, and interacting with people in real life are far superior to spending a lifetime in front of a computer.
1630	1634	1	2	"Have you ever had a computer help you answer a difficult question or type up an essay for school or work? For years, computers have been of great assistance to me, so I have no intention of getting rid of them. However, there is a controversy. Many experts believe that computers do not benefit society, while I and others hold the opposite view.  Owning a computer offers numerous benefits. It is an endless source of information. Unlike books, a computer contains the opinions, ideas, and facts of people with varying levels of intelligence. For example, I once watched a movie about a man who disliked computers and new technology. He spent most of his life wandering the world in search of a rare artifact called the @CAPS1 diamond but failed. His son, however, used the internet and discovered that the root ""geo"" in @CAPS1 meant underground in ancient @CAPS2 culture. Thanks to the computer, he found the diamond beneath the ancient @CAPS2 temples.  Computers also enable online communication. They allow us to stay in touch with family and friends, regardless of distance. Many soldiers use computers to communicate with their loved ones back home.  In school and at work, computers are indispensable. Whether it's answering homework questions, researching for a project, making brochures, or typing essays, computers are always there to help. Even those with messy handwriting can benefit by choosing the type of ""handwriting"" for their documents.  Although some experts argue that computers can be addictive, I firmly believe that they benefit society. They are a reliable source of information, a means of communication, and a valuable tool for work. So, take my advice and continue using your computer."
1631	1635	1	2	I've noticed an ongoing argument about whether computers have a positive impact on people. In my view, computers do have a positive effect. With computers, people can access necessary information, communicate with friends and family globally, and learn new things.  For students, whether in college or elementary school, computers are almost always the go - to when working on class projects. Without computers, students might struggle to obtain the required information, potentially leading to poor grades on projects and a downward spiral in their academic performance.  Adults rely on computers for work and planning. The absence of computers could cost thousands of people their jobs. They might also forget important scheduled plans, which could cause financial hardships for families, such as an inability to pay bills and even the loss of their homes, forcing them onto the streets.  In terms of communication, most people have friends or relatives living far away. Staying in touch via long - distance calls can be expensive. However, computers allow people to communicate with loved ones worldwide without incurring extra phone costs. Moreover, in case of an emergency involving a family member or in the area where a relative lives, the internet can be used to check on their well - being.  Many parents use computers to prepare their children for school from an early age. Schools also primarily use computers to educate students about future - relevant knowledge. Computers are daily tools for learning important life skills, whether for school, college, or work. This self - sufficiency in learning means we can assist others when needed.  In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. They help us acquire information for school or work, keep us connected with friends and family globally, and teach us important life lessons. They are essential in helping us avoid potential losses and maintain our quality of life.
1632	1636	1	2	When considering @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1, it becomes evident that computers offer significant benefits to society. They are a valuable asset for learning and knowledge acquisition.  For students, computers enhance work efficiency. When typing a report, the spell - check feature on computers helps correct spelling mistakes. Additionally, if a student encounters an unfamiliar word, they can simply visit @LOCATION1, type in the word, and instantly obtain its definition.  In the case of a book report, although direct copying and pasting may not be allowed, the computer still serves as a useful reference. Compared to writing on paper, it provides easier access to information.  Computers also create new job opportunities. People with physical limitations that prevent them from standing, walking, or talking can find employment in computer - related fields. Moreover, they have replaced some traditional jobs while generating new ones.  From an environmental perspective, computers are a more sustainable option. Teachers can receive emails without wasting paper, even though computers do consume electricity. Saving trees is a crucial environmental benefit.  For college students, commuting can be time - consuming. With a computer, they can attend online classes, eliminating the need for daily travel. And there's no need to buy a backpack as all study materials can be stored digitally.  In summary, computers are a remarkable invention. They have made life more efficient, environmentally friendly, and have even contributed to job creation. Each computer purchase not only benefits the user but also provides economic opportunities for others. Investing in computers is a wise decision as they continue to improve our lives in multiple ways.
1633	1637	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are incredibly helpful and useful to us. They offer a wide range of entertainment options, facilitate communication, and aid in learning.  On a rainy or cold day when going outside is not an option, the computer becomes a source of entertainment. We can watch movies, play games, and engage in web - chatting. Health expert @PERSON1 states that computer usage is acceptable as long as it is limited to about an hour or an hour and a half per day. Some people blame computers for a lack of exercise, but it's not the computer's fault; it's a matter of personal choice.  In modern times, computers have revolutionized communication. We can call, text, or page others. With a webcam, we can have video chats and exchange videos. Social media platforms like Facebook and MySpace allow us to connect with friends. Sociologist @PERSON2 notes that more people are using @CAPS1 websites to communicate with their friends. @CAPS2 also mentions that @CAPS1 websites are great for staying in touch with distant friends, although face - to - face interaction is still irreplaceable.  Computers are also excellent learning tools. They can answer almost any question we have. For example, if we search for information about a topic, we can find a wealth of knowledge on the internet.  Some people still think that computers are bad and cause a lack of exercise. However, I believe that people have the ability to make choices. Overusing the computer is a personal decision, and too much of anything is harmful. In today's world, computers are an indispensable part of our lives and are irreplaceable.
1634	1638	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, as you may be aware, an increasing number of people are using computers. In my opinion, computers bring numerous benefits to society.  One of the major advantages is communication. Through computers, people can easily send messages to one another. Even those without a phone or car can go online, write a message, and send it with a click. This makes it convenient to communicate with someone living on the other side of the world. Additionally, if we have family members living far away, we can share pictures of ourselves, our friends, and the places we've visited. They can reciprocate by sending their own pictures.  Computers also promote learning. The internet is a vast repository of knowledge, allowing us to search for any topic imaginable. For instance, if we type the word 'dog' on @ORGANIZATION1, we'll be directed to multiple websites with detailed information about dogs, including different breeds, their lifespan, habitats, and care instructions. It enables us to explore new things and generate ideas.  When we're bored, the computer is a great companion. If bad weather or an injury prevents us from going outside, we can play computer games, listen to music online, or write stories. Playing computer games can improve our gaming skills and keep us occupied. Online music platforms like @CAPS3 offer a wide selection of songs, which is better than relying on the radio where we may not like the currently playing song. And if we're in the mood to write, we can use a word document to express our thoughts.  In conclusion, the computer is a fascinating tool. It enables communication, learning, and entertainment. However, we should also remember to balance our computer use with outdoor activities and spending time with friends and family.
1635	1639	1	2	In today's world, computers have become a common household item. While some people believe they have a negative impact on society, in reality, they are one of our most useful tools.  Computers provide easy access to information. In the past, people spent hours searching through books to find what they needed. Now, all it takes is typing a query and hitting the enter key. This not only improves children's grades but also makes adult life more convenient, allowing us to solve problems without leaving home. It also helps spread news instantly.  They are also great for skill - building. They can help children develop social and decision - making skills. Moreover, they teach skills such as web design, time management, and business skills.  Online video gaming is a significant industry. It offers a wide range of activities like dancing, building, fighting, and more. A large number (@NUM1) of games are suitable for different age groups (@NUM2). Gaming also improves hand - eye coordination and brings happiness on tough days.  Computers create an interactive platform where people from around the world can ask questions, share opinions, and compare responses. We can also gather statistics to make important life decisions.  In conclusion, computers are essential. They not only provide information but also prepare us for the future. They offer entertainment and connection, making our lives more fulfilling. With a bit of self - control, computers can help us achieve our dreams.
1636	1640	1	2	People consider the computer to be a wonderful and useful device. It is wonderful because it can assist in various aspects. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, when at school with homework, work, projects, or similar tasks, the computer is extremely helpful. One can access the internet on the computer and visit Google or other websites. Secondly, the computer is useful at home. For instance, if there is a major issue with the car, one can go to @LOCATION1 on the computer to view the car's parts. Thirdly, in modern times, the computer enables people to accomplish almost anything. By accessing the web, life can be made more convenient. One can now handle work, homework, projects, generate ideas, write books, chat, obtain information, print pictures, and so on. If one is an architect, they can create their own designs. Clearly, the computer is truly amazing. However, some individuals misuse the computer for inappropriate purposes, such as accessing pornography, which is neither acceptable nor suitable. In my opinion, the computer is a remarkable and highly intelligent tool. It is almost a necessity in our lives, not for survival but for enhancing the quality of life. For example, one can use the webcam to see family members, which is truly wonderful. However, the webcam should not be used for improper activities. One can also learn new things from the computer. Therefore, the computer should be used for positive purposes, and we should appreciate its value.
1637	1641	1	2	Dear local newspaper, technology, especially computer technology, is an indispensable part of daily life and even the lifestyle of many people. Without it, humanity would be at a loss. Computers enable people to learn about distant places and individuals, conduct research with a broader range of information, and for some, communicate with friends and family. Whether people realize it or not, technology is essential in everyone's life. The capabilities of a computer are virtually limitless, and in terms of technological advancements, this is merely the beginning. The internet allows people to learn more than what can be obtained from a library book. One can learn about the culture of @LOCATION1, the cuisine in @LOCATION2, or the dressing styles in @LOCATION3. Additionally, one can find pictures of far - off places and learn about a country's currency. One of the key functions of a computer is research, which can make tasks like giving a presentation much easier. Moreover, the computer facilitates communication. For some, it is the only means of staying in touch. If one has a pen - pal in another state or country, email is a quick, easy, and enjoyable way to communicate. Others prefer instant messaging, where messages appear almost immediately on the other person's screen. In conclusion, without technology, people would be unable to learn as much as they desire, conduct research for school projects, or communicate with others effectively. And this is just a glimpse of how difficult life would be without computers.
1638	1642	1	2	To the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, in today's world, computer technology has a dominant position. It is the source of our news, music, shopping, and entertainment. While this may seem great, there are significant drawbacks. Firstly, computers are taking over people's lives and reducing physical activity. Nowadays, people are becoming increasingly lazy. Instead of going outside to play soccer with friends at the nearby field, they prefer to stay in front of their computer screens, playing games like Grand Theft Auto or stalking others on Facebook. @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 population goes without physical activity for at least a @DATE1 and a half, and @PERCENT2 of them choose to stay at home on their computers. This is unacceptable and must be stopped. Secondly, as computers become more popular, human interaction is decreasing. People can now do almost everything from their computers, and there are even cases where people marry computer characters. For example, a man recently married a character in a computer game, with a priest present. This shows the sad state of our society. Finally, computers are expensive. One has to pay a large amount, such as @MONEY1, to purchase a computer, and then there are numerous maintenance costs. Computers are prone to problems, like freezing and losing important work. For instance, @DATE1, my dad had to pay @MONEY2 to fix my computer, and it froze again a week later, causing him great frustration. Overall, the cons of computers far outweigh the pros, and it is not worth the trouble.
1639	1643	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on society. People are spending excessive time on computers, reducing their exercise time, and losing interaction with family and friends. I often find myself thinking about the computer as soon as I get home from school, almost like an addiction. People are so engrossed in social networks that they miss out on opportunities to meet new people in the real world. Moreover, computers are causing a decline in physical activity. I've been to a friend's place where we just played computer games instead of going outside to enjoy nature. Many @CAPS1 don't make healthy food choices, and the computer is a major reason they don't exercise. I've seen my little brother spend an entire Saturday in front of the computer, eating and playing games, which is clearly unhealthy. Finally, computers take time away from family and friends. I've spent whole after - school days in my room on the computer, thinking it's okay to talk to friends online. As a result, I've neglected helping my family and lost touch with real - life friendships. In conclusion, these three reasons - excessive computer use, reduced exercise, and loss of social interaction - demonstrate that computers are harmful to society. I hope you will seriously consider these issues and think about the impact of computers on @CAPS1.
1640	1644	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, in the present era, either individuals own computers or laptops. Both devices serve similar functions and are extremely useful. They can assist with numerous tasks that other means cannot. For example, they can help in finding long - lost siblings or other people one wishes to locate. However, there are risks associated with computers. One can get into trouble or face problems if not careful while using them. A woman once said that she tried to find her brother using a computer while at her mother's house. Computer - accessible websites like Facebook and MySpace can be helpful in such searches, but this can also have an impact on personal and social values. It can transform one's life in an instant, turning a difficult time into a positive one by helping to find loved ones. On the other hand, there are significant risks. One might attempt to pay bills online and send money to the wrong websites, leading to identity theft. People may also share excessive personal information such as phone numbers and addresses, which can make them vulnerable to being contacted by malicious individuals who may deceive or even harm them. Some people may think using a computer is simple and safe, but it is not. Additionally, computers are contributing to a change in people's behavior. Many people now prefer to shop online rather than go out, and they often choose to stay at home and play games instead of engaging in physical activities. Overall, while computers are useful, one must be cautious and aware of the potential drawbacks.
1641	1645	1	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, on @DATE1, computers have become an integral part of our society as a technological advancement, bringing certain positive effects. Nevertheless, their negative impacts on people are more prominent. They reduce @CAPS3 time, impede family interaction, and hinder people from experiencing the real world.  Firstly, computers have a negative influence on people by diminishing @CAPS3 time. People are so engrossed in computers that their motivation for @CAPS3 fades. According to a @ORGANIZATION3 survey in @DATE2, a @CAPS1 person spending @NUM1 hours on the computer per week (approximately @NUM2 hours daily) experienced an increase in cholesterol and muscle deterioration. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 stated, ""Computers distract people from their physical needs. A @CAPS1 person requires about one to two hours of physical activity daily, yet only @NUM2 out of @NUM4 people achieve this amount."" The main culprit? ""Technology,"" she said, specifically ""@CAPS2 computers, which rob people of the motivation and time needed for @CAPS3."" @CAPS3 is essential, but computers are depriving society of it. People should not suffer from poor @ORGANIZATION1 due to the negative impact of computers.  Secondly, computers have a negative effect on people as they erode family interaction. Family @CAPS4 @ORGANIZATION3 reports that @NUM5 out of @NUM4 people claim computers encroach on their family time. This is far from ideal, especially since a @CAPS1 person needs at least @NUM7 hours of family interaction for a healthy mental state. Children are directly affected by computer use at home. When computer time takes over, it also cuts off communication, which is crucial for a child's development. As a result, family bonds and relationships are damaged. Clearly, computers have a negative impact on people in terms of family interaction.  Lastly, computers have a negative effect on people because they prevent people from engaging with the real world. When using a computer, it may seem that the whole world is on the screen, but that's an illusion. This has a negative impact on people. My physcology.net indicates that @PERCENT1 of people who use computers for about @NUM2 hours a day on average have become withdrawn and oblivious to their surroundings. The solution? Traveling or taking walks in nature can help. People need to be aware of the world they live in. They must make important decisions for themselves, their children, and even their country, and staring at a computer screen won't assist at all. This is particularly harmful to children, the next generation. If people continue their negative computer - using habits, children will have little knowledge or a clear view of the world.  In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people. They reduce @CAPS3 time, leading to increased poor @ORGANIZATION1 and a greater need for @CAPS3. They disrupt family interaction by destroying relationships and communication. Finally, they prevent people from experiencing the real world, which is important for decision - making and the future of generations. People should recognize these negative effects and significantly reduce their computer usage."
1642	1646	1	2	Computers have a huge impact on people's lives. They can be both helpful and distracting. I have a computer, but I can only use it after finishing my homework. I do a lot of things on it, mostly playing games and using social websites like MySpace.  Computers are helpful. They can assist with homework or help us find information. I often use my computer for school projects or when I'm not familiar with a subject. They're also great for communicating with friends and family. I talk to my family in @LOCATION1 a lot. I go on MySpace about five times a week.  However, computers can also be a distraction. They make people lazy and there are bad websites. For example, MySpace can be dangerous. If you share important information with strangers, it can turn out badly. A lot of my family members only get up to use the computer or play video games. They spend about eight hours on it. My mom uses the computer to go on @CAPS1. She talks to many of her friends from @LOCATION1, especially her older sister. She spends about @NUM2 minutes to an hour on it.  I think computers can be useful in life, but spending eight hours a day on them is too much. My cousins are getting fatter (not taller). So, don't spend almost half a day on the computer.
1643	1647	1	2	Dear newspaper, technology is a double - edged sword. It is a useful tool, yet it can make people lazy. A computer, in particular, is a multi - purpose device that allows users to access any website for various reasons, such as research or personal use.  First, it's important to acknowledge that computers are indeed valuable multi - purpose tools. However, they can also make people sluggish or lazy. I hold this view because many people choose to sit in front of a computer instead of being physically active. Physical activity is beneficial and crucial for people. A large number of individuals are inactive because they spend excessive time on the computer. Some students even go home and immediately turn on the computer instead of doing their homework.  On the other hand, computers offer numerous advantages. They can help with bill payment, research, or simply provide entertainment through games. There is an endless number of websites available to meet various needs. For instance, uploading family pictures from a vacation is easy with most computer software.  In essence, a computer is like a blank canvas, waiting for a spark of inspiration. While it has its benefits, it's essential to use it in moderation to avoid the negative effects of inactivity and distraction.
1644	1648	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper, computers have a positive impact on people. With a computer, one can accomplish a wide range of tasks. It offers abundant information, communication opportunities, and entertainment. The only reason some people perceive computers as unhealthy or negative is that some individuals abuse their ""computer - time.""  Take the popular website www.google.com as an example. When you need information, sites like this are incredibly useful. You simply type a word, and hundreds or thousands of links with relevant information appear. How can access to such a vast amount of knowledge be considered unhealthy or have a negative impact? Computers also contain dictionaries, references, translators, encyclopedias, and history pages filled with extensive information. So, go ahead and expand your knowledge!  Social networking websites like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 provide a new way to communicate with friends and family. These platforms are equipped with safety tools and settings. You can reconnect with long - lost friends or family members and quickly catch up. Admittedly, some people misuse these websites by posting harmful or inappropriate content. But this problem can be easily resolved by reporting such behavior to the website manager or an adult. As long as you know how to stay safe online, you can enjoy messages from family and friends.  There is a wide variety of entertainment on the computer. Video - sharing websites like www.youtube.com and gaming websites like www.onemorelevel.com offer games, videos, and even learning aids. There are also sites where you can buy music, movies, clothes, and furniture. Many stores have online platforms where you can purchase items and have them delivered to your doorstep. How could this be a bad thing? Additionally, there are computer - specific video games that you can buy and install for instant entertainment. Who wouldn't want to play games or shop without having to go out? My aunts certainly enjoy it.  In conclusion, computers are not negative unless you abuse your ""computer - time"" and waste countless hours without purpose. You need to set a limit. Spending all day on a computer is just not right. So, have fun, learn, communicate, and entertain yourself, but use the computer wisely."
1645	1649	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, computers generally have more negative effects on people than positive ones. This is evident as people are not getting enough exercise, not appreciating the beauty of nature, and not spending sufficient time with family and friends. While computers are useful to have at home, their over - use has become a problem.  Firstly, people are spending excessive time on computers, which is detrimental to their health. When on the computer, they are not engaging in physical activity. Obesity is a major concern for the @ORGANIZATION1, and sitting in front of a computer all day doesn't help. Any person concerned about health, even those not very tech - savvy, would agree that the hours spent on the computer are harmful to the nation's health.  Secondly, people are spending too much time on computers and neglecting the beauty of nature. Many adults and others have @DATE1 because they are focused on the virtual world instead of exploring the real one. There is so much beauty in nature that people should be grateful for and eager to experience. They should not miss out on these wonderful things.  Finally, although communication is important, instead of chatting on the computer, people should make plans with their family and friends. This also ties in with the lack of exercise and people's disconnect from reality. If people went out and enjoyed nature with their loved ones, they wouldn't waste so many hours on a computer. Life is too short to sit around all day. Any intelligent person would recognize that spending time with family and friends is more enjoyable than sitting in front of a computer.  In conclusion, computers have been over - used recently. Instead of dealing with health problems, lack of sunlight, and dull computer conversations, people should get up and live life to the fullest. We only have one life, and it should be lived to its fullest potential.
1646	1650	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I often wonder what one would do without a computer. In my view, life would be severely limited. If, like me, your family resides in another country, a computer allows you to see and converse with them via a camera, creating an almost tangible sense of presence. Computers are not time - wasters; they enhance our understanding of family bonds.  Computers are of utmost importance for several reasons. Firstly, they offer information about places that pique our interest and their cultures. Many people have a thirst for exploration but are constrained by time or work. No one should miss out on opportunities just because they lack the time or access to a computer.  Secondly, computers are essential for work. Office workers may need information about a disaster - struck area, including how it occurred and the conditions at the time. Those in important positions rely on computers to save their work, preventing data loss and potential job loss.  Lastly, computers help with organization. Being organized is crucial for job retention and having everything at hand. Instead of dealing with piles of papers, you can store all your documents on a single digital page, accessible only to you.  As you can observe, many computer users employ them productively. Computers are not merely a pastime; they facilitate various tasks for our future, not just for making new friends. These are the main reasons why having a computer at home and using it productively is highly advisable.
1647	1651	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION2, computers are an incredibly helpful resource. They assist people in navigating through life, enabling them to find jobs and conduct school research. The world would be unrecognizable without computers. However, some individuals do spend excessive time on them, but that is their personal choice.  Computers are a boon for students. Instead of spending hours at the local library searching for books, they can simply type in their research topic, and a plethora of websites will appear. A computer truly puts the world at your fingertips.  For unemployed individuals, computers are a valuable tool for job - hunting. It's as easy as typing in the desired work city, and one can even fill out job applications instantly. Moreover, many people now work from home. Stay - at - home moms can earn money while doing daily chores like washing dishes. Working from home is also less stressful as there is no need to deal with annoying and impatient colleagues. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of employment is from workers' homes? Now you do. Working from home blurs the line between the office and home.  Computers have come a long way since prehistoric times. Without them, we would lack many basic amenities like stoplights, elevators, and blenders, as well as more sophisticated inventions such as rockets, cars, and planes. Imagine an airport, a school, or the government trying to store their information on paper. This would lead to a significant deforestation of @ORGANIZATION1.  Computers also benefit the environment. They will aid in the invention of more advanced technologies, perhaps enabling us to live on @CAPS2 in the future.  I hope this essay has changed your perspective on computers. To recap, they help students with research, assist people in finding jobs, allow for remote work, and are environmentally friendly. Without computers, we would be living in caves, much like cavemen. In conclusion, computers are extremely helpful.
1648	1652	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are a great asset as every developed country utilizes them. They promote learning, facilitate communication, and are commercially significant. Additionally, they make life easier for numerous people.  Computers promote learning by providing vast amounts of information. Personally, I keep myself informed about world events by simply visiting yahoo.com. They also allow me to learn about new @NUM1 and different cultures around the world. Moreover, computers inform us about daily life, such as how to remove a stain, pronounce a word, or cook a new dish.  In terms of communication, computers are crucial. We use them to chat with friends on Facebook and meet new people. Since almost everyone uses computers, the possibilities of meeting others are endless.  From a commercial perspective, computers are highly beneficial. They help small businesses gain visibility, allowing domestic sellers and large companies to compete for the same customers. The internet also serves as a cyber - billboard, generating substantial income for people.  In conclusion, computers are useful due to their contributions to learning, communication, and commerce. Therefore, they should be supported rather than being looked down upon.
1649	1653	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, have you ever spent more than an hour continuously on the computer? I believe computers have a negative impact on people. They can damage your eyesight, reduce your time spent playing outside, and make it difficult to communicate with others in person.  When you finally get off the computer, do your eyes hurt? Whether you're playing games or typing articles, your eyes strain to focus on the small fonts on websites. I recall reading an online novel once, and while my body was eager to play, my eyes were exhausted.  Instead of playing sports games on the computer, you should go outside and play. When you're on the computer, you're usually indoors. Did you know that a person should spend at least @NUM1 minutes outside to get their daily dose of vitamin @CAPS3? Sitting in front of a computer screen won't provide you with the necessary vitamins.  Do you find it easier to talk to someone on the computer than in person? You're not alone. If you step away from the computer and have face - to - face conversations, you can improve your social skills. It may be challenging at first, but it's definitely worth it in the long run.  By now, it's clear that computers don't have a positive effect. They harm your vision, limit your outdoor activities, and impede in - person communication. So, put down the mouse and engage in some hands - on activities.
1650	1654	1	2	Computers do not bring overall benefits to society today. They have made technology a necessity, led to people spending insufficient time on other activities, and pose risks to health.  Do we really want a world where people are constantly glued to their computer screens? While computers are helpful, they can be addictive. They were initially designed to make tasks quicker and easier, like online shopping and searching on Google. However, in this generation, computers have become a necessity rather than a source of pleasure. According to @PERSON1, a psychologist at the @ORGANIZATION1, more than @PERCENT1 of people now spend a large amount of time on their computers indoors.  Computers are also making people lazier. Instead of going to the store to buy things or walking to a friend's house to talk, people use the computer. As a result, they don't spend enough time on other activities. On a sunny day, one would expect kids to be outside having fun, but those old enough to use a computer often stay indoors. Although there are enjoyable things to do on a computer, such as chatting with friends and checking emails, time on the computer should be limited. The time spent on the computer could be better used outside or at the movies. Moreover, not relying so much on the computer could support small businesses. Paying for activities, purchases, or entertainment would boost their profits.  In addition, computers are detrimental to health. Mac magazine reports that there are health risks associated with excessive computer use. @PERCENT2 of people become obese and have vitamin @CAPS1 deficiency due to long - term computer use. Instead of using the computer, one could be working out or exercising. Also, staying indoors all the time means not getting enough sunlight, leading to vitamin @CAPS1 deficiency. Prolonged computer use can also cause permanent eye damage.  In conclusion, it is evident that computers do not benefit society today. Many people are addicted to technology, time is not being used wisely, and health is at risk. Although computers make task - completion easier, overusing them will have consequences for everyone.
1651	1655	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on people. Currently, many adults and most kids lack sufficient exercise and fail to spend quality time with their families. Some parents are less engaged with their children. Kids often neglect their homework as they are constantly on the computer upon returning home.  Both adults and kids are becoming less physically active. Merely sitting and reading or performing other tasks on the computer does not constitute exercise. They tend to eat, sit, get hungry again, eat, and sit some more, which can lead to weight gain. The claim that moving the mouse provides finger and arm exercise is unfounded. Staring at the computer screen all day can cause significant hand problems.  Moreover, people are not spending time with their families. They sit in front of the computer, ignoring everything and everyone around them. Kids could be enjoying other activities, and parents could be outside playing catch with their kids or engaging in board games. Instead of going out and having fun with friends, people communicate with them through computers, Facebook, or MySpace.  Kids are also failing in school because they choose to use the computer instead of doing their homework. In conclusion, it is evident that computers have a negative effect on both kids and adults, and steps should be taken to reduce their excessive use.
1652	1656	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, in my view, the computer is an excellent invention as it allows us to do a wide range of things, such as playing games. There are three main reasons why one should own a computer. Firstly, it enables us to talk online with friends. We can use this feature to discuss homework, find out meeting times, or learn about party schedules. It is also a great way to stay in touch with friends and family who live far away around @LOCATION2. Secondly, the computer is essential for doing homework. We may need it to print pictures for reports or type them during vacations. It also helps us find historical information and @CAPS2 books online, facilitating the completion of homework and projects. Lastly, the computer helps us find out various @LOCATION1 - related things. We can learn about the age of @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the height of @ORGANIZATION1, how to spell big words, and the routes to @LOCATION1, @CAPS5 beach, or other places. We can even locate the wall of @LOCATION3. In conclusion, if you enjoy learning @LOCATION1 - related things, talking online, and performing other tasks, then a computer is a must - have.
1653	1657	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am convinced that a large number of people currently use computers, and this number will continue to grow in the future. Computers have become a standard in the business world, and people rely heavily on them. Many individuals now require internet access on their cellphones to keep track of stocks, shipments, and important emails. Some computers are used for home purposes, enabling people to contact family members and obtain information that they need immediately or cannot find elsewhere. Computers are constantly evolving, becoming faster and more efficient with each passing day. It is highly likely that they will never become obsolete. However, this does not mean that computers will permanently restrict us from other activities. While it is true that some people spend excessive time on computers, not everyone does. Some individuals work from home using computers as it is their job. We should consider the reasons why computers are so widely used and understand that they are designed to help, not harm, people. Computers simplify tasks and are extremely useful for gathering information. I firmly support the use of computers and strongly disagree that they have a negative impact on human life. For example, people would not typically look up every piece of information they need in a book because they are only searching for specific facts. It is much easier to compare and contrast information on a computer than to read multiple books. Therefore, computers save us a significant amount of time. In conclusion, computers enhance our lives rather than causing harm.
1654	1658	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on people around the world today. Firstly, computers make people less active. Most individuals prefer to stay at home and use the computer rather than engage in outdoor activities. Secondly, communicating through computers restricts people from expressing emotions. People should interact face - to - face rather than through a machine. Finally, excessive computer use contributes to the obesity problem. @CAPS4 is one of the most obese places globally, and people spend their days sitting in front of the computer, eating, and not moving, which leads to weight gain. People use the computer for hours every day, and there are numerous online options such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and ooVoo. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people claim they “need” to check these daily, but this is not necessary. As @PERSON1 said, “@CAPS3 is the easiest way” to communicate, but it is also the most boring. Communicating through a computer does not allow us to show emotions. We should go out, hang out with friends, or even call each other to have more meaningful conversations. To address these issues, people should limit their computer usage to an hour or less if possible. In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on people by making them less active, reducing emotional communication, and causing obesity. I urge everyone to join me in promoting more outdoor activities and a healthier lifestyle.
1655	1659	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I would like to share my views on computers. On one hand, computers are becoming increasingly advanced. In recent years, computer companies have made remarkable progress, enabling people to do almost anything. Computers are a valuable tool for any home. They are especially beneficial for small business owners, who can easily update their stores online, design colorful posters to attract customers, and increase business. They also allow people to book flights weeks or months in advance, which is convenient for busy travelers. We can use websites like @ORGANIZATION2 to explore the world and zoom in on famous landmarks such as the great @CAPS1 in @LOCATION2 or the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 in @LOCATION1. Additionally, typing on a computer can improve hand - eye coordination, and mastering typing skills can make tasks more efficient compared to working on paper. Some people can even type without looking at the keyboard. Computers are also excellent for communication. We can use @CAPS4 to talk to relatives who live in other states or countries. On the other hand, many people argue that people spend too much time on computers. They do not get enough exercise and do not spend sufficient time with their families. I agree with this to some extent. I know some friends who spend about six hours a day on computers, which is excessive. Parents also sometimes neglect their kids by being too busy on the computer with work. Some kids become so addicted to computers that they may become unhealthy and obese from excessive sitting. In conclusion, while computers have many benefits, it is important to use them in moderation to avoid their negative impacts.
1656	1660	1	2	Hello, everyone. I've noticed that many people claim computers are bad, stating that individuals spend excessive time on them, neglecting outdoor activities and family time. However, I'm writing today to highlight the numerous benefits of computers. Firstly, computers have significantly advanced technology, enabling us to accomplish tasks previously unimaginable. We can now chat with overseas friends for free, research fat - burning methods and diet programs, and share photos with family and friends. Computers have empowered people to do countless good things. Secondly, they've helped us achieve remarkable feats, such as moon landings, the development of cell phones, and the treatment of some diseases. Although computers can pose risks to those who use them incorrectly, this issue can be resolved as technology advances. The progress we're making is truly astonishing. There are so many more advantages of computers that I could discuss, but space is limited. Lastly, computers make research easier and faster. In my school, we use computers for learning, and they've been extremely helpful. I've personally learned a great deal from them, even using them to improve my math skills for exams. I'm even using computers to learn a new language. It's unfair to assume that all computer users are lazy, overweight, and neglect their families. So, let's stop this unfounded criticism. Spending too much time on computers shouldn't be our primary concern at the moment. That's all I have to say. Goodbye.
1657	1661	1	2	I recall a time when computers weren't popular. Back then, I had to write essays by hand and listen to the radio for music. Now, computers are ubiquitous, and I firmly believe they have a positive impact on people. Students rely on them for schoolwork, they can be used for various other purposes, and they're easily accessible. Most students use computers to type college essays and projects, which is much more convenient. For example, as a student who can't draw, I printed pictures from the computer for my poster. Many colleges require students to submit assignments electronically. Failing to do so results in a zero, which is a waste of money since you're still paying for the course. So, computers can prevent academic failure. People also use computers for entertainment, like messaging on social networks. It's amazing to reconnect with long - lost friends. Additionally, the internet allows us to find better deals. For instance, flight tickets are often cheaper online than when booked through a traditional agency. Given the current economic situation, these savings are crucial. Computers are everywhere, at school, home, cafes, and even on cell phones. At home, I can spend hours playing games on my laptop. When my laptop broke, I was able to use the computer at the library for free. In conclusion, computers are essential. Students need them, they offer various uses, and they're easily accessible. I can't imagine life without them in this fast - paced generation.
1658	1662	1	2	"Dear local newspaper, computers are having a more detrimental than beneficial impact on society. A boy named @PERSON1 bought a computer and subsequently developed numerous health problems. His computer, which he thought would be helpful, turned out to be the opposite. His health deteriorated, with symptoms like shortness of breath, high blood pressure, and weight gain. He spent so much time on the internet that he neglected exercise and family time. In my opinion, computers are a waste of time, can harm education, and lead to poor health. According to a health magazine, using a computer for two to three hours can cause a loss of @PERCENT1 of brain cells, and these cells can't be regained, which is a significant drawback for education. After speaking with people on the streets, @PERSON2, a policeman, said, ""I enjoy using the computer, but I often start at @TIME1 and end up spending @NUM1 hours on it. It can be very unsafe and unhealthy."" @PERSON3, a well - known female rapper, also stated that ""Computers are okay, but they're sometimes just a waste of time. Instead of playing games online, you could be studying for a test or doing homework."" Computers can show new things, but overall, they're a waste of time. We should interact with our families and friends in person instead of being glued to the screen."
1659	1663	1	2	Dear Newspaper, while some may think people can use computers non - stop, I disagree. There are many negative consequences, such as spending less time with family, getting addicted, and becoming unhealthy. People who are constantly on the computer often forget about their families. I remember when I was young, I was so engrossed in the computer that I missed out on family outings to the mall or park. It's important to give attention to our loved ones. In other countries, almost @PERCENT1 of people are lonely because they only focus on the computer. I never thought computer use could be addictive, but many people in other countries can't go a day without it. Some computer - addicted people have even died due to neglecting basic needs like eating, sleeping, and using the bathroom. I once thought my friend's warning about dying from excessive computer use was a joke, but now I realize the seriousness. Moreover, some people neglect their physical health while using the computer. They forget to eat, sleep, or move around, which can cause numb legs and stomach pain. It's time to decide whether people should use computers day and night. Considering the negative effects of less family time, addiction, and poor health, we should make a conscious choice. So, get up and make that decision.
1660	1664	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I've been using a computer for a while. I didn't have one growing up but got one last year. Some people say computers are great for staying in touch with family and friends, learning, and getting news, and I agree. However, others dislike them because people spend too much time on them instead of going outside. Here are my thoughts. First, computers are an excellent source for news and weather. You can find this information faster than on TV. Just visit a news website, and with a click of the mouse, you can learn about today's weather, daily events, and celebrity news. Second, the computer is like a tutor. Whether you're struggling with homework or just curious about a fact, a search on a search engine will give you the answer. This is especially important when you're eager to learn. Third, computers are a popular way to communicate globally. Social media platforms like Facebook, MySpace, and AIM allow you to talk to friends and family, near or far, for free. Skype even lets you see the person you're talking to. Now, you might think people spend too much time on computers. Well, it's a matter of self - control. You can limit your usage to half an hour a day, go outside, enjoy nature, and get some exercise. In conclusion, computers are valuable tools for learning, getting news, and communicating, but we need to use them responsibly.
1661	1665	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, the advancements in computer technology have had a positive impact on today's society. Computers are effective tools for teaching hand - eye coordination. They are also beneficial for children's learning both within and outside the school environment, and they serve as a powerful means of social connection across the globe.  Computers are excellent for developing hand - eye coordination. Some opponents of computer use claim that computers make children lazy and ignorant, but this is a misperception. The coordination skills acquired through using mouse - based games can be transferred to sports such as baseball and lacrosse. In these sports, players must track an incoming ball and precisely guide their stick or mitt to catch it. Coordination is not only crucial for sports but also for simple daily household tasks. For instance, a small error in handling a pot while cooking can lead to boiling water spilling on the floor, creating a mess. We are fortunate to have computers as effective teachers of hand - eye coordination.  Computers are also a vast source of knowledge. The internet stores an almost infinite amount of information. In today's era, environmental concerns are on the rise. Since paper is made from trees, and it takes forty years for a tree to grow but only seconds to cut it down, schools should shift from using paper and pencils to computers and keyboards. Most students are already familiar with computers and prefer working on them. A student can learn more in an hour with a computer than in a whole day at school. This transition is necessary.  Moreover, computers form a large - scale social network. Instant messaging and @CAPS2 have become primary communication methods. For example, I can still communicate with my friend who moved to @LOCATION2 two years ago because of computers. Social networks help people maintain connections with old friends and support work - related activities. All major corporations use computers for investment, product sales, and information storage. Computers are the ultimate communication tool.  The @LOCATION1 should take advantage of the growing popularity of computers. Envision a more eco - friendly country where we no longer need to cut down millions of acres of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 rainforest each year. The benefits of computers are indeed endless, including hand - eye coordination, knowledge acquisition, and communication.
1662	1666	1	2	Dear @LOCATION1 press, I've recently heard many arguments suggesting that computers are ruining society, but I firmly disagree. I believe that the computer is an excellent way to reconnect with old friends. The internet also offers a faster option for research compared to using books, and it has a wide variety of games.  The internet is a great platform for staying in touch with old friends. Some of my friends have moved away, and without the internet, I wouldn't be able to talk to them. The same goes for my mom. She has re - connected with her high - school and college friends through Facebook. In addition, emailing is a cost - effective alternative to sending letters by mail. It's also much quicker. So, the internet can help us save both money and time while keeping us connected with friends and relatives.  I also think that using a computer for research is more efficient than going to a library. If you're short on time, you can conduct research at home. What if the library is closed when you go? You'll end up wasting time. The internet, on the other hand, is available 24/7. And even if the library is open, they might not have the book you need. But on the internet, you can find almost anything. You can also renew an overdue library book online. The internet is a great place for researching any topic.  Finally, the computer is a wonderful device for playing games. Instead of spending about @MONEY1 on an Xbox and a game, you only need to spend about @MONEY2 on a computer game. There are numerous websites with games. Some are dedicated to specific games, while others offer a variety of them. A few games allow you to interact with other players, make new friends, and have conversations. There are also single - player games.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that the computer is an essential part of our society. In the long run, it will pay off, especially considering the economic problems our country is facing, as it helps us save money. It also enables us to connect with old friends, saves time, and provides entertainment for everyone.
1663	1667	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, consider these two article titles: ""Local @CAPS1 wins three - mile race"" and ""Local @CAPS1 wins three - mile race on computer game."" The latter is clearly less interesting, and this is the kind of unappealing news that might become prevalent if people continue to over - rely on computers.  I firmly believe that computers are a bad idea. One of the negative impacts of computers is that they can lead to cheating. There are websites on the internet where users can simply type in a question and get an answer. Another form of cheating is copying work, essays, or articles from a website. Some students might be assigned to write a biography, but instead of doing original work, they copy an article, change a few words, and submit it without any guilt.  Computers also cause people to spend less time with family and friends. I once watched a TV show where a man was constantly on the computer. His wife was frustrated because he spent so much time on it. This show made me realize that computers can make people anti - social, and it may even contribute to an increase in the divorce rate between parents.  Many people assume that looking up facts on the computer is equivalent to learning. However, when I have free time on the computer, I'm usually not looking up things to learn. Most people today aren't very interested in learning about other countries or people they don't know. The large number of users on game websites shows that people aren't using computers mainly for learning.  In conclusion, computers have negative effects on all people. @ORGANIZATION1, you need to decide. Do you want your news to be filled with stories of divorces and computer - game high scores, or do you want to have interesting news that will keep your newspaper thriving? Thank you for taking the time to read this."
1664	1668	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1, while technology generally seems to have a positive impact on people, we need to question whether excessive computer use is a bad thing. I believe that we currently spend too much time on computers, and I have several reasons to support this view.  Firstly, excessive computer use is harmful to physical health. Although it's nice to meet new people and learn about other places on the internet, spending @NUM1 hours on the computer doesn't provide any exercise. Instead of sitting in front of a @CAPS3, typing and clicking, you can go outside. For example, riding a bike is a great way to get fit. You can enjoy the sun and fresh air while working out your body. Running is another excellent option. Kids need about @NUM2 minutes of cardio, so it's better to run outside than to sit and download new things on the computer. Running works out both your arms and legs.  Secondly, spending too much time on the computer means less time for friends and family. Are kids going to sit at the computer all day while their family is having fun? When there are chores to do, such as washing the dishes or cleaning the room, they might be neglected. Also, kids and teens at this age should be socializing with friends in person rather than gossiping online. If you're always on the computer, no one will want to invite you to events.  Finally, we should take the time to enjoy nature. It's good to go outside occasionally and breathe in fresh air. If you haven't visited the park in a while, it would be a great idea to go there. You can listen to the birds chirping and see the trees and flowers in bloom. Taking a walk or a stroll in the park is a wonderful way to relax and get some exercise. You can even plant flowers in your garden, which is a more environmentally friendly activity than buying games online.  In conclusion, spending time on the computer isn't inherently bad, but we shouldn't spend hours upon hours on it. Both kids and adults should take these considerations into account. We should try to get exercise, spend time with friends and family, and enjoy the beauty of nature.
1665	1669	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I've noticed that the topic of computers and their influence on people has been brought up. In my opinion, computers are a remarkable tool that helps mankind progress. They offer limitless knowledge, entertainment, and contrary to what some opponents say, they can enhance social interactions for those who are not comfortable with face - to - face meetings.  One of the main benefits of computers is the knowledge they provide. Through the internet, which is accessible via computers, there is a near - infinite amount of information. With just a click of a button, you can access thousands of websites that can answer your questions. For example, consider two students given an assignment to write a report on a famous person. The student with a computer can quickly search for information and gather enough material to write multiple reports. This student is likely to excel in the assignment, graduate at the top of the class, go through college, and secure a high - paying job right after graduation. In contrast, the student without a computer has to go to the library. After an hour of walking, he finds that all the relevant books are checked out. He manages to find a short bit of information and writes a poor report, fails the test and the grade, drops out of school, and ends up working at a @ORGANIZATION1 for his entire life. This shows the significant difference a computer can make.  Computers can also build social lives. Millions of people use the internet every day, and there are many online platforms for communication. Some people worry about privacy and security, but with basic knowledge, one can protect their information. The internet also allows people to ask questions. For instance, if someone wants to become a writer and has questions about the writing system, job opportunities, and pay, they can post these questions on a public site. Someone with first - hand experience can then provide detailed answers.  Finally, computers offer a wide range of entertainment options. You can play games, watch movies or homemade videos, and chat with friends. There are thousands of free services available on computers. When you're bored in your room, you can play a game on your computer. If you're tired of watching regular movies, you can access an infinite video library on the computer.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that there is no limit to what you can do with a computer as long as you have imagination. Computers were invented to benefit mankind, and they are doing an excellent job in achieving this goal.
1666	1670	1	2	Do you have an interest in learning about distant, exotic lands and the animals that inhabit them? Are you proficient in sports but aspire to reach an even higher level of skill? Have you ever felt the pangs of missing your family members who reside in other states? The computer can serve as a valuable aid in addressing all these aspects, yet it also prompts the question: Is it detrimental to you? In my opinion, both children and adults should utilize the computer. When individuals are on the computer, they gain the opportunity to explore fascinating far - off lands. They can conduct research on natural disasters; for instance, people can search for information on earthquakes and learn about the lives lost. Through this knowledge, they may be inspired to donate money to those in need, such as children living independently. Moreover, they can discover the numerous beautiful lands awaiting exploration. Everyone I know has an appreciation for the world's lovely birds and animals, and the computer allows them to experience this. There might be even more such lands to uncover. Owning a computer also enables communication with individuals who are not easily accessible. People can connect with family members living in other states. I have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1. Due to the high cost of travel, I rarely get to see him. However, it's simple to send him a message on the computer to share how I'm doing. Additionally, computers facilitate communication with friends when a phone call isn't possible. For example, if your friend is unable to talk on the phone, the computer can bridge that gap. Another reason to use a computer is that if you use it for @MONTH1 periods of time, it can improve hand - eye coordination. This is particularly beneficial for kids who play baseball, as they'll have a better sense of the ball's position and are more likely to catch it. Thus, playing a bit of video games isn't necessarily bad. Using the computer is a good option as it helps people interact with those who are otherwise difficult to communicate with. So, if you're completely against using a computer, it's time to reconsider and start using it.
1667	1671	1	2	"As more and more technology is developed, people increasingly rely on computers for work and learning. However, spending excessive time on the computer isn't necessarily beneficial. It leads to insufficient exercise, eye strain, and a reduction in real - world interactions. One of the negative impacts of computers on people is the lack of exercise. Take my friend @CAPS1 as an example. He was a triathlete who trained daily to participate in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 - @CAPS4 event in @LOCATION1 next @DATE1. But after getting a computer, he suddenly lost interest in exercise and spent his days checking emails instead of training. He isn't alone in this regard. Experts indicate that individuals with home computers get only @PERCENT1 of the exercise that those without computers receive. In a study conducted at @ORGANIZATION1, computer - using individuals were more likely to be overweight and choose junk food like chips over healthy options like apples. @PERSON1, who led the study, stated that ""Society teaches people that computers can perform amazing and educational functions. However, they aren't informed about the potential harm to health when used excessively."" Clearly, computers pose a threat to our health. Another issue with computers is eye strain. When disabled individuals came to our school to speak on @DATE1, there was a blind woman named @PERSON5. She lost her sight because she was a workaholic and spent too much time on her laptop. She isn't the only one to suffer vision loss due to computers. Scientists at the @CAPS7 lab in @LOCATION2 reported that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 regular computer users lost their vision within two years. One scientist, @PERSON3, said that ""As more people use computers, more will seriously damage their eyes or even lose their vision. We estimate that @PERCENT2 of the next generation will be legally blind before age @NUM3."" Evidently, this new technology is harmful to our vision. A third reason to limit computer use is the decline in real - world interactions. My uncle, @PERSON4, lives in @LOCATION3. We used to see each other occasionally and talk on the phone weekly. That changed when he discovered chat rooms and virtual worlds on the internet. Now, I haven't seen or spoken to him in almost a @DATE1 because he's created a virtual family on the computer and spends his days pretending to be a @CAPS10 and fighting dragons in the game @CAPS10 @CAPS11. He isn't the only one facing this problem. It's been proven that @PERCENT3 of people who engage in such games or chat rooms lose interest in friends and family, and their social skills deteriorate. Professor @PERSON2 commented that ""Too many people are getting hooked on these sites. They stop caring about school, sports, and even their friends. It's alarming!"" Given all these negative effects, why would anyone want to use a computer? Computers bring only grief to humanity. They are extremely dangerous to our health, causing lack of exercise, weight gain, permanent eye damage, and a lack of proper socialization. Is this the future we want for ourselves and the next generation?"
1668	1672	1	2	Computers are highly popular nowadays. Many people use them for research, work, shopping, and homework, among other things. Some people believe that computers consume too much of our time and prevent us from interacting with friends and family. However, computers have numerous advantages. You can chat with friends and family online or have a video chat, so you're not really avoiding them. Additionally, computers are excellent for research. You can look up anything you need for projects, work, schoolwork, etc. Popular websites for resources include @CAPS1.com and @LOCATION1. Computers are also useful for typing reports and creating presentations for work and projects. Virtually anything you can think of can be found on a computer. As you can see, computers are extremely helpful and a great resource. Having a computer at home is far better than going to the public library. It saves time and money, and you get your own personal library. You never know what new technological advancements might bring, but computers are already an indispensable part of our lives.
1669	1673	1	2	Everyone would agree that using computers is a good idea. By using computers, you can meet people you've never met before. You'll also gain knowledge about things you previously didn't know. Moreover, you can learn more about technology. Most people find meeting new people enjoyable as it allows for interesting conversations and getting to know different individuals. People are often curious about other cultures. Some may want to learn about people's personal or business lives, and others are interested in knowing where people are from. In conclusion, computers offer a great opportunity to expand our social circle, knowledge, and understanding of the world.
1670	1674	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1's at the @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON2 once said, ""Computers have assisted me in advancing my research. I can search for a wide range of information to help patients and keep all important data organized."" Can you question the opinion of a leading doctor? I concur with @PERSON3 and believe that computers are a valuable asset in today's society. People were already becoming lazy because of television, so it's unfair to blame computers. With websites like @CAPS4 and @CAPS5, people can stay connected. They can plan activities such as going for a walk in the park or dancing, which can keep them healthy, active, and in good shape. Computers enhance communication among people. @PERSON1 said, ""My patients can email me to schedule appointments and inform me if they think something is seriously wrong with them."" With computers, you can quickly reach out to distant family and friends to learn about any problems. During a crisis, most people are less likely to answer the phone, but email ensures that important information can be shared. You also don't have to worry about high phone bills. Instead of using up minutes on the phone, you can simply chat with a friend on @CAPS4. Computers also enable us to access information more rapidly. How would you feel if you had to learn about the death of your best - friend or mother from a newspaper instead of being informed promptly? You'd be extremely distraught. I know I would. With email, you and your family can maintain contact with old, new, and current friends. If something bad happens and someone doesn't know how to tell you in person, they can send an email. It's much easier than having a difficult phone conversation. Can you now see that computers are a significant benefit to today's society? We can't blame computers for people's laziness, as television was already contributing to this issue. If someone chooses to be lazy, that's their decision. We shouldn't blame others or things when it's an individual's choice. Computers are an excellent way to stay in touch and access a wealth of information, not just about family and friends but also about the world. Thank you for taking the time to read this essay, and I hope you can understand my perspective."
1671	1675	1	2	"One evening, after getting home from school, I was unsure about my homework. I decided to call my friend on her cell phone, but ended up reaching her voicemail. I left a message and then called her home phone, with the same result. Fortunately, I had the numbers of my other friends. The next day, I asked her why she didn't answer either phone. She apologized, saying she was too busy on the computer, emailing others.  When I think about people spending excessive time on the computer, I believe they don't get enough exercise, fail to enjoy nature, and spend less time with family and friends. Firstly, when people spend too much time on the computer, they exercise less. Approximately @PERCENT1 of people fall into this category, which is unhealthy. If people engage in this behavior too often, they won't get enough exercise, and as they get older, this lack of exercise will negatively impact their health. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 stated, ""When adults spend too much time on the computer, perhaps @NUM1 hours a day or more while consuming junk food like chips and soda, they're not setting a good example for their kids. Once adults develop this bad habit, their kids are likely to follow suit, and it's too early for kids to be unhealthy."" I wholeheartedly agree with @CAPS3 @PERSON1; people do spend an excessive amount of time on the computer.  Secondly, when people are on their computers, it's as if their faces are glued to the screen, and they show no interest in nature. I find this behavior intolerable. It seems they don't care about anything else. What I don't understand is why they can't go outside and do something for at least half an hour before going back to the computer to waste time. Going outside and enjoying nature on a sunny day is peaceful. One could have a picnic, go for a hike, or hang out with friends instead of playing on the computer. I understand that on bad days, like when it's snowing or there's a thunderstorm and going outside isn't an option, using the computer is reasonable. I think at least @PERCENT2 of people would give this a try.  Thirdly, if people are too engrossed in the computer, they won't have time to hang out with friends or family. For instance, if your friend wants to go to the mall with you, but you can't because you're on the computer, they'll be furious. You've chosen the computer over your friend. There's probably a @PERCENT1 chance they won't talk to you again, and I don't blame them. People who spend too much time on the computer often don't understand what's going on around them. When someone tells them something, it goes in one ear and out the other. This is truly disappointing because it means less time spent with friends and family.  In conclusion, people are spending too much time on the computer at the expense of exercise, enjoying nature, and spending time with loved ones. In my opinion, I don't spend as much time on the computer, which is a good thing."
1672	1676	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I'm glad to see there's a debate about whether computers are good or bad for human society. I'd like to share my opinion on this matter. In this letter, I'll discuss the negative aspects of computers and why they aren't beneficial for society.  I don't believe computers are good for society because people don't exercise as much as they used to. I can attest to this as a fact. Before computer games became popular, I used to work out regularly. However, once they came out, I spent @NUM1 hours a day playing them. I had no time for my family and no interaction with the outside world. It felt like the computer had taken over my life. Moreover, I know many people who feel the same way.  The computer can be addictive. Once you turn it on, it's difficult to stop using it. Social media platforms and other communication websites are designed to keep you engaged. They often include games to prevent you from logging off quickly. There are also websites with funny videos that can easily distract you. While it's true that you can use the computer to see and talk to family members you don't often see, it takes away time that could be spent at the park having fun and enjoying nature.  I'm not suggesting that we get rid of computers entirely, but we should reduce our usage. I know some people may be upset by what I'm saying, but as a society, we've become addicted to computers. Wherever you look, there's a computer.  To conclude, I pose the question: would you choose computers or a fulfilling life? We need to strike a balance and not let computers dominate our lives.
1673	1677	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, the use of advanced computers has increased significantly. As a result, we don't see kids playing outside as often as we used to. On the news, we frequently hear about the rising rates of obesity and crime. These trends indicate that computers are having a negative impact on society.  I know a thirteen - year - old named @ORGANIZATION1. She admits that being on the computer is more appealing than being outside with friends. Meeting people through technology, especially for minors, is extremely risky. You can't be sure who the person on the other end really is. Eventually, in the real - world social life, these kids may end up with no friends and become outsiders. For @PERSON3, her family hardly knows her anymore. Do you want your child to be in such a situation?  Constantly being on the computer is similar to spending time at a fast - food restaurant. You don't exercise; instead, you just sit, eat, and interact with the computer. I once met an obese fourteen - year - old, @PERSON2. He weighs three hundred pounds. He's an eighth - grader, and it's hard to believe. He told me that he sits with his laptop on his lap, surrounded by junk food. He never exercises or takes a break. His academic performance has also suffered greatly. He used to be an A @CAPS3 student, but now his grades are abysmal. @PERSON2 doesn't listen to his mom at all. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION2's mom, says he locks himself in his room, goes straight to his laptop, and starts eating. You can even hear him munching on junk food. This is why our kids are becoming obese these days.  In the past, concerns were mainly about jobs, but now it's about the people we meet on the computer. Social media platforms like Myspace, Facebook, and Twitter are contributing to the increase in crime rates. The people behind the profiles may not be who they claim to be. Minors, especially those who lie about their age, are at risk of falling prey to perverted old men. This is how sex offenders operate. They can use false identities and lure young girls and boys to meet them. This often leads to tragic consequences such as kidnapping, rape, and even death.  Computers provide countless opportunities for criminals to commit crimes. Do you want your child to be the next victim? Nowadays, computers are being misused by the wrong people. Kids are always inside, getting obese, and at risk of being kidnapped. We can't let this continue. We should take our children away from their laptops right now. Go on a family vacation to a fun place and protect our children from these sick - minded individuals.
1674	1678	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, computers have a negative impact on people for several reasons. Firstly, people are becoming overly addicted to them. While computers do offer the benefit of internet access, many people get hooked on it. For example, about @NUM1 people visit YouTube and have a hard time leaving. These individuals don't turn off their computers to exercise; instead, they sit and stare at the screen, which can damage their eyesight. They need to develop the willpower to step away from the computer.  Secondly, the internet can be a dangerous place. Some people in @LOCATION1 share their @CAPS3 with strangers online. Nearly @PERCENT2 of teens are kidnapped because they give their personal information away, and @PERCENT3 of these teens are never found. The internet is also a breeding ground for cyberbullying. Cyberbullying involves harassing children or teens online. When children under or over @NUM2 are cyberbullied, they may fall into depression and not tell their parents. Six months ago, at my old @CAPS4, a volunteer shared his story of how he became so depressed due to cyberbullying that he committed suicide. Clearly, the internet is not always a safe place.  Finally, our brains are smarter than computers. People have the ability to rely more on their brains. Approximately @PERCENT1 of people use their brains more often than computers and have achieved success in life. The brain is like a computer in that it can store information, and no one can hack into it.  In conclusion, computers have detrimental effects on people. They are addictive, the internet can be dangerous, and our brains are more powerful. We need to be more aware of these issues and use computers in a more responsible way.
1675	1679	1	2	Dear society, don't you all have a computer at home or at work? What would happen if your computer was taken away? How would you work? These are crucial questions.  Computers in our time are extremely helpful in our daily lives. Firstly, they help develop hand - eye coordination. Secondly, they enable us to learn and communicate with people in far - away places. Thirdly, they allow for quick communication through emails or @CAPS2.  If experts were to take away our computers, we should consider the consequences. About @PERCENT1 of Americans have a computer or a cellphone with internet access. These people have developed hand - eye coordination through technology use and are accustomed to multitasking at work. For students, computers are a necessity. They need computers to write papers and do reports. Without computers, it would be extremely difficult for them to complete their academic tasks.  Let's imagine a world without the internet. Social media platforms like Facebook, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4, which have chat features for communication, would be gone. We'd be left with only the telephone, but what if we don't know someone's cellphone number? There'd be no computer to turn to.  While it's true that computers may reduce face - to - face communication, they are still a common necessity. We often need to ask someone a quick question, and cellphones and phone calls aren't as fast as using @CAPS2.  In conclusion, computers are an integral part of our lives, from school to work to entertainment. They help teach hand - eye coordination, allow us to learn about the world and communicate with others. We need to recognize their importance and use them appropriately. So, before considering taking away computers, think about the impact it would have on society.
1676	1680	1	2	I believe that we are all spending too much time on computers. All my friends are on them all day. I think people should get active and visit different places in the world, such as the pool, the forest, and the lakes. There should be a program that encourages people to go out and forget about computers. For me, computers are useful, but we shouldn't spend excessive time on them. Instead, we should spend more time outdoors with our family and friends.  The problem isn't just limited to computers; it extends to a lot of technology, like video games such as Xbox, Game Boy, and others. We should play these games only a few times a week, perhaps for an hour each time. There are numerous outdoor activities that you and your family can do. For example, you could take a walk around the park, ride bikes with friends around town, or have a picnic in the park when the weather is nice.  As the [DATE1] approaches, there are plenty of things to do. Even if you don't have money, you can go to the park or the beach and spend the whole day there. My family checks the weather. When it's good outside, we get up, go to the store to buy hamburgers, soda, plates, and other things we'll need. Then we go to a lake or a pool and spend the day playing and eating.  In my opinion, people should spend more time outdoors with their friends and family. I want people to know that there's a whole world outside and not to get addicted to the technological world. I don't know if you agree, but I think you should give it a try. If you don't like it, find a way to change your habits. I'm writing this because I want people to know that there are many places yet to be discovered. So go out and enjoy life because it only comes once. Make it full of happy and good times, not sad ones. Treat each day as if it were your last on this planet.
1677	1681	1	2	Dear [CAPS1] town, as you know, computers have become an integral part of our lives. However, the question remains: are they a positive or negative influence?  Computers offer numerous benefits. They can show us different parts of the world and provide breaking news. They can also assist in planning our next vacation and enable us to communicate with family and friends. Imagining life without computers is difficult, as it would undoubtedly be challenging.  Nonetheless, computers also have negative aspects. They can be expensive, and they often require frequent repairs. People may spend too much time using computers and neglect physical exercise, which can lead to weight gain. Additionally, a significant amount of energy can be wasted. The internet also presents risks, such as chat rooms. If one interacts with the wrong people, they can find themselves in trouble.  Overall, computers are a crucial part of our lives. They can help us plan our next [DATE1] break trip. However, we must also be aware of their potential drawbacks, such as contributing to weight gain. In conclusion, while computers offer many advantages, we need to use them responsibly to minimize their negative impacts.
1678	1682	1	2	"Many people believe that computers are bad, claiming that they cause us to spend less time outdoors. However, the question is whether computers are as harmful as people make them out to be. In this situation, moderation is key.  When we think of computers, games and social [CAPS1] often come to mind. But what if computers offer more than that? Last year, a computer helped diagnose my concussion and revealed that I had [NUM1] previous ones. It performed this task more quickly and efficiently than a human doctor. An expert stated that ""Computers diagnose anything, not just concussions, [PERCENT1] better than doctors.""  Social networking also has a positive side. It allows people who haven't seen each other in a long time to reconnect and rekindle their friendships. However, with every positive, there is a negative. Computers have contributed to childhood obesity, which is a significant problem in our country. If we become lazy due to over - reliance on computers, we could potentially harm our nation.  Moreover, if we become overly dependent on computers for diagnoses, what will happen when they malfunction? These are real problems that are not being adequately addressed. If we fail to deal with these issues, computers could turn out to be a bad thing.  Moderation can be extremely beneficial. For example, instead of using social [CAPS1] to interact with neighbors next door, we should go outside and play wiffle ball with them. Social [CAPS1] was designed for reconnecting with distant friends, not those nearby. Similarly, instead of relying solely on computers for diagnoses, we should involve doctors as well. This approach will yield better results and keep doctors prepared in case computers fail.  In conclusion, completely eliminating computers is not a good idea because of their many contributions to society. However, being overly dependent on them is also unwise as they have limitations. We need to find a balance to fully enjoy the benefits of computers while minimizing the potential harm."
1679	1683	1	2	Dear local newspaper, [CAPS1]. Did you know that only male coquis sing? Some facts are easily accessible on the internet. Computers have revolutionized research. We no longer have to lug home massive books or painstakingly search for information within them.  First, computers teach hand - eye coordination. When we use a computer, our eyes focus on the screen while our hands operate the hard, smooth keyboard. This helps children develop the hand - eye coordination needed for ball - playing sports such as baseball, basketball, and soccer. In high school, excelling in sports can lead to scholarships for college. College is crucial as it plays a significant role in our lives and can open the door to great jobs.  Second, we can learn about faraway places. Learning about places like [LOCATION1] and [LOCATION2] through books can be dull, but the internet makes it exciting. The internet has taken over our lives, and it has done so quickly and efficiently. It takes less time than going to the library and back. Skimming through paragraphs on the computer is also much simpler.  In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits. They make research easier, teach important skills like hand - eye coordination, and allow us to learn about the world in an engaging way. The internet has become an indispensable part of our lives, offering a wealth of information at our fingertips.
1680	1684	1	2	Dear [ORGANIZATION1], in my personal opinion, computer technology can be extremely harmful, and we need to take precautions. We should be concerned about eye protection, virtual harassment, and the presence of dangerous people on the [CAPS2].  Eye protection is of utmost importance. Computers can damage our eyes. The screen can be too bright, causing pain, and looking at it for too long can make our eyes tired. From personal experience, I know that wearing glasses isn't cool, and some people are even bullied because of it. The consequences of eye damage can range from wearing glasses to even going blind.  Virtual harassment is another issue we need to be aware of. On the [CAPS2], we can be cyber - bullied by kids we may or may not know. For example, while chatting on [CAPS3], we might encounter kids making sexual, homophobic, or offensive remarks. Sexual harassment is particularly serious as it can make people feel terrible about themselves. Kids often take pride in using derogatory names related to race, gender, or sexual orientation.  Sexual predators are a major concern for parents. They are everywhere, whether on [CAPS4], [CAPS5], [CAPS3], or even among our neighbors. When kids are out and about, they are at risk. That's why we should never put any personal information on the [CAPS2], including our address, birthday, cell or house numbers, and even our town. Sometimes, it's also risky to put our last name.  In conclusion, we need to be extremely careful when using the internet. If we see sexual harassment or someone being followed by a sexual predator, we should report it immediately. By taking these precautions, we can protect ourselves and others from the potential dangers of computer technology.
1681	1685	1	2	"Dear Newspaper, I firmly hold the view that computers do not bring benefits to society. This is because when using a computer, people spend less time exercising. Secondly, computers reduce the time available for enjoying nature. Finally, interacting with family and friends is of great importance, yet when one is on the computer, little of this interaction occurs. Using a computer has numerous drawbacks, one of which is the lack of exercise while using it. As is well - known, many countries are facing an obesity problem due to the lack of exercise. Computers do not help solve this issue. The only form of exercise computers contribute to is the movement of hands and fingers, but this can also be harmful. Typing on a computer for too long can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome in the fingers and hands. An expert on health, @PERSON1, stated that ""one in three people use the computer for more than one hour a day, which could lead to obesity."" When on the computer, there is no opportunity to enjoy the outdoors. Enjoying nature is an essential part of everyone's routine. A computer is a time - consuming and potentially mind - numbing device, making it impossible to enjoy nature. Nature is beneficial for the brain. Without it, people will feel exhausted all the time. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of kids go outside every day, which means @PERCENT2 of kids are inside on the computer? Although the computer has sites where one can talk to friends, it is nowhere near as good as seeing them in person. Family is important, and time should be spent with them. My family often does activities together, such as playing board games. With computers, there would be no time for family because everyone would be on the computer playing games instead of spending time with family. In conclusion, computers have an extremely negative impact on society as they consume time that could be used for exercise, limit the time for enjoying nature, and cause people to spend too much time on computers and too little time interacting with family and friends. Thank you for reading my thoughts on the many effects of computers."
1682	1686	1	2	Dear: @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3Ö. My name is @PERSON1, and I am concerned that people around the world are using computers excessively during the day. Some computers have problems as there are glitches in them. Moreover, many people have MySpace accounts, and MySpace can be a source of viruses. These viruses can infect your computer, causing it to shut down or run slowly. In addition, people can hack into your computer without your knowledge, and all the information on your computer can be spread around the world. Strangers can learn your most private secrets. Finally, if you are caught making illegal movies on your computer, you could go to jail, and your business could be ruined. In conclusion, the overuse of computers and the associated risks pose significant threats to individuals. It is crucial that people are more cautious when using computers to avoid these negative consequences.
1683	1687	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, Computers have truly had a profound impact on society. Opinions on this impact are divided. Some people believe it has been positive, while others hold the opposite view. I firmly believe that computers are a valuable addition to our lives and have made a remarkable and positive impact. One reason to support my view is that computers are the primary means for people to stay in touch. There are multiple ways to communicate via computers, such as video - chatting, e - mailing, and using chat websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. Many people appreciate the ability to maintain connections in this way, which is an improvement over phone conversations. When web - chatting on a computer, you can not only talk but also see the other person. For example, @CAPS2 has millions of users who love this platform. Since I moved to @STATE1 and left my friends behind, computers have helped me preserve some relationships. I can e - mail my friends and see their changes on @CAPS2. Another significant advantage of computers is their ability to facilitate the search for information. Whether you need to know the meaning of a word or the directions to @LOCATION1, the computer can assist. My mom said, ""Computers make it so easy to access all the information I need about your brother's diabetes."" Searching for information in books can be time - consuming. You have to visit a library or bookstore, find the right book, and then read through it to locate the needed information. On a computer, you can simply search on Google and access the relevant article or map. Lastly, computers simplify and speed up our school lives. In school, when we need to write a long composition, typing on a computer can take about half the time of writing by hand. I conducted a survey among six students, three of whom typed their compositions and three who wrote them. The students who wrote the papers said it took about two hours, while those who typed took about an hour. Also, typed work is usually easier to read, which makes grading easier for teachers. The opinion that computers are not beneficial to society is unfounded. Although there are some disadvantages, the advantages far outweigh them. Without computers, people would face greater stress and difficulty in making life more convenient. Computers are an amazing asset to society. Everyone should recognize their value as they help people stay connected, make information retrieval easy, and simplify school life for both students and teachers. Computers have had a huge impact and have improved our lives for the better."
1684	1688	1	2	"Dear Local newspaper, I am deeply concerned about the excessive use of computers by many people lately. This overuse has led to a lack of exercise, less time spent enjoying nature, and reduced time with family, which is not a positive lifestyle. In my opinion, exercise is extremely important. To maintain good health, a balanced diet and regular exercise are necessary. I know some people who don't exercise and are either overweight or in poor health. People claim to be ""busy"" using computers to do all their work instead of going to their jobs and working in the traditional way. This modern reliance on computers has made people lazier than ever. If computers didn't exist, people would lead healthier and happier lives. Nowadays, people rarely go out to explore the world. Instead, they search for places on Google. However, looking at pictures online is no substitute for seeing the real thing. Everyone knows that experiencing the real world is far better than looking at pictures, but this seems to be forgotten. Since everything is available online, people are reluctant to leave their homes. Even when they do, they often carry laptops and stay online. People also spend less time with family because they can communicate with them in online chat rooms. This is not a good practice. For example, you might think you're talking to your mother in a chat room, but it could be someone else. If you share private information, it could lead to problems. For instance, if you talk about your credit card and give out the number, it could cause serious issues. Online is not a safe place, so face - to - face communication is preferable. I hope you will publish my letter in the newspaper so that people can be encouraged to exercise, enjoy nature, and spend time with family, as they did before the widespread use of computers."
1685	1689	1	2	Dear, The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people use the internet, which often leads to a lack of exercise. Some people play online games, and there are also concerns about online chat rooms. Online chat rooms are not safe; some people have been seriously injured or even murdered. Exercise is crucial, but @CAPS2 people neglect it. This is very dangerous as it can cause cholesterol levels to rise, lead to weight gain, and lower self - esteem. Some people even commit suicide because of their appearance, which is a tragic outcome that no one wants. Online video games are very entertaining, but some people can become overly obsessed. There are cases where people have resorted to extreme measures for these games. Online chat rooms are extremely dangerous. You never know who you're communicating with. Millions of people have suffered harm, such as being raped, molested, or robbed, because they said the wrong things or gave out personal information like their addresses. There are strange, crazy, or suicidal people in the world, and one should not make themselves a target. Personally, I do not agree with the excessive use of computers. Many bad things can happen if one uses them in the wrong way. I hope you understand and agree with my reasons.
1686	1690	1	2	In my view, computers have a significant presence in people's lives. Most individuals around the world spend a large portion of their time sitting at a computer daily. If I knew someone who spent the whole day on the computer, I would directly advise them to go outside, breathe fresh air, and engage in exercise. Sometimes, the only way to communicate with such people is through the computer.  Computers can be highly beneficial. They allow users to look up important information, such as historical artifacts, medical - plan details, and tutorials on how to fix, make, or build things. They also offer opportunities to meet new people. However, the computer can be a dangerous environment. One might encounter someone who lies about their age, and there is a risk of being raped or murdered.  Spending excessive time on the computer can lead to health problems. Prolonged inactivity can cause paralysis due to lack of exercise or result in a condition where the body becomes weak and unable to exercise without special treatments like massage.  On the positive side, using a computer can improve hand - eye coordination, especially when using certain software, videos, or websites. It is also possible to upgrade a computer for better quality. Some systems are integrated with computers or can be connected to them. There are PC games designed to communicate with children, teaching them writing, reading, spelling, and pronunciation. Special computers and websites offer tutorials for learning different languages and playing musical instruments.  Some people use the computer to fill an inner void instead of eating, and others abuse it like a drug, becoming addicted. It's not uncommon to see someone carry their laptop everywhere. Many deaths have been associated with computer abuse. Nevertheless, computers are a very useful invention. As time progresses, scientists are creating new technologies to save lives. Overall, while computers have their drawbacks, they remain an important part of modern society.
1687	1691	1	2	In modern society, computers have become an integral part of people's daily lives. Workers in @CAPS1 wake up in the @TIME1, stretch, put on their slippers, and then check their @CAPS2 book air for the weather. They log on to @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1, etc., to view emails from work friends and family.  I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people and are a great addition to society. Firstly, computers help both children and adults acquire typing skills. Statistics indicate that an increasing number of jobs rely on computers and prefer candidates with a higher words - per - minute typing ability. Approximately @PERCENT1 of companies are adopting new computer technologies and using computers to store company information. Thus, understanding computers and having typing skills are essential. As a student at @LOCATION1 school, I can attest to this. Many of my projects involve typed words and information. It would be extremely difficult if I had to hand - write all my work and search for information manually. If multiple students are assigned the same project, it would be nearly impossible for teachers to check all the work without the aid of a computer.  Secondly, computers enable people to connect with friends and family, regardless of the distance. Through platforms like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @ORGANIZATION1/@NUM1, and webcam video chats, people can stay in touch. This is particularly important when friends and family are far away or when it's not possible to visit them in person.  In conclusion, computers are wonderful tools. They help build typing skills, facilitate education and information access, and keep friends and family connected. They have a positive influence on people's lives and make daily life easier. Therefore, computers are an indispensable part of society, and their importance should not be underestimated.
1688	1692	1	2	Dear The @CAPS1, I strongly disagree with those who claim that computers are not beneficial. In my opinion, computers are extremely advantageous. They can teach hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about others and distant places, and facilitate interaction with friends and family through the internet.  Computers are capable of teaching hand - eye coordination. Some computers come with typing - teaching programs that allow users to type without looking at the keyboard. Even without such programs, many people can learn to type quickly without looking down. I know several individuals who have learned to use the computer and type on their own.  Computers also give people the ability to explore and learn about different people and places. By using the internet, one can search for information about a specific person or place, and the computer will provide relevant results. Both children and adults need computers. For instance, when a child gets a school project about a famous person or a topic like smoking, they are likely to turn to the internet. The same goes for adults in various workplaces such as offices and schools.  In addition, computers are an excellent means of communication. People can use them to communicate with friends and family in far - off locations via email, @CAPS2, video, and other websites. Some websites, like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, allow for video or text - based communication. People appreciate using computers because they are useful when needed.  In conclusion, computers are one of the most important things for a person. They can be used to learn hand - eye coordination, help people access information about the world, and facilitate communication. Their positive impact on society is undeniable.
1689	1693	1	2	Dear Newspaper, it's evident that more and more people are becoming overweight these days. While some attribute this to excessive fast - food consumption, I believe that our heavy reliance on computers and lack of exercise also play a significant role. Moreover, as technology advances, it keeps people from going outside to enjoy nature, and it has also changed the way we interact with friends and family. Although I'm not suggesting that we should downgrade our technology, we do need to find a way to limit its use.  Technology is contributing to the rising obesity rate. Some studies suggest that people choose not to exercise, but if we limit computer usage, they won't have to make such a choice. As a child, I love being on the computer. My parents often encourage me to put down the computer and take the dogs for a walk, but I usually say I'm busy. In truth, I prefer staying on the computer to play games or talk to friends rather than going outside. I think many others feel the same way, which is why we need to limit computer time.  Global warming is a pressing issue, yet people often prefer to stay inside on the computer rather than go outside and enjoy nature. While one can look up ways to stop global warming on the computer, it doesn't mean they will actually take action. Additionally, using computers consumes electricity, which contributes to global warming. By limiting computer use, people can spend more time outdoors and enjoy nature without harming the environment.  Finally, while internet sites like MySpace, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5 allow us to communicate with friends and family without leaving home, they can't replace face - to - face interaction. When we interact with friends and family in person, we develop important skills such as communication, teamwork, and respect. We can also discover new places together.  In conclusion, if we continue to spend excessive time on the computer, we will miss out on exercise, the beauty of nature, and meaningful interactions with friends and family. Therefore, we need to act now and limit our computer usage.
1690	1694	1	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I think people are spending far too much time on computers these days. This over - reliance on computers is causing numerous problems, such as a lack of exercise, a disconnection from nature, and a breakdown in personal relationships.  Computers mainly engage only our hands, and we tend to stay sedentary when using them. People often become cranky while on the computer or when they have to get off it. Some individuals are so obsessed that they may have a tantrum if forced to stop using the computer. Lack of exercise is clearly visible in those who spend excessive time on computers. Jimmy @CAPS2 points out that many kids are glued to their computers, rarely leaving their rooms, and when they do, they are often in a bad mood and are gaining weight due to a junk - food diet. He can't even spend quality time with his children. A family trip would be a great way for them to bond.  We also need to appreciate nature more. Instead of spending time on the computer looking at pictures of nature, we should go outside and experience it firsthand. Nature is always there for us, whether we need solitude or want to be with friends and family.  Finally, computer - obsessed teenagers and adults should spend more time with their friends and family. Why talk to friends on the computer when you can meet up and have fun together? Spending time with family strengthens relationships. No one wants to be distant from their loved ones.  In conclusion, people should turn off their computers, go for a workout, enjoy nature, and spend quality time with friends and family. This will not only improve their physical health but also enhance their emotional well - being and social connections.
1691	1695	1	2	"To the esteemed local newspaper, it has come to my notice that an increasing number of people are purchasing and owning computers. While some experts contend that this is a negative development and advocate for more time spent outdoors, I firmly disagree.  Computers play an indispensable role in our daily lives. We rely on them to access news, and some individuals even use their computers as a television to watch important shows. Moreover, computers are an excellent means of communication. Whether it's staying in touch with friends, family, or conducting business, a computer offers an efficient way to connect. Additionally, computers are invaluable for schoolwork and professional tasks. For instance, one can write papers on a computer, and if more information is needed, online resources are readily available.  Consider a scenario where you see something on the news that piques your interest. With a computer, you can visit the news website and delve deeper into the topic. Another practical use is watching your favorite shows on the computer if you don't own a television. My English teacher, @PERSON1, once said, ""I've never owned a television; I only watch shows on my computer, and I prefer it."" In fact, @PERCENT1 of those who watch videos on the computer like it better than traditional television.  I appreciate the diverse communication channels computers provide. I have many relatives living far away, and I use my computer to communicate with them regularly. Skype is my preferred option as it allows me to see the person I'm talking to. Computers also facilitate business communication for large companies operating internationally. I'm certain that as a reputable newspaper company, you could benefit from the ease of communication computers offer. Social media platforms like Facebook and MySpace also enable seamless interaction with friends.  In the realm of education and work, computers are highly useful. Typing papers or news articles on a computer is much faster than writing by hand. And when researching a topic, such as writing an article about dolphins, you can quickly find relevant information online.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are a boon. They enhance our daily lives, facilitate communication, and support us in school and work."
1692	1696	1	2	It is undeniable that computers have become an integral part of our lives. I wholeheartedly believe that they offer numerous benefits to society, particularly in the areas of communication, education, and commerce.  In today's digital age, computers have revolutionized the way we communicate. With the advent of new technologies, many people use computers to stay connected with friends and family. For example, if you have a loved one serving in the military, you can use a webcam on your computer to communicate with them. Computers also come in handy for students. If you miss a school day, you can use your computer to ask friends about homework assignments. Additionally, when you're interested in a product for sale, you can communicate with the seller via email to get more details.  Education is another area where computers have made a significant impact. Nowadays, many college students with busy work schedules struggle to attend traditional classes. Thanks to computers, they can take online courses at their own pace. Some students find learning from computers more engaging than sitting in a classroom all day, which may lead to better understanding of subjects. For example, in science, students can conduct research and perform virtual labs on a computer. With access to the internet, students can explore topics of interest and educate themselves even without textbooks.  Computers have also transformed the way we buy and sell products. Online platforms like eBay have made it possible for people around the world to trade goods and make money. By purchasing products online, people can save time and gas by having items delivered to their homes instead of driving to stores.  In light of these compelling reasons, I hope you will agree with me that computers bring substantial benefits to society. They have enhanced our ability to communicate, expanded educational opportunities, and streamlined the buying and selling process.
1693	1697	1	2	"Dear editor of the local newspaper, I am deeply concerned about the growing trend of excessive computer use, which some experts have recently highlighted. I wholeheartedly concur with their view that this phenomenon poses several risks.  One of the most significant drawbacks of excessive computer use is its detrimental impact on physical and mental health. I witnessed this firsthand with my friend, @CAPS2. She was once an active, happy person who loved sports. However, after her mother bought her a blue and white laptop, she became completely engrossed in it. She took the laptop everywhere and spent all her time on it. As a result, she stopped playing sports, gained weight, and fell into a state of depression. Her doctor advised her to limit her computer use to just two days a week, five hours each day. It took her about three months to regain her former self. This experience clearly shows that excessive computer use can harm not only the individual but also those around them.  Another issue is the so - called ""cyber friends"" we meet online. We have no way of knowing their true identities, where they live, or their real ages. They can create a false persona in this virtual world, which is mentally unhealthy. Human beings need to be socially active in the real world. Spending too much time on the computer can also have a negative impact on our brain development.  Lastly, various problems can arise from excessive computer use. If you're like Becky, who is on the computer at every opportunity, it's not only bad for you but also for the device. Prolonged use can damage both the user and the computer.  I sincerely hope that you will take my concerns into consideration. It is crucial that we raise awareness about the potential dangers of excessive computer use and encourage a more balanced approach."
1694	1698	1	2	Nowadays, as soon as teenagers get home from school, the first thing they do is turn on their computers to chat with friends on Facebook or send instant messages. There are both positive and negative aspects to computer use, and I'd like to share my thoughts on this matter, as well as offer some advice on time management.  My personal experience with computers is that they are a vast source of information, but sometimes, there's just too much. In today's society, a significant number of children and teenagers are facing cyberbullying. People often send hurtful messages online because they don't have to confront the recipient in person. This is one of the aspects I dislike about computers. However, on the positive side, computers are an excellent resource for learning and reconnecting with people from the past.  Parents need to be strict when it comes to their children's computer use. Studies have shown that children who spend more than two hours a day on the computer are likely to see a decline in their grades. Therefore, it's essential to manage time effectively. Children should have a balanced life, with time for homework, after - school activities, and computer use.  There are numerous benefits to using a computer. It's a great tool for researching school topics and finding old friends. For example, Facebook helps us stay connected with old buddies, and Google provides a wealth of information on any topic. But there are also negative effects. People tend to say things online that they wouldn't say in person, and excessive computer use can prevent us from focusing on our main priorities.  In conclusion, computers have both positive and negative features. It's important to be aware of these and manage our time wisely. While computers are a valuable tool, we should not let them consume our lives and distract us from our important responsibilities.
1695	1699	1	2	I firmly believe that computers have a profound and positive impact on our lives. They offer a wide range of benefits that make our daily activities more convenient and enriching.  One of the most significant advantages of computers is the ability to explore the world without leaving home. You can study different cultures, cuisines, and traditions from various countries at a fraction of the cost of traveling. For example, instead of buying an airline ticket to visit @LOCATION1, you can go online and learn about its language, the food people eat, and the clothes they wear. You can also research sports and games unique to that region.  Playing games on the computer is not only fun but also beneficial for developing hand - eye coordination. Most online games are free to download and come in various genres, such as puzzle games that challenge your intellect, action games that require quick reflexes, and adventure games that allow you to explore new virtual worlds. These games also provide an opportunity to interact with other players and make new friends.  Computers also revolutionize the way we communicate. There are multiple platforms available, including email, chat rooms, Facebook, Twitter, and video chat. Whether your friends or family are in the same state, country, or on the other side of the world, you can easily stay in touch. Video chat allows you to see each other face - to - face, Facebook lets you share pictures, and chat rooms enable group conversations. You can either download these applications, access them online, or purchase physical copies.  In conclusion, computers are an indispensable part of modern society. They offer a wealth of opportunities for learning, entertainment, and communication. Whether you're exploring the world, having fun, or staying connected with loved ones, computers have something to offer for everyone.
1696	1700	1	2	"Technology refers to anything that enhances our way of living. It surrounds us; our beds, houses, televisions, and chairs are all forms of technology. In my view, one particular form of technology has revolutionized modern - day living: the computer. I hold a very positive outlook on the impact of computers on our society. Consider all the tasks we rely on this device to perform. One aspect that stands out is communication. The computer is perhaps the greatest communication tool the world has ever seen. E - mail is essentially sending a letter to a friend without the hassle of mailing, which may result in the letter getting lost or stolen. Sending an e - mail involves two simple steps: composing and sending. It not only reduces the risk of non - delivery but is also much quicker. You click the ""send"" button, and before you know it, the letter is in your friend's inbox. Another computerized communication method, my personal favorite, is instant messaging. It allows you to have a conversation with someone miles away. And it's acceptable to take a break, say, to get a soda during an instant messaging session, which isn't considered rude as it would be in a real conversation. These are just two communication methods enabled by the computer. There are numerous other ways in which the computer enhances our lives. I believe the main reason the computer has had such a profound impact is the internet. The internet makes all computer - based activities possible. If you want to conduct research on a topic, the internet takes you to the relevant sources. With millions of websites, the possibilities are endless. Whether you're interested in arcade games, need to write a science report, want to listen to music, or are looking for a funny video, the internet can fulfill your needs. The internet is perhaps one of the greatest inventions ever, and it's yet another reason to love the computer."
1697	1701	1	2	I firmly believe that computers have positive effects on people, although some experts hold the opposite view. That's why I'm writing this paper to present both sides of the argument. Nowadays, having a computer at home is almost as common as having a telephone. Computers are extremely useful in our lives. They can store information, facilitate online communication, and even help us find recipes. In fact, without computers, we wouldn't have achieved the technological advancements we have today. Let me share my personal experience. I had a job interview, but I couldn't find the location. Thanks to my computer, which provided me with directions, I made it to the interview on time. This is a clear example of the positive impact of computers. However, the opposing view argues that people are spending too much time on computers, leading to less exercise, less time enjoying nature, and less interaction with friends and family. In my opinion, spending excessive time on the computer is a personal choice, usually made by those lacking self - control. Moreover, not everyone needs to exercise, especially if they are already in good physical shape. As for interacting with friends and family, it's obvious that one can't stare at a computer screen all day. In conclusion, computers are beneficial, but with self - control, we can enjoy their advantages without experiencing any negative side - effects. Next time you use a computer, remember to value your friends, family, and health more.
1698	1702	1	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, as a computer user, I am convinced that computers are helpful in numerous ways. They assist us in obtaining new opportunities. They also play a crucial role in operating machines. Additionally, they enable people to learn new things. Computers are excellent tools for finding and accessing new opportunities. They offer the public an alternative way to search for a new or different job. Take my brother as an example. He graduated from a university with a mechanical engineering degree but had difficulty finding a job. Someone advised him to visit @CAPS1.com and search under ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"". He followed the advice and found a good job on the computer, where he still works today. Clearly, the computer is a great resource for job - hunting. Computers also help in operating machines. Many machines that were once manually operated are now computer - controlled. This has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it allows for more products to be manufactured in less time. For instance, in the automotive industry, mechanical robot hands on the assembly line, controlled by computers, are putting cars together, resulting in more cars being produced in a shorter period. On the other hand, this automation has led to many people losing their jobs. However, despite these drawbacks, computers are still a valuable asset in our lives, as they continue to teach and empower people."
1699	1703	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, in my opinion as a middle - schooler, the impact of computers on society is a double - edged sword. While they can be beneficial, they also cause significant damage to our society. Firstly, the internet is rife with inappropriate content. Illegal activities are prevalent, and a single click of the mouse can expose anyone to such content. Hacking and unauthorized access to others' computers are becoming increasingly common. People can download songs and documents illegally for free instead of paying for them. Moreover, users may encounter graphic language, videos of drug use, criminal acts, and vulgar language on the internet. A recent study by the @ORGANIZATION1 on internet use found that ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"", a form of @CAPS5 where people can chat or instant - message and hurt others' feelings, is linked to suicides and depression in teens. Another concerning issue is that people can easily talk to strangers online. It's terrifying to think that a child could give out personal information to someone who lies about their identity, putting the child at risk of kidnapping or harm. Secondly, excessive internet use is unhealthy and can lead to social isolation. According to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of children and teenagers who use the internet too much may develop weak relationships with friends and family. Spending too much time on the computer can make people lazy, reduce mental effort, and limit interaction with the outside world. Finally, the internet is highly addictive. I once stayed up late using websites like @CAPS9 just because everyone else was doing it. Although it seemed fun at the time, my academic grades suffered, and I stopped communicating with the outside world. Addiction can overpower one's willpower. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, we must be aware of their negative impacts and use them responsibly to avoid harm to ourselves and society."
1700	1704	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I wholeheartedly support technological advancements and firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. There are several reasons for this view. Firstly, using a computer helps you develop valuable skills. When you think of a computer, you might think of typing on a keyboard. With regular use, you'll get better at typing, improve hand - eye coordination, and become more proficient with the mouse. As your computer skills grow, you can perform tasks more quickly and efficiently. Secondly, the internet on a computer allows you to search for any information you need. Whether it's for schoolwork or learning about different cultures, a computer is an invaluable tool. When I'm doing my homework and can't answer a question, I turn to the internet for help. It's also great for researching different cultures and comparing them to our own. Lastly, a computer can solve the problem of loneliness. If you feel alone with no one to talk to, simply get on a computer. You can chat with people from all over the world, reconnect with old friends, and make new ones. The chat function on a computer is amazing; you can be anywhere and talk to anyone you want. In conclusion, computers are both helpful and fun. There are countless things you can do on a computer, and you'll never run out of options. In my opinion, there's so much to gain and learn from having a computer at your side.
1701	1705	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, upon entering a room and observing people interacting with their computer screens, one realizes the wealth of new and exciting information they can access daily. The question arises: what impact do computers have on people? In my view, computers have a positive influence on individuals. They enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about distant places and cultures, and even facilitate online communication with others. Undoubtedly, computers can have a positive impact on society.  Computers teach a highly valuable skill to every user: hand - eye coordination. Whether it's clicking on a link to a website found on @ORGANIZATION2 or playing the matching game Bejeweled, users are honing their hand - eye coordination. According to recent studies, over @PERCENT1 of the interviewed individuals reported having excellent hand - eye coordination, and @PERCENT2 attributed it to computer use. While it's essential to engage in outdoor exercise, computers can be beneficial as long as we don't let them overwhelm us. Intelligent individuals would concur that coordination is a useful skill.  These remarkable inventions also assist us in learning about different places and people. Consider this scenario: A student at @ORGANIZATION1 has to complete a project on the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in @LOCATION1. He goes to the library to consult the encyclopedias, but they are outdated. Then, he heads to the computer lab and quickly finds the information on @ORGANIZATION2. This example demonstrates that the computer is one of the fastest ways to obtain information on any subject. Although traditional text sources can provide accurate information, computers offer speed and convenience. Moreover, not only can you gather information about specific people and places, but you can also keep up with the latest fads, current events in @LOCATION2, and the latest @CAPS6 gossip. Clearly, the computer is an easy source of information on diverse areas and people.  This amazing device also allows for online communication. There are multiple ways to do this. You can use traditional @CAPS7 - mail or a device in the @CAPS8. Of course, you need a @CAPS9 for that. I recall a time when I was bored and decided to do my homework, but I forgot what it was. I called my classmate, but he didn't answer. I then rushed to my computer and found him online. Thanks to the computer's ability to connect with others, I got the homework details and received an A. In conclusion, computers bring numerous positive benefits to our lives, from skill - building to information access and communication.
1702	1706	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, I firmly believe that computers have a positive rather than a negative effect on people, and I have three reasons to support this view.  Firstly, computers help relieve stress. In my opinion, without computers, life would be far more stressful. With a computer, you can effortlessly look up information, saving time and avoiding the stress of searching for things.  Secondly, computers are closely related to technology. Without technology, many tasks would be extremely difficult. Without computers, it would be more challenging to type assignments neatly, print pictures, and access information. I believe that a lot of things would go wrong if we didn't have computers.  Thirdly, factories would face significant problems without computers. In a factory, most operations are controlled by some form of computer. Without the computer instructing the machines, everything would come to a halt. The work would become so time - consuming that no one would be willing to complete it.  In conclusion, based on these three reasons, I am convinced that computers have a good effect on people. They make our lives easier, support technological progress, and keep industrial operations running smoothly.
1703	1707	1	2	Dear whom it may concern @CAPS1, have you ever pondered what it would be like to spend all your time in front of a computer? In my opinion, one should not be glued to the computer all day. As my mom always says, only an hour a day is ideal.  One important reason is that you need to embrace what life has to offer. You can engage in activities such as playing catch with your dog, taking your dog for a walk, or visiting a friend's house. While playing on the computer is enjoyable, you also need to exercise.  Another reason is that by going outdoors, you can avoid getting trapped in a virtual world and discover new places. You can also make many new friends. That's how I got to know trees, animals, and enjoy the beautiful scenery. You'll feel like you're having the time of your life.  The final reason is that you can gain a lot from outdoor activities. In winter, you can build snowmen, and on a rainy day, you can watch a movie at home. There are countless things you can do.  In conclusion, activities like building, playing, and jumping are just a few examples of the fun you can have outdoors. Remember these three good reasons and make use of the wonderful outdoors. Go for a walk with your dog, invite friends over, or simply have a great time with your family and friends.
1704	1708	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, computers have become an integral part of our lives today. They offer a wide range of benefits, including the ability to look up information, learn new things, and keep us occupied.  Computers are like a comprehensive package. They provide learning opportunities and access to a vast amount of information, such as facts, historical events, and details about @CAPS1. They help us understand the world around us and how things have evolved. In many ways, a computer is similar to a trip to the library, as it contains a wealth of information. You can use it to research for a project or for general knowledge. Moreover, you can quickly access information in folders, almost instantaneously.  Every day, people learn new things on the computer. There are various websites like @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS4 where you can find different types of content. Some people can't imagine their lives without computers. However, it's important to note that some computer applications, like music players, require you to download music and other apps. These features not only keep you busy but also keep you engaged.  As you can see, computers have a significant impact on people. They are a source of information, a means of learning, and a form of entertainment. Whether it's a desktop or a laptop, computers bring a lot to the table. In conclusion, computers have firmly established themselves as an essential tool in modern society, offering numerous advantages to users.
1705	1709	1	2	Everyone seems to love spending time on the computer. I'd be shocked if someone didn't. In my opinion, the problem is that the computer distracts us from other equally enjoyable aspects of life. People learn an excessive amount on it, and it can completely change a person's life.  The computer is like a disease or a virus that takes control of you, but it is entirely possible to regain your freedom from it. I understand that some people in @MONTH1 may not agree with me, but I firmly believe my view is the best.  It's truly horrible how the computer distracts people from their lives. It makes them blind to the beauty of nature. Spending too much time on the computer is a terrible affliction. The difficult part of regaining your freedom is realizing that it has control over you. Once you recognize this, the door to freedom will open.  Technology keeps you from having fun, doing schoolwork, and spending time with friends. I know you can break free because I've been through it. Technology is indeed a wonderful thing; it holds so much information that it seems to know more than a person. However, it can also be very harmful. I once came across a truly awful scene on the computer, and I couldn't wait to shut it off.  Machines have a will of their own, and they can change a person's life in an instant. Sometimes these changes are positive, but often they are negative. A machine can transform you in just ten minutes. If you see something you like or want on the computer and can't get it, you might be tempted to obtain it by unethical means.  In conclusion, while computers offer a vast amount of information, they can also have a detrimental impact on our lives. They can make us lazy, as we no longer need to read or search actively. We must learn to control our use of computers and not let them take over our lives. We should choose the path that allows us to balance the benefits of technology with the joys of real - life experiences.
1706	1710	1	2	Undoubtedly, computers have a significant impact on people. There are three main reasons why they have a positive influence. Firstly, computers enhance typing skills. When one uses a computer regularly, the hands gradually adjust to the keys, and typing proficiency improves. For those aspiring to work with computers in the future, practicing typing at home makes them more eligible for relevant jobs. Moreover, computers are beneficial for the hearing - impaired. They can use specific devices and chat with people online, enabling them to read what others say since they cannot hear. Secondly, computers are highly educational. There are numerous websites that offer facts about different places, such as the local cuisine and geographical location of various countries. Ask.com is an excellent website for obtaining accurate information quickly. These websites also assist with school projects. Lastly, computers are helpful in many ways. For instance, one can find out the distance between two locations or locate a friend's house using a laptop if the directions are lost. While GPS exists, it can be confusing, whereas a computer can read the information out. And texting or calling friends might not always be effective if they don't communicate clearly. In conclusion, it is evident that computers have positive effects on people, as they improve typing skills, are educational, and offer practical assistance. Please consider these viewpoints.
1707	1711	1	2	My experience with computers is quite positive. I can play games and do my homework on them. I'm able to install my own music and work on my assignments simultaneously. With computers, I can access the internet, which allows me to complete tasks more quickly and easily. I can also get more work done by using the internet for research, copying, and pasting information. I now own a laptop, which is essentially a portable computer. On my laptop, I can create data tables and graphs, write papers, and use a dial - up connection. A dial - up connection lets me access free internet by entering someone's phone number. If the phone line is connected to the modem, the laptop will call it up. My laptop also has a slot for a floppy disc and another for a specific device. It even comes with a calculator. Some laptops, like mine, have a mouse that resembles a small pad. As is clear, owning computers and laptops is truly advantageous.
1708	1712	1	2	Dear The @ORGANIZATION1 @MONTH1 has claimed that people are spending too much time on computers and neglecting their homework or outdoor activities. I firmly believe those people are @CAPS1! Computers represent a major leap in new technology. For example, they can be used for school research. Suppose you're writing a research paper and have borrowed all the relevant books from the library, but then realize you missed an important one. By the time you rush back to the library, it's closed. Computers come to the rescue as you can search for the book online and find a digital copy, ensuring you get a good grade on your paper. Also, if you're stuck with math homework and home alone, you can visit your teacher's website for an explanation. Children need to communicate with their friends to some extent, whether it's about homework or just for fun. Without friends, children would be at a disadvantage. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of children allowed to communicate with friends outside of school stay away from drugs and have better educational performance. The internet wasn't created without purpose. It was invented for communication, research by children, and for exploration and entertainment. For example, one can learn about distant places, cultures, animals, and even shop online. These are essential aspects that people should have access to. Without computers, people wouldn't get important news when needed or access necessary information. Computers are the future. We need computers in our lives for communication, shopping, learning, teaching, research on various topics, email, and spreading important news. Therefore, the people of @LOCATION1 should keep their computers as they are crucial for growth and the advancement of technology. After all, who wouldn't enjoy a good computer game occasionally?
1709	1713	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, do you think people should stop using the computer? I believe they should, as they aren't getting enough exercise. People's bodies become lazy, and they're reluctant to get up. Instead of spending time with their families, they prefer to use the @CAPS3. People should stop being lazy and get some fresh air. Do people who spend a lot of time on the computer interact with their families? No, because they think technology can entertain them more than their family. I don't like computers much because one can get hooked on them very quickly and find it hard to stop. Interacting with family helps us get to know them better, which is invaluable. Computer use should stop as it can damage people's minds. Another reason is the lack of exercise. When people don't exercise, it has a negative impact on their bodies. They tend to eat too much and become extremely lazy. Exercise gives us a lot of energy to do various activities, like bungee jumping. When we exercise, we look healthy, and others notice. That's why exercise is the key to being healthy and fit. Additionally, enjoying nature is important. We can have a great time and relax in nature. We can swim at the beach, feel the wonderful breeze, and have a good time. When on the computer, people sit down instead of going outside, and this becomes a habit. It's harmful to the environment as people don't want to get up and enjoy nature. This behavior shouldn't be tolerated as people are being lazy. In conclusion, people shouldn't spend their lives on the computer. They think technology can entertain them more than family interaction. They'll start overeating and become lazy, and they'll rarely leave the house. This situation needs to change as it's harming both people and the environment.
1710	1714	1	2	I firmly believe that we should have and make more use of computers. Nowadays, an increasing number of people rely on computers. In the past, we didn't have them, but now we do, so we should utilize this technology. If we don't use computers, what's the point of having them? Computers can help us learn about far - off places like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, and @PERSON1. Without computers, we'd be unaware of the flags, cuisines, cultures, and languages of these places. We can also talk to our friends online. Instead of calling them, we can chat with them when we need help with homework or if we left our math textbook at school. Even if our friends are in @LOCATION2 or other distant places, they can bring their computers and communicate with us online. Additionally, using computers helps us learn to type. As we gain typing skills, we can type faster. We can then type stories, poems, and notes for school, eliminating the need to write on paper. In conclusion, the advantages of computers are clear, and I hope you'll agree that we should embrace and use them more.
1711	1715	1	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, the question is whether too much computer time causes people to interact less with their surroundings. In my opinion, computers definitely do not make people lazy and less interactive with those around them. First, computers can sometimes make users smarter. One can read about history and world news and research various topics. I recall that when I was younger, I was eager to learn about the @CAPS1. I used to search for information on it constantly and even created a poster project for fun. Thanks to the computer, I obtained accurate information. A survey by the @CAPS2 school social - studies teacher revealed that @PERCENT1 of their students used computers to find facts for school projects, and @PERCENT2 of that @PERCENT1 ended up getting better grades. The famous psychologist @PERSON2 stated, ""Kids and students learn more when they are on the computer researching or @CAPS7 new things."" I understand you might think too much internet use is unhealthy, especially for students, but at @ORGANIZATION1, it is a good source of @CAPS7 for them. Thus, computers help everyone learn facts and stay informed about the world. Second, people can interact with family and friends online. For example, there is @CAPS3, where people can socialize with out - of - state family members. I remember that in @NUM1 grade, I made a new friend who moved to @LOCATION1 in the @DATE1 after @NUM2 grade. I have kept in touch with her on @CAPS3. A student - council survey showed that @PERCENT3 of students had someone they knew and loved move out of state, and @PERCENT4 of that @PERCENT3 kept in touch via email or @CAPS3. The famous scientist @ORGANIZATION2 said, ""People who keep in touch with family and friends tend to stay happy and not become depressed."" I know you may think people don't need to constantly keep in touch with their families, but it makes them happier. Therefore, people need computers to stay connected with their families. Third, one can learn new exercises, moves, or tricks. You can find new exercises, train for a dance competition, or learn new magic tricks for a magic show. I wanted to learn how to twirl a balloon between my fingers, so I found a step - by - step teaching video online, and it became easier. A survey by @CAPS5 muscles @CAPS6 indicated that @PERCENT5 of their @CAPS6 members got stronger and fitter by @CAPS7 new exercises. The famous athlete @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS7 new exercises online helps me stay fit for my games."" I know you might think one can just find someone to teach them, but no one wants to pay for something they can get for free online. So, learning new exercises, moves, or tricks online can be very helpful. In conclusion, too much computer time does not cause people to interact less with their surroundings. Instead, it helps them learn, socialize with family and friends, and get in shape through the new exercises they learn from how - to videos."
1712	1716	1	2	I believe using computers is a great thing, just like many others in this country. There are numerous people here who speak different languages, and computers can teach them, unlike a person who only speaks our native language. For some, computers are an essential part of their lives, and many use them for work. Kids also use the internet, not just for platforms like Facebook, MySpace, Gmail, and other web pages. I used to visit gaming sites like @NUM1.com or /cup/coffee, but I don't go on them as often now because I have Xbox Live, which also provides internet access and allows me to talk to friends. Some of my friends spend all their time on the computer and don't exercise at all. However, many of them use the computer but also play a lot of sports, so they don't just sit around getting fat. Most people in the world have a computer, but not everyone in @LOCATION2 of @LOCATION1 does. I think our country should provide financial support to those less - privileged countries so they can get computers. This way, if people from those countries come here, they can learn our language. Alternatively, we could ship computers to their countries to ensure they don't end up with sub - standard ones. Moreover, when you're on a computer, you can either buy a webcam or use the one already built - in. You can then talk to your friends and show them what you've made. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are one of the best inventions ever.
1713	1717	1	2	"Dear @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1, and I'd like to discuss the issue of computer use in @LOCATION1. First, I'll outline the benefits of owning a computer. Then, I'll talk about social networking, which is often misconstrued as bad. Finally, I'll touch on the technological advances brought about by computers. I believe that the use of computers in our town is highly beneficial to society. There are several major advantages. One is the ability to use Microsoft software to write papers. A sixth - grader, @PERSON6, said, ""I prefer typing to writing a paper. Another reason to use a computer is for research."" @PERSON4 stated, ""@CAPS4 many articles and facts are online about anything you need."" Additionally, a computer allows you to quickly access world news. @PERSON5 said, ""I would've never known about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 without seeing the article on @CAPS2 homepage."" These are just some of the key benefits that kids enjoy on their computers. Now, let's address social networking, which is often considered negative but isn't actually so. Platforms like @CAPS5 use a texting form on a computer, enabling us to connect without incurring a large phone bill. @PERSON2 said, ""With instant messenger, I can talk to @CAPS2 girlfriends."" Facebook also helps us connect on a global scale. @CAPS6 said, ""I can talk with @CAPS2 cousin in @LOCATION2."" These are the main social networking tools that allow us to communicate with people worldwide. Another crucial aspect of computers is the technological advancements they've spurred. We now have laptops, which are portable and can be used anywhere. @PERSON7 said, ""I can use @CAPS2 computer anywhere I like."" Memory cards allow us to save data on a computer and transfer it to school or work. An eighth - grader, @CAPS7, said, ""I can take work I didn't finish in school home with the stick."" The use of printers is also an important advancement. @PERSON3 said, ""I use @CAPS2 printer to print out papers to bring to school."" In conclusion, there are many benefits to owning a computer. We can communicate with people worldwide at any time, and computers have been the driving force behind many groundbreaking technological improvements. @CAPS4, please support us kids in this matter of computer use."
1714	1718	1	2	Losing @CAPS1 to @ORGANIZATION1 has become a significant part of daily life. While this is beneficial for businesses and schools, for those simply looking to pass the time, computers can be a risky choice. On one hand, computers are a means of communication. They are useful when a student forgets their homework or assignment. However, when it comes to dealing with boredom, computers can be a problem. Social networking is a concern as there are privacy issues, and too many young people are creating @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 pages. Additionally, exercise is an important issue, and sitting at a computer all day doesn't provide any physical activity. On the other hand, computers open up new worlds. You can type any question or place into a search engine and get instant results. Like anything else, computers are fine in moderation, but excessive use is unhealthy. Websites such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, or @CAPS6 pose risks to privacy. There is little privacy protection, and your page can easily be made public. These websites are also addictive. You might just log on to check notifications but end up spending @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours on the computer without realizing it. Other forms of passing time, like running on a treadmill or jogging, have real benefits, unlike spending hours on the computer, which can only give you blurred vision. It's okay to be on the computer for 1/@NUM1 hour a day, especially when not using the internet for non - productive purposes. Some websites can be useful. Edline helps with homework or assignments, and Google is great for research or vocabulary work. When these types of websites are the focus of computer use, it is more productive. In conclusion, I believe computers can have a negative impact on people. If more computer users balanced their screen time with exercise, they would be in better health.
1715	1719	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper, I've often thought about what the world would be like without computers. It's a scary thought, and I'm sure many share this view. A world without computers would mean a world where people have difficulty communicating and limited access to independent information. The benefits of computers are numerous. First, they enable us to communicate with friends and family who don't live nearby or whom we haven't spoken to in a while. I can email and interact with people I met on past vacations through social networks like Facebook. This is extremely beneficial for those who have lost touch with loved ones, as it gives us the opportunity to catch up and reconnect. Clearly, communication through computers is one of their many great advantages. Second, computers can teach hand - eye coordination. Dereck, a channel @NUM1 news reporter, said, ""I can hit some far balls that are remarkable in our games. I truly believe it's because my mother taught me how to use a computer!"" Children, in particular, benefit from this, as hand - eye coordination is useful for sports like hitting home runs or scoring touchdowns. Third, computers allow students and many others to learn and look up information they don't know. @PERCENT1 of schools across the country benefit from having school computers for research. Businessmen, parents, and teachers also use the internet to learn about the world and gather information for teaching. In conclusion, computers are an amazing invention. They allow us to communicate with others, teach hand - eye coordination, and help us learn about the world. This intelligent machine seems to have all the answers and is a reliable source of information."
1716	1720	1	2	"Dear @PERSON1, in your newspaper's @CAPS1 section, I came across an article about the negative impacts of computers on the community. I firmly disagree with the article's stance. In my view, computers represent a significant advancement in modern technology and offer numerous benefits to society.  Computers enhance hand - eye coordination. When typing on a computer, one's eyes are on the screen while the hands are typing, strengthening at an impressive rate. A study by students at @ORGANIZATION1 revealed that the likelihood of developing arthritis by the age of @NUM1 decreased by almost @PERCENT1 among frequent computer users. Moreover, the hand - eye coordination acquired from typing is beneficial in sports like tennis and baseball. For those looking to improve their hand - eye coordination, taking a computer class, which is widely available in schools across the country, is a great option.  Secondly, using the internet on computers simplifies the process of gathering information on various subjects. For example, when planning a family vacation, instead of making phone calls, one can use the computer to plan the entire trip online. There are numerous websites that make this process fast and easy. Additionally, if one wants to learn a new skill such as knitting, typing ""how to knit"" into a search engine will yield over @NUM2 helpful sites.  The internet also facilitates communication with friends. In the past, I'd often say I'd keep in touch with friends after camp but rarely did. However, with instant messengers and webcam applications, it's now easy to talk to friends. I even regularly communicate with a friend who lives in @LOCATION1. My dad, who used to be stressed about international meetings, is now excited as he can use webcams to communicate with his overseas bosses. He finds modern computers very user - friendly for communication.  In conclusion, I am convinced that computers are a boon to the world as they improve hand - eye coordination, make information accessible, and enable communication with others."
1717	1721	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to society. Many kids find it difficult to write a @NUM1 - page essay by hand, so they turn to computers, which are much easier to use. People use computers daily, whether for chatting with friends, playing games, or conducting business.  I personally don't use a computer frequently, mainly for checking emails and schoolwork. However, this doesn't mean that others don't need them. People get exercise in various ways, such as walking, so concerns about lack of activity due to computer use are unfounded.  Computers are extremely helpful for research projects. Instead of spending time searching through books, one can find information at their fingertips on a computer. A significant number of students, at least @PERCENT2, receive zeros on homework or tests because their teachers can't read their handwriting. Typing on a computer not only solves the legibility issue but also helps with spelling and grammar checks, potentially improving grades.  Another great advantage of computers is video - chatting. This is especially useful when a parent is away on business. I've used it to talk to friends as well.  Computers come with useful programs like Word, Excel, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. These programs assist in writing essays, calculating grades, and creating charts. Without computers, doing these tasks by hand would be messy and less accurate.  The internet, accessible via computers, is a treasure trove of information. It allows people to shop online, play games, watch videos, chat with friends, and post pictures and videos.  In conclusion, computers are essential for both kids and adults. Taking away computers would severely impact how kids learn and how adults conduct business. We need computers, and they need us to make the most of their capabilities.
1718	1722	1	2	Dear local newspaper, there's a lot of talk among @CAPS1 people about the effects of computers on us. Some believe that using computers is a waste of time, but I strongly disagree. Computers offer a wealth of benefits, including the ability to learn about different parts of the world, the lives of people from the past, and stay in touch with friends.  People often claim that computers waste our lives. However, the internet is an excellent resource for learning about different places. We can explore the climate, the local animals, and their diets. Different places have unique cultures; for example, in @LOCATION3, seafood is a staple, while in @LOCATION2, spicy food is popular. The internet also provides pictures of beautiful, unseen places, allowing us to learn about and compare different lifestyles.  If you have a long - lost friend, the internet is a great way to reconnect. You can create accounts on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, @NUM1, etc. Searching for your friend's name can lead to a chance to talk to them again, which is truly exciting.  Many @CAPS1 kids use computers for history projects. The internet can help by providing information about famous people from the past and present. For instance, we can learn about @LOCATION1, the first president of the @ORGANIZATION1, including his birthplace and family details.  In conclusion, computers are far from being bad. They don't take away our time from family, friends, or outdoor activities. Instead, they allow us to learn about the world, communicate with friends, and study the past.
1719	1723	1	2	Dear newspaper, I wonder if you @CAPS1 think that computers have a negative impact on people. In my opinion, they are extremely beneficial. Over @PERCENT1 of people today own a computer, and it offers many advantages.  Computers are great for gathering information. If you want to know about your favorite hockey player, instead of going to the library and hoping to find a book, you can search for them on @ORGANIZATION1. This will save you time and money. If you take the same family trip to @LOCATION1 every year and want a change, you can use the computer to find another location with similar features that is closer.  For students with messy handwriting, learning to type on a computer is a great solution. At least @PERCENT2 of students today get zeros on homework or tests because their teachers can't read their writing. Typing on a computer helps with spelling and grammar, potentially improving grades.  Computers also offer entertainment. You can find videos of your favorite players and even get warnings about playoff games. You can download your favorite songs for your cellphone; over @PERCENT3 of people get their songs from the computer. For example, if your favorite band is Dropkick Murphys, you can search for them on @ORGANIZATION1 and find all their songs.  In conclusion, computers can help kids find information, improve their grades, and provide entertainment. They are a valuable tool that can enhance our lives in many ways, contrary to what some people might think.
1720	1724	1	2	Dear NewsPaper @CAPS1, have you ever considered the profound impact of technology on our society? For many, computers are an integral part of their lives. They help adults maintain contact with friends, provide a wealth of information on countless topics, and teach valuable skills.  Computers are excellent for socializing. There are numerous websites, such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @ORGANIZATION1, that keep people connected. As adults, we often find that childhood friendships fade over time. With computers, we can chat with old friends all night. It's also a convenient way to stay in touch with friends living in different parts of @LOCATION1.  Computers are a treasure trove of information. A family planning a vacation can use a computer to find a suitable destination and book a flight. A student unable to visit the library can use the computer to gather information for a report. Someone unsure about an ailment can look it up on the internet, with sites like @ORGANIZATION2 dedicated to such purposes.  Using computers also helps users acquire valuable skills. Knowing how to operate a computer is an essential skill, and computers offer features like creating PowerPoint presentations for work or slideshows for personal events. Typing is a valuable skill required by most modern jobs, and using a computer improves hand - eye coordination.  Although some may argue that staring at a screen all day is unhealthy, @CAPS5 of @CAPS6.S.A citizens believe that using the computer is beneficial for social lives when used in moderation.  In conclusion, computers are amazing tools when used properly and moderately. They enhance our social lives, teach us skills, and provide information on a wide range of topics. We need computers to lead an enjoyable life. I urge you to write an article on @DATE1 highlighting the importance of computer use, informing people that they are making the right decision by using them.
1721	1725	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, consider a world where individuals lack hand - eye coordination. When they attempt to catch a ball, it simply slips away. Moreover, there are no friendships and no communication between countries. Is this truly the world you desire?  Computers have positive impacts on both individuals and society. They enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about distant places and individuals, and facilitate online communication.  Regarding hand - eye coordination, not everyone is naturally gifted in this area. However, using computers can improve it. According to research, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 have enhanced their hand - eye coordination through computer use. For instance, my mother once had extremely poor hand - eye coordination. But after regularly using a computer, her skills have significantly improved. Oprah also stated, “When I was young, I couldn't catch a ball, but now, as an older person using computers, I'm quite proficient.” Additionally, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people agree that computers aid in hand - eye coordination.  Computers also assist people in learning about far - off places. Without computers, many might never travel to @LOCATION1. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 admit that they would not travel without the information they gather from the internet. Educational websites like www.exploretheworld.org report that @PERCENT2 of its users are students, indicating the role of computers in promoting learning about other countries.  Finally, computers allow online communication. @PERCENT3 of Facebook users have at least one friend living abroad. Good relations between countries are fostered when their people can interact. Www.internationalfriendships.com has over @NUM3 users who communicate with people from other countries. My friend's mother, who was born in @LOCATION2, often chats online with her friends. Dr @PERSON1 said, “International friendships are the best as they allow us to learn about different cultures.”  Imagine a world where countries get along due to online friendships, adults can play baseball because of improved hand - eye coordination, and students can learn about unknown distant places. Computers are indeed beneficial to society as they teach hand - eye coordination, provide access to knowledge about far - away places and people, and enable online communication. So, @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, computers do bring positive benefits to society.
1722	1726	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, did you know that @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 @CAPS2 families own a computer? While computers can be useful for school essays, when it comes to choosing between family and the computer, the average child usually opts for the computer. This is causing a loss of family time, exercise opportunities, and time dedicated to schoolwork.  Mothers often say to their children, “@PERSON3, get off the computer and come play '@CAPS3' with us!” The most common response from children aged @NUM3 to @NUM4 is “@CAPS5!” These children prefer spending time on the computer, whether it's playing games or chatting with friends. This is an issue that demands attention.  My friend @PERSON1 has a little brother who is always on the computer playing games. Whenever @PERSON1 wants to play hide - and - seek with him, he finds excuses to avoid playing and continues to play on the computer.  Computers also deprive kids of exercise. For example, last week when it snowed, I invited my neighbor @PERSON2 to have a snowball fight, but she said she had to finish a level in a computer game. This shows that computers take away time for outdoor activities.  Moreover, computers reduce the time kids spend on schoolwork. A recent survey among eighth - graders revealed that @PERCENT1 of those who don't do their homework spend too much time on the computer. In my science class, a boy named @CAPS7 never does his homework because he is busy talking to his girlfriend on the computer, and she also neglects her homework for the same reason.  Sacrificing family time, exercise, outdoor play, and schoolwork for “@CAPS8 one more level” is too high a price. I hope you will write an article about this important issue in your newspaper and consider my suggestions so that children spend less time on computers and more time on meaningful activities.
1723	1727	1	2	Do you want people to be overweight? Do you want our beautiful outdoors to be ruined? And do you want families to be distant because they are too preoccupied? Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of families don't communicate because they are overly engrossed in computer games. The question we need to address is whether computers have an impact on people. In my view, computers have a negative impact for the following reasons.  People spend excessive time on computers and don't get enough exercise. Statistics indicate that @PERCENT3 of overweight people spend more time on the computer than engaging in physical activity. I recall a time when I was overweight because I spent too much time on the computer. One day, my mother threw the computer out of the window, and I was forced to go outside and exercise. Do you want kids to be overweight like I was?  Many people fail to enjoy the great outdoors because they are too focused on the computer. Lisa, a volunteer worker in @LOCATION1, said, “This field used to be full of plants and animal life, but now it's a wasteland because of computers. People were too preoccupied with their computer - related tasks and didn't care about nature.” @PERCENT4 of high - tech areas are dirty with little plant life as workers prioritize computers over the environment. Do you want this to happen to our country?  Some families struggle to have conversations about their daily lives because they spend too much time on the computer. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of divorces are related to the inability to have a conversation, and this number will likely increase with more technology. My parents got divorced because my father spent more time on the computer than talking to me or my mother.  Although some think computers are good for research, you're still confined to the house instead of being in a large library with all the information you need. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on people.
1724	1728	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, there is an increasing controversy about whether computers benefit society. In my opinion, computers are an excellent resource that will soon become a staple in every household. I am writing to convince you that computers have a positive effect on people.  Computers allow people to stay in touch with those they rarely see. Nowadays, parents are more comfortable sending their children to college as they can use video - chat websites like @ORGANIZATION1 to see them. This feature has significantly influenced people's lives. People in @LOCATION1 can communicate with those in @LOCATION2, enabling the sharing of new and innovative ideas.  Computers also help people keep up with modern life. Many companies are replacing newspaper ads with online ads and some only sell their products on their websites. Students can complete and submit their homework via email if they can't attend school. There are even online colleges where students can take classes from home. I believe that in a few years, more businesses will be conducted using computers, and more stores will operate online only.  Finally, computers provide access to more knowledge through the internet. There are websites dedicated to history and various information. Blogging websites allow people to debate and get answers from experts. Websites like Wikipedia enable users to search for topics, read their history, and follow links for more in - depth research.  Overall, I believe that computers are a great asset to humanity. They will be used for a wider range of purposes in the coming years. They are useful because they offer access to knowledge, help people stay connected, and keep them updated with modern life. In a few years, there will be fewer physical stores, and most shopping will be done online as it is more cost - effective for companies. So, computers will play an even more significant role in our lives in the future.
1725	1729	1	2	Over time, computers have become more advanced and smaller. However, many people are unaware of the dangers they pose to society and personal lives, including stress, addiction, and cyberbullying. I am writing to highlight how computers can be a nuisance.  Computers are a leading cause of stress in daily life. Approximately four out of ten stressed people attribute their stress to computers. For example, if you're writing an important document or emailing your boss and your computer crashes, you'll likely be extremely frustrated. You may lose your data, have to restart the computer, and in the worst - case scenario, take it to a repair shop.  Another stress - inducing factor is computer hacking. Hacking has become a widespread “sport,” with books and instructions available on how to hack. Due to the freedom of speech and press, the government has limited control over this. In @LOCATION1, a hacker shut down the power of an entire city for @NUM1 days. Hackers can also steal personal information like social security numbers, causing significant stress.  Secondly, people, especially teenagers, spend too much time on computers at home. A recent survey shows that six out of ten teenagers spend more than two hours on the computer each day. This reduces their social interaction with friends and family and limits their participation in sports. As a result, they often fail to meet the recommended one - hour - a - day exercise requirement.  In conclusion, the negative impacts of computers, such as stress and reduced social and physical activity, cannot be ignored. People should be more aware of these issues and find a balance in their use of computers.
1726	1730	1	2	The question of whether computers have a net negative impact on people is a subject of much debate. Some believe that computers are an asset to society as they provide access to almost anything. However, this very access can be a problem. The content on computers is exposed to all who view it. Moreover, computers do not contribute to people's physical health, and when it comes to research, books can be more helpful than the internet. The content available on computers and the internet is overwhelming for both individuals and society. There is an excessive amount of information that can be accessed online. Derogatory and pornographic websites are particularly harmful, especially to [ORGANIZATION1] and teenagers. The Chinese government has restricted access to such dangerous sites. Chinese readers have expressed concerns, stating that the easily accessible content on computers is corrupting the minds of the youth. The internet and computers pose a threat of overwhelming people's minds. Secondly, computers can have both mental and physical drawbacks. There are numerous games available on computers for [ORGANIZATION1] to play. Initially, these games seem fun, but they can turn into habits. While games can be enjoyable, when a child spends hours each day playing them, it becomes an issue. The problem is that children are not getting enough exercise. Studies by [ORGANIZATION1] have shown that [PERCENT1] of children who play computer - generated games are overweight. Thus, these games can be a harmful habit for young [ORGANIZATION1]. Lastly, many people conduct research on the internet, but some of the facts found there are inaccurate. The point is that one does not necessarily need a computer for research. Instead, visiting a library is a better option. Although many find books boring, they are more reliable in the long run. I recall a time when I had a project for [PERSON1] in [NUM1] grade on [LOCATION1]. I used the internet to look up information instead of using a book, only to discover that the facts were highly inaccurate. Therefore, one should not rely solely on the internet for research. From derogatory content, to the negative impact on youth's health, to inaccurate research, computers are not assets to society but rather present issues. In my opinion, computers do more harm than good to those who use them.
1727	1731	1	2	I wrote to the local newspaper to share my thoughts on how computers affect people. I wonder if some people have “computer - related viruses” in their heads and need a miracle to break away from the computer. It's because using computers can be unhealthy and a waste of time. More importantly, it can get people into trouble. My stepfather spends an unhealthy amount of time on the computer. He just sits there every day, eating while online. As we age, our bones get weaker, and if we're overly reliant on computers, we won't be as active as we should be. Just think, if we didn't have computers, the time and money people spend on them could be used for more useful things. For example, [NUM1] out of [NUM2] people love computers more than life itself, while only [PERCENT1] of the world spends time on something active instead of being on the computer. A computer can be nice, but one must not let it control them. One day, I was online when I heard sirens getting closer to my house. I got scared, worried that I might have done something wrong. But it turned out the cops were going to my next - door neighbor's house. I guess he was doing illegal things online. This shows that computers can get people into trouble. I also remember getting in trouble with my parents, and they took the computer away from me. Now you can see why computers have a negative impact on people. They are unhealthy for many, take up a lot of people's time, and get people into various troubles.
1728	1732	1	2	Computers are an integral part of daily life and are used by almost everyone. When used properly, they offer numerous benefits. They are essential in every household, helping with various tasks, whether it's finding a song stuck in your head or filing taxes. They are also an excellent learning tool. You can look up answers to nagging questions or learn to play a new song on your favorite instrument, thereby expanding your knowledge. In my view, computers have a more positive impact on society than a negative one. They are a great way to interact with family and friends. Some computers come with built - in cameras, allowing face - to - face conversations with peers, which is especially useful for those with family living far away or in long - distance relationships. Computers are also effective for organizing. Whether it's [CAPS1] or [CAPS2], you can rely on your computer to keep things in order. Some computers even have a built - in calendar to help you plan your day. If you're unsure what to do, computers can also assist in finding places. For instance, if you fly to [LOCATION1] for a business meeting and arrive a few days early, you can use your computer to look up sightseeing spots and have a great day. Overall, computers are indispensable. They will not become obsolete, so everyone should learn how to use them. If you haven't learned yet, you should do so as soon as possible.
1729	1733	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to people. Supporters of technological advancements argue that computers have a positive impact. For example, they enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about distant places and people, and facilitate communication with others. Firstly, important people around the world use computers to build a better future. Those in significant professions such as judges, engineers, lawyers, architects, scientists, and archaeologists rely on computers in their work. This indicates that computers are helpful to people. Secondly, computers are beneficial for kids. They can help children achieve better grades at school and develop a smarter brain. One way is through extensive reading on the computer. Reading on the computer helps kids understand the meaning of new words and speak correctly and clearly. Thirdly, computers assist adults in connecting with different parts of the world. It can be a hobby for adults with free time, allowing them to have a good time. In conclusion, computers can lead to a better life. They can help individuals secure a better future.
1730	1734	1	2	Dear Connecticut [CAPS1], do you like to catch up on your favorite TV shows, shop for the latest trends, or plan a get - together with old friends? Thanks to today's advanced technology, you can do all these on the computer. The experts are debating whether computers are the healthiest thing for our society, but in my opinion, they are great. I'm [NUM1] years old and have a [NUM2] - year - old brother. We spend a lot of time on the computer, not just for homework. I like to shop online for discounts and sales as things are cheaper than in stores. My brother likes to go to concerts and buy the latest video games. My grandparents, who don't watch much TV or read the newspaper, find the computer perfect for catching up on TV shows and the news. With computers, you can chat with old friends on platforms like Facebook, [CAPS2], and [ORGANIZATION3]. [PERCENT1] of teens [CAPS5] prefer to shop by brand names such as [CAPS3], [ORGANIZATION1], [ORGANIZATION2], [CAPS4]. However, many of us can't afford these items at regular prices. On the computer, you can get these brand - name items for less than [MONEY1], compared to [NUM3]%. Computers lower the cost of the things we want and need. I've noticed that grandparents often struggle to have a decent conversation with their children or grandchildren. My grandmother used to only talk about her days during the Great Depression. But with the computer, she can catch up on the news, and now I can sit down with her and have a great conversation. Also, when everyone at school is talking about a particular show, you can use the computer to catch up and not miss out. I remember getting my first Facebook in [NUM4] grade. I felt so cool! On [DATE1], I went to camp and met new kids, all of whom had Facebooks. I've been able to keep in touch with them and maintain our friendships. I know scientists and experts are likely smarter than a [NUM1] - year - old girl, but most teenagers and parents who have Facebook say it's great as it allows us to connect with people worldwide. I hope the experts will make the best decision on whether computers benefit our society and take my ideas into consideration.
1731	1735	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, the issue at hand is the claim that people are addicted to computers. However, I believe this is not the case. Many individuals can multitask, spend time with their families and friends, and most importantly, enjoy life while using computers. In fact, computers can be a source of enjoyment. For example, if you and your friend have computers with webcams and video - messaging capabilities, you can talk, see each other, and have private conversations. Computers do not always take us away from the important people and things in life. They can also be helpful; one can take online courses, learn to write essays, read, and more. For some people, computers are a means of success. The only thing that can prevent you from having fun with your family and friends is yourself, not the computer. Imagine life without a computer. How would you complete a homework assignment that requires computer use when you can't do it at school? Some people truly need computers. If those who developed new technologies had known how excited we would be about computers, perhaps they would have thought differently. In conclusion, it's clear that we need computers as they can benefit our society in various ways.
1732	1736	1	2	@ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS1, can you envision the children in the schools you manage being unable to conduct research on computers? Would you be comfortable with kids not having the option to type their homework? Do you think the adolescents in @LOCATION2 would want to waste paper due to messy handwriting and mistakes? I detest the thought of living in such a way, and I'm certain my peers would agree. This is just one of the many reasons why computers have a positive impact on people. Other reasons include the need for citizens around the world to communicate more easily and the fact that some people need to work from home. As an @ORGANIZATION3, you wouldn't want to upset as many people as taking away computers would. First, consider the schools run by @ORGANIZATION1. Picture children turning in eight - page handwritten essays when typing would have reduced it to three pages. Imagine them scribbling away with cramped hands the night before, trying to write as fast as possible. Their teachers would then have to spend time deciphering the illegible handwriting. I can almost see the kids struggling, their eyes darting around as they try to finish their important papers. Without computers, this is the reality for children. Additionally, students use computers for research, learning about different parts of the world. As an @ORGANIZATION1, I doubt you would say that research has a negative impact on school - kids. Unless, of course, you don't want them to learn. Secondly, close your eyes and think about calling your best friend in @LOCATION1. When they don't pick up, you can turn to your clean, shiny black computer. You hear the keys clicking as you write a message and the sound when you press send. It's amazing how advanced our technology is, allowing you to send a message from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 in seconds. You can't deny that the hard work put into developing computers has had a positive effect, can you? I often talk to my friends in @LOCATION3 on the computer because my family doesn't have long - distance calling. Many of my friends face similar issues, and time differences also make it difficult to call. Have you ever had this problem? Would you want to lose contact with some of your friends? Most importantly, I'd like to share a story. When I was five, my dad used to tuck me into bed every night. But when I was six, he got a job that required him to work late. He stopped coming home to tuck me in, and I was heartbroken. After three weeks of crying, his boss said he could work from home if he had a computer. His work provided one, and he's been tucking me in ever since. Many people can work from home because of computers, which is yet another reason they are beneficial to all citizens. I'm sure you, as an @ORGANIZATION1, need a computer for work. Although I can see why some people oppose computers, I completely disagree. Computers assist people with work, learning, and communication. While people might think computers are expensive, you can find them in almost any price range. I do agree that people shouldn't spend excessive time on computers, but overall, they have a positive impact on the world. I hope you, as an @ORGANIZATION1, will agree.
1733	1737	1	2	I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to people. First, computers have a positive impact on us. They can motivate someone, help find a lost pet, assist in getting a job, and even help in finding a safe home. Clearly, computers bring positive changes. Secondly, computers offer us the ability to learn. They can help deaf people through sign - language websites. We can gather information about places we plan to visit, which helps us learn about different countries. Most importantly, they support both kids and adults with schoolwork and professional work. Thus, it's evident that we can acquire knowledge through computers. Thirdly, computers enable us to communicate with people who are far away. This is extremely useful for families, especially those with hospitalized members. Parents in the military can talk to their children, and adopted kids can connect with their birth parents online. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people. They give us the ability to learn and allow us to communicate with loved ones who are far away. Therefore, using computers is a great benefit to people.
1734	1738	1	2	Dear readers, more and more people around the world are using computers. However, there are those who don't believe that computers benefit society. I'm not one of them. I firmly believe that computers are a boon to society. One reason is that teens and adults can chat with their friends online when there's no other way to contact them. Another reason is that when teachers assign projects during vacations or weekends, students can search for information on the computer. Lastly, computers allow us to learn about things we didn't know before. In my opinion, computers benefit society. Teens, kids, and adults can easily chat with friends on the computer when other contact methods are unavailable. All you need to do is turn on the computer, go to a site where you think your friend might be, log in or register if it's your first time, and then find your friend to chat. Teachers often assign projects, and instead of going to the library to borrow books, kids can find the information they need on the computer. When you're bored, you can use the computer to look up information about nature, books, and more. I'm convinced that computers benefit society, though not everyone agrees. Kids can chat with friends, find project information, and discover new knowledge on the computer. What's your take on this? Am I right or wrong?
1735	1739	1	2	Dear State legislator, imagine living in a time when there were no computers. Now, think about having the technology but not being allowed to use it. Do you think your job would be more difficult? I am certain that computers are making your job and everyone else's lives easier. They improve hand - eye coordination, teach people about far - away places, and enable communication. I firmly believe that computer technology is helping society. Firstly, computers are enhancing hand - eye coordination. As you know, good hand - eye coordination is essential for drivers. According to statistics from “@CAPS2 drivers.com”, the accident rate has decreased by over @PERCENT1 in the past ten years. Computer games for young kids are improving their hand - eye coordination from a young age. Thanks to games like “@CAPS3”, many kids are riding bikes, skiing, or snowboarding by the age of five, all of which require excellent hand - eye coordination. Moreover, resources for hand - eye coordination are being used to help special - ed students complete simple tasks more quickly. Secondly, the world wide web is teaching people of all ages about places thousands of miles away from their homes. I personally use my computer to research a location and learn its history before going on vacation. In our school, computers have benefited our social studies classes. My teacher, @PERSON1, said that even though he has been grading more strictly, the grades on computer and internet research projects are up by @PERCENT2. Our school is also in communication with a school in @LOCATION1. We email our pen - pals once a week, and computers have clearly improved our school's curriculum. Finally, computers allow people of all ages to communicate with business partners, friends, etc. According to “@CAPS4 - tech” magazine, social networking sites have kept @PERCENT3 of friends in touch and reconnected @PERCENT4 of high - school friends. Video - chatting is also being used for business meetings, saving the cost of travel. I bet you spend about @PERCENT5 of your time in the office using a computer for work. In conclusion, computers improve hand - eye coordination, teach us about far - away places, and enable communication. State legislator, please recognize how much society needs computers.
1736	1740	1	2	I firmly believe that computers have a highly positive impact on people. They enhance hand - eye coordination, enable individuals to learn about distant places, and facilitate online communication. Regarding hand - eye coordination, using a computer requires looking at the screen while typing. This skill is crucial throughout one's life. Without it, people may appear clumsy. For example, kids who want to play sports like baseball can benefit greatly as they learn to use their eyes, arms, and hands effectively.   Computers also open the door to knowledge about far - off locations. In a world without this ability, we'd be oblivious to global events. If family members live far away, we can access online information about their areas. Moreover, in an academic setting, when tasked with reports on distant places, the internet is a valuable resource.   Online communication is another significant advantage. It promotes more interaction and the opportunity to make new and better friends. Shy people can gradually become more comfortable talking to others online and eventually in real life. All in all, these are compelling reasons why I think computers are an excellent addition to our lives.
1737	1741	1	2	Dear local newspaper, do you like computers? I love them because they help us learn about all sorts of things. They also let us chat with people on their computers even when we can't call them. One reason I'm fond of computers is that when I have a project, I can simply type it. They make everything easier, so I hope you'll start liking them.  Imagine having a project due in two days, your mom can't drive you to the library, and you have no information on the subject. But you have a computer! You can search for your subject, and numerous websites will quickly appear on your screen. Most of them will help you learn about the topic, giving you time to finish the project and still hang out with friends.  Suppose you forget what page of the book you're supposed to read and lose your friends' contacts. Don't worry; the computer is here to help. You can email or chat with your friends online to find out the pages and get their phone numbers back. A significant percentage of people said that chat and email programs are great because they can contact friends, family, and co - workers.  Typing an essay on the computer is also a breeze. Writing a long essay by hand takes too much time, but with a computer, you can go to Microsoft Office and type it. A large percentage of people said they prefer typing on the computer over writing on paper.  In conclusion, computers are amazing technology for chatting, learning, and typing essays and papers. I hope you'll change your view from thinking computers are bad to realizing they make our lives better.
1738	1742	1	2	To whom it may concern, I am writing to share my thoughts on the effects of computers on people. In my opinion, both positive and negative aspects are valid. On one hand, computers give us the ability to learn about distant places and people and allow online communication. I personally owe the completion of many school projects and homeworks to computers.   On the other hand, some experts and individuals spend excessive time on computers, reducing time for exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I've witnessed people getting addicted to online video games and spending hours glued to the computer. I've also found myself engrossed in new websites instead of exercising.   However, despite these negative aspects, I believe the overall effect of computers on people is positive. Without computers, many students would struggle in classes, getting poor grades on projects, assignments, and homeworks due to the lack of a quick information - lookup method. Also, families and friends would lose a fun and effective way to communicate. So, in my view, computers have a positive impact. What's your opinion?
1739	1743	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I believe that using computers is a great idea and will benefit people. Computers are widely used around the world, and they are beneficial as they help kids learn, communicate with others, and teach responsibility. Please consider my points.  Computers are excellent tools for kids' learning. Buying computer games like cooking games can teach kids how to cook. Even taking care of virtual pets like @PERSON1 is a form of learning. There are numerous good websites such as @ORGANIZATION1. People learn by playing new things, and playing with favorite characters on these platforms is a great way to learn. Using Google to search for answers and typing homework on the keyboard also helps kids learn typing skills.  Communication is another area where computers shine. Tools like @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2, along with webcams, allow kids to talk to friends around the world. There are also websites for global communication. This helps kids understand the differences among people, as everyone has unique languages and personalities.  Using computers also instills a sense of responsibility. Kids using the internet learn about privacy. They should respect others' wishes not to be bothered. They also learn to be nice during video chats, as rudeness can lead to being kicked off platforms. Additionally, since computers are valuable, kids learn to take care of them and be grateful for having one.  In conclusion, if you're considering getting a computer, the answer is yes. Computers are truly beneficial for kids as they aid in learning, enable communication, and teach responsibility.
1740	1744	1	2	"Dear Local newspaper, do you have a computer at home that you enjoy? Computers have become an integral part of life, helping with various aspects such as organization, studies, and entertainment. I firmly believe that computers are useful and make life much easier.  I'm a person who loves using computers. I use them to talk to friends, listen to and search for music, watch YouTube videos, and complete schoolwork. One of the main advantages is that it helps me stay organized. I can create multiple folders to store my work, avoiding the risk of losing or damaging paper documents. I can save music, homework, projects, and more, and always know where to find them. There's no more excuse of ""my dog ate my homework.""  When it comes to studies, saving work on the computer allows for easy addition without erasing, making the work neat and perfect. Teachers often grade on neatness, so there's no need to worry. You can look up information on any topic, which helps in getting better grades. Spelling is no longer a problem as the computer highlights misspelled words and provides suggestions. You can even have text - to - speech programs read books to you, helping you learn new words. Teachers can post homework and project due dates on school websites, eliminating the excuse of not knowing or remembering.  Entertainment is perhaps the most prominent aspect of computers. People upload videos, pictures, and blogs daily. Younger kids play educational games, while older kids enjoy a variety of games like maze, driving, and shooting games. Almost everyone using a computer knows of chat websites like Myspace, Facebook, and Twitter, where they can communicate, express feelings, show love, and send birthday wishes. There's no more ""I'm bored"" with the endless entertainment possibilities on a computer.  Without a doubt, computers are used for work, communication, and self - expression. I hope you'll recognize their value. Which side are you on?"
1741	1745	1	2	Dear local newspaper, in the past few years, computers were non - existent. However, currently, a large number of people have internet access at home. While some believe the impact of computers on people is negative, I firmly hold the view that computers have positive effects in multiple ways. The internet enables people to maintain contact, equips them with technological skills for high - tech jobs, and allows them to discover and learn about new things. In today's globalized world, people are scattered across the globe. Those fortunate enough get to meet many individuals from different regions. Yet, long - distance phone calls can be a hindrance. With a computer, people can stay connected without geographical barriers. It is extremely convenient for people to communicate with others from anywhere without having to be in each other's presence. Moreover, it is an easy means for people to keep in touch with their family members living far away. The world is becoming increasingly reliant on technology and computers. If young people start using computers earlier, it will facilitate their entry into the job market. Many jobs require technological skills for recruitment. Hence, having computer experience at a young age prepares young adults for their future. Additionally, almost every up - to - date workplace, including restaurants, hotels, retail stores, and construction businesses, utilizes computers. Computer skills are not just an advantage; they are essential. Computers also offer a faster and more efficient way to find new information and learn about various topics. Instead of spending time searching through numerous books and encyclopedias, one can simply search the topic online. Although the computer and internet should not completely replace books, they are valuable research tools. For example, someone who has never visited the pyramids can easily research them, view amazing pictures, and learn about their ancient history. Computers allow people to learn about the world without leaving their homes. In conclusion, considering the aspects of staying connected, skill development, and information acquisition, it is evident that computers have a positive impact on people. We should embrace this technology and make the most of its benefits.
1742	1746	1	2	"Although computers can consume a significant amount of a person's time, they also bring numerous benefits. With just a click of the cursor, one can gain a vast amount of knowledge and simplify interaction with others. The computer is an incredibly intelligent device that contains a wealth of information about life and the world. By exploring articles on search engines like Google, one can access a vast reservoir of knowledge. Need to find the best route to a destination? A world map with a bird's - eye view can be accessed instantly. If a child has a school - related question that parents can't answer, there are help websites that can explain how to do homework. And if a child is unsure about their homework and friends are unavailable, most schools have websites with comprehensive information, including grades. In case of being late for a party without a cell phone, one can log on to social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or MySpace to inform friends. In today's digital age, traditional letters have been largely replaced by email and instant messaging. Typing is far more convenient than writing letters. If a mistake is made while typing, hitting the ""backspace"" key allows for easy correction. Moreover, instant messages are received immediately, unlike letters that take a long time to arrive. Missing a cousin or wanting to see a friend? Computers are often equipped with webcams, or a separate one can be purchased. This enables face - to - face conversations with friends and family right on the computer screen. In conclusion, the computer is a multi - functional device that offers far - reaching benefits beyond just learning and interaction. It has transformed the way we live, work, and communicate, making our lives more convenient and connected."
1743	1747	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computer technology is beneficial and has numerous positive effects. Firstly, it teaches us to work independently. After getting accustomed to looking up information on the computer, homework becomes easier. We can gather more information for our assignments, which can lead to better grades. Working on the web also allows us to complete tasks more efficiently on our own. Secondly, the computer enables us to communicate with friends online. If one doesn't have a cell phone, the internet provides an alternative way to stay in touch. It is also useful when we are in a difficult situation and need to inform someone. Moreover, it allows us to connect with relatives we haven't seen in a long time. In addition, using the computer improves hand - eye coordination. We learn to use our hands and fingers more quickly, and it reduces our reliance on traditional typing methods. It also helps us become proficient in web - surfing. Over time, we can easily navigate the web and become experts at finding the information we need. In conclusion, the computer offers a wide range of positive effects. It equips us with typing skills, enhances our ability to search the web, and broadens our knowledge. These benefits clearly demonstrate that computer technology has a positive impact on our lives.
1744	1748	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I am strongly of the opinion that computer technology has a negative impact on the people in our society. People are spending excessive time on computers, neglecting physical exercise and interaction with family and friends. However, there are ways to address this issue. Regular exercise is crucial for our health. If we fail to incorporate exercise into our daily routine, we put our well - being at risk. Activities such as walking a dog, cycling, or jogging in the park are simple yet effective ways to improve physical fitness. Participating in extracurricular activities also plays a significant role in exercise, benefiting both our physical and mental health. Additionally, engaging in local community service projects is another form of exercise. Interacting with family and friends is also an effective way to reduce computer usage. Playing games with family members can strengthen family bonds and help them understand us better. Playing with friends can develop social skills, which may be beneficial in the future. Moreover, interacting with loved ones allows us to relax and let life flow naturally. In conclusion, techniques such as regular exercise and social interaction with family and friends can help us reduce our computer usage. By working together and adopting these methods, we can minimize the negative influence of computers on our lives and improve our overall quality of life.
1745	1749	1	2	Dear newspaper, I believe that computers are excellent tools for research, whether it's for finding information about a car or searching for people, places, and things. Social media platforms are also great as they enable us to stay in touch with family and friends. We can use email, webcam chat, and instant messaging to communicate with them. I think more people should embrace these platforms as they offer a wide range of functions. We can save pictures, download music, and play games. Some people claim that others spend too much time on these platforms. However, I believe that this time is well - spent as it allows people to learn about different countries, cities, and states. There is nothing wrong with spending time on computers as they open up a world of knowledge and connection. In conclusion, computers and social media platforms have numerous benefits. They facilitate research, keep us connected with our loved ones, and offer entertainment and learning opportunities. We should make the most of these technological advancements and use them to enhance our lives.
1746	1750	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers do not bring as many benefits to society as people assume. In my view, nature can offer all the qualities that any computer can provide. A computer cannot offer fitness, genuine interactions with friends or family, or real - world experiences.  It is known that @PERCENT1 of children in @LOCATION2 are overweight due to a lack of exercise. According to @CAPS1 @PERSON1, an expert from @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1, computer systems are the primary cause of insufficient exercise. So, how can a system that leads to obesity be regarded as a benefit to society?  Moreover, overweight children who spend @NUM1 hours on computers put off healthy activities such as basketball or tennis. This not only leaves them socially behind but also deprives them of healthy experiences.  People often think that computers know everything, but in fact, there are very few things one can truly experience on a computer. For example, you can read about World War @CAPS2, but can you really understand what people were thinking or what combat felt like? A computer cannot teach you how to feel; only real - life experiences can. If you were deployed to an army in @LOCATION1, you would know what it's like to be in war, but playing a game or reading an article cannot provide such an experience.  Another point is about real - life interactions with family and friends. There is only one true way to see family or friends, and that is in person. People claim to talk to their friends and family online all the time, but true satisfaction can only come from seeing them face - to - face. For instance, a romantic relationship would likely fail if the only form of communication was online, unlike most successful relationships.  I hope this letter to your newspaper will draw people's attention. I would appreciate it if you joined my cause to protect society from the dangerous computer technology that can cause obesity, poor relationships, and inexperience.
1747	1751	1	2	"Computers are indeed remarkable technology, yet they have a detrimental impact on people's lives. They cause children to perform poorly in school and lead to a lack of exercise. Moreover, children put themselves at risk by using certain websites.  I'm almost @PERCENT1 certain that students who do badly in school are those who come home, toss their backpacks in the hallway, and start playing silly online games. My mom used to complain about my dad spending too much time on @CAPS1, even though he only spent @NUM1 minutes a day chatting with family. Now, my mom has her own @CAPS1 account. She said she would only use it to connect with family, but instead, she plays pointless applications like ""cafe world."" She wastes time on @CAPS1 when she could be spending quality time with the family or friends.  I used to be one of those students who came home, dropped my stuff in the hall, and turned on the computer. The difference was that I didn't play games; I just talked to friends I'd just seen. After getting my report card, I realized my grades were horribly bad. My dad then disconnected my @CAPS4, and I believe my grades have improved. At first, I was angry with my dad, but now I'm grateful for him breaking my bad habit of being online all the time. He also pointed out to my sister how much exercise she was missing out on because of online gaming.  Computers can be quite pointless in many ways. Some websites are extremely dangerous. I once watched a TV show at my aunt's. An old, creepy man created a website where teens had to videotape themselves choking, and the one who did it the longest won. About a hundred students died from this deadly game. There's also ""blogtv.com,"" where teens go live on webcam for anyone to watch. I remember one week when my cousin Denise and her friend tried to get more viewers. They did inappropriate things like flashing, dirty dancing, and showing body parts. They were banned from the site, but not before people had screenshot and posted pictures of them. This is disturbing and unacceptable.  People, stop wasting your lives! Don't let the computer keep you at home. It's unsafe and a waste of time."
1748	1752	1	2	To Whom It May Concern, I wonder how many hours a day you spend on the computer. I guess it's too many. In my opinion, computers are warping people's minds, and things should return to the way they were before.  Some people may disagree and claim that computers are helpful for school - going children. While that might be true to some extent, just a couple of decades ago, the average student didn't even own a computer, and schools were still teaching the same materials without them. Moreover, some children use computers to cheat on homework and essays, which clearly doesn't contribute to good education.  Another reason computers may not benefit society is the associated dangers. Sexual predators lurk on the internet, and many people talk to strangers online without realizing the potential harm.  In conclusion, I feel strongly about the negative effects of computers on society for these reasons. I hope you can see things from my perspective and agree with me.
1749	1753	1	2	"Dear Local Newspaper, as the ones who write for a living every day, I'd like you to share your views on computers. Computers offer numerous benefits. They allow us to learn about far - away places, enhance hand - eye coordination, and enable online communication.  First, computers let us learn about distant places without leaving our rooms. A friend of my mom's moved to @LOCATION2. Since she didn't like using computers, she didn't look up @LOCATION2's laws, saying she'd figure it out when she got there. After arriving, she was arrested multiple times in the first few years because she didn't know the laws well. A few months after her last arrest, she returned to @LOCATION3 where she was familiar with the laws. @LOCATION2 is a beautiful country, and all her arrests were due to her lack of knowledge of the laws. Just ten minutes of searching for @LOCATION2's laws on a computer could have kept her in @LOCATION1.  Second, computers improve hand - eye coordination. A survey shows that @PERCENT1 of children who spend more time on computers are better at tennis and baseball than others. However, @PERSON3, a gym teacher at @ORGANIZATION2, says that some of these kids are weak and need more exercise.  You, as the local newspaper, have the power to express your opinion on the effects of computers on people. I firmly believe that computers have great effects. They teach hand - eye coordination, provide the ability to learn about far - away places, and allow us to talk to people. In fact, @PERCENT2 of people agree with my view on computers.  Using computers helps with hand - eye coordination. For example, my grandmother says she can use her hands and eyes well because of computer use, as she types and researches all day. Computers are designed to make our eyes and hands focus better.  Computers also have a wealth of information about far - away places. @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""I always use computers for my work as it helps me learn new things. Moreover, it lets my wife and me search for details about a trip we want to take."" Many people agree with @PERSON2. Although some may say computers sometimes provide incorrect information, if you find a good website, it won't lie.  Finally, using computers allows us to talk online or video - chat with friends and family worldwide. If you haven't seen your relatives in a long time and can't afford a visit, video - chat is a great option. It has brought people closer and changed the way we see the world. Instead of using up cell - phone minutes, buy a laptop or computer with a camera for video - chatting.  In conclusion, computers can improve hand - eye coordination, help us research far - away places, and enable online communication. I hope you can tell the world that computers are useful and that people use them every day without problems. When you make others smile by sharing the idea that spending time on the computer can teach a lot, you'll have a great feeling!"
1750	1754	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, computers are being used globally. While some think it's a bad idea, I firmly believe they have a positive impact on people's lifestyles.  Computers are excellent tools for staying in touch. There are platforms like @CAPS1, MySpace, Twitter, Facebook, email, and video chat. For example, my cousin is in @LOCATION1, and we often use video chat to communicate. Without this, we'd have no way to talk to him. Many people around the world rely on computers for communication.  Moreover, computers are already amazing and will only get better. Just imagine what they'll be like in @NUM1 or @NUM2 years. As more people buy and use computers, companies will be more motivated to invent new and improved ones.  Computers also greatly assist kids. On average, about @PERCENT1 of kids in the @CAPS2.S use a computer daily. They use it to chat with friends, play games, do homework, and for many other purposes. Additionally, both kids and adults use computers to find out how to do things or locate places in their town.  In conclusion, computers are used worldwide for various reasons. They help people stay connected, are bound to improve further, and benefit kids. Since everyone is using computers, shouldn't you join in too?
1751	1755	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a profoundly positive impact on people's lives. Every day, millions of individuals use computers for a multitude of purposes. One of the main reasons I hold this view is that computers are an excellent tool for research. People can explore various topics and learn about places they never knew existed. For instance, when faced with a homework assignment, there's no need to rely solely on books; a computer can provide all the necessary information.  Computers also revolutionize communication. They allow us to connect with friends and family who live far away. Instead of the traditional and time - consuming method of sending letters, we can now use emails and instant messaging. This not only makes communication faster but also more convenient.  Moreover, computers have become a significant news resource. In the past, we had to read newspapers to stay informed about breaking news. But now, with a computer, we can access the entire newspaper and even get more in - depth information about global events. So, what's the point of reading a physical newspaper when a computer can offer so much more?  In conclusion, computers make life easier in countless ways. They are helpful in research, communication, and keeping us informed. I truly don't understand why some people think computers have a negative effect. In today's world, computers are an essential part of our lives, and their positive influence is undeniable.
1752	1756	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, using your computer daily can be a huge waste of life. Your computer time takes away from the time you could spend exercising and enjoying nature. It can also distract you from meaningful human interactions and waste a significant amount of energy.  Imagine sitting at your desk, chatting with friends online. Without the computer, you're just sitting there, not burning a single calorie or using any muscles (except your fingers). Don't you think you should be doing something more useful, like taking a walk and enjoying the beauty of nature? Obesity is a real problem in [LOCATION1], with [PERCENT1] of [CAPS3] considered ""fat"". Why would you spend your day sitting in a chair when you could go to the gym and shed some extra weight?  Communicating through [CAPS5] is overrated. People can't fully express their emotions; all they can do is send a smiley or happy face. This kind of communication can cause you to miss out on important information. For example, if there's a work cancellation announced on the news, but you're chatting with a friend online and miss it. And let's face it, [PERCENT2] of people don't even ""laugh out loud"" when they send that phrase to their friends. It's time to get out and have real - life conversations.  Also, even if you've bought energy - saving lights, running your computer daily still wastes a lot of energy. Running that [CAPS11] uses about the same amount of energy as [NUM1] regular light bulbs in [NUM2] hours. So, is that light really saving you money? With the current bad economy, we can't afford to waste energy and money on excessive computer use.  In conclusion, computers are bad. They prevent us from enjoying nature, reduce our communication skills, and waste energy. We should limit our computer time and focus on more productive and healthy activities."
1753	1757	1	2	I believe the reason people use computers so much is that many have work or projects to complete on them. However, I understand the concern raised in the article about people spending too much time on computers and less on exercise.  Most young teens start using computers at an early age and get hooked because there are so many things to do, like downloading free games and playing with others from around the world. While adults mainly use computers for work or research, a lot of teens are on the computer every day and rarely exercise.  The internet has introduced a lot of advanced technology. In the past few years, we can search for old friends from school on the web or chat with strangers from all over the world. We can have a [NUM1] [CAPS1] and buy new songs or albums without going to a local store. We can also shop online and have clothes delivered to our doorstep. We can even rent or buy movies to keep on our [CAPS2].  In conclusion, while computers offer many conveniences, the excessive use by teens is a concern. We need to find a balance between using computers for their benefits and ensuring that we also get enough exercise and real - world experiences.
1754	1758	1	2	Dear local newspaper, on a beautiful sunny day, it's disheartening to see people inside, glued to their computers instead of enjoying the weather. I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on people as they cause a decline in communication skills, reduce exercise, and harm health.  First, communication skills are severely affected. People who use computers daily often enter chat rooms without knowing who they're talking to. For example, in a chat room, someone might ask for personal information like your address, phone number, and name, which could lead to dangerous situations such as kidnapping or rape. Interactions with family and friends also decrease. Whether you're playing an online game, watching random YouTube videos, or using social media like Facebook and Twitter, these activities can be addictive. YouTube can be dangerous for younger children as they might accidentally access inappropriate websites. And constantly sharing every moment of your day on social media is not a real form of communication. If we don't maintain our communication skills, they're sure to decline.  Second, exercise is a major problem. Doctors say that [PERCENT1] of parents are obese or overweight according to [ORGANIZATION1]. Kids just sit at home, playing games like Sims [NUM1] or video - chatting with friends instead of going out. People rarely go for walks or enjoy nature anymore. As [PERSON1] from [LOCATION1] in [LOCATION2] said, the number of people using parks is decreasing, and soon, parks might have to close.  Finally, people are becoming more unhealthy. If you're on the computer every day, your eyesight is likely to deteriorate. My aunt, who uses a computer at work daily, had to see an eye doctor because her vision was weakening. The doctor asked if she used a computer daily, and after she answered yes, he said she might need cataract eye surgery. Also, typing and using the mouse all the time can lead to arthritis in your hands and fingers.  In conclusion, technology is clearly harming our communication skills, exercise, and health. We don't want this for future generations. So, let's take action and contact our local newspaper to raise awareness about these issues.
1755	1759	1	2	Dear [CAPS1], I am convinced that computers have a negative impact on people's lives. Computers consume a large amount of people's time, which could be better spent on other important matters. The internet also contains a lot of inappropriate content that children should not be exposed to, and there are numerous predators online targeting young children.  Computers take up so much valuable time. In America, the childhood obesity rate is rising, and electronics, especially computers, play a significant role in this. For example, my brother plays on the computer every day and rarely goes outside. The computer has become the center of his life, leaving no room for other activities.  The internet is filled with all kinds of content, from songs to pornographic websites. Most sites don't alert users that they need to be [NUM1] or older to view the content, and very few actually ask for proof. This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.  Worst of all, there are millions of predators on the internet targeting young teens. They use chat sites, pretending to be teens or children under an alias, with the motive of luring young victims to a secure location and committing rape. Some victims are brave enough to speak up, but most are too afraid or ashamed.  In conclusion, although computers have some positive aspects, the cons far outweigh the pros. The occupation of time, inappropriate content, and the presence of predators make computers a negative influence on people's lives. I truly believe that the world would be better off without the excessive use of computers.
1756	1760	1	2	In today's digital age, computer usage has emerged as a highly controversial topic. In my view, computers exert a negative influence on individuals. Firstly, computer usage is fraught with safety risks, especially for children who can easily access inappropriate content on the internet. Additionally, people nowadays spend excessive amounts of time in front of computers, which not only serves as a major distraction but also has a detrimental impact on children's schoolwork. Safety is a paramount concern for parents. When children are online, they can access a vast array of content, much of which is inappropriate. Sometimes, inappropriate content pops up unexpectedly, even when children are not actively seeking it. For example, websites like @CAPS2.com pose significant risks to internet safety. Despite the requirement to be at least @NUM1 years old to have a @CAPS2 account, many children lie about their age. Shockingly, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 @CAPS2 users admit to lying about their age, and it's not just @NUM4 - year - olds; even @NUM6 - year - olds may claim to be @NUM7. Moreover, people often lie about their identities online, which is not the kind of internet exposure parents want for their children. Another negative aspect of computer usage is the impact on health. More than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are overweight and unhealthy. On a beautiful @DATE1 day with bright blue skies, fluffy clouds, and a warm breeze, instead of going outside and being active, people prefer to stay indoors on their computers. For instance, rather than going for a walk, they spend hours on Facebook. Lack of exercise is already a problem, and excessive computer use exacerbates it. People need to be reminded that turning off the computer and engaging in physical activities like a neighborhood game of baseball is not only fun but also much more beneficial for their health. Academic performance is also affected by computer use. Kids who spend more time on the computer are more likely to do poorly in school. As a student, I can attest that the computer is a highly tempting distraction that can easily pull students away from their studies. It's unrealistic to expect children to make the right decision and prioritize their studies over computer use. Therefore, it's time for us to take action and address the negative effects of computers. We need to decide whether to accept the current situation or take steps to mitigate these issues. So, do you believe that computers have a negative effect? Let's make a change now!
1757	1761	1	2	Dear @PERSON1, computers are indeed useful in our daily lives, but they also have a dark side. Some users become addicted to their @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, which causes them to distance themselves from friends and family and neglect physical activity. It's understandable that the @CAPS4 is so appealing. You can charge your iPod, tweet, listen to music, play games, and do many other things all at once. However, excessive use of the @CAPS4 can make people miss out on various real - life activities. It has become an epidemic where everyone seems to be sucked into their computers. For example, people who are constantly on their @CAPS4 @NUM1 are detached from their friends and family. They might say things like, “I haven't talked to him since his surgery. I wonder how he is. Let me check on Facebook.” But chatting on Facebook or Twitter is not the same as having a face - to - face conversation. When people are glued to their @CAPS4, they become lazy. An @CAPS4 addict might say, “I'm supposed to go to the gym, but let me check my Twitter first.” Then, two hours later, they finally head to the gym. People don't exercise as often as they should. What they plan to do for @NUM2 minutes on the @CAPS4 can end up taking @NUM3 hours. They have to sign in, chat with friends, check their mail, look at tweets, check out restaurant reviews, watch YouTube videos, and do all sorts of other things. In conclusion, while computers are beneficial, they have side effects such as addiction, social isolation, and lack of exercise. @CAPS4 addicts should reduce their time spent on the @CAPS4 to lead a healthier and more balanced life.
1758	1762	1	2	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 are concerned that people are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time outdoors enjoying nature or exercising. However, I believe there are several positive aspects of using the computer. Firstly, both kids and adults can communicate with their friends online. You might think that kids already see their friends at school, but what if their friends have moved to a different city, state, or even a different country? In such cases, the computer is the only way to stay connected. Making long - distance phone calls can result in hefty phone bills, so online communication is a more practical option. In fact, seventy - five percent of people talk to their friends through the computer, and about half of them are communicating with friends who live in another state or country. Do we really want people to lose touch with their friends? Secondly, the computer provides an opportunity to make new friends, similar to having pen - pals. Pen - pals are people you correspond with who may live in a different state or country. If you're doing a school assignment and your pen - pal doesn't speak fluent @CAPS3, you can teach them @CAPS3, and they can teach you their language. Finally, there's a way to manage kids' computer time. For example, if a child wants to play a game on the “@CAPS5” and uses up all the allotted time, and then another child wants to use the computer the next day but throws a tantrum, the parent should take away the computer for a certain period. Once the child cooperates, they can regain access to the computer. In conclusion, there are many useful things to do on the computer, from staying in touch with distant friends to making new ones, and a proper computer schedule can help balance its use. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.
1759	1763	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, did you know that over half of our nation owns home computers? Recently, some experts have questioned whether computers are beneficial to society. In my opinion, computers have a positive impact because they are essential for work, facilitate online socialization, and enhance travel. First of all, computers are indispensable for work and @ORGANIZATION1. Students rely on the @CAPS5 to keep their essays, study guides, and homework updates organized. Offices would be unable to function without computers as workers depend on the internet and email systems. An interview with a student from @ORGANIZATION1 revealed that they use their @CAPS5 for everything. The student stated, “I would not be able to handle the workload without @CAPS3. @CAPS3 keeps everything organized and makes it easier to research topics.” A lawyer also emphasized the importance of a @CAPS5, saying, “You can't support a client without the right tools, and a @CAPS5 is one of those tools.” Without computers, offices would collapse, and students' grades would decline. It's hard to imagine writing a newspaper without a @CAPS5. Secondly, internet access enables people to meet new people. Social networking websites like '@CAPS6' and '@CAPS7' allow people to reconnect with old friends and make new ones. According to a poll, @PERCENT1 of the nation has accounts on socializing websites, and @PERCENT2 of the nation reports that their friend groups have expanded. A psychologist explained that some people who are too shy to make friends in person can thrive online. Without the internet, citizens in @LOCATION1 would know very little about people from other countries. Lastly, the internet has significantly increased traveling. It allows citizens to research destinations and purchase transportation tickets. It is also an efficient way to book accommodation. A poll conducted by @ORGANIZATION2 airports showed that @PERCENT3 of travelers book their flights online. A worker at an airport said that without online ticketing, the wait to book flights would be extremely long or might even prevent people from traveling. My team and I interviewed @NUM1 people at various airports and train stations across the country, and @PERCENT4 of them said they bought their tickets online. One person interviewed said, “How do we travel? Of course, on the internet! No one could get anywhere if we stood in lines all day.” Airports contribute to the @LOCATION2 government's revenue, and without the internet, less people would travel. In conclusion, computers are essential. They have a positive effect on users by enabling easy organization and research, facilitating online socialization, and providing better ways to book travel. Without computers and internet access, our businesses would fail, and the economy would suffer. I hope you agree with my view.
1760	1764	1	2	Dear @PERSON1, the rapid advancement of technology, particularly computers, is having a negative impact on people. People are spending an excessive amount of time on computers and neglecting activities that are more beneficial for them. One of the major drawbacks of computer use is its impact on health. Staring at a bright computer screen for more than @NUM1 minutes at a time can severely damage your eyes and may lead to significant vision loss. Moreover, spending all your time indoors on the computer means you miss out on much - needed exercise. You should spend as much time outside as you do on the computer. Fresh air, sunlight, and physical activity are crucial for your well - being. Another issue is the lack of real - life social interaction. When chatting online, you can't truly understand the other person's feelings, and you may not even be sure who you're talking to. Face - to - face interaction is far superior for maintaining good social health. To have a fulfilling social life, you need to hang out with friends, laugh, and have a good time in person, rather than sitting alone in a dark room chatting with online friends. Computers can also be extremely distracting. For instance, if you need to type an article for the paper on the computer, a simple decision to play a game for a minute or check something online can turn into hours of distraction. You might think it will only take a short time, but before you know it, you've wasted @NUM4 hours. Then you have to stay up late to finish your work. This problem affects people of all ages and often leads to unfinished tasks. In conclusion, although computers represent a technological advancement, they have significant negative side effects. I believe it's our responsibility to inform people about these negative aspects and help them overcome the challenges posed by computer use. @PERSON1, let's write an article in the paper to warn people about the harmful effects of computers and encourage them to use computers more responsibly.
1761	1765	1	2	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers are beneficial as they enable us to learn about others, including famous individuals from the past. They also allow us to explore different places such as @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, and Texas. Learning about various locations is an enjoyable experience. Owning a computer is advantageous because it provides access to the web, where one can play games, view content, and engage in numerous other activities that are likely to be appealing. Additionally, it facilitates communication with friends from afar through platforms like MySpace, Yahoo, and other websites that connect us with diverse people we meet online. In conclusion, computers offer a wealth of learning and social opportunities, making them a valuable tool.
1762	1766	1	2	"Throughout history, humans have shown a continuous interest in technology, and computers are a significant part of it. In my opinion, computers have a positive impact on people. They enhance hand - eye coordination, contribute to tree conservation, and enable individuals to acquire knowledge about everything. Hand - eye coordination is essential in our daily lives; activities like driving a car or writing all involve it. A few years ago, I had poor hand - eye coordination and struggled to catch a ball. Nowadays, I spend up to an hour and a half on the computer each day. I've noticed that my handwriting has improved, and I can catch balls easily. Do you want to risk crashing your car due to poor hand - eye coordination? Computers not only improve hand - eye coordination but also save trees. Using a computer eliminates the need for paper, allowing us to read and write without using a single sheet. As a result, @PERCENT1 of tree - cutting has been halted. Saving trees is crucial for our survival as they produce the oxygen we breathe. Some argue that computers cause people to spend less time enjoying nature. However, I believe that without computers, there would be less nature to enjoy. Finally, computers help people worldwide learn about almost anything. A scientist, @PERSON1, said that ""with the computer, we can share our discoveries with the world."" Thanks to computers, we found a doctor to treat my dad. The average person can learn non - average things every day. There are online dictionaries with multiple translations that would typically require about @NUM1 books. The computer is one of the greatest technological advancements to date, benefiting our world in numerous ways. It enhances hand - eye coordination, preserves the environment, and provides knowledge, which is essential for success in life."
1763	1767	1	2	It is certain that @NUM1 years from now, we will still be using computers, whether for chatting with friends, conducting research, or typing up assignments for @ORGANIZATION1. Computers are truly wonderful as they enable us to do many things that would be difficult or impossible to achieve alone. Without computers, our lives would be vastly different. Recently, a girl in @CAPS1 went to a friend's house to do homework. After finishing, when she tried to walk home, she disappeared. With computers, we can collaborate on homework with friends without leaving our homes, ensuring our safety. Additionally, computers allow us to conduct research on unfamiliar topics. Instead of searching through old books that may lack the required information, a search on @ORGANIZATION1 can provide a map of its location and access to the school's website for homework details. Clearly, computers save us a significant amount of time. Moreover, we can complete our homework on computers, whether it involves research or simple typing. Most of our daily homework is computer - based. On @DATE1, we had to type a prompt about vending machines in our @ORGANIZATION1. In @NUM2 grade, almost every night's homework is on the @CAPS3, and if we forget to write down the assignment, the computer provides an alternative source of information. In conclusion, computers are an indispensable part of our lives, and those who oppose them may not be using them correctly.
1764	1768	1	2	I firmly believe that the effects of computers are negative, and I have three main reasons to support this view. Firstly, excessive computer use can lead to blindness. The computer screen emits a large amount of light, and people often find it difficult to stop staring at the monitor. Prolonged exposure can cause vision problems and may even result in blindness. Therefore, it is crucial to limit screen time. Secondly, people need to relax their eyes and engage in activities other than using computers. When people spend too much time on computers, they miss out on opportunities to interact with family and friends, enjoy the beauty of nature, or engage in hobbies such as reading, drawing, or watching @CAPS4. Finally, reducing computer usage is beneficial as it allows people to spend more time with their loved ones, save energy, and avoid high electricity bills. It also gives the eyes a chance to rest. In conclusion, the reasons of potential blindness, the need for vision relaxation, and the importance of reducing computer time clearly demonstrate that the effects of computers are quite negative.
1765	1769	1	2	Dear editor, I think people are overusing computers, and the drawbacks outweigh the benefits. People are getting less exercise, missing out on the beauty of nature, and spending less quality time with family and friends. To begin with, insufficient exercise is a significant issue. Children, in particular, are spending too much time on computers, contributing to the child obesity crisis in America. Many adults are also overweight because they sit at computers for work and entertainment all day. Clearly, computers are having a negative impact on our health. Secondly, people are neglecting to explore nature. The Earth offers countless wonders waiting to be discovered, such as new species of animals, fish, and plants. By spending too much time on computers, we are missing out on these opportunities. Thirdly, family and friends are not spending enough quality time together. Instead of having in - person conversations and creating memories, people are chatting online. Children are spending more time on computers than sharing family meals and engaging in meaningful family discussions. In conclusion, computers are taking over our lives, leading to less exercise, less appreciation of nature, and less time with loved ones.
1766	1770	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, some experts worry that excessive computer use is detrimental to health. However, this view is incorrect. Computers offer significant benefits in communication, education, and entertainment.  In terms of communication, computers enable people to stay connected with family and friends. While some may argue that phones are better for communication, computers have an edge in long - distance communication. There are no busy signals, and sending emails globally incurs no extra cost. You can send a message and go about your business while waiting for a reply.  Computers also play a crucial role in education. Many individuals, especially those taking college - level courses, are turning to online learning. Approximately half of college students are not physically present in a school. This is particularly beneficial for those with full - time jobs, as they can earn a degree at their own pace. Moreover, computers can answer simple queries like the location of the nearest @ORGANIZATION1 or the price of an item. They can even assist in vacation planning and learning about distant countries.  Entertainment is another area where computers shine. With a simple click, one can watch a funny video to lift their spirits. There is a vast array of games, from the trivial to the addictive, to keep boredom at bay. For music lovers, computers offer free access to songs and music videos. And if portability is a concern, laptops are always an option.  In conclusion, it is evident that computers enhance people's lives by providing communication, education, and entertainment opportunities.
1767	1771	1	2	Computers are an important topic. Although they may not be entirely beneficial, when used correctly, they can be an essential part of life.  Computers are a great source of information. A survey shows that @NUM1 out of ten people consider computers a part of their daily lives. For example, without computers, half the world might not know about the recovery of Haiti after the earthquake.  In terms of social interaction, children are more socially active on the internet than ever. More than @NUM2 of the world's population relies on interactive websites to communicate. Children now have more online friends than before. We don't want to be the ones who prevent kids from having these social experiences.  In the academic field, computers are indispensable for school projects. Take @PERSON2 as an example. He had terrible handwriting, and for the biggest project of the year, he used his computer to type it. If there were no computers, he would have received a @CAPS2 - for the project. Teachers often tell students to type their homework or projects. @PERSON1 said that many kids pass his class by typing, and without computers, they would all fail.  In summary, computers are used for daily needs such as getting information, making friends, and doing school projects. We need to decide whether to support the use of computers or let the so - called “madness” of restricting them continue. We should consider the negative impact on society, including socially - retarded and academically - failing kids.
1768	1772	1	2	Dear Newspaper Readers, have you ever thought about how many hours a day you spend on the computer? In today's modern world, it seems difficult for many to break away from the computer screen and face real life. Nearly @PERCENT1 of the people in @LOCATION1 own a computer, and this excessive computer use is causing problems for our country.  Excessive time on the computer leads to a lack of exercise. Statistically, @ORGANIZATION1 is the most overweight country, and one of the reasons is the hours spent sitting in front of the computer instead of engaging in healthy exercise. This lack of exercise can cause serious health problems, including obesity, which damages joints; diabetes, which reduces the quality of life; and heart disease, a leading cause of death in the country.  The outdoors also suffers from our computer addiction. Every day has its own beauty, such as clear skies and warm temperatures. But instead of going outside, people often just glance out the window and go back to their laptops. Our bodies need sunlight and fresh air. Staying indoors deprives our bodies of an important element.  Moreover, being on the computer all the time affects more than just our health. We learn things virtually on the computer, but when forced into the real world, we may find ourselves ill - prepared. It also keeps us from having real - life experiences and interacting with others face - to - face.  In conclusion, the amount of time we spend on computers is causing significant harm. Computers are clearly bad for people as they contribute to obesity, prevent real - world experiences, and damage social bonds. It's time to step away from the computer and embrace real life before these negative effects further damage @LOCATION1.
1769	1773	1	2	Dear @CAPS1 newspaper, I recently read that some people oppose the use of computers. I disagree with them.  One of the main advantages of computers is that they enable people to communicate. Suppose your friend moves a few states away. With high long - distance phone rates, many can't afford frequent communication. However, with a computer, you can send pictures or have video chats, and it's free. You can also send short messages like “see you at @NUM1” without incurring extra costs.  Computers also teach important hand - eye coordination. You can play games, take quizzes and tests, attend online school, and listen to music. There are even websites that teach you how to use a keyboard and operate electronics like a computer.  In addition, computers allow you to explore far - away places without leaving home. This is useful for school projects, planning family reunions or vacations, or finding a sunny spot for fun.  Some people worry that too many people are staying in front of computers instead of exercising and being outdoors. To address this, people should limit their computer and electronic device usage and then go outside for exercise or to visit new places.  In conclusion, computers offer many benefits, including communication, the development of hand - eye coordination, and the ability to explore distant places. They are truly a great invention, and we should make good use of them while also maintaining a healthy balance.
1770	1774	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION2 (our local newspaper), I've noticed that more and more people are using computers, and this is a remarkable advancement for our society.  Computers have a positive impact on people in several ways. Firstly, they improve hand - eye coordination. Statistics show that sports players who own computers are @PERCENT1 more talented in hand - related activities like baseball or basketball than those who don't. This improvement also extends to daily tasks such as driving a car or doing the dishes.  Secondly, computers help us learn about far - away places and people. Thanks to computer technology, it's easier to access information. @PERSON1, a @NUM1 - grade student, said that he couldn't have finished his @CAPS3 @CAPS4 report without his laptop. When planning a vacation, you can easily research your destination's location and culture using a computer's advanced search engine.  Finally, computers facilitate communication. There are various ways to communicate, including video chatting, @CAPS6 messaging, and speaking aloud. @PERSON3, a resident of @LOCATION1, said that after moving away from his best friend, he could still stay in touch using his computer.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people by teaching hand - eye coordination, helping us learn about the world, and enabling communication. We should embrace this trend. Ask yourself how computers could positively affect your life.
1771	1775	1	2	"Dear newspaper, I firmly believe that computers bring significant benefits to society. Firstly, they function like large electronic encyclopedias. Instead of laboriously flipping through dictionary pages to find a word, one can simply access the internet, navigate to @LOCATION1, enter the word in the search box, and all relevant information appears instantly. When I need to write a paper, I often turn to the internet. For instance, when I had to write about @PERSON1, I used the internet to find a website, took notes, rephrased them, and created a works - cited page. This was much more efficient than relying on children's books at the library. Moreover, one can look up places such as @CAPS1 @LOCATION2 or use @ORGANIZATION1 to find the location of a place.  Secondly, computers are akin to large cellphones with huge keyboards. My elder sister frequently uses @CAPS2 on the computer to chat with her friends, which has improved her typing skills. There are also platforms like @CAPS3 where one can play games with friends and communicate during the game.  Finally, computers play a crucial role in keeping our soldiers out of harm's way. When I watch ""Future Weapons"", I see unnamed helicopters that can be controlled from hundreds of miles away. There is also a robot used for mine - clearing, which saves numerous lives. I interviewed @CAPS4 @CAPS5 from the military, and he said, ""@CAPS6 use those helicopters all the time. @CAPS6 appreciate that no one has to be in the helicopters, so @CAPS6 don't have to worry.""  In conclusion, computers are beneficial to society as they serve as electronic encyclopedias, large - scale cellphones, and tools for protecting our soldiers. In schools, @CAPS6 constantly use computers for writing papers and conducting research."
1772	1776	1	2	"I believe that technology, especially computers, has a profound impact on people. In my view, computers have a positive influence. A large number of computer users utilize them to connect with family, conduct research, or present their work neatly instead of writing on paper.   Around @PERCENT1 of people use computers mainly to connect with family members who often live far away or in another state. Video - chatting on the computer is a great way to stay in touch. Additionally, instead of making long phone calls that can be time - consuming, one can @CAPS1 - mail @CAPS2 family members. Social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter also enable us to reconnect with old friends.  @CAPS3 Romano from Strong Middle School said, ""My teachers like it when I use the computer to do my work. They say it's much neater."" Teachers indeed prefer students to use computers for assignments. When writing a book report or a story, using Microsoft Word makes the paper easier for teachers to read. In science class, using Excel to create charts or graphs makes them look more professional. For presentations on topics like ""Bloody @DATE1"" or ""Little @CAPS4 Nine"", using PowerPoint is better than reading from note - cards.  Computers are also indispensable for research. Without search engines like Google or Yahoo, students would struggle to prepare for presentations. Even in daily life, if there's a family discussion at dinner or a disagreement about song lyrics, the internet provides quick answers.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. They are excellent for connecting with friends and family, presenting work neatly, and conducting research."
1773	1777	1	2	Dear Newspaper, computers have advanced significantly since their inception. Some people perceive computers as a means to dull the mind, while others view them as powerful learning tools. Although computers can have negative effects, especially on children, their positive impacts outweigh the negatives as they enable people to learn about distant places and communicate online.  On the negative side, computers can be misused as a form of childcare. When children are on the computer, they sit idle, staring at a screen filled with words and pictures. Some parents use the computer to keep their kids quiet instead of taking them outdoors. Growing up in such an environment, children may only know how to play computer games and talk to friends online. Kids have abundant energy and need to engage in productive activities to stay fit and healthy. Using the computer as a babysitter can lead to childhood obesity as children neglect proper physical care.  On the positive side, computers offer the opportunity to learn about far - off places and people. For example, if a teacher assigns a last - minute essay on @LOCATION2 due in a week, traveling to @LOCATION2 to gather information is both time - consuming and expensive. And if the library lacks relevant books, the computer can provide endless information, allowing one to finish the essay quickly. If someone is planning to visit @LOCATION4 but knows nothing about it, researching online can reveal local traditions, clothing styles, etc. Also, learning about long - gone famous people is easy with the help of the computer.  Finally, computers facilitate online communication. Suppose your grandma lives in @LOCATION3, and long - distance calls are costly. Using the computer to talk online can save money. For instance, my grandparents live in @LOCATION1. After they got a computer, we bought webcams and started chatting on @ORGANIZATION1 every day, which not only allowed us to talk but also see each other. If a friend doesn't have a phone and you need to ask about homework, you can find them on social media.  In conclusion, despite the negative effects on children, computers have more positive impacts as they help people learn about distant places and people and enable online communication.
1774	1778	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I think computers have a considerable impact on people. When people are using computers, they mainly exercise their fingers and don't get the physical exercise they need. Staring at the computer screen all the time is also harmful to one's health.  Another aspect is diet. People using computers often eat junk food in a hurry so that they can get back to the computer. They don't consume the nutritious food they should.   All these factors affect people's lives. They may not go out as much as they should, which can have a negative impact on their overall well - being. In conclusion, the over - use of computers can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and poor eating habits, which are detrimental to people's health.
1775	1779	1	2	"Dear @LOCATION1, *@CAPS1*. Now, I can enjoy my favorite @CAPS2 music with just a few clicks and typing a word. I can also watch a funny episode of ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4 #@NUM1"". On my @CAPS5 page, I feel the smooth keys under my fingers as I send @CAPS7 to my friend in @LOCATION3. These are just some of the things I can do on my computer, which shows how essential it is for me.  I wholeheartedly support the use of computers as they are a valuable resource. There are more reasons to use them. Firstly, to save money on gas, one should use @CAPS7 @CAPS8. Instead of driving long distances to meet a far - away friend or spending money on long - distance calls, one can use platforms like @CAPS5, Facebook, or Twitter. If friends in @LOCATION2 don't have these computer sites, we should encourage them to join.  Some people argue that we need to get out and exercise. However, many people don't know the correct way to exercise and may end up hurting themselves. By going online, they can find painless, cost - free, and effective workout methods, avoiding physical and financial troubles.  Regarding the idea of spending more time in nature, what if one encounters a wild animal or gets lost? In such situations, the knowledge available on @ORGANIZATION1 can be a lifesaver.  Finally, when doing formal reports, using a computer is better. In the @LOCATION4, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people have messy handwriting, and 9/@NUM3 teachers misinterpret hand - written words. A computer not only displays the written words clearly but also corrects spelling mistakes with spell - check.  In conclusion, computers offer many benefits. They can save money, time, and gas, provide useful real - world information, and correct spelling and legibility issues. We should show others the advantages of using computers and let them experience the wonders of this amazing machine, which is not just a time - waster but a life - saver."
1776	1780	1	2	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are among the best inventions of all time. They enable communication with individuals in distant locations, assist in exploring career and educational options, and offer learning opportunities across a wide range of subjects. Computers are here to benefit society, not cause harm, so there is no reason not to use them. With computers, we can communicate with people around the world or even in space. In fact, all global communications rely on satellites, which orbit the planet from space. Professor @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION1 informed students at @ORGANIZATION3 that many everyday items, such as cars and phones, utilize computer technology. Computers facilitate human communication. Additionally, they aid millions of people in making educational and career choices. Most college - bound students have limited knowledge of the numerous colleges available. When my sister was choosing a college, she was initially unsure. She sat down and researched hundreds of schools. After narrowing down her options, she selected @ORGANIZATION4, a college she had never heard of just a couple of months prior. Similar situations are common. At @ORGANIZATION2, a survey was conducted among students to determine their career aspirations. Over the following week, students got to experience different career options, and @PERCENT1 of them chose a different career path. The saying “Knowledge is power” holds true, and computers are an excellent source of knowledge. They cover various subjects, including math, science, history, and language. People should make use of this knowledge. At the @CAPS4 Francisco National Debate, @PERSON2 stated that “Computers are a great tool when used properly, whether for researching new places, studying math, or communicating. They should not be used mainly for unhealthy games.” In the @NUM1 grade, my teacher assigned a report on a country. My friend and I discovered a place we had never heard of before. Using the computer, we found a wealth of information about it, such as its main income sources, exports, resorts, and fun activities. After considering these facts, it is evident that computers are a valuable tool that should be utilized. They enable communication, support educational decision - making, and provide access to a vast amount of knowledge. I strongly advocate for everyone to use computers.
1777	1781	1	2	Mom! Did you know that the human body has only one liver? I didn't either until I found out on the computer. I've recently heard that some experts are worried that people are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising and enjoying nature. But I don't think they should be concerned. Computers keep people open - minded and teach them new things. They offer opportunities to learn, chat with distant friends, and expand one's horizons about travel. They have a huge impact on a person's knowledge. Just yesterday, I learned that the human body can't survive without its liver. The computer has also helped me with my math struggles. Even though that's what teachers are for, they're not always available, like when I'm at home or on vacation and I want to review math. It also helps people learn new languages like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4. Two days ago, I had a video chat with my grandparents in @LOCATION2. It was amazing. After six years of not seeing them, they'd really changed, and I was starting to forget what they looked like. I was surprised that a computer could do a video chat from so far away. I don't understand why experts are so worried about computers taking over people's lives. Look at what it's done for my family. If one of these experts' family members went away for a long time, they'd want to talk to them too. Some people, like those in the army, love video chatting because it allows them to see their loved ones. The computer has shown me a two - way ticket to @LOCATION3, with all its beautiful sights and delicious food. I saw a picture of a waterfall and found out it's in @LOCATION4, @LOCATION1. Now I have to go there. The computer has shown me places I've never seen before. It's a wonderful thing. So, don't worry about what we do on the computer. In conclusion, don't listen to the experts. They don't know what they're talking about. For all we know, they use the computer more than we do. Computers teach us new things, let us chat with family and friends far away, and open our eyes to new places. They're making life better, step by step.
1778	1782	1	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am of the opinion that computers are a valuable technological resource. There are several reasons to support this view. Firstly, children spend more than half of the school day in school. How can they be constantly on the computer when they are engaged in learning at school? In school, they get plenty of exercise as they are always on the move. After school, kids usually do their homework or go out with friends. Computers do not have a negative impact on people; instead, they make people smarter. Secondly, if children have access to a computer at home, parents should regulate the time they spend on it and what they do. Supporters of technological advancements are correct in stating that computers stimulate imagination and learning. Parents of children with computers should be more vigilant. If they are concerned, they can take the computer away. They should also take their kids out more often so that the children do not rely solely on the internet. Lastly, computers serve as a means of communication. If one does not have a phone, they can use a computer to access email or personal websites. Moreover, people need computers for schoolwork and their jobs. Many people also use computers for research and writing reports. We need access to information. In conclusion, my views are worthy of consideration. Many others might be too shy to voice these opinions and get them published in the local newspaper. I firmly believe that computers do not interfere with our relationships with family, friends, or nature. As a society, we rely on computers for our daily activities. Without the ability to go online or save files, we would be at a loss. I urge you to take my ideas into account. Thank you.
1779	1783	1	2	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that technological advancements can be harmful to society for several reasons. Firstly, they open the door to strangers for teens, adults, and others. The problem is that you never truly know who is on the other side of that virtual door. In chat rooms, people can mislead you into thinking they are someone they are not. For example, there is a show called Dateline. This show depicts how young teens put themselves online. Grown or young men click on their pictures, opening a chat line. You have no idea who is on the other end. These men online make the teens trust them and feel safe. They might ask, “Hey, can I come over sometime?” The young teen, thinking they are a friend, often agrees. Since they haven't seen the person's picture, when the man comes over, many have ulterior motives. This is what happens on the Dateline TV show, and one can only imagine how many other kids or teens are in similar situations without getting caught. Secondly, technology takes you away from your family and friends. Family members may feel that you love the computer more than them. Friends may invite you out, like to the mall or for a drink, but you might choose to check something online instead. Gradually, you will start to lose the people who are most important to you. My final reason is that technology takes you away from living your own life. Online, there is a lot of content that others claim is cool, but you should do what you think is cool. For instance, if someone posts that @NUM1 guys think London is amazing and you've always wanted to go to @LOCATION1, don't let others' opinions sway you. Also, spending too much time online means you don't get enough fresh air, and your skin can become pale and unhealthy. In conclusion, although some people may think that advanced technology is beneficial, it clearly has drawbacks. It exposes us to danger, separates us from friends and family, and prevents us from experiencing what life has to offer.

Kids need computers as an alternative way to communicate. Texting and phone calls cost money. If someone doesn't have texting, they can use platforms like Facebook to make plans with friends. On a rainy day when there's nothing else to do, the computer comes in handy. Computers are a great source of entertainment for kids. There are tons of games available on different websites. For example, there are MMORPGs and RPGs. They are like a virtual outside world for kids. Computers are also essential for school projects. They can be used to conduct research and find pictures. While books are useful, they don't always have all the information you need, and you can't cut pictures out of them. To get good grades on projects, kids need to use computers. In summary, computers are necessary for communication, entertainment, and school projects, so it's reasonable for adults and kids to use them.
1781	1785	1	2	I believe people should have computers at home. Computers are useful for important tasks such as job - hunting. One can also carry out work on a computer. It is a great tool for teaching children how to use technology and allowing them to search for kid - friendly content on the internet.  However, people should not spend all their time on computers. They should prioritize spending time with their families and friends. Many people use computers almost daily, which might worry their families. People can also use computers to teach their friends typing and share historical knowledge.  When having a visitor at home, one should not be overly absorbed in the computer, as it may give the wrong impression. Computers offer the opportunity to learn about distant places and gain knowledge from the internet. But not everyone agrees on unrestricted computer use, as people can get addicted. Some think it's a great idea to spend more time on computers than with family, while others believe the opposite. In conclusion, a balance should be struck between computer use and real - life social interactions.
1782	1786	1	2	Dear readers, in my opinion, excessive use of the computer has both positive and negative aspects. On one hand, computers can provide a wealth of information, offer various entertainment options, and facilitate communication. For example, we can access online courses to learn new skills, connect with friends and family around the world through social media, and work remotely. On the other hand, spending too much time on the computer can lead to health problems such as eye strain, back pain, and a sedentary lifestyle. It may also reduce face - to - face interactions and cause people to become isolated.  In conclusion, while computers are an important part of modern life, we should use them in moderation to enjoy their benefits without suffering from their drawbacks.
1783	1787	1	2	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly hold the view that computers are beneficial for society. Without computers, numerous tasks would be impossible to accomplish. They often provide the easiest solution, which is why I am fond of them. Computers make almost anything achievable.  For instance, an elderly person with limited mobility can manage their bills, search for a job, or shop online using a computer. Even those who are just feeling lazy can lie in bed all day, work remotely, or order items from the mall. All they need to focus on is personal hygiene. Moreover, computers can relieve a great deal of stress. There are no annoying co - workers or angry bosses; everything can be just fine.  However, it is crucial to choose a good computer. An old one may break down, which is one of the drawbacks of computers. Although they can be a bit troublesome at times, once you get the hang of them, they are extremely useful. In conclusion, despite the minor issues, computers are highly beneficial, and one can do almost anything with them.
