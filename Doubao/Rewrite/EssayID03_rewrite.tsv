1	5978	3	2	The cyclist was significantly affected by the features of the setting. The lack of information about the route and the scarcity of water posed major problems. Since he required water for the journey and directions to know where to go, these deficiencies had a detrimental impact on his cycling experience. In conclusion, the unfavorable features of the setting hindered the cyclist's progress.
2	5979	3	2	The cyclist was negatively impacted by the setting. In June, he was traveling through the high deserts of California, a dry and hot environment. As described, the temperature was extremely high, with “brackish water falling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”. The sun beat down relentlessly, and there was no escape from its heat. The cyclist was alone on the road, and until he passed out, there was no one to assist him. About forty miles into the ride, he reached what was supposed to be a “town”, but it was a ghost - town. In the end, the poor settings led to his dehydration and fatigue, clearly showing their negative influence on him.
3	5980	3	2	Everyone ventures into unfamiliar places. Sometimes, when we get lost, asking locals for directions might not be a wise move. The cyclist had a good map but chose to ask some older men who seemed to have been out of touch for ages. These old men gave him the wrong directions. My advice is that if you have a reliable map, don't listen to anyone, regardless of their age. Also, always be aware of your destination. In conclusion, relying on a good map and self - awareness is crucial when traveling.
4	5981	3	2	I think the cyclist's traits affected him. He was impatient and overly trusting. He took the old men's advice to take a shortcut to save an hour. If he had stuck to the map, he wouldn't have almost suffered from heatstroke. His impatience got the better of him. After this experience, he learned to follow the map and not trust those who haven't witnessed the area's changes in recent years. In conclusion, the cyclist's initial behavior led to trouble, but he gained valuable lessons from it.
5	5982	3	2	The setting has a significant impact on the cyclist. If the setting were different, the story would lose its coherence. The story is set in a hot and dry area with scattered ghost towns. When the cyclist reaches the first “town”, he sees “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold the lamesh mule”. The lack of water in this setting creates the main conflict. As the speaker says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California” which are hot and dry. If the setting were a forest on @DATE1, the need for water would be less pressing, and the story would be far less exciting. In conclusion, the unique setting is essential for the story's conflict and appeal.
6	5983	3	2	The setting presented multiple features that influenced the cyclist. The weather was extremely hot and dry, and the area was nearly deserted, with almost all the places the cyclist passed through being empty. Other features of the setting included a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that could not contain the lamest of movements. These features give an indication of how the cyclist might be feeling. The harsh and desolate setting likely made the cyclist's journey arduous and isolating.
7	5984	3	2	While riding through a town, the cyclist stopped to ask for directions. A group of old men advised him to take a shortcut, and he followed their advice. Unfortunately, he got lost and ended up in a ghost - town in the desert. Deserts are known for their high temperatures, and this particular desert was no exception. The heat in the desert can pose significant challenges to anyone traveling through it, as was the case for this cyclist.
8	5985	3	2	I believe that if the situation regarding the cyclist doesn't change, it could hurt a lot of people's feelings because there are those who simply don't care about the cyclist. I am one of them. It doesn't affect me or anyone I know, so I don't really care. However, it's a big deal for some people. Some of them even take extreme actions like blowing things up. They talk about it on TV and radio, but a lot of what they say seems made - up. I'm a skeptic; I won't believe it until I see it. I also think this situation doesn't really pertain to black people as it hasn't had any impact on us. In conclusion, we truly don't care about the effects related to the cyclist.
9	5986	3	2	The essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” depicts a man's bicycle ride across California. The cyclist undertakes this journey during summer, when California experiences extremely high temperatures. This setting significantly impacts the man's journey, making it extremely challenging for him to complete his ride. At the start of his ride, he consumed most of his water, leading to severe dehydration. As the text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Evidently, the hot and arid setting made the man's bike - ride an uphill battle.
10	5987	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” it is shown how certain environmental conditions can impact a cyclist. The cyclist was biking through the desert to reach Yosemite National Park, but faced numerous difficult conditions during the journey. Firstly, the intense heat of the desert made travel extremely tough. As the text mentions, “the sun was beginning to beat down.” The sun drains a person's energy, making any task, including cycling, difficult. Secondly, the long - distance nature of the trip made it hard for the cyclist to conserve water. The man drank so much water that he almost ran out; “The water bottle contained only...” This led to dehydration, which can be life - threatening. Overall, Kurmaskie's story effectively demonstrates how the specific conditions of an environment can have a significant impact on a cyclist.
11	5988	3	2	"The author's ""shortcut"" setting significantly impacted his performance and strength. Whether it was the hills, the heat, or the barren landscape, all three factors took a toll on Joe Kurmaskie. Moreover, his lack of water further depleted his energy. The flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, which were difficult to traverse as Joe's energy was being drained. However, he overcame this exhaustion when a building came into view. ""I wiped the sweat from my eyes to ensure it wasn't a mirage and tried not to get overly excited, using what I believed to be my last burst of energy. I maneuvered down the hill."" Despite the difficulties, the author overcame all the problems he faced. It seems he wrote this piece to emphasize the importance of perseverance when one wants to give up. As Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" I believe the author would agree."
12	5989	3	2	The setting has a significant impact on the cyclist. When the cyclist is riding through the hot desert, he requires a large amount of cold water to stay hydrated. The longer he rides under the hot sun, the more he sweats, increasing the risk of dehydration. On the other hand, if he were riding in rain or snow, it could slow him down as he would feel cold, and his muscles might become stiff, reducing his speed. In conclusion, the setting plays a crucial role in affecting the cyclist's performance.
13	5990	3	2	"Several features, such as heat and lack of water, affected the cyclist. Throughout the story, the cyclist consumed a substantial amount of water, but by the end, only a small quantity remained. The statement ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" indicates that the cyclist was not adequately prepared with water for the trip to Yosemite. Without water, the cyclist would face the risk of dying from the heat. The description ""Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke"" shows that the cyclist was aware of the danger of insufficient water in his system. Both water and heat had a significant impact on the cyclist throughout the story. Insufficient water led to excessive sweating, and the heat exacerbated this, potentially resulting in extreme heatstroke."
14	5991	3	2	The features of the setting had a profound impact on the cyclist. At first, when the cyclist encountered a road with a large snake in the middle, it made him cautious and uneasy. Additionally, the desolate desert environment, with nothing around, gave the cyclist a sense of abandonment and the fear of having no help in case of trouble. Finally, the cyclist felt a great sense of relief upon seeing the bait - store and the presence of people. In conclusion, the features of the setting had a significant influence on the cyclist during his ride.
15	5992	3	2	"In ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist, subjecting him to numerous hardships that could potentially have been avoided. The old cottagers advised the cyclist about a path they thought was correct, but it was difficult and did not lead him to the right destination. The setting is described as a transition from a flat road to short rolling hills. Overall, the setting features had a detrimental impact on the cyclist's journey."
16	5993	3	2	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” author Joe Kurmaskie employs the features of the setting to influence the cyclist. The cyclist is affected because for several miles, the cyclist sees the same desert setting, has no water, and the road is full of hills. Seeing the desert with no scenery changes for a while can impact the cyclist. Staring at the same scene for hours can lead to tiredness and boredom, causing the cyclist to feel drowsy and uninterested. Moreover, the cyclist had no water as none of the fountains provided cold water. Being in the desert without water can cause dehydration and fainting. In conclusion, the setting's features significantly affect the cyclist's state and well - being.
17	5994	3	2	Various characteristics of a setting can determine the outcome of an event that takes place there. In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist's journey was influenced by several weather - related factors. The extreme heat slowed the cyclist down and, in most cases, prevented the cyclist from reaching the maximum level of ability. Additionally, the time when the journey occurs greatly impacts the cyclist. Lastly, the type of road and the amount of ground the cyclist has to cover also affect the performance. Overall, the setting can be a decisive factor in a journey, just as it is in life.
18	5995	3	2	The setting of the story has multiple effects on the cyclist. As the cyclist is riding in the California desert, the cyclist constantly feels extremely hot and is perpetually thirsty. The area the cyclist is traversing appears desolate, with only old abandoned buildings in sight. There are no people, cars, or any signs of modern civilization. This makes the cyclist feel a bit uneasy, as in case of an incident, no one would be aware. This feeling is especially prominent when the cyclist becomes dehydrated. In these ways, the setting has a profound impact on the cyclist.
19	5996	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by @PERSON1, the features of the setting influence the cyclist in numerous ways. One such way is that in the desert, the cyclist drinks more water than usual. For instance, the text states, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. You will drink more water in a desert than in a forest.” Cyclists should be aware of their surroundings because the setting can have an impact on them. In conclusion, the setting plays a crucial role in how a cyclist experiences a journey.
20	5997	3	2	Certain features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, the cyclist followed the old codgers' advice on how to reach Yosemite National Park, but the advice proved useless in the end. Next, what the cyclist thought would be water turned out to have “a tarlike substance oozing out.” Then, the terrain changed to “short, rolling hills,” which did not improve the cyclist's biking experience. Lastly, “tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” slowed the cyclist down. All these obstacles in the setting had an impact on the cyclist. In conclusion, the various elements of the setting combined to impede the cyclist's progress.
21	5998	3	2	The features of the setting that impact the cyclist include a lack of water, outdated information, and rolling hills. Had the cyclist possessed up - to - date information, he likely would have obtained water from a town that was not empty or nearly so, like the “ghost town” he described.
22	5999	3	2	When the cyclist is racing and there's wind blowing, it becomes a problem. Additionally, he is required to abide by traffic laws and ride on the right side of the road. This combination of factors presents challenges for the cyclist during his race.
23	6000	3	2	The sign “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was in a rough setting filled with hazardous elements and extreme heat. The cyclist journeyed through a desert where the temperature was @NUM1. He endured dehydration and showed great determination. Bad directions almost cost him his life. As he passed through ghost towns, he had to ration his water. He employed nature skills, sucking on pebbles to distract from thirst and moisten his throat with saliva. Throughout his adventure, numerous obstacles hindered his access to water. Having survived, he resolved never to take shortcuts again.
24	6001	3	2	An instance of the setting affecting the cyclist occurred when he faced a water shortage in a ghost town in just eliterat. He found water, but a tar - like substance came out, and it tasted like battery acid. After leaving, he had to traverse a rough road. Due to the poor condition of the road, he couldn't travel at a fast pace.
25	6002	3	2	The cyclist encountered significant difficulties while trying to reach Yosemite National Park. It was the middle of June, and the sun was shining brightly. The intense heat caused the cyclist to become dehydrated more rapidly than on a cooler day. When he pumped the handle of the old, rusted water pump, he described the water as “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” Moreover, he had to deal with many “short rolling hills,” which were much more arduous to cycle on compared to flat roads. On top of all this, the roads were in very poor condition, forcing him to watch out for rocks. These factors combined to make his journey extremely tough.
26	6003	3	2	"At the beginning of the story, the cyclist confidently accepts the old men's help and shows no suspicion when setting off. The directions given by the men seem reliable as his water supply is intact, and the first landmark, now a ghost - town, is precisely where it should be. However, when he reaches the next ""town"", there is nothing to replenish his dwindling water supply, and he starts to feel uneasy. Since he was told the next town was nearby, he presses on. Subsequently, the scenery changes drastically. The flat roads turn into hills, the sun beats down more intensely, and tumbleweeds pass by, making it look like a desert. Despite severe dehydration, the cyclist continues. An old juice building appears, seemingly highlighting his lack of water. Eventually, he spots a shop where he can get water. The changing scenery gradually shifts the cyclist's state from confidence to worry, then to hopelessness, and finally to relief."
27	6004	3	2	I believe the weather plays a crucial role. Unfavorable weather can make a person feel tired, upset, and prone to anger. These negative emotions accumulate and lead to stress. In conclusion, weather conditions can have a significant impact on a person's emotional and mental state, causing stress and discomfort.
28	6005	3	2	"The features of the setting impact the cyclist in two ways: physically and mentally. Physically, the terrain is a major factor. Long and winding roads can exhaust the cyclist. A steep hill incline can also make the cyclist physically fatigued as they struggle against gravity. Temperature is another critical factor in a cyclist's physical ability. No one wants to feel as if they are in a sauna while cycling. Mentally, the cyclist can be affected as well. If the terrain looks like a desert or deserted area, the cyclist instinctively thinks of ""dehydration"" and ""death"". The sight of dead animals or bones can also make them fear for their lives. Vultures circling overhead can cause fear and thoughts of death. The worst situation is when all these negative elements are present simultaneously. In summary, the setting can have a profound impact on a cyclist's physical and mental state."
29	6006	3	2	The setting of the story was extremely grueling. As the cyclist rode along, the sun began to beat down on him. The intense heat made him sweat profusely, and he drank almost all of his water. Consequently, he suffered from severe heat, excessive sweating, and dehydration. The California desert is a harsh place, especially in June. Fortunately, the cyclist came across a camp where he found fresh food and water. After replenishing his supplies, he continued his journey to Yosemite National Park.
30	6007	3	2	While traveling to Yosemite National Park, the cyclist encounters various features in the area that affect him. First, he takes directions from some old men who are unaware of the map changes as they rarely leave their porch. Initially, this has a positive impact as he believes he has found a good shortcut to Yosemite. However, it turns out to be a non - existent shortcut, and the impact becomes negative. Another influential feature is the desert - like setting. The heat makes cycling more difficult and causes him to drink a large amount of water, leading to dehydration. On a positive note, he finds a bait shop where he rehydrates and gets new directions. Overall, the features in the area have both positive and negative impacts on the cyclist's journey.
31	6008	3	2	The characteristics of the setting exert numerous influences on the cyclist. As the setting is a desert, it is well - known that the environment is hot and dry. Due to the high temperature, the cyclist requires more water as he is becoming dehydrated. The dryness also causes his mouth to dry up when his water supply is low. Moreover, being in the desert, the cyclist encounters wild and sometimes dangerous animals. In the story, he spots a diamondback snake, which is likely venomous. The extreme desert heat makes the cyclist realize that he has a high risk of suffering from heatstroke. Additionally, the short rolling hills and rough road in the desert will exhaust the cyclist. These terrain features have a significant impact on the cyclist.
32	6010	3	2	The features of the setting impact the cyclist in multiple ways. The intense heat of the sun beating down on him makes him extremely thirsty. The rough road takes a toll on the cyclist, wearing him out and making him fatigued. The old juice factory with a picture of a refreshing cup of juice on it makes the cyclist feel like giving up, as he fears dying of dehydration. In conclusion, these aspects of the setting clearly demonstrate how they can affect the cyclist in diverse manners.
33	6011	3	2	In the essay, the author writes about the rough roads that the cyclist has had to overcome to reach the goal. These challenging roads pose significant obstacles for the cyclist, and their presence in the story emphasizes the difficulties the cyclist must face on his journey. Overall, the description of these rough roads is an important part of how the story portrays the cyclist's struggle.
34	6012	3	2	Understanding, realism, and mood are all factors through which the setting affects a story. A well - crafted setting can greatly enhance a book. When a story has a proper setting, it becomes easier for readers to understand what the author is trying to convey. A good setting also adds a sense of realism, preventing readers from being confused or disoriented. The mood of the story sets the overall tone, as most books have their highs and lows. Authors often strive to create an appropriate mood through the setting. In conclusion, these elements related to the setting are crucial for the overall quality and impact of a story.
35	6013	3	2	The setting of the story has an impact on the cyclist by causing dehydration, which can potentially lead to heatstroke. The statement “I could drop from a heatstroke” indicates that the outside temperature was high and the cyclist was in a poor physical state. This shows that the hot setting of the story has a detrimental effect on the cyclist's well - being, highlighting how the setting can directly influence the characters in a story.
36	6014	3	2	The terrain significantly impacts the cyclist during his journey. Initially, he encounters a rather flat and gentle landscape. As the author notes, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face,” indicating that he was full of energy and in high spirits. However, considering that the cyclist is in a desert during the summer, where the heat is intense, it is foreseeable that the journey will not remain so pleasant. Subsequently, he faces hilly terrain, which, combined with his depleted water supply, drains him of all his energy. The cyclist remarks, “sometimes life can feel so cruel,” highlighting the shift from his initial enthusiasm to exhaustion and despair. This change in mood due to the terrain is analogous to real - life situations, where one must persevere through obstacles. The cyclist ultimately manages to overcome these challenges, demonstrating the importance of resilience.
37	6015	3	2	The setting features in the story have a substantial impact on the cyclist. One prominent factor is the heat. At the start, the pine trees offer some relief, cooling the cyclist. But as the forest gives way to a desert, the intense heat bears down on him, making cycling arduous. Another crucial aspect is the lack of water. As the cyclist moves away from his starting point, he consumes a significant amount of water. When it comes time to refill, the available water is brown and hot, so he refuses to drink it. The combination of the heat and the shortage of water creates a formidable obstacle that could potentially have been fatal. Nevertheless, through sheer determination, the cyclist endures this difficult period, showing that with willpower, one can overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges.
38	6016	3	2	The narrator in this story embarks on a challenging journey filled with hope, challenges, physical pain, despair, and relief. The settings in which these experiences occur play a crucial role in developing these emotions. After receiving advice from old men at a campsite, he sets off through the deserts of California. Had he been in a different location, his journey might have been far more favorable. He could have obtained more reliable advice or been in an area where towns were more accessible. Additionally, when he encounters a snake on the road, it could symbolize a decision - either the choice he is about to make and its impact on the trip's outcome or the decisions he has already made, such as taking advice from strangers and whether to act on it. The irony deepens as he becomes dehydrated and the flat terrain turns hilly. If these circumstances had not occurred, his journey could have been more successful and he could have remained healthier. The settings are essential for the story's plot and its inherent humor. For instance, if the narrator were in a city, he would not get lost and stranded, and thus, there would be no story to tell.
39	6017	3	2	The setting in the story undergoes multiple changes. It begins in an area characterized by rivers and pine trees. The cyclist then reaches a town. Subsequently, he is exposed to the blistering sun and has to navigate a hilly road. With his water supply nearly exhausted, the cyclist musters all his remaining energy to reach a town where he can get something to drink. It is evident that the ever - changing setting is what makes the cyclist's journey a difficult one. The diverse landscapes and environmental conditions present numerous challenges, highlighting the influence of the setting on the cyclist's experience.
40	6018	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit,” the setting features have a notable impact. It is morning, and everyone is still asleep. The protagonist wakes up with nothing to do and heads out. When he arrives at the first place, he perceives the people there as old and crazy. He also notices that the houses are in a state of disrepair, suggesting that the place needs fixing. After leaving, he encounters a vast expanse of hills. In conclusion, I find the extensive riding that the protagonist undertakes to be something I would never do. The combination of the unappealing place and the strenuous riding makes the experience unappealing to me.
41	6019	3	2	The cyclist is significantly affected by the setting. He is in the desert without water and has no clear sense of direction. Some old men on a porch provided him with incorrect directions, causing him to become lost in the desert. Despite these difficulties, the cyclist finds the determination to keep moving forward. Along the way, he encounters another old man who offers to give him directions, but the cyclist claims to have a map. In the end, the cyclist's willpower allows him to persevere through the challenging desert setting.
42	6020	3	2	"The setting in the story had a highly discouraging impact on the biker. After following the advice of the elderly men and starting his journey, he observed that there was ""no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" He used descriptive words to convey the harshness of the situation, stating that ""The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips."" He exhaustively described how difficult his journey was becoming. He depicted the intense heat in the California desert as he pedaled up ""one long, crippling hill."" The terrain made his ride extremely arduous. The factors of weather, rolling hills, and water shortage took a toll on him. Had he been on flat terrain on a cool day, he would have been fine. In conclusion, the adverse setting significantly hindered the biker's journey."
43	6021	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. The scorching sun beating down on him makes him sweat profusely and extremely thirsty. The bumpy roads and hills force him to exert more effort. The desolate and abandoned places make him lose hope. If I were in the cyclist's shoes, facing these same obstacles, I believe I would be affected in the same way, as any human would. In summary, the setting's features pose significant challenges to the cyclist.
44	6022	3	2	"The features of the setting, or nature, have an impact on the cyclist as they are wearing her out. The cyclist is on her way to the city of Yosemite. Some guys suggested a shortcut to her. Along this shortcut, there are hills, intense heat, and a lack of water. @CAPS1 described the situation by saying, ""I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get too excited."" @CAPS1 was excited about a building from which she might obtain some water. Also, the act of wiping sweat from her eyes indicates that it was hot outside, and she was sweating and losing water. In conclusion, the features of the setting clearly affect the cyclist."
45	6023	3	2	"The three most crucial features of the setting that influence the cyclist are the ground he travels on, the towns he passes through, and the availability of water. The condition of the ground is important because the rougher the terrain and the more hills there are, the more energy he has to expend and the less distance he can cover. @PERSON1 was riding smoothly until he had to tackle the rolling hills, which depleted his energy, exhausted his water supply, and eroded his hope. As he neared towns, his hope would rise, but it would quickly fade when he realized that the towns could not offer him relief. When he pumped out water that tasted like ""battery acid,"" his hope diminished once again. However, when he saw the bait and tackle shop, he knew he could reach it and recover there. In conclusion, these three features have the greatest impact on the cyclist."
46	6024	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,” the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist. During the summer, in the middle of the desert, the cyclist faced a shortage of water. The old men provided incorrect directions, seemingly expecting the cyclist to perish. Although the cyclist survived, the heat and the season in which he was cycling likely taught him a lesson, and he will probably carry an additional water bottle on his next journey.
47	6025	3	2	Several features of the setting affected the cyclist. The road was in poor condition, full of bumps, which made cycling much more difficult and consumed a great deal of the cyclist's strength. Additionally, after cycling in an area with extremely high temperatures, the cyclist encountered a road with numerous hills. These challenging aspects of the setting clearly made the cyclist's journey arduous.
48	6026	3	2	In the story, various settings influenced the author in diverse ways. At the start of his journey, he encountered a ghost town. He responded to the characteristics of this setting with humor and hope, stating, “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on,” still hopeful of reaching a safe and correct destination. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the road. When he saw that no nearby town was in sight, he grew worried, noting, “This sight was troubling.” As he came across the features of the subsequent setting, including tumbleweeds and a large snake, he became desperate and devastated. On rough desert terrain with little water, his hope vanished when he reached the abandoned @CAPS1’s factory, and he even contemplated death, thinking, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” However, when he reached the fish camp, he was relieved, saying, “I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them and buy some bait.” His survival filled him with joy and a sense of relief.
49	6027	3	2	Ghost towns are hardly appealing to a cyclist running low on water. In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” the cyclist is affected by his surroundings in multiple ways. Beginning his journey on a warm, sunny day, he starts in high spirits with a fresh mood and happy expressions. But as he progresses, he laments, “The sun was beginning to beat down,” regretting following the old men's “shortcut.” Along the way, he reaches his first disappointment, a ghost town with “one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn't hold the lamest male.” When he tries to pump water from the corral, he gets a “battery - acid” flavor and is left with little to drink, which sours his mood, making him pity himself and angry at the men who put him in this situation. Eventually, he is relieved when he arrives at GARY & @CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He expresses his gratitude, saying, “I had an overwhelming urge to seek out @ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait,” seeing them as the light at the end of his long, exhausting journey.
50	6028	3	2	The features of the setting had a notable impact on the cyclist. Reaching the first town was a difficult task for the author, as described in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The road the author was cycling on was rough; for instance, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” and the entire road was hilly and uneven. Moreover, the cyclist's water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips, indicating a shortage of water. These factors combined to make the cyclist's journey extremely challenging.
51	6029	3	2	The setting significantly impacts the cyclist. One prominent factor is the heat. Given the intense heat, the cyclist is likely suffering from dehydration as he has probably consumed all his water. Being alone in the middle of what seems like miles of nowhere, he is likely sweltering. Another aspect of the setting that may affect him is the uncertainty of what lies around the next turn. If he cannot see ahead, he has no idea if a car is approaching. Additionally, the cyclist may be contemplating when the next town will appear. Overall, the various features of the setting have a substantial influence on the cyclist's experience.
52	6030	3	2	The setting places a substantial amount of stress on the cyclist. The primary challenge he confronts is the weather. In June, he is cycling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1. After riding his bike all day, he is on the verge of running out of water. When he attempted to drink more, he had to consume water that felt as hot as around two hundred degrees. The hot and humid weather did not facilitate his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected him was the terrain. The transition from flat roads to short, rolling hills presented a major problem. These terrain changes exacerbated the issue caused by the uncooperative weather. The hills forced the cyclist to exert more effort and expend more energy. Fortunately, the terrain also had a positive impact. The stones on the ground helped him divert his attention from his thirst. In conclusion, multiple factors of the setting had both negative and positive effects on the cyclist during his adventure.
53	6031	3	2	In the narration of “Rough Road Ahead,” a solo cyclist faces numerous challenges. As he makes his way from the area of the old men to Yosemite National Park, changes in his environment directly influence his journey and health. His first encounter with the environment makes him acutely aware of his need for water. The text mentions that he had been consuming water regularly while in the high deserts of California in June. However, the water supply at the truck - stop pumps was insufficient for his consumption, forcing him to search elsewhere. Subsequently, he encountered rolling hills. Exercising more energy to navigate them, he still remained in need of water. His speed diminished as thoughts of his severe dehydration distracted him. As the heat relentlessly beat down on him, he faced further challenges on his way to a bait shop. The change in his environment challenged his health and created an obstacle that nearly made him abandon his goal. In summary, the environmental changes presented significant hurdles for the cyclist.
54	6032	3	2	The setting had a profound impact on the cyclist. Firstly, the heat was a major issue. It became so hot that the cyclist started to become dehydrated. He continuously drank his water until he had none left. Secondly, the road turning into hills forced him to use more energy. Lastly, the fact that he had seen no sign of living creatures, except for a snake @CAPS1, added to his difficult situation. In conclusion, the various elements of the setting combined to make the cyclist's journey extremely challenging.
55	6033	3	2	The setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” has a notable effect on the main character, the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through the high desert of California in June. Naturally, it is hot and dry, making water a scarce resource. As he passes through a ghost town and a pump that releases “a tarlike substance followed by brackish water,” he is running out of his precious water supply. The surrounding landscape, consisting of lonely hills, tumbleweeds, and snakes, does not instill confidence. The cyclist even feels that he could “drop from heat - stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” Discovering an old, out - of - service Grape Juice Factory only increases his anxiety and despair. The author relates a similar experience of walking in a state park on @DATE1, where the desolate snow - covered landscape made them feel they would never be warm again, just as the cyclist feels he could die of dehydration due to his environment. In conclusion, the setting of this short story clearly has a significant impact on the cyclist.
56	6034	3	2	The conditions that influenced the cyclist were, in fact, ones that one would prefer to avoid when out of water and fatigued from cycling. The time and location had a significant impact on him. In June in California, there was no cool breeze. He found himself in the middle of flat deserts, with no idea of where he was or where he could find civilization to obtain water. The quote “old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” indicates that taking directions from elderly individuals who rarely venture out is a poor decision. The statement “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills” reveals some of the terrain features that affected the cyclist. Eventually, the cyclist was fortunate enough to discover civilization with running water, which resolved his immediate problem. In conclusion, the challenging settings presented numerous difficulties for the cyclist, but he managed to overcome them by reaching a place with water.
57	6035	3	2	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” author Joe Kurmaskie conveys that one must endure many obstacles before reaching their destination. For instance, when the protagonist stops to ask for directions to Yosemite State Park, he risks getting lost. He also has to pass through other towns. Another example is when he encounters a rock on the road and has to obtain water from an old, rusted pump as his water bottle is nearly empty. These experiences illustrate the various challenges one may face during a journey. In conclusion, Kurmaskie's story emphasizes that reaching a goal often involves navigating through unforeseen difficulties.
58	6036	3	2	In my opinion, the features of the setting had a profound impact on the cyclist. The terrain, as described by the quote “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” indicates that the cyclist was troubled by the change. He also felt a sense of isolation, as evidenced by the line “I toiled on at some point tumbleweed crossed my path,” and thought he was in a ghost town. The intense summer heat affected him greatly; the quote “Summer time rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain” shows that he felt he was slowly dying and losing his sanity. The sun was so strong that he wiped his face to ensure he wasn't seeing a mirage. However, despite these hardships, he maintained hope. The author aims to inspire readers to have hope, keep moving forward, stay positive, and make the most of their surroundings even when the situation seems bleak. In conclusion, the author uses the cyclist's experiences to convey an important message of perseverance and optimism.
59	6037	3	2	Heat, dryness, and flatness are the key features of the setting that affected the cyclist. As the cyclist rode through the desert, he was acutely aware of the intense heat and the rapid rate at which he was becoming dehydrated. The dry environment made him increasingly nervous about his thirst. The flat ground signified that there was nothing nearby to assist the cyclist, which filled him with fear. The story also mentions that he entered a ghost town. These elements combined to create a challenging and intimidating situation for the cyclist. In conclusion, the harsh desert setting presented significant obstacles for the cyclist, testing his endurance and resourcefulness.
60	6038	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways, starting with the author's tone at the beginning of the story. When looking at the picture, the cyclist seems to be in a state of distress. As the story progresses, it becomes evident that he is not enjoying his ride. The noise on the bumpy roads, the sparks, and his lack of counter - thirst measures contribute to his discomfort. He should not rely on advice from “old timers” who may not be well - informed. Taking advice from them could lead to a dead - end situation, especially in a place like California where distances are vast and getting lost could result in dehydration. In conclusion, the setting and the associated factors pose multiple challenges to the cyclist, and he needs to be cautious in his decision - making to avoid getting into trouble.
61	6039	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's story ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"", numerous factors in the setting affected the cyclist. The water was a significant issue. Due to his location, he had no suitable water to drink. As he described, ""When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid."" The presence of what seemed like battery acid in the water meant that drinking it could have made him severely ill, so he was unable to consume it. Additionally, the unstable roads he had to cycle on presented challenges. A sign warned, ""Rough roads ahead."" Riding on unstable ground is extremely difficult. Clearly, these two aspects of the setting, the poor - quality water and the rough roads, had a definite impact on the cyclist."
62	6040	3	2	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead Do Not exceed posted speed"", several features of the setting affect the cyclist. At the start of the journey, the cyclist passes by a river, which he won't encounter later. As the journey progresses, the heat and the lack of water begin to take a toll on him. He then comes across a water fountain. The water it dispenses is hot and has an unpleasant flavor, indicating that it has been shut down for a long time. In conclusion, multiple features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist."
63	6041	3	2	"The setting significantly affects the cyclist. The roads are extremely rough. If he rides too fast, he risks losing control and getting into an accident. Moreover, the water is a problem. As he said, ""When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid."" The poor - quality water and the rough roads are two key aspects of the setting that make the cyclist's journey difficult."
64	6042	3	2	At the beginning of his cycling journey, the cyclist is full of confidence and eager to reach the joys of @LOCATION1. He yearns for “the cool pines and rushing rivers…” (@NUM1). However, the cyclist's biggest challenge is his lack of water. As he reaches the rough terrain, his water supply depletes, and exhaustion sets in. After a long climb over a hill, he experiences a brief moment of relief, but then he sees a shut - down juice factory, which seems like a cruel tease. Finally, when he reaches his destination, he feels relief and pride, knowing that he has survived this strenuous journey despite the water shortage.
65	6043	3	2	The setting had a profound impact on the cyclist. Snakes blocked his path, and his limited water supply made it arduous for him to continue. He felt on the verge of suffering a heatstroke. The environment around him and the information he received from an old man further compounded his difficulties, making it very hard for him to keep riding. In summary, the setting played a major role in influencing the cyclist's experience during his journey.
66	6044	3	2	The cyclist was significantly affected by the setting due to the poor road conditions. The road was in a state of disrepair, which hampered the cyclist's progress. This shows how the setting can have a direct impact on a cyclist's experience.
67	6045	3	2	The cyclist had prepared well for his adventure, but a change in the scenario was in store. In June, while cycling, some old men advised him to take a difficult path. After following their advice, his entire situation took a turn for the worse. He faced steep and seemingly endless hills, and dehydration gradually set in as he hadn't packed enough water or supplies for such a change. The hot and merciless sun made the situation even more challenging. This is how the change in setting affected the cyclist.
68	6046	3	2	Setting can impact anyone, and in this instance, it was a cyclist. In June, the outside temperature was quite high. Due to the cyclist's continuous movement and sweating, he lost a significant amount of body fluid, making water essential. As he cycled, he encountered a sign warning of a rough road ahead with a speed limit. Riding a bike on such a difficult road was no easy task. Additionally, a snake, which the cyclist thought was a diamondback, blocked the road. These factors demonstrate how the setting affected the cyclist.
69	6047	3	2	The features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist depending on the conditions. For example, weather plays a crucial role. When it is hot, it slows the cyclist down, while perfect weather allows for a regular speed. Road conditions also matter. A bumpy road slows the cyclist, whereas a smooth road enables a faster pace. Clearly, the cyclist's progress depends on these setting - related conditions.
70	6048	3	2	The setting has a substantial impact on the cyclist. In the middle of June, the cyclist finds himself in a California desert. The extreme heat makes him extremely tired. Although there are some cool pines, they offer little relief. Moreover, there is no access to water for a long stretch. As the narration states, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Dehydration due to lack of water impairs the cyclist's biking skills, such as balance and leg strength. Throughout most of the journey, there is no one around. The cyclist is unaware of the distance to @CAPS1 or water and has no one to assist him in case of a heat - stroke. This clearly shows the profound effect of the setting on the cyclist.
71	6049	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the setting's features had an impact on the cyclist. The cyclist journeyed many miles on a bike, contending with the desert weather, limited water supply, and fatigue. Traveling from one point to another on a bicycle was fraught with difficulties for the cyclist. The challenging setting made the cyclist's journey arduous and filled with obstacles.
72	6050	3	2	The setting of this story significantly influences the cyclist's attitude and the difficulties they face. The cyclist's route passes through the dry and hot deserts of California, presenting the major conflict of the story: the risk of the cyclist suffering from heatstroke. As the author states in the reading, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.” In a cooler climate, the author likely wouldn't have needed to drink as frequently and wouldn't have faced dehydration. A different climate would have made the trip less dangerous for the cyclist. Another aspect of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. The reading mentions, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The rough road took a toll on the author's body and mind. While riding, the author thinks, “I was doing a water - depleting 12 mph,” indicating that their attitude became less optimistic, and they were constantly preoccupied with their thirst. Dwelling on thirst only made them thirstier. The small change in terrain had a substantial impact on the author's journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation. The cyclist doesn't encounter another human until the end of the story. Up to that point, they were alone, having to deal with thirst and fatigue independently. In a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have received help, making the ordeal much easier. The fact that no one was going to help played a significant role in the author's mental state. In conclusion, the story's conflict is established by the setting. If the setting weren't hot, rough, and isolated, the cyclist's journey would have been easy, and the story wouldn't have been as exciting or interesting. In my opinion, a different setting would have ruined the story.
73	6051	3	2	The features of the setting impact the cyclist in multiple ways. As the cyclist traversed the desert, they encountered a desolate scene. “I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the largest mule greeted me. This side was troubling.” When attempting to use the rusty water pump, a far - like substance oozed out, and the water seemed to be at a very high temperature. “Not two miles into this next section of ride, I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This change made it more difficult for the cyclist to ride the bike, leading to increased fatigue. As the cyclist continued, they grew more tired, and their water supply dwindled. It was a struggle to maintain balance while riding. The harsh desert setting and the changing terrain presented numerous challenges to the cyclist's journey.
74	6052	3	2	The setting of the place has a significant impact on the cyclist. Firstly, the dryness is a major issue. A cyclist shouldn't be in a dry place as they are at risk of heatstroke. In the story, it says, “I was travelling through the high parts of California in June,” indicating that it was extremely hot and dry. Secondly, the presence of dangerous animals is a concern. A cyclist shouldn't be riding in an area with diamond - back snakes. The text states, “I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path; it really did look like a diamond back,” which, if it were a real snake, would be extremely dangerous. Cyclists should avoid such hazardous places regardless of the type of danger. In conclusion, the setting's surroundings affect the cyclist negatively, making it an unsuitable place for them to ride.
75	6053	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in two main ways. Firstly, the ground frequently changes terrain, making it difficult to maintain a consistent speed throughout the ride. Secondly, the lack of water makes it hard for the cyclist to focus. In my view, the features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist, and people often think these challenges are worse than they actually are. Overall, the setting's features create difficulties for the cyclist, but the perception of these difficulties can sometimes be exaggerated.
76	6054	3	2	The setting has a significant impact on the cyclist in multiple ways. The hot and humid weather makes the cyclist sweat as the body attempts to maintain a cool temperature. This sweating process expends energy. Moreover, the lack of water exacerbates the situation. With the cyclist losing energy through sweating and having no water to replenish the body, it becomes extremely difficult for the cyclist to continue. In conclusion, the combination of hot - humid weather and water scarcity in the setting severely hampers the cyclist's ability to keep going.
77	6055	3	2	In the story, a cyclist is traversing a desert in California. The limited water supply can be attributed to this arid setting. The high temperature makes the cyclist consume more water. The cyclist began the journey in the morning to avoid the peak heat of mid - day. However, as time passed, the sun became stronger, bringing more heat. The cyclist's statement, “The sun was beginning to beat down,” helps readers understand the time of day and the intensity of the heat. In the morning, the cyclist didn't fully grasp the situation, but as afternoon arrived, dehydration set in. In conclusion, the extreme heat and limited water in this desert setting gradually took a toll on the cyclist as the day progressed.
78	6056	3	2	The features and settings had a significant and negative effect on the author. Firstly, the almost unbearable heat was a major issue. With a limited water supply, the author used a large amount of water due to the sweltering temperatures. Secondly, at the snack stop, the pumps the author encountered had no water. This lack of water severely impacted the author's well - being. Finally, when the author tried to get water from the pump, a tar - like substance came out, and there was also brackish water that tasted suspiciously like battery acid. In conclusion, these unfavorable features of the setting combined to have a detrimental impact on the author.
79	6057	3	2	"In June, a cyclist is traveling through a harsh area of California. The author describes the journey, stating, ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" The intense heat of the sun and the scarcity of water make the cyclist worried about his health. As the journey progresses, the cyclist realizes the danger of heatstroke if water isn't found soon, as the author writes, ""the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke."" Having run out of water and seeing no signs of life around, the cyclist begins to doubt making it to Yosemite National Park. The author describes this despair, saying, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" In conclusion, the setting of the cyclist's journey significantly influenced his perception and sense of hope during the trip."
80	6058	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist due to his location. The cyclist is in a campground in California. From this description, one can infer that it is a dusty place. The story mentions that the “town” had been abandoned, indicating that the area the cyclist is in is deserted, with few people and places to stop. There is also mention of a snake on the road. In normal populated areas, streets are busy and snakes are not found on the road. So, the presence of a snake suggests that this town is indeed deserted. In conclusion, the various elements of the setting, such as the abandoned town and the snake on the road, paint a picture of a desolate place that impacts the cyclist's experience.
81	6059	3	2	The setting has a significant impact on the cyclist. As the cyclist rides over short rolling hills and around a remarkably large snake, and with the high temperature, there is a constant risk of heatstroke. Therefore, it is evident that the author is affected by the setting.
82	6060	3	2	The features of the surrounding environment affect the bikers. The hot bikes make it necessary for the bikers to have water. Additionally, the hilly roads prevent them from riding straight; they have to go over the hills. This is challenging because it is difficult to land a jump on a cycle. In conclusion, these environmental features have a notable impact on the bikers.
83	6061	3	2	"In the journey, the features of Yosemite offer the cyclist something to anticipate. However, the arduous journey to reach it brings despair. Early in the trip, as the cyclist passes a ghost - town and feels the sweltering heat of the sun, he reassures himself, saying, ""I barely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" Despite starting to feel the strain of the trip and the sun, he clings to the hope of reaching Yosemite. As he notices the sun more, he drinks more water until his supply runs low. He hopes to replenish it from an old rusty water pump, but the bitter taste like battery acid makes him stop. The rolling hills, sun, and tumbleweeds do nothing to quench his thirst. Instead of seeing a sign indicating Yosemite was near, he sees one warning of a rough road ahead, which only deepens his despair. If the terrain were more favorable and water was abundant, his mood would be more hopeful. In summary, the setting features cause the cyclist grief rather than hope."
84	6062	3	2	"In the short story ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"" by @PERSON1, the bike - rider is significantly affected by the surrounding land conditions. He is cycling through an extremely dry desert, and his water supply is running low. Since the area is desolate, he can neither find water nor ask anyone for it. Had the story been set elsewhere, these problems would not have occurred. In conclusion, the specific setting of the desert causes the bike - rider's difficulties."
85	6063	3	2	"In ""Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit"", the features of the setting impact the cyclist. Numerous visual features depict a deserted and sweltering area. For instance, in paragraph five, many adjectives like ""ramshackle"" and ""rusty"" are used to describe the abandoned place. The repeated mention of the lack of water makes the reader sense the intense heat of the California desert. The heat makes the cyclist believe he is seeing a miracle when he spots the Welch's fruit juice factory. The visual words in the story are chosen to describe what affects the cyclist. In conclusion, the setting features and the visual descriptions play a crucial role in influencing the cyclist's experience."
86	6064	3	2	The cyclist in the passage encountered approximately @NUM1 distinct settings. One such setting involved rough terrains where he faced a shortage of water. Another setting was the hill - like terrains, where he found himself laughing at his decision to follow the old men's advice. Both of these aspects significantly depleted the cyclist's physical strength and spirit. However, through confidence, determination, and the anticipation of success, he managed to overcome these obstacles.
87	6065	3	2	The features of the setting have multiple impacts on the cyclist. In June, the weather in California was sweltering, and the water the cyclist found in the pipes was also extremely hot, as described in the text as “Somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This left him without suitable water to drink. Additionally, he had to deal with tumbleweeds and snakes, as the text mentions “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” These were obstacles he had to surmount. Moreover, he was in a deserted area, with “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” Overall, the various features of the setting presented numerous challenges for the cyclist.
88	6066	3	2	The environmental conditions in the cyclist's setting can significantly influence their riding performance. Extreme temperatures, whether too hot or too cold, can have adverse effects. When it is excessively hot, the cyclist will tire more rapidly. Conversely, if it is too cold, the cyclist may become ill. Additionally, strong winds can impede the cyclist's progress, especially when riding in the direction of the wind. In conclusion, the setting's features play a crucial role in determining the cyclist's riding experience.
89	6067	3	2	Several factors affected the cyclist. One major issue was the lack of potable water; the text indicates that the water from the pump tasted like battery acid. Another problem was that the actual surroundings differed from what the old men had described, causing the cyclist to get lost. When lost, the cyclist needed determination to find someone who could help ensure his survival. In summary, these various features presented significant challenges to the cyclist.
90	6068	3	2	The setting and its features have a profound impact on the cyclist. He is in a desert where all the towns are abandoned. Moreover, he comes across a sign that reads “Rough Road Ahead…(kurmaskie, pg @NUM1).” This makes his journey even more arduous as he now has to navigate not only large hills but also damaged, old, and rough roads. With the sun blazing down and his water supply nearly exhausted, his situation is quite dire. In conclusion, the setting and its features severely hamper the cyclist's progress.
91	6069	3	2	The characteristics of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. When descending winding hills, the cyclist encounters obstacles that require slowing down to navigate the slopes and maintain control of the bicycle. The intense heat leads to fatigue and dehydration. Prolonged exposure to the sun can result in sunburn or heatstroke, which can be life - threatening, especially for those with heart conditions. Dehydration, too, can be fatal. Moreover, if the cyclist fails to spot any buildings, it becomes difficult to determine his location, increasing the risk of getting lost. Getting lost further exacerbates the issues of dehydration, fatigue, and the likelihood of heatstroke. In conclusion, the setting poses multiple challenges to the cyclist's safety and progress.
92	6070	3	2	The setting and its features have a profound impact on the cyclist. As the cyclist travels through the desert, each building he sees gives him hope of finding water. However, due to the arid environment, water is scarce, and many buildings in the wasteland are empty. The sight of these buildings initially brings a sense of relief to the cyclist, only to be replaced by despair when he discovers they are abandoned. The featureless landscape also instills a feeling of hopelessness in the rider, making his entire journey even more arduous. Overall, the cycling experience is extremely taxing both physically and mentally for the cyclist.
93	6071	3	2	In the story 'Rough @CAPS1 Ahead', the features of the setting and the cyclist's surroundings exert a substantial influence on him. The cyclist is in the high deserts of California in June, where the climate is characterized by heat, dryness, and discomfort. Another notable aspect of the setting is its isolation; there are no other people, cars, or buildings for miles around. Additionally, the terrain impacts the cyclist. When the road becomes bumpy and uneven, the cyclist uses up his water supply at a faster rate. In summary, the cyclist in this story is significantly affected by his surrounding environment.
94	6072	3	2	"In the short story, the cyclist is affected by the setting in numerous ways. Throughout the story, the cyclist (also the author) is running out of water. As described, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,"" indicating a limited water supply. The cyclist has a long distance to travel, as mentioned, ""Not two miles into the next section."" This long - distance journey, combined with the poor terrain, takes a toll on him. The text states, ""I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" As a result, it becomes increasingly difficult for the cyclist to continue his ride."
95	6073	3	2	The cyclist had his heart set on seeing cool, piney trees and lakes. However, the sight of dirt, snakes, and the absence of any signs of civilization worried him. What scared him the most was what he didn't see. He didn't find windy rivers or trails hidden among trees, nor did he encounter any people or friendly forest animals. Instead, he was greeted by the same rust - colored dirt and the occasional snake. This affected his mood, causing him to lose confidence and hope. Unaccustomed to the new surroundings, he even doubted if he could survive. When he came across the dilapidated Welch's factory building, his distress deepened. Fortunately, his spirits were lifted when he found a fishing supply shop, which meant he had reached civilization. After quenching his thirst and reassuring himself that he was alive and would likely stay that way, he sat down before continuing his journey in search of his destination.
96	6074	3	2	The environmental features pose significant challenges for the cyclist. In June, while cycling in California, the sweltering heat and desert - like conditions take a toll. When the cyclist stops to find water, the pump he locates has only a few drops left. Moreover, these meager drops taste like battery acid. Clearly, such circumstances are unfavorable for the cyclist.
97	6075	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author modifies the mood by both depicting the cyclist's emotions and describing his surroundings. As the cyclist leaves the “resevoir compground,” he is in high spirits, departing from the tranquility of an early - summer evening and heading towards “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” The beautiful setting influences him as he anticipates another idyllic scene. However, when he reaches the “ghost town” and the sun intensifies, his confidence wanes, and he becomes more skeptical of the man's advice. Yet, he remains optimistic, even finding it amusing that the place was once a thriving spot. Next, upon encountering “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral,” he realizes the dire situation and needs water. But all that is available is a “tarlike substance,” so he has no choice but to move on. When he comes across “rough road tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake,” he understands that the situation is at its worst. He must decide whether to give up or persevere. Both he and the author doubt the situation could deteriorate further. Finally, when the cyclist enters a rather modern bathroom, he returns to civilization, feeling relaxed, relieved, and much better.
98	6076	3	2	There are several features of the setting that impact the cyclist on his journey. Firstly, there is a severe lack of water. The cyclist is in the middle of nowhere, with no one around. Water is essential for him to continue his journey. Without an adequate supply, he risks dehydration and could even die on the road. Secondly, the isolation in the middle of nowhere means there are no buildings, not even gas stations. If he had money, he could buy two or three bottles of water and some snacks. Thirdly, there is no one around to offer assistance. For instance, if he gets lost, there is no one to provide directions. In conclusion, these factors significantly affect the cyclist's journey.
99	6077	3	2	The settings have a notable impact on cyclists for multiple reasons. When the setting is pleasant, cyclists can focus on the scenery rather than just the pain they are experiencing. Conversely, when the setting is unappealing, cyclists are more likely to concentrate on the pain than the scenery. Additionally, if the setting is hilly and the cyclist has to pedal over the hills, it will not be a pleasant experience. The cyclist will feel more pain and may dehydrate more quickly. Evidently, the setting has a substantial influence on the cyclist.
100	6078	3	2	The setting in the story presented numerous obstacles for the cyclist on his way to town. The story is set in a Californian desert in June. The cyclist faced a severe water shortage. When he found a pump, the water was black and tasted like battery acid. Later, he stopped to ask for directions, but the men gave him outdated directions. As a result, the cyclist decided to rely on his trusty map. In this challenging setting, the cyclist had to overcome various difficulties to reach his destination.
101	6079	3	2	"The features of the setting within the text significantly influence the cyclist. As described, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, or structure of any kind."" This desolate scene left the cyclist feeling extremely lonely and led to a loss of hope regarding the search for water. Additionally, the text mentions, ""In an ironic twist the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it - had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory."" The cyclist, initially excited at the prospect of finding people in the building, subsequently lost more hope. Finally, the sight of ""GRAPE AND @CAPS1’S FISH CAMP"" provided the cyclist with hope and a sense of happiness as it signified a potential place to get a drink. Clearly, the features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist's emotional state."
102	6080	3	2	"The characteristics of the setting extended and intensified the cyclist's ride beyond his expectations. At the start of the journey, the road was flat and smooth. However, as he reached the halfway point, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" Despite being slowed down to 12 mph, the cyclist persevered. The hills made the ride more arduous and time - consuming. Towards the end of the hilly stretch, he had to conquer ""One long, crippling hill."" The use of the word ""crippling"" effectively illustrates the physical toll the hill took on him. Undoubtedly, the hills, as a feature of the setting, made the cyclist's ride longer, more difficult, and physically demanding."
103	6081	3	2	There are multiple features in the setting that impact the cyclist. The rough road is one such example. Tumbleweeds and snakes also have an effect on the cyclist. These elements of the setting, including the rough road, tumbleweeds, and snakes, collectively influence the cyclist's experience. In conclusion, these are the key factors through which the setting affects the cyclist.
104	6082	3	2	The sun, the number of miles, and the presence of people all contribute to how the setting affects the cyclist. The sun beat down on the cyclist constantly, and he frequently complained about the intense heat. Although he might not have consciously acknowledged it, the heat had an impact on him. Moreover, the number of miles the cyclist had to bike took a mental toll on him. In summary, the sun, the mileage, and the people in the setting all play significant roles in influencing the cyclist's journey.
105	6083	3	2	The setting resembles a desert, with no water, people, or civilizations in the vicinity. This situation heightens the cyclist's worry because if something were to happen to him, it could be days or even weeks before anyone would be aware. The desolate nature of the setting thus adds a layer of anxiety to the cyclist's experience, highlighting how the setting can have a significant psychological impact on him.
106	6084	3	2	The cyclist faced multiple features during the ride, all of which had an impact. For instance, the text mentioned “several rusty bumps,” indicating that the cyclist was not on smooth ground but rather on rough, hard, and bumpy terrain. Moreover, the cyclist suffered from a severe lack of water. Being water - depleted, the cyclist could only travel at 12 mph instead of the possible 55 mph. The warning “Rough roads ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit” further highlighted the risks of the journey. All these factors combined made the cyclist uncomfortable, dehydrated, and extremely tired.
107	6085	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting was a significant factor that caused the protagonist's problems throughout. Initially, the large hills the protagonist had to cycle up made the ride strenuous, quickly tiring him out. Subsequently, the intense heat of June was a major issue. As the text stated, “and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because.” The heat was so severe that it made the protagonist hot, depleted his essential water supply, and posed a high risk of heatstroke and death. The abandoned Juice Factory was all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist in the heat. “A sand - blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” In the unbearable heat, with no water left and an unknown number of miles remaining, the protagonist felt like the sorriest and unluckiest man in the world. Overall, the setting seemed deliberately designed to make the protagonist suffer from natural elements and be taunted by certain things.
108	6086	3	2	The features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist. It is difficult to cycle long distances when the area is dry, abandoned, quiet, with fluctuating temperatures, and straightforward. The description “there was none in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind” indicates that the setting is deserted. This makes it challenging for the cyclist to maintain an adequate water supply, as there are no resources around. In conclusion, the unfavorable setting severely hampers the cyclist's journey.
109	6087	3	2	The cyclist decided to take an old, abandoned route to @LOCATION1. Along parts of the route, there were no buildings in sight, which made the cyclist lose hope of finding water. Throughout the journey, the cyclist was completely alone, and in case of an emergency, no one would be aware. During the adventure, the cyclist ran out of water and became dehydrated, which only worsened the situation. The setting of the story was indeed tragic for the cyclist, as it presented numerous difficulties and left the cyclist in a vulnerable state.
110	6088	3	2	The features of the setting had a profound effect on the cyclist. As Kurmaskie (@NUM1) wrote, “The sun was beginning to beat down.” The intense sun made the cyclist sweat, leading to rapid water loss and dehydration. Kurmaskie (@NUM2) also mentioned that “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The hills the cyclist had to ascend were physically demanding, causing the cyclist to get tired more quickly. However, Kurmaskie (@NUM3) described how “I stumbled into a rather modern in bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” The modern bathroom had cold, good - quality water. The cyclist was able to drink from it, which replenished lost fluids and allowed the cyclist to regain some strength and continue the journey.
111	6089	3	2	In the essay “DO NOT Exceed posted speed limit,” the situation seems to be a matter of survival, as the man appears to be struggling to stay alive. Cyclists often pedal for hours and sometimes cover hundreds of miles. If he were biking in a place where green grass meets cool mountains, the tone and mood of the essay would be completely different. The author uses sentences like “... of two hundred degrees, deteriorating brain, birds would pick me up clean and drop from heatstroke.” These statements make me eager to read further to find out if he will be okay by the end of his journey. I understand the feeling of being low on fluids because I have chronic dehydration. I can't imagine biking and only seeing the desert hiss and passing tumbleweeds. It sounds like a truly awful experience. Had he been in a cooler and more colorful place, his experience wouldn't have been so horrific.
112	6090	3	2	The setting in the story has multiple effects on the cyclist. Firstly, the extreme heat described in the story puts the cyclist at risk of dehydration and heat - stroke. Additionally, the windy roads pose a problem. Since the cyclist is tired, he may have difficulty navigating the turns, potentially continuing straight and getting even more lost. In conclusion, the features of the setting significantly impact the cyclist's journey in the story.
113	6091	3	2	In the story “Rough Road ahead,” the features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist. The weather is a major source of his problems. As the cyclist was biking in a California desert in June, the temperature was likely in the [@NUM1]s. This led to his dehydration, as evidenced by his statement “I had been hitting my water bottles quite regularly.” The heat made him consume water rapidly and eventually run out. Moreover, the objects the cyclist encountered during his journey also affected him. For example, on a rough path, “a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” This impeded his progress and probably frightened him. Overall, the features of the story's setting have a substantial influence on the cyclist.
114	6092	3	2	The cyclist was severely affected by the heat. It was June, and he was in the desert with low water supplies, which almost led to his downfall. The hot desert setting seems extremely hostile. I'm really surprised that he survived; he was incredibly lucky. In conclusion, the harsh heat and desert conditions posed a great threat to the cyclist's well - being.
115	6093	3	2	The features of the setting misled the cyclist. When he first left the town where the old men gave him advice, the cyclist had high hopes. He was enjoying the scenery and seemed unaware of the struggles that awaited him. As the journey progressed, it became clear that the seemingly pleasant start was a false impression. In conclusion, the initial appearance of the setting did not accurately represent the challenges the cyclist would face.
116	6094	3	2	The setting significantly influenced the cyclist, making his journey arduous. As he continued, he started to lose hope, grow tired, and even thought he might die. The setting was a major factor; it was swelteringly hot, with no people or buildings in sight. He had very little water and no means to obtain more. Then, he came across a large snake, which exacerbated the situation as he was in fear with no one around to assist him. Had he followed his own directions instead of those of the old men, he would not have faced this predicament. The desolate setting, lacking water, people, towns, and buildings, truly made his trip a difficult one.
117	6095	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting had a profound impact on the cyclist. At the start of his journey, the cyclist was confident in his abilities, stating, “I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” The setting initially supported his excitement, as he felt that “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” However, as the setting changed and his water supply dwindled, his attitude shifted. Traveling through the high deserts of California in June with little water, he began to feel desperate. The appearance of abandoned buildings and deserted towns led him into despair. He described encountering tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake that blocked most of the pavement, and being in the middle of nowhere with no one around made him lose hope of survival. He feared dying of heat - stroke under the extremely hot sun on the short rolling hills with no water left. Throughout his journey, the changes in the setting caused the cyclist's attitude to shift from confidence to desperation, despair, and finally to relief.
118	6096	3	2	In “Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting have a major impact on the cyclist. When the cyclist sees the grape juice factory, he is reminded of his lack of water and begins to doubt his survival. As the text states, “A young man pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head” (Kurmaskie). Later, the text mentions “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path...” (Kurmaskie), indicating that the cyclist is depressed and significantly affected by these sights. These experiences can damage his self - esteem and make him contemplate death.
119	6097	3	2	The cyclist embarked on a rough journey. He described how tiring and difficult it was to travel from town to town. He had to deal with a lack of water, poisonous snakes, and the poor condition of the road. All these challenges combined made his journey an extremely tough one.
120	6098	3	2	The setting in the essay did not assist the author during his journey. There were few structures along the way, and many of the so - called towns were “ghost towns.” This did not reassure the author that things were going well. Moreover, the journey took place in June while traveling through the deserts of California. Deserts are hot, and June is in the summer, the hottest season, so it was extremely hot and humid. All these factors must have taken a toll on the author, as he did not see anything reassuring until he reached the last town with the bait store. Clearly, the setting affected his confidence and energy levels.
121	6099	3	2	In this essay, the features of the setting have a distinct impact on the cyclist. When the cyclist encounters the signs stating “Rough [area] ahead: Do not Exceed posted Speed Limit,” they are compelled to slow down their bike. Subsequently, the cyclist notes that there are no buildings or cars in sight. This desolate setting clearly affects the cyclist's journey and experience.
122	6100	3	2	The setting's features significantly influence the cyclist. The essay mentions, “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time - say, before the last world war - but on that morning it fit the tradition of a ghost town.” This description may make the cyclist fear that if they get into trouble, there will be no one around to assist them. It could also make them worry that they are on the wrong path. Another statement in the essay, “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral they couldn't [accommodate] the larger mule greeted me,” gives the cyclist the impression that this town is deserted, and it might have been uninhabited for years, perhaps even decades. Many cyclists would fear the outcome of such a journey. If they let these fears take over, they might become like “old - timers” who never leave their porches and miss out on these experiences. In conclusion, the various features of the setting in the cyclist's journey can instill fear and uncertainty.
123	6101	3	2	The features of the setting had a notable impact on the cyclist. Forty miles into the desert, the cyclist reached the first “town.” As the cyclist was riding down the road, a man with certain characteristics affected the cyclist; this man seemed quite crazy. The cyclist's water bottles had only a few sips left. Wide rings of dried sweat circled the cyclist's shirt. There was a fear of dropping from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June just because the cyclist listened to some gentlemen who might have been overly confident or tough - talking. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist, highlighting the challenges and risks faced during the journey.
124	6102	3	2	The cyclist placed his trust in a man who had limited knowledge of the world. He assumed the man would know the way to his destination. Taking the man's advice, the cyclist thought he'd reach his destination quickly, so he consumed his water rapidly. Soon, he realized he was out of water, and the park he was headed to was nowhere in sight. Frustrated and angry, the cyclist continued across the desert, growing tired and dehydrated. He passed a rough road filled with tumbleweeds and snakes but kept going until he spotted the “[Company Name] Juice” company. He rushed there, went into the bathroom, and drank some water. When he emerged, an old man offered directions, but the cyclist declined. In the end, the cyclist's trust in an ill - informed man led to a difficult and trying journey.
125	6103	3	2	During the “Do not exceed speed limit” passage, the cyclist faces numerous hardships due to the setting. While lost, thirsty, and exhausted, the cyclist is in “The high deserts of California in June,” where the temperature is likely unbearable. This extreme heat causes the cyclist to tire and dehydrate more quickly than normal. Additionally, the road has many steep hills, as indicated by “over one long, crippling hill,” which requires a great deal of energy to climb. Moreover, the area is completely deserted, with “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This means that if the cyclist needs help, there is no one around. Overall, the setting negatively impacts the cyclist's journey, making it arduous and perilous.
126	6104	3	2	The situation impacts the cyclist as the text initially mentions an old man. It also implies that the information is outdated. In other words, the cyclist should have simply followed the map from the start. This oversight led to a less - than - ideal situation for the cyclist.
127	6105	3	2	In the stories “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, there are highly descriptive settings that significantly affect the cyclist. The effects vary depending on the settings, with some being positive and others harsh. The first described setting, “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,” paints a vivid picture of the cyclist's destination and creates a happy mood. However, as the cyclist rides on, the terrain changes; the flat road is replaced by short, rolling hills. At this point, the cyclist is short on water and extremely tired, which crushes their spirit. Riding hills is difficult, especially without the promise of something good on the other side. These two very different settings evoke contrasting feelings. The first makes one think the cyclist will have an easy and enjoyable bike ride, but this changes when they encounter the hills. The mere thought of riding over miles of hills can make one's legs ache. Overall, the features of the setting suggest an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward in a beautiful place.
128	6106	3	2	The author had to cycle in extremely hot weather, which made them sweat profusely. As the narration states, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt” (@NUM1). This led the author to drink water until the supply ran out, as described by “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (@NUM1). In desperation, the author resorted to sucking on pebbles, a risky act as they could have choked. The narration “With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat” (@NUM1) highlights this danger. In conclusion, the hot weather created a series of difficult and dangerous situations for the author during the bike ride.
129	6107	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, numerous features of the setting affected the cyclist. The most challenging issue the author faced was the lack of water. As described, “I pumped that handle for several minutes but the water wouldn’t come out; when I got a drip or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” When the cyclist set out for the next stretch, they came across a road sign that read “Rough road ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The terrain became bumpier and harder to cross, which affected the cyclist's remaining determination. The cyclist regretted not listening to the old men, thinking they didn't know what they were talking about because they never left their porches. Evidently, the setting affected the cyclist both physically and mentally.
130	6108	3	2	The features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist. One way is through the heat, as stated in the text “I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June” @CAPS1. Another way is the bumpy terrain, as indicated by the sign “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” These elements of the setting, heat and bumpy roads, clearly affect the cyclist's experience during the ride. In conclusion, the setting plays a crucial role in influencing the cyclist's journey.
131	6109	3	2	The setting's features have a significant impact on the cyclist as he travels from the desert to a town. His mood and actions are influenced throughout the journey. For instance, when an old man asks for a map, the cyclist's mood shifts. He first becomes cautious on a new road, then experiences terror as he fears for his life, thinking “I was gonna die and the birds would pick me clean”. Later, he feels pride when he tells the old man “I own a very good map”. As he heads towards Yosemite, the setting changes. He passes through a desert - like area and stops at a bait shop to rest before continuing on his way to his destination. Overall, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experiences during his journey.
132	6110	3	2	In 'Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit' by Joe Kurmaskie, it is evident that the setting's features had a substantial impact on the cyclist. The cyclist was traveling through the desert on a bicycle. Had they been in a car or on a bus, significantly less energy would have been expended. Additionally, the cyclist started to run out of water. Since they were on a bike, this lack of water was a major issue as cycling requires proper hydration. The deserted towns also affected the plot. If these towns had not been deserted, the cyclist's journey would have been much easier. In conclusion, these various features of the setting greatly influenced the cyclist's journey.
133	6111	3	2	The features of the setting significantly influence the cyclist's determination to continue. After traveling @NUM1 miles, the cyclist encounters a “ramshackled shed, several rusty bumps, and a corral”. This sight troubles him. In the desert, the water he has tastes like “battery acid”. He describes this experience as “a test for my inner spirit”. The cyclist continues his journey with just a few drops of water, passing through tumbleweeds. Despite the numerous obstacles he faces, he manages to persevere and gains a bit of confidence. Even though his situation is almost unbearable at times, he keeps pushing forward. In the end, the setting presents challenges that the cyclist overcomes, showing his resilience.
134	6112	3	2	Throughout most of the story, the setting has a profound impact on the cyclist. The heat makes him hot and thirsty, and the long - distance travel depletes his energy and increases his need for water. In paragraph @NUM1, the writer describes one of the hills as “long”. This hill wears the cyclist out and drains the remaining energy he has. The nature of the road, whether it is flat or bumpy, and the temperature are key elements of the setting. The combination of these factors in the setting greatly affects the cyclist's physical state and his ability to continue the journey.
135	6113	3	2	The setting can affect the cyclist in numerous ways. The area where the cyclist is seems to be abandoned. This lack of human presence gives the cyclist little to rely on, as there are no noticeable building structures for a long while. The shape and condition of the road are also dangerous for the cyclist. It is narrow and rocky, and the presence of wildlife adds to the risk. In the text, a poisonous diamond - back snake is directly in front of the cyclist, indicating that there could be even more dangerous creatures. Moreover, the temperature limits the cyclist's water supply, and the risk of complete dehydration is a major concern. All these conditions of the setting put the cyclist at a disadvantage. In conclusion, the setting's features create a challenging environment for the cyclist's journey.
136	6114	3	2	The cyclist had to face various settings, including mountains or hills with winding roads and the California desert in June. Moreover, he was running out of water. These challenging conditions presented significant difficulties for the cyclist during his journey.
137	6115	3	2	In my opinion, the features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist. When the setting is not right, it affects the overall experience. These features could be adjusted slightly without changing the core meaning of the essay. Therefore, I firmly believe that they should be modified to enhance the overall effect.
138	6116	3	2	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. He is undertaking a bike ride through the deserts of California in June. This setting is bound to have an impact on him due to the extreme heat. At one point, he remarks, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed.” Additionally, the presence of numerous ghost towns troubles him as he is alone and starting to run out of water. The weather starts to take a toll on him, and he says, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…” Cycling through the desert on a hot day inevitably has effects. If the setting were different, the feeling of despair would not be present in the story. This clearly demonstrates how the setting affects the cyclist.
139	6117	3	2	The features of the setting can affect a cyclist in multiple ways. One such feature is the weather. During a cycling trip, the weather can greatly influence the setting. For instance, if it starts to rain, the roads can become slippery and dangerous, increasing the risk of a crash that could endanger the cyclist's life. Another feature is the local animals. Different areas have different animals with various behaviors. Knowing about the animals in the area where the cyclist is traveling can help keep them safe. It is better to be informed and feel secure rather than being unaware of potential dangers.
140	6118	3	2	As the features of the setting change, it becomes increasingly difficult for the cyclist. Initially, the cyclist's journey was relatively easy. He had flat, smooth roads to ride on and started before the sun became too intense. He found solace in the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite, which helped him stay focused. However, when he reached a highway, the situation became more challenging. The terrain changed from flat roads to short, rolling hills, forcing him to pedal harder and tire more quickly. Later, tumble - weeds crossing his path indicated that he was in the desert during a hot period. With little water left, he became dehydrated, making it extremely difficult for him to maintain his balance. Clearly, the changing terrain made his journey a hard task to overcome.
141	6119	3	2	The setting of the short story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is a sweltering, sun - drenched desert where all towns have been deserted. As described, “The sun was beginning to beat down” and “I arrived at the first town it fit the definition of a ghost town”. At this point, the cyclist is neither tired nor overly worried about the lack of water. The setting and the cyclist's state are closely intertwined. This co - existence of the harsh setting and the cyclist's current state sets a unique tone for the story, highlighting the potential challenges that may lie ahead for the cyclist in this desolate environment.
142	6120	3	2	In the story, the cyclist faces numerous challenges. To complete the race, he endures a series of hardships. He must be vigilant on the rough road he traverses. Throughout the race, he also has to watch out for diamond - back snakes. The most pressing issue for the cyclist is water; he runs out of it quickly. When he spots a factory and stops, he puts rocks in his mouth to distract himself from the thirst and to keep his saliva circulating. By persevering through all these problems, the cyclist demonstrates remarkable determination. His ability to overcome these obstacles shows that he is driven and resolute in achieving his goal of finishing the race.
143	6121	3	2	The characteristics of the setting significantly impact the cyclist. He is cycling on a route about which he has little confidence that it will lead anywhere. Having never been on this road before and possessing only outdated information, the cyclist is filled with unease. The temperature is extremely high, with little shade and the sun beating down on him. The route is demoralizing, constantly taunting the cyclist with false hopes of finding water. At the first town, he notices a water pump, but all he can obtain is sludge and water that tastes like battery acid. Later, he comes across a deserted old building that turns out to be an old bottling factory for Welch's grape juice. Each time, the cyclist seems to be close to getting something to drink but is ultimately left empty - handed. These repeated disappointments due to the setting make the cyclist's journey even more arduous.
144	6122	3	2	During the cyclist's bike ride, the unbearable conditions transform his attitude. At the start, the reader can sense his frustration because of the directions given by the old - timers. However, when he realizes that he might have enough water, his attitude begins to change. He shifts from being frustrated to appreciating the scenery, stating, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them”. But as the conditions deteriorate into even more unbearable heat, he decides to give up. Then, he gathers the courage to continue, “slowly gaining elevation while losing hope”. Finally, when he sees Gary and Wilber's fish camp, he realizes he is safe. This journey through changing attitudes shows how the external conditions can have a profound impact on a person's mental state during a challenging endeavor.
145	6123	3	2	The cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” is affected in multiple ways by the environment. The most prominent environmental feature is the lack of water. The cyclist is on the verge of death due to severe dehydration. Another significant factor is the heat. The area where the cyclist is biking is extremely hot, and the heat further dehydrates him, pushing him to his limits. Moreover, the deserted towns haunt him; he becomes frustrated with the lodgers he talks to. The road also poses challenges as the smooth flat terrain gives way to rolling hills, making it more difficult for him to ride. Additionally, he has to avoid a snake on the road. All these environmental factors combined have a substantial impact on the cyclist, making his journey a struggle filled with obstacles.
146	6124	3	2	"Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie is a classic tale of man versus nature. A lone cyclist, accompanied only by his bike, the barren landscape, and the unrelenting sun, embarks on a challenging journey. First, the sun beats down overhead, a typical occurrence in a California June but no less oppressive. Then, the rolling hills and inclines come into play. As he pedals uphill, his body works harder, burning calories and depleting his precious water supply. Adding to his torture is the posted speed limit of @NUM1, while he struggles to maintain a speed of just 12. To make matters worse, a billboard shows a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth, a cruel reminder of what he lacks. Every element of his surroundings contributes to his sense of hopelessness, making this a harrowing account of a man's battle against the forces of nature."
147	6125	3	2	The features of the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist. The road conditions were terrible. The cyclist also encountered a huge snake blocking his path and the occasional tumbleweed. However, the most significant factors affecting the cyclist were the lack of water, the unbearable heat, and his fatigue. These aspects of the setting combined to make the cyclist's journey extremely challenging.
148	6126	3	2	"If I had to choose between cycling in California and Vermont, it would be an easy decision to pick Vermont. The temperature in Vermont is much cooler than in California. In the story, the cyclist complains about the ""wide rings of dried sweat"" and the risk of heatstroke. It is well - known that as temperatures rise, the body loses more water. Had the cyclist chosen a cooler location at a different time of year, he would not have faced dehydration during his bike ride. Clearly, the cooler climate of Vermont would make for a more pleasant cycling experience."
149	6127	3	2	"The features of the setting in the story had a profound impact on the cyclist. In the morning, when he started his trip, he was full of eagerness and determination to reach his destination. It took him forty miles to reach the first ""town,"" but he didn't seem to mind. As the sun began to beat down, he thought about the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite, showing that he was unfazed at that time. However, as the trip progressed, the heat increased, and his water supply dwindled. After passing a couple of abandoned and desolate ""troubling sights,"" he started to worry. In his desperation, he resorted to sucking on pebbles to keep the last bit of spit in his mouth. Finally, he saw a sign of hope that gave him the strength to continue. When he arrived at GARY AND @CAPS1'S FISH CAMP, his mood changed from despair to gratitude, highlighting how the setting's features influenced his emotional and physical state throughout the journey."
150	6128	3	2	"During his cycling trip, author and cyclist Joe Kurmaskie had to face numerous challenges related to the setting of Yosemite National Park. He endured extreme heat, encountered snakes, had little to no shade, and suffered from a severe lack of water. He became dehydrated, as he described, ""the sun was beginning to beat down and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" One of his struggles was crossing the path of a ""ridiculously large snake"" while trying to maintain his balance in a dehydrated state. Due to the extreme heat, he ran out of water. When he reached a water pump, he found the water unfit for drinking and extremely hot. Another issue related to the setting was that the area seemed deserted, and he had to cycle for miles before finding a place with clean water where he could rest and rehydrate. Overall, the setting of Yosemite National Park presented a series of difficult obstacles for Kurmaskie during his cycling trip."
151	6129	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting's features significantly impacted the cyclist. The presence of rolling hills made pedaling a challenge. Additionally, tumbleweeds obstructed the cyclist's path; if caught on the bike, they could cause the cyclist to fall and sustain injuries. Moreover, the rough road ahead, with potholes and other obstacles, made riding difficult. Overall, the setting had a notable adverse effect on the cyclist.
152	6130	3	2	The features of the setting continuously affect the cyclist. Initially, he is hopeful, but then realizes the situation is hopeless. He laughed when people gave him the right directions, yet later, as he referred back to the first town, he said, “It was sad, hopeless laughter, mind you, but at least I still had energy to feel bad for myself.” At first, the cyclist was doing well, but then he got thirsty and encountered bad things. In conclusion, these elements of the setting clearly influenced the cyclist's state and journey.
153	6131	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting's features had multiple effects on the author. One prominent feature was the hills. The speed - limit also affected the author as he felt he was moving too slowly. The text “I was doing a water - depleting @NUM1” serves as evidence of this. In summary, the setting, including the hills and the speed - limit, had a notable impact on the author's experience in the story.
154	6132	3	2	The setting affects the cyclist in several ways. The hot, dry heat of the California desert makes him hot and thirsty, leading to a shortage of water. The heat has made the water in the well undrinkable, and the water bottle only contains a few tantalizing sips, insufficient to quench his thirst. The intense heat, which could even make birds pick at him, makes it difficult for the cyclist to follow the old - timers' advice. It makes him realize that wisdom comes with time and youth can make silly mistakes. The heat turns the journey into a test of his inner soul's survival. In conclusion, the setting has a profound and multi - faceted effect on the cyclist.
155	6133	3	2	The cyclist was significantly affected by the features of the setting as he was in a desert. There were no stores, rivers, or lakes. The extreme heat, long roads, and the presence of snakes on the road added to his difficulties. With limited water to drink, the harsh desert setting made his journey much harder. In conclusion, the desert setting presented numerous challenges for the cyclist.
156	6134	3	2	"The setting's features significantly impact the cyclist. Key elements such as the pseudo - towns that are now dilapidated and the water pump play crucial roles. Although these features offered a glimmer of hope, they failed to provide any real relief. The first so - called ""town"" the cyclist encountered could potentially have supplied water. However, it was in a state of disrepair. As the cyclist noted, ""I arrived at the first 'town'. This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time... refer the @NUM1 word war."" It seemed that this town, which could have provided water and energy, was no longer viable. Additionally, the cyclist came across a much - needed water pump. But despite trying to pump water for several minutes, as he said, ""I pumped the handle for several minutes but the water wouldnít cool down."" A functional water pump would have given him the strength to continue cycling, yet it too was misleading. In conclusion, these features of the setting, while offering initial hope, ultimately let the cyclist down."
157	6135	3	2	"The features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist. For instance, the description ""flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" indicates the cyclist's likely fatigue as he has to work harder to get over the hills. Another example is the mention of ""high deserts of California in June"", which implies a hot and tiring environment. Given that California is generally hot and June is part of the summer, it is reasonable to assume that the cyclist would find the conditions exhausting. In summary, these features of the setting clearly affect the cyclist by increasing his physical and mental exertion."
158	6136	3	2	The features of the road have a direct impact on the cyclist. When the road has a downhill slope, the cyclist can ride at a faster speed. Conversely, an uphill road forces the cyclist to slow down. Moreover, the road may have obstacles such as bumpy rocks or patches of grass, which make cycling difficult. In essence, the cyclist's experience is highly dependent on the road's construction. The nature of the road, whether it is smooth or full of obstacles, determines the cyclist's speed and the effort required to pedal.
159	6137	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound effect on the cyclist's desire for water. As the conditions of the setting deteriorate, the cyclist's thirst intensifies. For example, in the essay, tumbleweeds crossing the path and a large snake blocking the pavement are described. Tumbleweeds are associated with dryness, like dry grass, and snakes are often seen when it is hot. These elements made the cyclist acutely aware of the dryness in his throat and surroundings, increasing his craving for water. Another feature was a sandblasted picture of a young boy drinking a glass of juice. This image likely made the cyclist long for a cold, refreshing drink. In conclusion, the features of the setting effectively heighten the cyclist's need for water.
160	6138	3	2	"In ""Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the cyclist was negatively affected by various features of the setting. First, the old men gave her a ""shortcut"" on her journey to Yosemite National Park, which may have led her astray. Then, she encountered ghost towns that had no water to offer, putting her at risk of dehydration. The rickety road with tumbleweeds and a huge snake was also a major obstacle, making it difficult for her to progress. However, at the end of her journey, she came across ""Gary and Wilberís fish camp"". This place was a saving grace as it helped her avoid dehydration. Overall, most of the setting's features had a negative impact on the cyclist, except for the fish camp which provided a much - needed respite."
161	6139	3	2	In the short - story “Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist encounters numerous problems, and the setting plays a significant role. The story is set in a desert, an extremely hot environment with no water sources and scarce human habitation. The cyclist is running out of water, as the text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Additionally, the story takes place in June, a very hot month. When combined with the desert setting, this extreme heat poses a severe challenge to the cyclist. The harsh setting forces the cyclist to face difficult circumstances and potentially affects the outcome of his journey.
162	6140	3	2	The settings have a notable impact on a cyclist's performance. When the weather is too hot, the sun beats down on the cyclist, which can cause them to slow down. Conversely, in cold weather, cyclists need to wear more clothes, which may add weight and prevent them from achieving the desired speed. The condition of the bike is also crucial. It should be stable, and factors such as riding on rough roads, proper braking, smooth speeding, and well - maintained chains are important. The area where the cyclist rides sets the mood. A nice scenery can put the cyclist in a wonderful mood, while a dark, gloomy area with bad weather can have the opposite effect. These aspects collectively determine how settings can influence a cyclist's experience.
163	6141	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead”, the setting has a profound impact on the cyclists. The desert climate bears down on the cyclist. For instance, the route the cyclist takes is not only in a desert but also lacks water sources. The combination of intense heat and the lack of water leads to a high risk of deadly dehydration for the cyclists. As a result, the setting compels the cyclist to be more determined if they want to survive. They must continue their journey and hope to come across a town where they can restock on water and rehydrate. The harsh setting thus becomes a significant challenge that the cyclist must overcome.
164	6142	3	2	On the cyclist's way to Yosemite National Park, many factors influenced his journey, but the environment he was in had the most significant impact. He was in a dry desert area where tumbleweeds were more common than people. When the cyclist met some old men and asked for directions, they led him to a “ghost town”. There was no water for the dehydrated cyclist who had been exposed to the extremely dry and hot weather. This made the cyclist fear that he would die in the desert due to the weather, the wrong directions, and the lack of water. However, when he came across a bait shop, he knew he was saved. He rehydrated and declined directions from an old man because the elements of the setting, such as the old men, the dry weather, and the lack of water, had caused his problems in the first place.
165	6143	3	2	In the story, several factors affect the cyclist. One major issue is dehydration. The text describes the situation as “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” On the positive side, the absence of other people on the road allowed the cyclist to ride without being slowed down. However, there were negative impacts too. Taking directions from some gentlemen who hadn't left their porch in a decade led to problems. Also, a poisonous snake got in the cyclist's way. The text mentions, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake -- It really did look like a diamond back. Blocked the major of the pavement in front of me.” These various factors combined to create a challenging journey for the cyclist.
166	6144	3	2	A cyclist, unsure of his destination, received incorrect information and followed it. He was initially excited, thinking he knew where he was going. During his journey, he was affected by various elements. The sun was a major factor; the intense heat in the summer made him dehydrated, and he was running out of water, which made the journey extremely difficult and put him in a strange mood. Additionally, he encountered a large snake, which startled him as he feared an attack and was unsure how to proceed. Due to his lack of knowledge about the route and his unpreparedness for the hot weather on a bicycle, he ended up going in the wrong direction. In conclusion, the combination of misinformation, harsh environmental conditions, and unexpected encounters significantly hindered the cyclist's journey.
167	6145	3	2	The features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist's state of mind. On page @NUM1, the cyclist mentions, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This description creates a sense of the intense heat and foreshadows a potential water shortage later. As he passes a snake, he struggles to maintain balance in his dehydrated state, likely feeling dizzy and starting to lose hope. On page @NUM2, he says, “…I could drop from heatstroke…,” indicating that he is imagining the worst - case scenarios. By page @NUM3, he laments, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean…,” showing that the harsh conditions have made him extremely worried and caused him to lose hope. In summary, the setting's features, including the heat and isolation, had a detrimental effect on the cyclist throughout the story.
168	6146	3	2	The setting presented numerous challenges for the cyclist due to the limited water supply. Joe @PERSON1 described the desolate environment, stating, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The absence of people or nearby stores made it difficult for the cyclist to get proper directions after receiving bad ones from a few old men. @PERSON1 also recounted, “working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength,” highlighting the struggle to find water, which led to weakness and instability. Moreover, the terrain changed from flat roads to short, rolling hills, which was arduous for a cyclist with little water and a weakened body. Additionally, traveling through the high deserts of California in June meant dealing with dust in the lungs and the sun's intense heat, further straining the body. In conclusion, the setting's lack of resources and harsh conditions severely hampered the cyclist's journey.
169	6147	3	2	The setting in the story has a significant impact on the cyclist. The story is set in June, and the extreme heat causes the cyclist to become severely dehydrated. The description “wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage” gives a vivid sense of the sweltering conditions. The cyclist also implies that it felt like two hundred degrees as the sun beat down. The heat and dehydration made the cyclist's journey extremely challenging. In conclusion, the hot and arid setting in June in California had a detrimental effect on the cyclist's physical and mental state during the journey.
170	6148	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in multiple ways. In June, while traveling through the @CAPS1 of California, the intense heat dehydrated him. Since he was unsure of his route, he had to rely on the directions of others. The lack of water and the continuous dehydration further exacerbated his situation. These factors combined to make his journey difficult and uncertain. In conclusion, the combination of the hot weather, unfamiliarity with the route, and dehydration significantly affected the cyclist's experience.
171	6149	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's essay “Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit,” the settings presented a rough and challenging environment. A solo cyclist rode through Todi, California, an arduous area for cycling. The long and hot ride left him severely dehydrated, with dried sweat around his neck. The cyclist reported seeing no one, no buildings, cars, or structures. He had no access to water or food as the area was deserted. He even contemplated that if he died, no one would find him before the birds picked his body clean. This essay portrays solo cyclists as highly independent individuals.
172	6150	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist encountered numerous obstacles. He needed directions to Yosemite National Park, but the directions from the elder men were outdated. At a fork in the road, he had to make a choice and selected a path that the old men said would lead to a town about eighteen miles ahead. Additionally, he faced flat roads that transitioned to rolling hills, snakes blocking his way, and a state of dehydration that could have been fatal. In the end, the cyclist overcame these obstacles to reach Yosemite National Park.
173	6151	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's essay “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting impacts the cyclist in multiple ways. Initially, he followed the advice of an old man and ended up on the wrong path. It was a hot June day in the California deserts. The cyclist's situation was dire from the start; as Kurmaskie wrote, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I needed a drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…” This shows that he was tired and nearly out of water. Despite the significant strain on the cyclist, he managed to persevere.
174	6152	3	2	The setting has a substantial impact on the cyclist. Flat roads are easy and smooth for cycling, but when the road changes to short, rolling hills, the cycling becomes more difficult. The sentence “Over are long, crippling hill...” supports this, indicating that the hill is a challenging obstacle. The cyclist is also affected by the elements that come with the terrain change. For instance, the description “...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondbuck - looked the majority of the pavement in front of me” emphasizes the remoteness of the area. This remoteness has both mental and physical effects on his cycling trip.
175	6153	3	2	Two old - timers sitting on their front porch in the desert since Carter was in office set the scene. As daylight began to break, the cyclist had to walk @NUM1 miles to reach the next town. He then got on his bike and started riding. The speed limit was 55 miles per hour, but he was going at a mere 12 miles per hour, as slow as a gentle water flow. He cycled up and down rolling hills. Eventually, he reached the next town, ensuring his survival.
176	6154	3	2	The setting's characteristics had an impact on the cyclist as he got lost after asking the elderly for directions. This shows that the setting, through the interaction with local people, presented challenges for the cyclist.
177	6155	3	2	In the essay, the setting's features significantly affected the cyclist. The author depicts the setting as hot and bumpy, causing the cyclist to sweat and become tired. He is also running out of water due to thirst. At one point, the road turns very rocky, as the narrator states, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). A photograph further illustrates the rough terrain, which is barren with nothing around. Overall, these aspects of the setting had a substantial impact on the cyclist's journey.
178	6156	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in multiple ways. The cyclist is dehydrated and has to ride on a road with poor conditions, along with the presence of snakes and hills. These elements act as obstacle - courses, making it difficult for him to obtain water. Due to the heat and lack of water, the cyclist is delirious and may not know what is happening. In the story, the main feature of the setting is the road, as described by “Rough road ahead.” Riding on a rough road while dehydrated is extremely dangerous. These features of the setting clearly have a negative impact on the cyclist.
179	6157	3	2	The settings have a significant impact on the cyclist. When he first arrives at the “@CAPS1 town,” he is not overly worried; he even chuckles and makes a light - hearted comment, “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time - say, before the last world war.” However, when it gets dark on the road with the risky water pipe, he switches to a conservation mode and becomes scared. He says, “I would comer water - a test at my inner spirit,” indicating his fear. After seeing the abandoned Grape juice factory, he remarks that birds will pick him clean, leaving behind his expensive biking gear, showing that he is giving up. This is further supported by his mention of writing in his diary about the old men who gave him directions. When he finally reaches the bait shop, he is relieved, goes to the bathroom to drink water, and says he will buy bait even though he has no rod. These instances clearly demonstrate how the setting affected the cyclist.
180	6158	3	2	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the features of the setting impact the cyclist. On a hot summer day, finding shade is necessary to keep cool, but unfortunately, there is no one in sight, no building, car, or any structure. This lack of shade only makes the cyclist more exhausted. Another factor is the lack of water; early in the story, the author mentions that “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” With many miles still to go, the cyclist starts to lose hope of reaching his destination alive. The rolling hills also affect the cyclist. Although the hills are short, they still have an impact on him as “flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills.” Evidently, many features of the story influenced the mood and the cyclist's experience.
181	6159	3	2	The setting's features had an impact on the cyclist. As the distance showed @NUM1 miles and he reached the first town, the cyclist grew excited, thinking he was almost done and moving at a fast pace. When he arrived at the town, it appeared deserted. As he continued, he realized he wasn't making much progress. He then recalled that he had listened to some old folks who had never left their porch. After reaching the first town, he knew he should never listen to old folks again because the town seemed to have been empty for years.
182	6160	3	2	The features of the setting on the journey to Yosemite National Park significantly affected the cyclist. While traveling to the park, the cyclist experienced the intense heat of the California desert. Additionally, he had to navigate the rough terrain of the short, rolling hills, which made him tired and fatigued. Compounding his weakness and the extreme heat, he ran out of water, leading to dehydration. As he put it, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat - stroke... laugh.” This passage through the California desert caused great exhaustion and dehydration for the cyclist, clearly demonstrating the impact of the setting.
183	6161	3	2	The features of the setting can have a substantial impact on a cyclist. The climate may be hot, the road bumpy, and the town deserted. For instance, a sign reading “Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit” poses a challenge for a thirsty cyclist. Without water, it would be difficult for the cyclist to climb the hills. Moreover, if there is no town nearby to get water, the cyclist will suffer from thirst. The so - called “first town” might have once been a lively place, but it now resembles a ghost town with no water available. In conclusion, these setting features can make a cyclist's journey extremely difficult.
184	6162	3	2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in three main ways: heat, lack of water, and getting lost. Firstly, the heat was intense. The cyclist mentioned that the sun was beating down, the water felt around two - hundred degrees, and he was covered in sweat, indicating just how hot it was. Secondly, the lack of water affected his performance. He was desperately in need of water and tried various means to obtain it, but managed to continue with hardly any water. Thirdly, he got lost as the map he had was inaccurate, and the trip did not turn out as he expected. However, in the end, he felt relieved. Despite these negative impacts, he managed to find a positive outcome. This story shows that if you try your hardest, never give up, and are willing to try new things, you are likely to succeed in life and other endeavors. So, one should always strive to do their best and make the most of their life and plans.
185	6163	3	2	The conditions a cyclist encounters can either be obstacles or aids. For example, a rocky uphill section will undoubtedly slow the cyclist down. On the other hand, a smooth downhill part will increase the cyclist's speed and reduce the effort required for pedaling. In conclusion, the nature of the cycling conditions plays a crucial role in determining the cyclist's speed and the amount of work they need to put in.
186	6164	3	2	In June, a cyclist found himself in the California deserts. The extreme environment started to wear him down, and he began to lose hope. Adding to his despair, a rusty water pump provided water that tasted like battery acid. When he saw the sign “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” he became extremely cautious. He was certain that he would die there. The text also mentions that “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” which made him feel incredibly lonely. Being in the California desert, he was convinced that death awaited him.
187	6165	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the author details his arduous biking journey through California. He states, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Although this doesn't directly describe the weather, it allows readers to envision the intense summer heat of a desert. As the author encounters a “ghost town,” a dilapidated shack, and finally the sign reading “Rough Road Ahead,” his hope of reaching Yosemite Park vanishes. The hopelessness of the situation makes him want to give up, fearing death from dehydration and exhaustion in the desert. This experience can resonate with anyone who has been lost in unfavorable circumstances and felt the accompanying helplessness and fear. Just as it seems everything is against you with nothing going your way, the author captures this feeling in his account of the trip.
188	6166	3	2	The setting had a significant impact on the cyclist. The exhaustion began to take its toll on him. Compounding the problem, being out in the heat made him sweat, leading to dehydration. In such a situation, the combination of physical fatigue and water loss severely affected the cyclist's well - being.
189	6167	3	2	One of the features that affected the cyclist was a lack of water. This is evident when the speaker mentions that when they tried a drop or two of the available water, it tasted like battery acid. This poor - quality water was one of the major risks the cyclist faced during his journey. Overall, the scarcity and unpalatability of water had a detrimental impact on his situation.
190	6168	3	2	As the reader followed the old - timers' directions, they encountered numerous issues and learned a lesson. At the start of the morning ride, they had strong legs and a smile on their face. However, as time passed, they were running out of water and energy. The hot summer day made them sweat profusely, and they started to imagine that birds would peck at their body if they died on the way to Yosemite. When they finally reached a town, they refreshed themselves. They then realized that they should start following their own way of getting to places, learning from this challenging experience.
191	6169	3	2	In the essay “Do not exceed the posted speed limit,” the characteristics of the setting had a detrimental impact on the cyclist. As he continued his ride, his thoughts became increasingly negative, and he was filled with doubt. Lacking confidence, he began to believe he would not complete the journey. For instance, when he saw nothing in the vicinity, his tone changed. He noted, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” His words revealed uncertainty and a touch of nervousness. As the journey progressed, it seemed the cyclist was losing hope. He thought, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary.” With no end in sight and only “Rough Road Ahead” signs to accompany him, he struggled to envision finishing the journey. In conclusion, the setting’s features significantly undermined the cyclist’s confidence and hope during his ride.
192	6170	3	2	The setting features presented numerous challenges to the cyclist. He found himself in a desert region of California, where the water supply was scarce. The weather was extremely hot and dry, and he had very little water to sustain him through the long journey in the sweltering and humid conditions. The lack of water put him at risk of dehydration. Another obstacle was the hills he encountered on his biking trip to Yosemite National Park. Initially on flat terrain, he now had to pedal up steep hills, which made the journey much more arduous. Additionally, he came across a snake, further complicating his trip. Overall, the setting was fraught with difficulties for the cyclist. Had it not been for the heat and water shortage, his journey might have been less challenging. In conclusion, the setting’s features posed significant obstacles that tested the cyclist’s endurance and ability to overcome adversity.
193	6171	3	2	The setting’s features had a profound impact on the cyclist. The rolling hills were the most formidable challenge, as they were long and demanding. Maneuvering up these hills required a great deal of energy and determination, especially considering the cyclist was already fatigued from riding on rough roads and encountering a large snake. The difficult terrain also contributed to his risk of dehydration and heatstroke, as the physical exertion in the hot conditions took a toll on his body. However, the cyclist maintained a positive attitude and refused to give up. His perseverance paid off when he finally reached “Gary and Wilbells fish camp,” where he likely found relief. In conclusion, the setting’s features forced the cyclist to work extremely hard, but his determination allowed him to overcome these challenges and continue his journey.
194	6172	3	2	In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist. As the road and setting change, so does the cyclist’s mood. The narration describes, “A large highway sign jumped out at me. I read: Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit … sometimes life can feel so cruel (Kurmaskie).” As the terrain becomes more difficult, the cyclist’s spirits decline. Each time he thinks he is approaching a town, his hopes are quickly dashed. The picture depicts the challenging cycling terrain, which, combined with a lack of water and a growing sense of hopelessness, makes the cyclist tired and leads him to believe he might die. In conclusion, the setting’s features significantly affect the cyclist’s physical and mental state, making his journey a struggle.
195	6173	3	2	Certain features of the setting influenced the cyclist’s ride. One such feature was the speed - limit signs, which affected the cyclist’s speed. Another was a hill on the route. The cyclist’s statement, “I wipe the sweat from my eyes,” indicates that the hill made him tired. In conclusion, the speed - limit signs and the hill in the setting had a direct impact on the cyclist’s speed and physical exertion during the ride.
196	6174	3	2	The setting significantly influenced the cyclist. Firstly, the area he was in, a desert, had a severe water shortage. Moreover, the scarcity of people in the region offered no assistance to the cyclist. The hills on the road further challenged the cyclist as they depleted the little energy he had left. Additionally, the intense sunlight made his body overheat, making it difficult for him to concentrate on his task. In conclusion, the harsh setting posed multiple obstacles for the cyclist, severely hampering his progress.
197	6175	3	2	In the setting where a sign reads “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist is profoundly affected. Initially, the cyclist was enjoying a pleasant campground outside Lodi, California. At that time, some “old - timers” provided him with directions. From the cyclist's perspective, “they'd sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and naming towns I would come across along this breezy route.” The cyclist followed this information, but it did not turn out well for him. In conclusion, relying on the old - timers' directions led to an unfavorable situation for the cyclist.
198	6176	3	2	The features of the setting had a notable impact on the cyclist. When an old guy asked another if he knew where to go, the latter replied, “Yes sir! I own a very good map.” As the cyclist rode his bike, he saw numerous towns and a sign that said “Rough Road ahead.” He kept moving forward, passing by buildings and towns. It seems that his experience of seeing these things might make him more inclined to look towards the future. In conclusion, the setting and the events during his journey could potentially change the cyclist's outlook and make him more future - oriented.
199	6177	3	2	In the story, the cyclist encountered numerous problems. One of the most significant issues was the challenging terrain he had to navigate. The hilly landscape was extremely tiring; cycling uphill consumes more energy and wears a person out faster compared to riding on flat land. The unbearable heat also made it difficult for him to focus. The cyclist did his best to stay conscious while traversing the hilly and deserted landscape of a vast desert with rolling mountains. He pushed forward but found no civilization to refill his water. For instance, if the terrain had been less hilly, he would have used less energy and put less strain on his legs. The intense desert heat likely slowed his progress. Heat generally makes one move slower, and cycling on a barren road with no shade can make the journey seem endless and impossible. In the end, his willpower and determination enabled him to cross the landscape and reach a place where he could get the water he needed to complete his trip.
200	6178	3	2	In this essay, the features of the setting made the cyclist irritated with the old men. The old men gave the cyclist directions, and instead of using a map, he followed their advice. However, the information they provided was outdated. It led the cyclist through rolling hills and bumpy roads. He exhausted all his energy to reach unimportant and unknown towns without any water. The cyclist blamed the old men for giving him directions that wasted his energy. But in fact, he should also blame himself for taking their advice instead of relying on a reliable map for accurate directions. In conclusion, the cyclist's poor decision of following the old men's advice and not using a map led to a frustrating and energy - consuming journey.
201	6179	3	2	The setting where one is cycling significantly influences the cyclist. In my view, the setting is the most crucial aspect. It sets the tone and context for the entire cycling experience, making it an indispensable factor.
202	6180	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting has a profound impact on the cyclist's mindset. When the scenery is pleasant and cheerful, as described by the author's mention of “enjoyed the serenity of an early - summer - evening,” the cyclist is happy. One can infer happiness from the word “enjoyed,” as people typically enjoy things when they are in a positive state of mind. Conversely, when the author writes, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke,” the desolate scenery with tumbleweeds, which are stereotypically associated with dreary and lonely places, makes the cyclist pessimistic. He starts focusing on all that could go wrong. This phenomenon is observable in daily life; for example, the poor and homeless with a low standard of living often have a negative outlook. In conclusion, the setting significantly affects the cyclist's mindset.
203	6181	3	2	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting due to its drastic changes. The initially flat and wide - open road transformed into “short, rolling hills.” With his water supply running out, it became increasingly difficult for him to muster the willpower and determination to navigate these hills. As he started seeing vast open lands filled with “tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes,” his determination waned. The scorching sun and lack of water made him fear dehydration. To cope, he put pebbles in his mouth to stimulate saliva. In his despair, he even wished to choke on a pebble as he felt utterly useless. In summary, the changing setting severely tested the cyclist's physical and mental endurance.
204	6182	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist encounters numerous hardships on his journey to Yosemite because of the setting. The hot summer day exacerbated his difficulties. With limited water, he was prone to dehydration. As the author states, “I could drop from heat stroke, on a gorgeous day in June” (Kurmaskie, @NUM1), highlighting the danger of the June heat. Moreover, there were few people around, mainly “Old timers who haven’t left the confines of their perches since water was in offing” (Kurmaskie, @NUM2). The narrator doubts the reliability of their directions as they seem out - of - date and incorrect. Overall, the setting made the cyclist's journey to his destination extremely arduous.
205	6183	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist faces multiple difficulties due to the terrain. He was already short on water from the strenuous journey, and then the environment turned against him. As the narration indicates, “I noticed the terrain changing; flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means the cyclist has to expend more energy to climb these hills, energy that he scarcely has. It will nearly deplete his remaining energy. Additionally, the mention of “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path” (Kurmaskie @NUM1) shows that the cyclist is in a desolate area with limited water and energy, further compounding his problems. In conclusion, the setting in the story led to numerous challenges for the cyclist.
206	6184	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting has a significant impact on the cyclist. The cyclist faces challenges such as a shortage of water, the long distance to be covered, and the hilly terrain. The statement “The water bottles contain only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt” indicates that the cyclist is out of water and is exhausted and hot. Clearly, the setting in the story greatly affects the cyclist.
207	6185	3	2	The cyclist encounters difficulties due to the conditions of lack of water, heat, and rough terrain, all of which make the ride more arduous. Firstly, the shortage of water depletes the energy he needs to continue. Secondly, the heat also impacts his journey, making it extremely difficult for him to keep going; he even fears for his life, imagining birds pecking at his dead body. Finally, the terrain does not help either. The route has numerous hills, which consume a great deal of energy and thus make the trip harder. In conclusion, these factors work against the cyclist.
208	6186	3	2	Here, I will explain how the cyclist is affected. One factor is that the heat makes him drink more water, causing him to run out. Another is that some misleading old guys give him wrong directions. Additionally, the long distance and poor terrain slow him down. Lastly, a snake also slows him down. In sum, these are the elements that have a negative impact on the cyclist's journey.
209	6187	3	2	The characteristics of the setting influence the cyclist in multiple ways. He is cycling across an area where there are no cars, no people, no water, and no food. This journey is fraught with danger for him, yet he manages to complete it. In conclusion, the challenging setting presents difficulties but the cyclist overcomes them.
210	6188	3	2	The features of the setting do exert an influence on the cyclist. For instance, the condition of his jar is one such factor that affects him. In conclusion, the setting features, like the jar's condition, have an impact on the cyclist.
211	6189	3	2	The features of the setting can influence a cyclist. For instance, an empty setting might trigger the urge to go faster and unleash one's inner need for speed. However, personally, I believe the setting where one rides a bike is not significant. It might matter to some bicyclists, but in my view, it holds little importance.
212	6190	3	2	The cyclist was significantly affected by the features of the setting. As he cycled, there were no cars, buildings, water, or people in sight. The road transitioned from flat to rolling hills. Despite having no water, he was determined to keep pedaling. When he saw a sign warning of a rough road ahead and to not exceed the posted speed - limit, he was in a dire situation as he had run out of water and was in the middle of nowhere. If I were in his shoes, I'd feel hopeless. All he could see were endless rolling hills. When he spotted a building over the hills, he thought he was saved. But upon reaching it, he found it and others to be abandoned, and he thought he was going to die. In conclusion, the desolate setting greatly affected the cyclist. A setting with cars and buildings on either side might have given him confidence, but that was not the case. Finally, he rounded a bend and said, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.”
213	6191	3	2	There are numerous features of the setting that impact the cyclist. His dehydration began when the sun beat down on him, making him extremely thirsty. His situation worsened when he ran out of water and passed an abandoned Welch's grape - juice factory. He saw a sand - blasted picture of a young boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth and hung his head. When he was almost out of strength, he spotted a bait shop. He said, “Somehow I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” Then, as easily as rounding a bend, his troubles, thirst, and fear were behind him. When he saw “Gary and [CAPS2] Fish camp – If you want bait for the big ones, we're your best bet,” his troubles were resolved.
214	6192	3	2	The features of the setting through which the author cycled have a profound impact on both his mood and physical condition. Firstly, the author is in “the high deserts of California in June,” which implies that the hot weather causes him to sweat while cycling. Subsequently, there is a change in terrain as he approaches “rolling hills,” which are more challenging to bike on. Finally, the author sees a sign reading “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” He becomes discouraged because his bike cannot reach the speed limit, yet he still has to navigate the rough road. After passing this road, he sees a picture of a boy drinking juice on a juice factory. This sight likely intensifies his thirst and leaves him more exhausted and frustrated than before. Clearly, the features of his surroundings play a substantial role in the author's mood change.
215	6193	3	2	The setting features have a substantial impact on the cyclist. The blistering sun is a major factor. The intense heat dehydrates him and nearly causes his demise. The rocky road also takes a toll, consuming his time and energy. The desert setting compounds his problems; there is no one to offer assistance, and no place to obtain water. In conclusion, the setting is a crucial element in this story as it significantly influences the cyclist's experience and well - being.
216	6194	3	2	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting presents significant challenges for the cyclist. The cyclist traversed a desert under extremely humid conditions with no access to water. Along the way, he encountered poisonous snakes and areas devoid of buildings or any form of civilization. These elements of the setting formed the main conflict in the essay. During parts of the journey, the cyclist had no water and lost all hope, believing it was futile. As stated in the story, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die…” The harshness of the setting led the cyclist to lose control, resorting to putting stones in his mouth to distract from his thirst. Overall, the setting had a profound impact on the cyclist, both physically and mentally.
217	6195	3	2	The setting can impact a cyclist in various ways, such as the shape of the road, the need to ride up hills, and the road's roughness. There was a sign that read “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” Had the cyclist not seen this sign, he might have exceeded the speed limit or been unaware of the appropriate speed for cycling, potentially resulting in injury. Since the road was designed for cars, adhering to the speed limit can be challenging for cyclists. In conclusion, the road - related aspects of the setting can pose difficulties for cyclists.
218	6196	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting has a notable impact on the cyclist. The first setting took a toll on him. In this environment, he depleted his water supply in the heat. This made him start to feel dehydrated and fear for his life. The text indicates this when it states “I could drop from heat stroke.” Later, when the cyclist reached an abandoned juice factory, thinking about his thirst made him even more parched and disappointed. The final setting had a positive effect as he finally obtained water and was no longer thirsty. In summary, the different settings throughout the story significantly influenced the cyclist's physical and emotional state.
219	6197	3	2	During that long bike ride, the cyclist was affected by the setting in multiple ways. The lack of water, the heat, and receiving bad directions all took a toll on him. Throughout the journey, the cyclist ran out of water because of the incorrect directions given by some men. As described, “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” The heat in the high deserts of California in June also contributed to his dehydration. The author mentions, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” and anyone who has been to California knows it can be extremely hot. Additionally, the wrong directions from some old men extended the trip. The men gave directions that were accurate in their time, but the land had changed. As the cyclist said, “Because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” Clearly, the setting of a bike ride can either be a great asset or a significant hindrance, as the cyclist in this story experienced.
220	6198	3	2	The setting exerts a multitude of effects on the biker. In June, he is cycling through the high deserts of California. Summers are naturally hot, and desert heat is twice as intense. This causes the biker to dehydrate rapidly, necessitating more water. The only available water source was an old pump, but the water was so hot and tasted so bad that he couldn't drink it. As Kurmaskie put it, “When I tried a drop it had the flavor of battery acid.” The route was deserted, leaving the biker with no one to turn to for help. Moreover, the terrain was difficult. The hills forced the biker to expend more energy, which was crucial for his survival. He even laughed at the thought of dropping from heatstroke. He also came across dangerous animals like the diamond - black rattlesnake. Mentally, the biker was frustrated with himself for following the directions of old men. He realized he should have taken the correct path instead of the abandoned and dangerous shortcut. In conclusion, the setting impacts the biker both physically and mentally.
221	6199	3	2	The setting's features had a significant impact on the cyclist. The sun started to beat down, and the cyclist regularly reached for their water bottles. The environment was hot and dry, severely affecting the cyclist to the point where they were on the verge of collapse. In conclusion, the harsh setting took a heavy toll on the cyclist's well - being.
222	6200	3	2	The cyclist in this story was incredibly brave. During his journey, he faced numerous obstacles, and nature was clearly against him that day. He had to pedal up and down hills multiple times, which quickly exhausted him. The flat road gave way to short rolling hills. After getting through the hills, he encountered a sign that read “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT,” meaning he had to navigate bumpy roads next. Then, tumbleweeds crossed his path, and a huge snake, which looked like a diamondback, blocked most of the pavement in front of him. Thankfully, he managed to pass the snake alive. As he climbed over a long, tiring hill, a building came into view. He thought he'd found a place to get water, but it was an abandoned Welch's grape juice factory and bottling plant. In the end, despite all these challenges, his courage got him through this difficult part of the journey.
223	6201	3	2	The setting has an impact on the cyclist. The heat makes the cyclist thirsty. When the cyclist says “the sun was beating on me,” it indicates that the temperature was high. This heat is one of the reasons for the cyclist's tiredness and dehydration. In conclusion, the hot setting played a significant role in the cyclist's physical state.
224	6202	3	2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist when some old - timers provided him with wrong information about a shortcut he intended to take. As a result, he ran out of water and energy. Doubts crept in, and he considered giving up on the race. In conclusion, the misleading information from the setting's elements put the cyclist in a difficult situation and tested his determination.
225	6203	3	2	In the piece “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting's features influenced the cyclist's emotions in multiple ways. The cyclist experienced black humor, despair, and then relief because of these features. The cyclist felt black humor due to the irony of his situation. He was in a hot desert, desperately in need of a drink, and passed a closed juice factory. This ironic scenario sparked his black - humored reaction. Despair set in as he saw that “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind,” making him feel there was no chance of survival. However, he later felt relief when he reached a bait shop. As the text states, “Then as easily as hobbles, thirst and fear were all behind me.” In conclusion, the features of the setting were the determining factors in the cyclist's emotional journey.
226	6204	3	2	"In the essay ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"" by @PERSON1, various aspects of the setting have an impact on the cyclist. Initially, upon reaching the first ""town"", the cyclist remarked that it might have been a bustling place, perhaps before the last world war. This deserted ghost - town setting, at the start of the day when the cyclist still had an adequate water supply, had a relatively minor effect. However, when he arrived at the ramshackle shed surrounded by several rusty pumps, the impact was more significant. He described the sight as troubling. When he got on his hands and knees to work the pump, the situation hardly improved; only a drop or two of water, tasting like battery acid, came out. Finally, after cycling several miles, he reached an abandoned Welch's Grape juice factory. With a dwindling water supply and a series of disappointments, this setting had a very wearing effect on him. The setting in this essay overall seemed desolate and hopeless, and it was only the cyclist's determination that enabled him to persevere through it."
227	6205	3	2	"The story ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"" follows a cyclist who received incorrect directions to Yosemite National Park. In extreme heat, his water supply is rapidly depleting. Due to dehydration and dizziness, he doubts his ability to complete the journey. Given his current state of physical distress and the lack of proper guidance, it becomes clear that his journey is fraught with challenges. Unless he can find a way to replenish his water supply and regain his strength, reaching Yosemite seems like an uphill battle."
228	6206	3	2	The setting in this story holds significant importance. A story without a setting lacks coherence, as the setting provides a framework that can be created anywhere and with any elements. It serves to piece the entire story together. In this particular story, the setting is @LOCATION1 where the protagonist is spending time with his family. Just as in a movie or video, the setting is a crucial component. Without it, the story would lose its context and fail to engage the audience effectively.
229	6207	3	2	To set the scene for the affected cyclist, I envision him riding through circumstances that one would never expect him to endure. He then overcomes his initial intentions and perseveres. This cyclist is faced with arduous challenges during his ride, but he manages to push through. By riding through these unforeseen difficulties, he shows great resilience. In the end, his ability to overcome his initial mindset and continue on his journey is a testament to his strength and determination.
230	6208	3	2	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead"", the features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. The cyclist begins his journey at a campground, where he engages in conversation with some old - timers. He asks them for directions to Yosemite, and they provide him with a shortcut that turns out to be outdated. As he travels on the road to Yosemite, all he encounters are abandoned towns. Overwhelmed by thirst, he finds no water source anywhere. In his desperation, he even thought he was going to die, stating, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" It was a sweltering summer day, with tumbleweeds and snakes along the road. The hot and dry, desert - like conditions in California made him feel even more parched and hot than he would have in cooler weather with a nearby river. Being in the middle of nowhere, the harsh setting clearly affected the cyclist, making his journey a struggle for survival."
231	6209	3	2	The cyclist had to contend with the terrain. He carried limited water, and there was no visible water source nearby. He simply persevered. He also mentioned the rough road, which affected the time it took him to reach the next water point. Moreover, he was in a desert region where the air was dry and hot. The heat made him sweat, leading to dehydration. In such a situation, his determination to keep going was crucial for his survival.
232	6210	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting significantly impacts the cyclist's confidence and hope. Throughout the narrative, he encounters disheartening sights like towns that were supposed to be thriving turning into “Ghost towns,” and the road changing from flat to hilly. Despite these challenges, he continues. At one point, he thinks he's using his last bit of energy and fears he'll die. However, he manages to press on, hoping to see a building over the next horizon. Clearly, hope saved his life, as if he had given up, he likely would have perished.
233	6211	3	2	The setting features have an impact on the cyclist. One key reason is the hot weather, which increases his water requirement. For instance, the cyclist mentions, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Another example of the intense heat is described as “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This shows how the hot setting directly affects the cyclist's need for water.
234	6212	3	2	In the short story “Rough Road Ahead,” a cyclist embarks on a journey to Yosemite National Park through an extremely harsh setting. After getting directions from two older men, the narrator starts the trip without knowing that the road ahead will be rough. The narrator says, “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” The arduous travel, along with the rocky terrain and dry climate, takes a toll on the cyclist. Apart from finding a general store at the end, the setting offers little relief. As the title suggests, the setting truly presented a “Rough Road Ahead” for the cyclist.
235	6213	3	2	The setting affects the cyclist. If the cyclist were riding in a different location around June, the impact might not have been as severe. However, starting the journey in a hot place with limited water was clearly disadvantageous. This is how the setting influences the cyclist, highlighting the importance of a more favorable environment for such a ride.
236	6214	3	2	The cyclist's situation was exacerbated by the setting. In the heat of California and on a difficult path, cycling while already in a certain condition was extremely challenging. The strenuous hilly trail left the cyclist hot and tired, and the lack of water supply made the situation even worse. The author was severely dehydrated and on the verge of fainting. Had it not been so hot, the cyclist would have been in a much better state. Overall, the combination of the environment and physical exertion took a heavy toll on the cyclist.
237	6215	3	2	The cyclist in the article had a near - death experience due to dehydration and heat stroke in a desert setting. Remarkably, he recounted this misadventure in a light - hearted and humorous way. I find it truly commendable that he could laugh about an incident where he almost died and then blame it on old people. He serves as an inspiration, albeit perhaps an unwise one, for reckless young people. This unique approach to a life - threatening situation shows his distinct personality.
238	6216	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the time and environment significantly affected the cyclist. The story took place on a sweltering, sun - scorching day. When the cyclist ran out of water, he was surrounded by nothing but desert and poisonous snakes. With no water and only the vast desert in sight, his thirst grew intense. Additionally, upon seeing the sign warning of a rough road ahead, the deteriorating road conditions added to his troubles. Towards the end, he reached a peaceful camp with cold water, which replenished him. Clearly, all these elements of the setting had a profound impact on the cyclist throughout his journey.
239	6217	3	2	The setting had a notable impact on the character. As the day grew hotter, the character became increasingly thirsty. Moreover, when he came across the sign indicating rough roads ahead, he started to feel worried and somewhat paranoid. These effects of the setting on the character show how the environment can influence one's physical and mental state during a journey.
240	6218	3	2	Several factors affected the cyclist during his travel. In the old town, there was no potable water, leaving him without a supply and facing thirst. It was mid - June in California, where the intense heat and large expanse of the area quickly wore him out. The steep hills he had to navigate were also a major challenge. As he described, “Over one long, crippling hill,” highlighting the difficulty of these inclines. These features of the journey played a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience.
241	6219	3	2	The essay is set in the California desert in June. All the features of this setting impacted the cyclist, with this particular setting having the most significant effect. In the fifth paragraph, the reader learns that the author was “travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” Given that California, especially its desert areas, is generally very hot, and June is the hottest month of the year, this would have had a profound impact on the cyclist. He cycled over fifty miles through the California desert with a limited water supply. This put him at a high risk of dehydration, which, as he mentions in the last line of paragraph ten, he did experience. The terrain and the extremely hot conditions would have made the cyclist extremely tired and dehydrated, thus making his journey to @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 even more arduous.
242	6220	3	2	The features of the setting had numerous effects on the cyclist. He was in a desert where there was no one to offer him useful information, no nearby functioning towns, it was a hot summer day, and there was no water in the vicinity. These factors caused the cyclist to not sweat, have a dry mouth, lack energy, and he had a great deal of doubt that he would not survive his journey. In the story, the cyclist said, “I picked up some pebbles and put them in my mouth. With my lurch, I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn't really matter. I was going to die.” This statement clearly shows his doubt. Every time he reached a town or building, it was abandoned. He even saw an abandoned Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant, which made his thirst even more intense. In conclusion, these are the ways in which the features of the setting affected the cyclist.
243	6221	3	2	The setting in the story had a substantial impact on the cyclist. The primary setting was that he was cycling in the desert. The desert's high temperature meant that he required more water than he would have if he were cycling in the woods or in snowy conditions. Additionally, there were hills on his route, and cycling uphill consumed more energy, which again increased his water needs compared to cycling on a flat road. Finally, due to the terrain, he encountered a snake, which could have harmed him. In conclusion, because the story was set in the desert, the cyclist was affected more than he had anticipated.
244	6222	3	2	This paragraph will explain some features of the setting that affected the cyclist. One such feature was the uneven, bumpy roads he was cycling on. If the roads were flat, he wouldn't have to be as vigilant. With bumpy roads, he had to watch out for rocks and holes. Another feature was the hills. He had to exert more energy than he would have on flat terrain. In conclusion, these are the reasons that explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.
245	6223	3	2	Some features of the setting influenced the cyclist on his journey to Yosemite. At the start, a man who hadn't noticed the changes in the world for about a decade gave the cyclist bad advice. If the cyclist hadn't received the shortcut information, he wouldn't have found himself without water in abandoned towns. When the cyclist reached some rusty pumps, he checked to see if there was water. The water was unpalatable and tasted like battery acid. Despite running out of water, the cyclist decided to continue. When he encountered a snake on the road, he had to overcome his “dehydrated state,” which would have been dangerous if he couldn't focus on the road. He then came across @ORGANIZATION1, which was derelict and abandoned. Obviously, he couldn't get any water there due to the building's poor condition. Since the cyclist had no water, he became dehydrated, and unfortunately, there were no water stops on his journey to Yosemite that day. In conclusion, these setting - related features made his journey extremely challenging.
246	6224	3	2	The features of the setting significantly impact the cyclist. The road resembled a chaotic maze, and the cyclist's lack of knowledge about his destination compounded his difficulties. Additionally, his insufficient water supply added to his distress. This is how the setting's features affect the cyclist.
247	6225	3	2	The cyclist's journey was greatly influenced by his surroundings. As the conditions of his setting deteriorated, so did his personal state. For instance, when he reached the ghost - town, he merely laughed. At the fork in the road, the diminishing signs of civilization worried him, and he remarked, “This sight is troubling.” Continuing on, the “Rough Road Ahead” sign further discouraged him. As his dehydration worsened, his situation became more dire. The climate in the story also grew increasingly difficult. Initially, the flat land was easy to cycle on, but as the terrain became more challenging, the cyclist grew more wary and delirious. However, he knew he had to persevere. Clearly, the area in which the cyclist found himself had a profound emotional impact on him.
248	6226	3	2	The features of the setting place the cyclist in a near - death situation. He exclaimed, “Sometimes life can be so cruel,” as he was running out of water, strength, and patience. A snake, which “really did look like a diamondback,” posed a lethal threat. In the desert, where anything could happen, the presence of unhelpful old men and the intense heat also endangered the cyclist. If the setting were different, the cyclist's situation would have been far better. Overall, the setting had a life - threatening effect on the cyclist.
249	6227	3	2	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by “@PERSON1”, the cyclist's main problem is dehydration, and the cause is the California terrain. California has long deserts where the temperature can exceed @NUM1 degrees in summer. Since the cyclist was expending a lot of energy, dehydration was bound to occur. In the story, the cyclist said, “I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June,” which clearly shows that the setting is a significant hazard.
250	6228	3	2	The features of the setting have a severe impact on the cyclist. They make him contemplate the possibility of an early death and present numerous challenges. The setting is in the deserts of California in early summer. There are no people, establishments, or towns. A highly dangerous aspect is the desert environment in summer; for example, the author mentions a town that “might have been a thriving little spot at one time - sat, before the last world war.” As the cyclist runs out of water, he feels a sense of hopelessness but also gains the determination to survive. He stated, “I was going to lie… slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” The author manages to reach a fishing camp and survive. He learns not to trust old people who recall the setting as it was decades ago because the current setting is lifeless and deserted. In conclusion, the near - fatal experience due to the setting's features teaches the cyclist an important lesson.
251	6229	3	2	The features of the setting had an impact on the cyclist. Since the author was not well - adapted, while riding her bike, she found no place to stop and refill her water bottle. This lack of suitable stopping points due to the setting affected her cycling experience.
252	6230	3	2	The road was deserted. There was not a building, car, or house in sight. He was stranded in the middle of nowhere, without any water or food. The presence of poisonous snakes and the intense heat put him at risk of collapsing. In such a dire situation, his well - being was seriously threatened.
253	6231	3	2	A cyclist on her trip in June through the high deserts of California (Kurmaskie) encounters many discouraging features. Deserts are extremely hot and dry, especially in June. Additionally, she has to deal with hills while cycling in the sweltering heat. Despite these perilous obstacles, she reaches a camp. As she said, “I could see the horizon, telling myself that I could make it that far, I'd be fine.” (Kurmaskie) This shows her dedication and that perseverance can lead to success.
254	6232	3	2	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the setting is a crucial factor. The author describes the path the cyclist follows and details of each place he stops, like “one ramshackle shed… and a corral that couldn't hold the lamest mule…” and “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite…” The rapidly changing setting is of great significance. If the author didn't emphasize the areas the cyclist passed by, the story would likely be of lower quality and less worth reading, which highlights the author's writing skill.
255	6233	3	2	The cyclist faced a harsh setting. The weather was so intense that it was difficult to cycle vigorously throughout the day. Such a challenging environment made the cyclist's journey a strenuous one, and it was clear that the setting posed a significant obstacle to the cycling activity.
256	6234	3	2	The setting features have an impact on cyclists. If a male cyclist is riding, he has to be concerned about falling off the bike or running out of water. Maintaining a fast pace without water can lead to dehydration. In the essay, the cyclist ran out of water and thought he was going to die due to dehydration. Fortunately, he found a place to get something to drink. This shows that the setting can pose real risks to cyclists and their well - being.
257	6235	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the man's bike ride turns quite challenging. After taking the old men's advice on a shortcut, what was initially an enjoyable ride became a difficult and perhaps arduous journey. This incident in the story demonstrates how following advice without full knowledge can change the course of an experience.
258	6236	3	2	The cyclist in the essay experiences different effects based on the changing setting. At the start, he is well - aware of his location and is excited about his bike ride, eager to complete it. However, upon reaching a “ghost town”, doubts start to creep into his mind regarding the advice given by the old men. This deserted place has no water, and his spirits begin to sink. When he passes the Grape juice factory, he believes it's the end for him. But his hope and enjoyment are restored after he spots the sign for the bait. Clearly, the cyclist's feelings and attitude are highly influenced by the setting, which changes frequently.
259	6237	3	2	The setting features significantly influence the cyclist. Initially, when he sees the tall pines and the river, he is calm and relaxed. But the sight of the abandoned “@PERSON1’s Grape Juice” factory makes him desperate, and he fears dying in the desert. A man travels to @ORGANIZATION1, meets “old timers” who offer him a “shortcut” to the park. He takes this shortcut on his bike. As he travels, he runs out of water and starts to think he will die in the desert. The quote “It din’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” reflects his desperation in the water - less desert in the middle of June. This clearly shows how the setting can push a cyclist to the brink of despair.
260	6238	3	2	The features of the setting can have either a positive or negative impact on the cyclist, depending on the circumstances. For instance, the cyclist could fall during the ride. In such a situation, having a traveling first - aid kit becomes crucial. Whether the setting is favorable or not, being prepared for potential mishaps is essential for cyclists to ensure their safety.
261	6239	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's “Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting is a crucial element. Kurmaskie encountered a harsh environment characterized by high temperatures, limited water supply, and the presence of wild animals. High temperatures combined with an inadequate water supply can result in heatstroke, hyperthermia, dehydration, and even death. It is essential to always have sufficient food and water to sustain oneself in situations such as getting lost. Dealing with wildlife can also pose an obstacle. Since one can never predict how an animal will react to one's presence, it is necessary to exercise the utmost caution around non - domesticated animals. In conclusion, the scenery and setting of a story can significantly impact its level of interest and informativeness. For example, if Kurmaskie had traveled through a flat small town in @LOCATION1 with favorable weather and an abundance of food and water, the story would not have been as engaging.
262	6240	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting have a substantial impact on the cyclist. The setting influences the speed, intensity, and duration of the cyclist's pedaling. For instance, when the cyclist saw the sign “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” he was traveling at 12 mph while the speed limit was 55 mph. This sign made the cyclist start to lose hope, but he persevered. Moreover, it's not just the terrain that adds pressure; the sun's heat also takes a toll. The cyclist mentioned the growing realization that he could drop from heatstroke, indicating that the heat affected both his health and perseverance. Overall, the setting places both mental and physical strains on the cyclist.
263	6241	3	2	This story serves as a powerful motivation for older men, demonstrating that they can maintain good health and regain the vitality of their teenage years. It showcases the great effort the protagonist put into achieving his goal and how he managed to persevere. He pedaled forty miles just to drink the same water as the cyclist, which makes for an interesting and inspiring tale. In conclusion, this story shows that regardless of age, with determination, one can overcome challenges and experience a sense of rejuvenation.
264	6242	3	2	The condition of the environment has an impact on cyclists as it determines their pace and the maximum speed at which they can travel. The nature of the surroundings, such as the terrain, weather, and road conditions, all play a role in how fast and how long a cyclist can pedal. In conclusion, the condition is a significant factor that directly affects a cyclist's journey.
265	6243	3	2	The features of the setting had a profound impact on the cyclist. In June, the cyclist was in California, a desert area with extremely high temperatures. These conditions increased the risk of dehydration. In paragraph ten, it is described how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and a large snake made it difficult for the cyclist to maintain balance, especially without water. Additionally, the sight of a building with a poster of a child drinking juice made the cyclist think about water and become extremely thirsty. However, the setting also had some positive effects. The pebbles allowed the cyclist to keep his mouth moist and temporarily distract him from his thirst. The bait shop provided him with an option to get something to drink, thus preventing him from dying of dehydration. In conclusion, the setting presented both challenges and some small advantages for the cyclist during his journey.
266	6244	3	2	The setting's features significantly impact the cyclist. Firstly, the weather condition plays a crucial role. With the intense heat outside, the cyclist lacks an adequate water supply. Secondly, the conditions alongside the road, such as tumbleweeds and snakes, pose challenges. Given the likelihood of a drought in the desert, the cyclist becomes severely dehydrated. These factors clearly affect the cyclist, as they comprehensively account for the difficulties faced during the journey.
267	6245	3	2	"The setting features have a notable impact on the cyclist. The lack of cool water is a major issue. Without it, the cyclist cannot replenish energy and tires out faster. Even when water is found, it is hot, as described by the cyclist as ""brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees"", indicating the high - temperature water in the ""high desert of June"". Pumping the well for minutes doesn't cool the water because the hot desert has heated everything above and below ground. Liquids, which heat and cool faster than solids, are hot in this setting. Additionally, the rough road makes travel difficult. The cyclist's mention of ""large highway signs dumped out at me. It read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT"" shows that speed is restricted. Overall, these setting features create significant obstacles for the cyclist."
268	6246	3	2	"The cyclist is suffering from dehydration. After traveling a long distance without water, he realizes that ""the old men would have been right, had he been riding"" before the last world war. Every ""town"" he enters is a desolate, abandoned part of the desert. He remarks, ""It was a sad, hopeless, laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself."" He is becoming increasingly dehydrated but is not ready to give up. Although ""hope was fading"", after climbing a large hill, he regains hope upon seeing ""Gary and Wilber’s fish camp"". He stumbles into the modern - looking bathroom and drinks from the sink, becoming safe. He is now prepared to continue riding and avoid those who haven't left their front porches in years, having overcome a dangerous situation."
269	6247	3	2	"In ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the harsh setting makes the journey more difficult for the cyclist. The hot June weather causes the cyclist to slow down. The statement ""wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June"" demonstrates the impact of summer heat. Another factor is the inconsistent pavement. The description ""Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills"" shows that the road conditions also contribute to the cyclist's slowdown. Despite these challenges, if the cyclist remains positive, he can reach ""Yosemite""."
270	6248	3	2	The setting features affect the cyclist in multiple ways. The extreme heat in the deserts of California makes the cyclist sweat profusely and rapidly consume the water in his bottles. When the cyclist spots a building, he hopes to rest and perhaps get a ride to his destination. However, he discovers that the building has been abandoned for years, preventing him from taking a break. These aspects of the setting, the heat and the unavailability of shelter, have a direct and significant impact on the cyclist's journey.
271	6249	3	2	The cyclist's journey was significantly affected by several aspects of the setting. The time of year, being summer, was the hottest period, and traveling through the deserts exacerbated the heat. As the cyclist himself stated, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Had he traveled at a different time, such as @DATE2, he would have likely been more comfortable. Throughout the trip, the cyclist encountered a lack of civilization, coming across a deserted factory and miles of uninhabited land. The desert terrain also meant that water was scarce, and he struggled to find a water source, which made the journey extremely difficult and discouraging. He even despaired, saying, “I was going to die.” As he continued, the land became more challenging to traverse, with flat roads being replaced by short, rolling hills. These characteristics of the setting all combined to make the cyclist's journey arduous.
272	6250	3	2	The cyclist's surroundings had an impact on his journey. In paragraph two, he described enjoying the serenity of an early - summer evening, which initially gave him the assurance that everything would be fine. The beautiful weather and his knowledge of a shortcut boosted his confidence. In paragraph @NUM1, some old men looked at his map and pointed out “this breezy jaunt,” making the cyclist think his life was about to get easier. However, in paragraph @NUM2, he came upon what he described as the “traditional definition of a ghost town,” which was nothing like what the old men had mentioned. In paragraph @NUM3, “Twenty miles up the road, i came to a fork of sorts,” causing confusion and worry. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June, constantly “hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” due to the heat, which he described as “two hundred degrees,” making him uncomfortable. The changing terrain also caused him to become puzzled and distraught. As he said, “I notices the terrain changing,” indicating that the settings likely caused confusion. Despite these challenges, the cyclist ultimately succeeded in his journey.
273	6251	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. The cyclist finds himself in a desert with no water, and the town he is trying to reach is farther than he anticipates. His despair is evident when he says, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean,” which shows that he had little confidence in this desolate part of his journey. Overall, the harsh desert setting and the long - awaited town made the cyclist's experience extremely challenging.
274	6252	3	2	The features of the setting can have an impact on the cyclist, particularly in terms of road conditions. The road may be damaged or have numerous hills. As an example, on page @NUM1, the cyclist remarks, “with any luck Iíd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat,” which indicates that the road conditions could be dangerous. In conclusion, the state of the road can greatly affect the cyclist's journey.
275	6253	3	2	When the cyclist resumed his journey on the road, he started with plenty of water, strong legs, and was enjoying the sunny and warm day. However, as the day grew hotter and the terrain became more desert - like, his confidence began to wane. As he continued riding, his water supply diminished, and he started to believe he would die. He described the terrain, saying, “i toiled on at some point, tumbleweeds crossed any path,” suggesting that he was struggling to keep going without water and having no idea where he was. When he was almost certain he would die, he said, “i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean,” clearly showing that the intense heat and unbearable terrain had made him lose all confidence. The terrible setting around him not only sapped his strength but also started to affect his sanity. In the end, the adverse setting took a heavy toll on the cyclist.
276	6254	3	2	When the cyclist begins his journey, the pleasant and calming setting makes him bright and happy. The peaceful pace gives him a sense that everything is right. As he says, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” After cycling about @NUM1 miles in the cold, his energy wanes, and he reaches his second significant location. Here, he starts to feel a bit disturbed and worried as he realizes he needs to find water. He remarks, “This site was trebling.” When he spots a water - plant, his hopes rise slightly, but they are quickly dashed when he finds the water is bad. He describes it as “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brickish water feeling some which is in the neighborhood of two hundred trees.” He then continues his journey and finally reaches a place where he can get his life back on track. He is extremely relieved and can't believe his luck, saying, “Then as easily as rounding a body my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me.” Clearly, the setting has a profound impact on the cyclist's mood; he feels as the setting looks.
277	6255	3	2	The features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. One major factor is the intense heat, which leaves him without any remaining water. Additionally, the presence of numerous almost - buildings and ghost towns gives him a glimmer of hope that he will be able to obtain water. Overall, the setting's characteristics greatly influence the cyclist's situation and his expectations regarding water availability.
278	6256	3	2	Nearly all of the cyclist's surroundings are old and barren, with a hot @CAPS1 - like climate. The road conditions are poor for cycling, as “Flat Road was replaced by short rolling hills.” As a result, his ride is extremely rough and tiring. The combination of the desolate surroundings and the difficult road makes for a challenging cycling experience.
279	6257	3	2	The features of the setting influence the cyclist's confidence in his destination and the means of getting there. The lack of water is a crucial factor that affects his state of mind. Without water, his ability to continue the journey with confidence is severely hampered. In conclusion, the setting, especially the absence of water, plays a vital role in determining the cyclist's confidence during his journey.
280	6258	3	2	If the sun had not been so glaring and the road not so treacherous, the author's journey would have been much easier. Moreover, the “devation” (presumably elevation changes) often troubles the author as he has to deal with the challenges of dryness and dehydration. These difficult environmental conditions significantly impede the author's progress and well - being during the journey.
281	6259	3	2	When engaging in cycling or any outdoor sport, the setting is of great significance. In cold conditions, a jacket is necessary; in hot conditions, water is essential. The safety of the setting can be a matter of life and death. For example, a hilly terrain can cause fatigue, and without water, one could face a life - threatening situation. Moreover, whether the location is a city suburb, a small town, a desert, or a highway all have a substantial impact on cycling. In conclusion, cyclists and outdoor sports enthusiasts should always consider the setting to ensure their safety and well - being.
282	6260	3	2	In June, a cyclist was in California. The features of the setting had profound effects on him. Due to the hot weather, he needed a large amount of water and was sweating profusely. If the weather had been cooler, his water requirement would have been much lower. Additionally, the absence of buildings and cars meant there was no one around to offer assistance. As the cyclist put it, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structures of any kind.” Clearly, the features of the setting can significantly influence a cyclist's experience and safety.
283	6261	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist. The cyclist is cycling “through the high deserts of California in June,” as stated by Kurmaskie. This setting causes the cyclist to dehydrate more quickly. The cyclist, who is also the author, becomes dehydrated before reaching the next town, as evidenced by him “gathering up a few pebbles and sticking them in [his] mouth.” In summary, the setting in this essay plays a crucial role in the cyclist's experience.
284	6262	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's essay “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the surrounding setting had a significant impact on the cyclist. In early summer, the cyclist was outside Lodi, California. Taking advice from some old men led him into difficult situations. As the sun beat down and his water supply dwindled, reaching Yosemite became extremely challenging. Traveling through the high deserts of California in June, when the terrain changed from flat roads to rolling hills, the cyclist pushed himself harder. The sun and hot air dehydrated him rapidly. After crossing a “along, crippling hill,” he stopped and even tried sucking on a pebble to distract from his thirst. When he found an inhabited store, he was exhausted but relieved. The weather dehydrated him and the terrain exhausted him, clearly showing that the features of the setting had a major effect on the cyclist.
285	6263	3	2	I believe the settings in the essay affected the cyclist both mentally and physically. Cycling through the desert in June made his water supply run out quickly. If he had been riding at a different time, say @DATE1, his water would have lasted longer and he would have had more energy. The abandoned town the old men told him about forced him to keep going despite his weakening state. What affected him most, in my opinion, was reaching the bait store. If it had been abandoned like other places, he would have died. Fortunately, it wasn't, and he could drink water. The picture of the boy in the factory haunted him mentally as the boy was drinking juice, something the cyclist couldn't do. Having fainted from dehydration myself, I know the stages well: first, a headache; then, a dry mouth and desperation; finally, dizziness. In conclusion, the conditions the cyclist endured had a huge impact on him.
286	6264	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting significantly influences the cyclist's physical and mental state, with both positive and negative effects. Physically, the effects of the setting are evident throughout the narrative. For instance, when the cyclist reaches @PERSON2 and @PERSON1’s Fish Camp, he can re - hydrate, which restores his health and safety. Mentally, the setting also has a substantial impact. When the cyclist is in the comfortable camp in @LOCATION1, he feels happy, which prepares him for the trip to Yosemite. However, when he encounters “Ramshackle @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral,” the limited available water troubles him. Cycling in the dry, arid terrain makes him feel “sad” and “hopeless,” putting him in the worst mental state. But upon seeing the fish camp, he feels relieved, and the positive effect of the setting changes his mental state from negative to positive. Overall, the setting is the primary factor determining the cyclist's physical and mental states, having nearly equal positive and negative impacts in the story.
287	6265	3	2	The setting made the cyclist experience loneliness. Since the cyclist saw no people or water on the way, hope quickly faded. The cyclist described seeing a “ghost town.” Before reaching the fish camp, the cyclist was alone and becoming dehydrated. This led to a loss of hope, and at times, the cyclist thought they were going to die, as evidenced by the statement “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Clearly, the setting had a highly negative impact on the cyclist.
288	6266	3	2	The cyclist embarked on a journey through a forest. The features of this forest setting presented a bumpy and long - drawn - out trip filled with numerous troubles. Despite the challenges, the cyclist persevered and managed to complete the journey, emerging with a story to share. In conclusion, the forest setting, with its difficulties, tested the cyclist but also became the backdrop for an eventful adventure.
289	6267	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting has an impact on the cyclist's physical and emotional state. At the start of the essay, the cyclist “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on [his] face.” The morning was not overly hot, so the cyclist was happy, strong, and confident that he could overcome any obstacle. As the day progressed, “the sun was beginning to beat down.” Although the cyclist was drinking a lot of water, he remained confident and strong. However, when he came across “a ramshackle shed [and] several rusty pumps,” the sight troubled him. Traveling in the hot deserts of California, the cyclist grew tired and thirsty, having to conserve water. What began as a confident ride into the desert turned into a survival ride. Once the cyclist found water, he felt relieved, more confident, and was able to continue to his destination. Just as in the essay, the weather and setting can affect us both physically and emotionally, as the cyclist became physically and emotionally exhausted as the hot, sunny day wore on.
290	6268	3	2	At the start of the journey, the cyclist was confident and excited after receiving new directions from some “old wise men” that promised a shortcut. With a mediocre water supply, the cyclist set off with determination against the flat and hilly terrain. However, he soon realized that the directions were inaccurate. While on his way to Yosemite, the cyclist came across what he thought was a town, but it was more of a ghostly place. As he continued, hoping the shortcut would materialize, he found himself alone in the hot desert with a dwindling water supply and a fading spirit. He was remorseful for following the advice of the old men. Through his pain and despair, he decided never to listen to such people again. By rationing water and mentally focusing on each hill one at a time, the cyclist endured physical, emotional, and mental trials. In the end, he learned a valuable lesson: never consult old “codgers” on mapping issues, as their information is likely to be outdated.
291	6269	3	2	The reason the setting affected the cyclist is that the hotter it got, the more water he drank. Additionally, the farther he traveled, the more tired he became. This tiredness made him hotter, which in turn caused him to drink more of his water.
292	6270	3	2	"The features of the setting significantly impacted the cyclist during his determined ride. Initially, he seemed relaxed, chatting about the cool pines and rushing rivers he'd encounter upon reaching Yosemite. After a grueling ride, he began to feel nervous and wondered if he'd even survive. He was running out of water and thought he saw a diamondback. When he reached the rolling hills, he noticed a posted speed - limit sign stating not to exceed 55 m.p.h., while he was only going at a water - depleting 12 m.p.h., constantly worrying about his survival. At the end of the rolling hills, he came across an old Welch's grape factory and lamented how cruel his life was. After that, he resolved to survive and reach his destination. He spotted some landmarks on the horizon and rode towards them, making his way across the desert. Finally, he arrived at ""Only and Wilbers fish camp"", where he knew he was safe and would survive."
293	6271	3	2	"The hot, dry, and barren setting had a great impact on the cyclist. A barren area is hot, dry, and abandoned. The cyclist was attempting to bike to Yosemite National Park. He made a mistake by following the directions of a couple of old men. As Kurmaskie said, ""Simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades."" The hot and dry conditions made staying hydrated the cyclist's most difficult obstacle."
294	6272	3	2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in multiple ways. One factor was related to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The cyclist's limited water supply also had an impact. He listened to the old men and thus traveled a considerable distance, which worsened the situation. With a lack of water and a long way to go, the cyclist stuck pebbles in his mouth to try and forget his thirst. He even thought about dying and being picked clean by birds due to the fear of dying from dehydration. The road conditions added to the difficulty; he started on straight roads and then had to go up and down hills. In conclusion, the cyclist faced numerous obstacles that made his trip more challenging than he had anticipated.
295	6273	3	2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. The setting had few hills and no water. For instance, in the story, he mentioned it was a hilly area, and there were no buildings; he was all alone, which made him scared. The setting, with its hot, dry climate, lack of water, no buildings, and no people to ask for directions, made the cyclist scared, lost, and fearful of what might happen to him.
296	6274	3	2	"During the cyclist's journey, he encountered numerous challenges. Mainly, he faced issues with drivers and ran out of water. The essay describes how he reached the first town in search of water. It stated, ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time - say, before the last world war."" This situation affected the cyclist as he was running out of water. Another aspect of the setting that impacted the cyclist was the occurrence of heatstrokes, along with the absence of any cars or buildings throughout the journey. Overall, these factors significantly hindered the cyclist's progress."
297	6275	3	2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist due to the poor road conditions, the absence of shade, the presence of deserts, and his limited remaining energy supply. These factors combined to make the cyclist's journey extremely difficult. In conclusion, the challenging setting had a substantial negative impact on the cyclist's ability to continue his ride.
298	6276	3	2	A long bike ride through the city is already grueling, but the author of this story endured an even tougher experience. Firstly, the climate was a major problem. The “high deserts of California in June,” along with direct sunlight and humidity, were clearly debilitating factors. If the cyclist didn't have the appropriate gear, these three elements could cause harm. Secondly, the flat road changed to short, rolling hills, which tested the cyclist's endurance as climbing each hill required energy and will - power. Most importantly, with the lack of water in his bottles, all these conditions were extremely harmful. In the desert, water is scarce. In hot weather, water in the bottles turns warm, and in sunlight, it can even evaporate. In my opinion, the setting and the weather were a combination that did far more harm than good.
299	6277	3	2	Two features affect the cyclist. One is the lack of water, which causes him to slow down. The other is the directions given by the old men, which are likely outdated. These factors make the cyclist's journey more difficult. In conclusion, the lack of water and unreliable directions are significant obstacles for the cyclist.
300	6278	3	2	The setting depicts an early - summer evening with some eccentric men. The cyclist is likely to be in a lively mood. As Kurmaskie says, “Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice…” A lively mood in this context can be seen as a state where one acts without full awareness, similar to being influenced without realizing it, as if being “drunk without being drunk.” This shows that the lively mood and the advice from the eccentric men led the cyclist to act in a somewhat unthinking manner. In conclusion, the setting and the cyclist's mood influenced his decision - making.
301	6279	3	2	The setting presents the cyclist with numerous difficult problems and tough hazards. The sweltering heat alone is a significant challenge, but cycling through a desert with limited water supplies is truly miserable. The intense warmth of the desert takes a toll on the cyclist, leading to fatigue. This fatigue, in turn, delays the cyclist from reaching the destination more quickly. Moreover, the cyclist has to contend not only with harsh weather but also hazardous conditions. There were instances when tumbleweeds crossed the path, and a ridiculously large snake appeared. These obstacles caused delays as the cyclist had to take time to cycle around them. Clearly, this was a difficult journey that had a substantial impact on the cyclist.
302	6280	3	2	The features surrounding the cyclist have a profound effect on him. All that surrounds him are hills, rough terrain, sand, and tumbleweeds. These desolate features make him feel as if he is on the verge of death, as there is no sign of life in the area. The arid, vivid landscape mirrors his inner feelings. The old, rusty water pump indicates that it has not been used for a long time, and the black tar pumped out does nothing to alleviate his negative view of life. In such a desolate setting, the cyclist's state of mind is deeply affected, highlighting the power of the environment to influence one's perception and emotions.
303	6281	3	2	The features of the setting impact the cyclist in multiple ways, including temperature, surroundings, and water availability. The cyclist experiences tiredness and exhaustion due to the temperature and terrain. For example, when traveling through the high deserts of California in June, the searing heat beating down on him while cycling on the roads would surely lead to fatigue. I can well - imagine that I would also feel worn - out in such a situation. The surroundings during the ride also have a negative impact on the cyclist's confidence. As described, a place that might have been bustling before the last world war now fit the definition of a ghost town. This information makes the cyclist unsure of his direction. In his shoes, I would also feel incompetent. Additionally, the lack of water makes the cyclist scared. His statement about conserving water and relying on his inner spirit shows that he perceives the situation as unfavorable. Overall, the setting has a far - reaching impact on the cyclist.
304	6282	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author uses the features of the setting to illustrate the struggles of the cyclist. The cyclist gets directions from two old men on a perch. The statement “Never accept braid advice from a collection of old - timers who haven’t let be able centres of their porch since Carter was in office” implies that the old men might be wrong, as places can change over time. On the shortcut, the cyclist almost runs out of water. His decision to conserve water and rely on his inner spirit for an hour or so shows his determination in the face of a water shortage. The terrain also poses a challenge. The hills, especially with a limited water supply, are difficult to navigate. The mention of flat roads being replaced by rolling hills demonstrates the cyclist's extreme determination. Despite the added struggle from the hills, the cyclist manages to make it through. Thus, the author effectively uses the setting features to enhance the portrayal of the cyclist's struggle.
305	6283	3	2	The features of the setting influenced the cyclist because the people in that setting believed that due to their advanced age, having witnessed various events and gone through similar situations, they were well - experienced. They thought they knew more about what was happening and expected others, including the cyclist, to listen to them. This perception of the locals based on their self - perceived experience affected the cyclist's journey, as their advice and the overall setting's characteristics interacted to shape the cyclist's experience.
306	6284	3	2	After conversing with the elderly individuals who hadn't left their porches since Carter was in office, the cyclist's confidence in them started to wane. He entered the desert in a state of happiness, hope, and determination. As his water supply began to diminish and he neared the old shed, canal, and a couple of water pumps, he felt a sense of emotion. He attempted to obtain water from the pumps, and the water was hot and tasted like battery acid. As he continued riding, his confidence further diminished. He traversed the desert and encountered a ridiculously large snake while running low on water. Finally, he spotted a building in the distance, which, ironically, turned out to be an abandoned juice factory. A sign featuring a figure sipping on some succulent icy liquid taunted him amidst the ruin, and he began to lose hope. He didn't believe he would reach his destination or anywhere else. However, after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy were restored.
307	6285	3	2	"The features of the setting had several effects on the cyclist. The rough road did not allow him to arrive as quickly, as he was driving at a certain speed on a specified speed - limit road. Additionally, since he was cycling through a desert, a large snake appeared on the road. He had to ""ease past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" Moreover, the desert heat made him extremely hot and caused dehydration due to lack of water. Lastly, the absence of buildings for miles left him lost and without a place to stop and ask for directions. These features clearly affected the cyclist during his journey."
308	6286	3	2	"The features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist's difficult journey to Yosemite. The old - timers at the reservoir campground, though old, were not very wise. The cyclist followed their advice and took a ""shortcut"" that was supposed to save hours on his ride to Yosemite National Park, but it almost cost him his life. The sun's warming effect on the cyclist led to dehydration. He was traveling through the high deserts of California in June and had been regularly consuming water from his bottles, indicating the intense heat of the climate. A lack of water posed major risks such as heatstroke and dehydration, both of which could be fatal. The cyclist felt that without enough water to keep him cool, he was on the verge of death. Overall, these factors made his journey to Yosemite extremely challenging."
309	6287	3	2	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting frequently influences the character. When the cyclist reached a desolate place with only ""one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule,"" he was clearly confused. The high temperature in the high deserts of California in June made the water in his bottle hot, as he had been regularly drinking from his water bottles. Also, when the terrain changed and the road was replaced by short, rolling hills, the biker had to exert more effort and use more energy. All these conditions made it more difficult for the cyclist to reach his destination."
310	6288	3	2	"In ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist. He was traveling through the high deserts, which is always a perilous situation. Despite regularly drinking water, the rising temperature took its toll. He struggled to keep his balance in a dehydrated state because the terrain had turned his water into a far - like substance. The harsh setting of the story presented numerous challenges to the cyclist, making his journey arduous."
311	6289	3	2	The conditions and characteristics of the desert - like land have a significant impact on the cyclist. The cyclist is required to conserve water while maintaining proper hydration to avoid dehydration. The desert's features are harsh; it is dry and uneven, and there are also creatures like snakes lurking. Given their unpredictable nature, it is impossible to anticipate their actions. This combination of difficult conditions and unpredictable elements makes the cyclist's journey extremely challenging.
312	6290	3	2	The setting in the story has numerous effects on the cyclist. When the cyclist reached the first town, the water tasted like battery - acid, which led him to conserve water. Additionally, harsh conditions such as high temperatures presented challenges. To reach his destination more quickly, the cyclist would listen to the advice of the local old people. Overall, the features of the setting influenced the cyclist's actions and decision - making throughout his journey.
313	6291	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. The dryness of the land is a significant factor. The cyclist pedaled for an extended period, becoming dehydrated. With no water in sight for an unknown duration, he doubted his ability to continue. The heat is another crucial feature. The sun's intense heat made him feel as if he was on the verge of a heat - stroke, almost making him give up. In conclusion, the features of the setting clearly had a substantial and detrimental impact on the cyclist's experience.
314	6292	3	2	"During the cyclist's trip, he endured both physical and mental stress. The intense heat, rough terrain, presence of animals, and his isolation all contributed to this stress as he tackled his challenging task. His isolation on the ""shortcut"" was a major factor. As @PERSON1 said, ""there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or any structure."" With no one around to help and no shelter from the heat, @PERSON1 could only focus on finishing the task. The heat was a predominant cause of physical strain. It made the cyclist dangerously thirsty, forcing him to find water quickly. Kurmaskie's statement, ""the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke,"" shows that the high temperature was life - threatening. The rough terrain and the encounter with a snake on the road also made the journey more arduous. Avoiding the snake and navigating the dangerous terrain put the cyclist in an even more difficult position. All these factors combined to make the cyclist's trip extremely challenging."
315	6293	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist. Firstly, the cyclist becomes dehydrated due to the heat and lack of water. The text states, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,"" which clearly indicates the cyclist's dehydration, creating an obstacle he must overcome. Another negative impact is the rough road ahead. The sign ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT"" would have been a warning of trouble for the cyclist. Fortunately, the cyclist managed to navigate through these obstacles successfully."
316	6294	3	2	The setting features have a significant impact on cyclists. Climate is one such crucial factor. In extremely hot conditions, cyclists can rapidly dehydrate while cycling. Conversely, in very cold weather, it becomes more difficult to breathe and regain one's breath. Terrain is another important aspect. If there are numerous steep hills, cyclists will tire quickly. Moreover, on rocky terrain, there is a risk of falling off the bike and getting injured. The isolation of the road also affects cyclists. If a cyclist runs out of water and there are no stopping points on the road, it can be life - threatening. Similarly, if a cyclist gets hurt on an isolated road, it may be difficult for anyone to find them. These are the primary setting features that can influence cyclists.
317	6295	3	2	The characteristics of the setting had a detrimental effect on the cyclist, leading to dehydration. The setting was marked by a scorching sun, a lack of trees, and no available water. The cyclist also felt lethargic. In the story, the cyclist stated, “I … and the growing … that I could drop from heat stroke.” The harsh setting clearly took a toll on the cyclist's well - being.
318	6296	3	2	The hot and dry setting had a substantial impact on the cyclist. The cyclist did not have sufficient space to carry an ample amount of water and supplies to make potable drinks. Additionally, following the advice of inexperienced individuals was unhelpful as it led her onto a much more arduous path. Overall, the setting and the misguidance combined to make the cyclist's journey extremely challenging.
319	6297	3	2	The features of the setting influenced the cyclist in multiple ways. Initially, the cyclist set out on a cool, forested road. Despite the route not being easy, this gave the cyclist a false sense of confidence, causing him to start in the wrong direction. Later, when he entered the desert, the cyclist began to suffer from dehydration. The little water he could find tasted extremely unpleasant, like battery acid. These factors provided the cyclist with false hope and almost led to a fatal outcome.
320	6298	3	2	The setting of the story was extremely helpful to the cyclist. Although it was hot while he was riding, the presence of “cool pines and a rushing river” made the ride worthwhile. These elements kept him cool, enabling him to reach the next town to replenish his water supply. Therefore, it is evident that the pines and the river played a vital role in assisting the cyclist during his journey.
321	6299	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the setting's features gradually wear out the cyclist, pushing the limits of his hope and survival skills. Initially, the cyclist enters a deserted town and remains calm and amused, as shown in the statement, ""I chuckled, check my water supply, and moved"". Soon after, a ""ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, through the high deserts of California in June"" troubles him. He becomes agitated, significantly reduces his water supply, and unfortunately continues. When he is still isolated and lost, the cyclist tries to stay hopeful but eventually breaks down. He reflects, ""Telling myself that if I could make it that far, I'd be"". As the cyclist progresses on his journey, the features of the setting increasingly dampen his spirits. In conclusion, the challenging setting in the story severely tests the cyclist's mental and physical capabilities."
322	6300	3	2	"At the start of the cyclist's journey, he is extremely happy and carefree. When he reaches the first deserted town, the setting isn't described as he isn't worried yet. After leaving the town, he barely notices the heat because he is thinking about ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite"". His spirits remain high. When he comes across a water - pump, he starts to get thirsty. However, the pump is non - functional. Until then, the road has been mostly flat and straight. Then, he notices hills on the road. At this point, he has no water and is severely dehydrated. After climbing one hill, he sees an abandoned grape juice factory, which is ironic considering his state. As a last resort, he sucks on rocks and loses hope of survival. But then he comes upon a fish camp, gets water from the bathroom, and all is well. The setting in this story has a profound impact on the cyclist. As the setting changes, so do his moods, his feelings about survival, and his perception of the danger he is in. In conclusion, the dynamic setting is a key factor in shaping the cyclist's journey and emotional state."
323	6301	3	2	"The features of the setting have multiple effects on the cyclist. The statement ""The sun was beginning to beat down"" indicates that the intense sunlight affects how he feels while cycling on the road and can impede his ability to keep cycling. Additionally, when he says ""I was doing a water - depleting 12 mph"", it shows that he was dehydrated and moving very slowly. The heat and lack of water significantly hampered his ability to continue cycling in that area. In conclusion, the setting, with its harsh sunlight and water scarcity, poses a great challenge to the cyclist's cycling ability."
324	6302	3	2	I firmly believe that the cyclist is alone, and in my opinion, the old man should have shot him. I think a long bike ride is rather foolish. Regardless of one's physical condition, embarking on an extremely long bicycle ride is not a wise decision. In conclusion, I find such long - distance cycling endeavors to be ill - advised and potentially dangerous.
325	6303	3	2	The lack of water, hills, and tumbleweeds all impact the cyclist. The hot weather makes the lack of water a pressing issue as the cyclist needs water to stay hydrated. Hills are difficult to pedal up, which also affects his cycling. Tumbleweeds give a distinct desert look. When the cyclist sees them, he tries to maintain balance because he is partially dehydrated and doesn't want to crash. Dehydration due to the lack of water makes him very thirsty, and since everyone needs water to survive, it becomes a major problem. When lacking water and energy, achieving his goal becomes much more difficult. In conclusion, the various elements of the environment in this cycling scenario create significant obstacles for the cyclist.
326	6304	3	2	The setting had a significant impact on the cyclist during his journey. The extremely hot temperature fatigued the cyclist and made him thirsty. Moreover, the high hills made it difficult for him to continue riding. As he was in the desert, there were few towns available. All these factors combined affected the cyclist throughout his journey.
327	6305	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting affects the cyclist in three ways. Firstly, the barren environment offers no shade from the sun beating down on the cyclist's body, contributing to his dehydration and lack of focus. Secondly, the terrain, including rolling hills and the desert, poses challenges. The hills require the cyclist to exert more energy, depleting his water supply, and the intense desert heat makes him doubt his senses as he may see mirages. Lastly, the ghost towns give the cyclist a glimmer of hope for relief, such as finding water and escaping the heat. However, when he passes through them and finds nothing, he is left crestfallen and contemplative of death. In conclusion, the setting significantly impacts the cyclist's journey.
328	6306	3	2	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. In the California desert, it is hot and dry. When cycling in such conditions with poor directions, it becomes extremely challenging. The long - distance ride under the burning sun with little water made the cyclist fear for his life as there was nothing in sight. Overall, the harsh setting put the cyclist in a life - threatening situation.
329	6307	3	2	The features of the setting impact the cyclist in multiple ways. In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist, dehydrated and tired from cycling long distances, had to overcome large, dark hills to reach his destination. The setting can sometimes lead to a loss of hope and the urge to give up. In the story, the cyclist started to lose hope until he found a store selling fishing bait. Additionally, the setting determines the time and route to reach the destination. For instance, encountering a dirt road blocked by a boulder forces one to find an alternative path. In conclusion, the features of the setting have diverse and significant effects on the cyclist.
330	6308	3	2	The setting affects the cyclist as he is in the California desert in June without water. He is cycling on curvy, hilly back roads. Eventually, the cyclist begins to lose water, and his determination is put to the test as he struggles to reach the next town. He remarks, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some old gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades. Caused me to laugh.” This shows how the circumstances are taking a toll on him. The road sign “Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” is ironic since he is already exhausted and about to face a treacherous stretch of road. I've never cycled for long periods, and I can hardly fathom being pushed to such a state of exhaustion. I can relate it to a time when I played @NUM1 soccer games in the summer heat. It was painful, and every time I got the ball, it took all my strength to handle it. In conclusion, the setting's harshness and the cyclist's situation are both relatable and challenging.
331	6309	3	2	In the story, the protagonist is significantly affected by the setting. Running out of water, he has to maneuver around a snake, a task that leaves him tired and dehydrated. The rough terrain causes his muscles to become sore, and the intense sun further exacerbates his dehydration. In the end, the harsh elements of the setting take a toll on his physical condition.
332	6310	3	2	In my view, the setting features in this story have a profound impact on the cyclist. The setting acts like the background and theme of his journey, with most of the story focusing on the background of his route and the sights he encounters. The cyclist shows the reader his desperate need for a destination and his current state of despair. When he says, “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself,” he acknowledges his tiredness and poor physical condition. Yet, he can still find humor in it and remains aware of his predicament. This text showcases multiple ideas, such as hope, awareness, and the courage to recognize the need for help while continuing to strive towards his goal, proving to himself that he can finish what he planned.
333	6311	3	2	The setting features significantly affect the cyclist as he is in a desert. The desert is extremely hot, as indicated in the story where he states it feels around @NUM1 degrees. The cyclist struggles to find cool water. He discovers a water pump, but “a tar - like substance oozes out, followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This clearly shows the high temperature and the difficulty he faces in finding suitable water. In conclusion, the hot desert setting poses a great challenge to the cyclist.
334	6312	3	2	The cyclist embarks on his journey facing many hazards and rigorous features. At the start, he receives advice from old men about a shortcut, which makes him excited, and he drinks his water efficiently. However, he soon gets lost, and the sun begins to beat down on him. He tries to relieve the pressure by thinking about the coolness of @CAPS1. Even the imaginary setting of a fictitious stream has an impact on him. As the sun beats down more intensely, he starts to run out of water and has to be cautious that the water sources he comes across are not mirages. Eventually, when he rounds the bend, he succumbs to his troubles of the road and thirst.
335	6313	3	2	The features of the setting have diverse effects on the cyclist. The rough terrain causes the cyclist to persevere but also makes him weak. For example, the author writes, “looked the majority of the pavement in front of me and ceased past tilling to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,” indicating his dehydration due to the heat and his determination to keep going despite the physical obstacle. Additionally, the harsh terrain makes him feel like giving up, as shown in the text, “it didn’t really matter I was going to die and the birds will pick me clearly waveng only some experience outdoor gears.” Nevertheless, he continues his journey. The text also portrays his exhaustion, with the winds and the desert's humidity and heat contributing to his dehydration. In summary, the setting features have a wide - ranging impact on the cyclist.
336	6314	3	2	The features of the setting significantly impact cyclists. When a cyclist is going downhill and then encounters a rough road, their performance can be severely affected. For instance, if a cyclist starts on flat land, then the terrain changes to hills and finally to a rough road, these conditions can pose a serious risk of injury. In conclusion, the nature of the setting's features can have a detrimental effect on cyclists' safety and performance.
337	6315	3	2	The features of the setting have several effects on the cyclist. When the cyclist came across a ghost town, since there was no one around, they were unable to ask for better directions or obtain food and water. The short rolling hills made pedaling more difficult as it's strenuous to pedal uphill. Towards the end of the story, the cyclist found a bait - shop where they got water and better directions. In summary, the various elements of the setting presented challenges to the cyclist but also led to a solution in the end.
338	6316	3	2	The features of the setting, such as large hills and rough roads, have a notable impact on cycling. As described in the essay, a flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. When the cyclist crested the first few hills, a large highway sign caught their attention, indicating the change in terrain. If one were the cyclist riding up these hills, their legs would likely become tired and sore over time. For example, my friend @PERSON1 and I went bike - riding in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in Fechmisburg. We had to ride up a big hill, and after just a few pedals, our legs started hurting, so we decided to walk up the hill. In conclusion, the hilly and rough nature of the setting can make cycling a difficult task.
339	6317	3	2	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead” affects the cyclist in multiple ways. The cyclist is bicycling through the desert, where the dry and hot conditions are a major problem. The author mentions trying to keep balance in a dehydrated state, showing that the lack of water has a significant impact. The cyclist almost collapsed from thirst. The remoteness of the area is also an issue. The cyclist saw no one, no buildings, cars, or structures. With no place to stop immediately, the cyclist had to keep cycling and using their limited water supply. Additionally, the rough road made traveling arduous. If I were cycling for a long time, I'd prefer a smooth road to conserve energy. Overall, the heat, remoteness, and rough road all made the cyclist's journey challenging.
340	6318	3	2	In the story, the features of the setting have a profound effect on the cyclist. The arid desert climate rapidly depletes the cyclist's water supply, taking a toll on their physical state. Moreover, when every town the old men mentioned turned out to be a ghost town, the cyclist began to worry. Doubts crept into their mind about whether they could survive the “shortcut” suggested by the old men. In conclusion, the desert climate and the non - existent towns in the setting created a sense of uncertainty and physical hardship for the cyclist.
341	6319	3	2	The setting's features impact the cyclist significantly. The presence of various types of hills poses a challenge. The cyclist must be vigilant for rocks in the middle of the road. Given that the environment seems to be a desert, the cyclist has to ensure an ample supply of water. Although there are no cars around, the cyclist still needs to watch out for any sudden appearance of vehicles. There are numerous turns on the route. The high temperature means the cyclist must avoid heatstroke. Moreover, there are no shaded areas to take a break and no stores to obtain water and food. All these aspects constitute the setting that affects the cyclist.
342	6320	3	2	In the story, the problem - ridden conditions often influence the cyclist's mood. For instance, when the sign read, “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” At one point, the cyclist spotted a snake. Being scared, while already dehydrated, he carefully eased past it, struggling to maintain balance. The dry and sweltering climate started to become a major issue for the cyclist, ultimately having a substantial impact on his experience.
343	6321	3	2	The features of the setting have multiple effects on the cyclist. For example, the cyclist might face difficulties if he drinks water with a battery - like taste or fails to obtain an adequate amount of clean water in a timely manner. Cycling over long distances without water or other supplies is extremely energy - consuming. Therefore, it is crucial to plan such trips very wisely to ensure a relatively smooth journey.
344	6322	3	2	In the story, the setting has a profound impact on the cyclist. The cyclist, cycling through California, experiences intense heat on the so - called “beautiful @DATE1.” Running out of water nearly spells disaster for the cyclist. However, the situation gets worse as the hills cause the cyclist to deplete both water and energy at a faster rate. Additionally, there are no places to stop and replenish water. It is fortunate that the cyclist managed to survive the rough terrain of California.
345	6323	3	2	The features of the setting influence the cyclist in numerous ways. If the cyclist were not in the “High deserts of California in June,” dehydration would likely not be a problem. Similarly, if the location did not have “short rolling hills,” the cyclist would have conserved more energy. Evidently, the setting plays a crucial role in affecting the cyclist's state and experience.
346	6324	3	2	Multiple factors affected the cyclist. The lack of water led to a decrease in his speed. Additionally, the presence of hills and the intense sun posed significant challenges, ultimately impeding his progress.
347	6325	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting's features significantly influenced the cyclist. The roads were bumpy, windy, and hilly. As a result, the cyclist needed to consume a large amount of water. When the cyclist reached the so - called town, he found no clean water source. As he put it, “I began to pump the old rusted water pump, but nothing came out except nasty blackish water.” These conditions made the cyclist's journey quite difficult.
348	6326	3	2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a substantial way. Passing through hot neighborhoods and riding on rough roads led to the cyclist becoming dehydrated. This dehydration, combined with the long and uphill cycling, had a negative impact on her journey, making it a challenging experience.
349	6327	3	2	In the story, the cyclist started his ride full of confidence, believing he could complete the entire journey. After leaving the first town, as he rode and felt the need for water, he stopped at a fork in the road to get water from a pump. Unfortunately, the water tasted like battery acid. As he continued his trip, he encountered a sign that read “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit” (Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1). The rough roads and mountains he had to cross were extremely challenging and drained the water from his body. When he finally got over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gas station. Upon arrival, he got some water and directions from a man with an excellent map. Clearly, going over the mountains depleted the cyclist of water, and he was greatly relieved when he finally obtained water at the end.
350	6328	3	2	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting had a tormenting effect on the cyclist. The environment he was in caused him to become dehydrated and exhausted. The cyclist's dehydration was due not only to the lack of water but also to the scorching desert heat. He sweated profusely, losing a large amount of bodily fluids. Moreover, traveling on unpaved roads required more energy than on paved ones. As a result, the cyclist became so exhausted that he was on the verge of death. These are the ways in which the environment affected the cyclist.
351	6329	3	2	The setting's features have a significant impact on the cyclist, evoking feelings of doubt, confidence, determination, and relief. Doubt sets in when the cyclist has scarce water and lacks knowledge of his location and destination. Confidence first emerges when the porch - sitting old people provide directions and is reaffirmed at the end when he decides to follow his map next time. The cyclist shows determination as he aims to reach the next town, which he successfully does. This achievement brings relief and further fuels his desire to reach Yosemite National Park. In conclusion, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's emotional state throughout the journey.
352	6330	3	2	The setting in which the cyclist undertakes his trip influences his perspective. At the start, with a good - condition road, he is confident. As the terrain changes, he expresses that “sometimes life can feel so cruel” and becomes despairing due to the new landscape and limited water. When he spots a building, hope and determination fill him, but this turns to bitterness when he realizes it's an old juice factory. After leaving the factory, he loses all hope, as evident from his statement “somehow i climbed away from the abandoned factory of of juice and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” At the end, when revitalized by water, he comically reflects on the journey. Overall, the cyclist's outlook undergoes significant changes based on the setting during his trip.
353	6331	3	2	California's geographical features and its proximity to Yosemite create a rugged and dangerous terrain for the cyclist. The state's hot climate and its nearness to a desert mean that the cyclist has a much higher need for water compared to cycling in other locations. In the story, the cyclist travels through desert - like conditions with limited water. He mentions that after several hours of riding, the land transformed into “short, rolling hills,” making pedaling difficult and increasing his exertion. The intense sun also contributes to his dehydration. Despite these challenges, the cyclist remains determined, unlike some others who might not have persevered. Additionally, the author's tone in the story shifts from confident to unsure to desperate at different stages of the cyclist's struggle. In conclusion, California's setting presents numerous difficulties for the cyclist but also showcases his resilience.
354	6332	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. They cause him to become tired, thirsty, and he nears exhaustion. The combination of elements in the setting, such as the terrain, climate, or other environmental factors, takes a toll on his physical state. In summary, the setting significantly affects the cyclist's well - being during his journey.
355	6333	3	2	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist follows the advice of older gentlemen who suggest a shortcut to @CAPS1 national park. However, the land has changed since these men were last there. The first town he encounters is a real - life ghost town, and he finds it amusing how long ago the men must have visited. After spending long hours on the hot road with depleted water, despair sets in. Reaching an old and ruined grape juice factory almost makes him lose all hope. Finally, he manages to reach a bait store to get water. He decides that from now on, he will only trust his map and not take advice from others. In conclusion, this experience teaches the cyclist the importance of relying on his own navigational tools.
356	6334	3	2	"The setting's features impact the cyclist by instilling hope in the author. When the cyclist encountered a sign reading ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" hope waned as he was traveling at a water - depleting @NUM1 per hour. Due to the rapid rate of water loss, he felt that life could be cruel and believed he was on the verge of dehydration. Additionally, when he came across tumbleweeds and a large snake, he attempted to avoid them, as a snake bite would have been fatal. Finally, the intense heat put him at risk of heatstroke, as indicated by the ""wide signs of dried"" conditions. In conclusion, the various elements of the setting significantly affected the cyclist's journey."
357	6335	3	2	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" numerous features of the setting pose challenges to the cyclists. The cyclist made a first error by taking advice from foreign old people. After realizing this, considering that he ""had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,"" the combination of water shortage and the June heat in California would have led to heatstroke for most individuals. As the journey progressed, even with these adversities, the text states that ""flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" Not only did he face excessive heat and lack of water, but he also had to deal with troublesome roads. Despite being close to complete exhaustion, the cyclist persevered. Many features in the story's setting affected the cyclist, yet he overcame them with honor."
358	6336	3	2	"The dry, desert - like setting has a significant impact on the cyclist. The intense sun and water loss through sweating put him at high risk of dehydration. As the cyclist states, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" (Rough Road Ahead). Despite being severely dehydrated, his determination drove him forward. The terrain transitioned from flat to short rolling hills. The road and the town he passed through in search of water were abandoned. He further mentions, ""I toiled on, at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake - it really did look like a diamond back - blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me"" (Rough Road Ahead). The desert - like setting, characterized by dryness, heat, and dust, clearly affects his body through sweating and subsequent water loss, leading to dehydration. In conclusion, the cyclist was greatly influenced by the setting."
359	6337	3	2	"The features of the setting had a disastrous effect on the cyclist. Firstly, he was ""traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" He was running out of water, and the pump he found produced ""brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees"" and ""had the flavor of battery acid."" Then, he encountered ""rolling hills"" and ""Rough @CAPS1."" By the end, he was exhausted, dehydrated, and in desperate need of water. The terrain in the story serves to emphasize that one should not take directions from old men. In summary, the setting features severely hampered the cyclist's journey."
360	6338	3	2	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist faced multiple problems. The primary conflict was the lack of water. Cycling is a strenuous activity that drains a rider's strength, and water is essential to keep the cyclist hydrated. In the text, the old men advised the cyclist to take a detour through desert areas and hilly terrains. Due to the hot weather and rough roads, the cyclist became dehydrated more quickly than usual. For instance, the text states, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."" The use of vocabulary like ""tantalizing"" reveals the cyclist's urgent need for water. Moreover, later in the sentence, the narrator blames the old men for suggesting the path. It is evident that the harsh setting of the essay had a profound impact on the cyclist."
361	6339	3	2	The characteristics of the setting pose significant challenges to the cyclist, making his journey arduous. The sweltering weather leaves him extremely thirsty, and the deserted towns prevent him from replenishing his water supply. The terrain he traverses is hilly, and the road is in poor condition. The combination of heat, water scarcity, ghost towns, and difficult terrains makes his journey a formidable accomplishment. Despite these obstacles, he manages to achieve his goal of obtaining water.
362	6340	3	2	The story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie follows a man traveling through challenging settings. The cyclist's mood is influenced by the setting, his needs, and his determination to persevere. The story is set in early summer in California. The weather is described as hot, with “The sun [beginning] to beat down.” He is traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Due to the excessive heat, he requires more water, which becomes the central conflict of the story. As the journey becomes more difficult, his attitude towards the old men's advice shifts from gratitude to regret. However, his determination to continue also strengthens as he tells himself, “if [he] could make it that far, [he'd] be fine.” Overall, the setting has a negative impact on the cyclist.
363	6341	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” numerous features influence the cyclist. For instance, as “The sun was beginning to beat down,” he starts to feel hot and then tired. When he encounters bumps on the road, pedaling becomes more difficult. He is also consuming his water rapidly, indicating that he is hot, fatigued, and potentially lost. The description “I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength” suggests that he is exerting excessive effort, which may leave him too exhausted to continue riding. These are the reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
364	6342	3	2	Initially, the old men disrupt the cyclist's journey by misleading him. They tell him about a “shortcut” that they claim will lead him directly to his destination. As a result, the cyclist encounters the rough rolling hills of a highway. Despite the challenges he faces during his long journey, the cyclist remains resolute in reaching his destination.
365	6343	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist in multiple ways. If the cyclist were riding in a different location in the middle of June, he would not have become as dehydrated. This cyclist is riding in the high deserts of California, where temperatures can reach @NUM1∞ degrees. In contrast, in the middle of @DATE2 in @CAPS1.A, the temperature barely reaches @NUM2∞ degrees. Additionally, the desert is known for its barrenness. If he were riding elsewhere, there could be a gas station every mile. However, this cyclist is in “No @CAPS2's @CAPS3.” Lastly, the roads in the desert are more dangerous because few people drive through, and there are no regular complaints about potholes. People are more concerned about the roads in cities with high traffic, and there is little incentive to repair potholes in areas with low traffic.
366	6344	3	2	"The setting significantly undermines the cyclist's determination. There were hills that rendered his ride arduous; the text states, ""over one long crippling hill, a building came into view."" This indicates that the hills were taxing on him as they were described as long and crippling. Another element of the setting was the building. He was extremely thirsty, and upon reaching an abandoned grape - juice factory, it was described as ""by the looks of it, a @CAPS1 Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant."" These are two of the numerous instances where the setting affected the cyclist."
367	6345	3	2	"On a very hot day, a cyclist is in a California desert with a limited water supply. As the heat intensifies, his water supply rapidly dwindles. He asks some old men for directions to Yosemite, and they, who ""have not left their porch since @PERSON1 was in office,"" give him incorrect directions. Consequently, he gets lost in the scorching California desert. Eventually, he comes across a fishing store, where he refreshes himself with a large amount of water from the sink and then resumes his journey to Yosemite."
368	6346	3	2	The setting has a substantial impact on the cyclist. The roads are littered with bottles, which pose a significant risk of serious injury. The water he drinks has a streaming flow and tastes like battery acid. Rolling hills present another major challenge. The environment is rather desolate as he also encounters a snake. Additionally, he thinks he sees mirages, which indicates that the climate is extremely harsh for him. In summary, these various features of the setting collectively affect the cyclist's journey.
369	6347	3	2	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist for multiple reasons. Firstly, it helps the reader better visualize the cyclist's feelings. Secondly, it makes the cyclist seem somewhat crazy for cycling in weather where he could ""drop from heatstroke."" Thirdly, the adverse weather affects him so severely that he hallucinates a ""building - abandoned years earlier"" as a mirage. Overall, the conditions created by the setting seem almost impossible to overcome, thus significantly affecting the cyclist."
370	6348	3	2	Throughout the story, the cyclist details the hot weather and the harsh terrains of the Midwest during his search for a water source. He mentions several times the pleasant @DATE1, which quickly turns into sweltering heat as he pedals on. He also elaborates on the transition from flat ground to rolling hills during his journey. These aspects make the cyclist's struggle more palpable and allow the reader to vividly imagine what he is experiencing.
371	6349	3	2	In the article “Do not exceed the posted speed limit,” the setting’s features had a significant impact on the cyclist. The entire setting was a dry, dusty expanse, not quite a desert but just as harsh. The sun was beginning to beat down, yet the cyclist barely noticed it at first. The arid conditions dehydrated the cyclist severely. As stated, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This combination of heat and exertion in the desert environment in June led to even more dehydration, to the point where the cyclist thought they were going to die. Along the journey, the cyclist came across an old abandoned juice factory. This sight filled the cyclist with despair and hopelessness, compelling them to push harder to reach water. Ultimately, the features of the setting only strengthened the cyclist's determination to find water.
372	6350	3	2	The setting influenced the cyclist in multiple ways. One aspect was the weather. As the story mentions, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kermaskie). This indicates that the cyclist was in a desert, which are typically warm. June is also usually a hot - temperature month. The heat made the cyclist dehydrated and left them with little water. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was the surroundings. The story states, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” (Kurmaskie). This means there was no one around to assist the cyclist if they got hurt, and there was no place to obtain water. In conclusion, the weather and surroundings of the setting posed significant challenges to the cyclist.
373	6351	3	2	Numerous features of the setting had an impact on the cyclist. The most prominent and direct feature was that the adventure occurred in the “high deserts of California in June.” CAPS1 describes this passage as having blistering heat; “high” implies being closer to the sun, deserts are hot, California is known for being smoggy, and June is the middle of summer. Additionally, the nearest water supply was “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,” and there was a “long crippling hill” while the sun was beating down. All these factors obviously made the cyclist tired, as they vividly expressed fears of losing consciousness. In summary, the setting's features significantly affected the cyclist's physical and mental state.
374	6352	3	2	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting impact the cyclist. For instance, the cyclist says, “I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This change makes the cyclist work harder, especially when dying of thirst on a hot summer day. The hills force the cyclist's muscles to work more and use up more strength. In summer, it is extremely hot; the cyclist mentions it being “in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” After this, the cyclist explains the frustration of having no cold water. This makes the cyclist focus on water and not think about their location, and since they don't have a good map, they could easily get lost. In conclusion, the setting's terrain and heat create difficulties for the cyclist.
375	6353	3	2	As the cyclist embarked on their trip, they encountered many dismal places and people. First, the cyclist trusted some old men when they knew they shouldn't have, which led them through the desert. Even in a car, the desert can be a despairing place, and on a bicycle, it's even worse, as running out of water means no one will be there to save them from dehydration. The endlessly bleak landscapes also affected the cyclist's mood. Another negative feature was the numerous abandoned towns and spoiled water. Every time the cyclist thought they were saved, they were disappointed. For example, they had to pump for minutes to get bad - tasting water. Finally, just as their strength was about to give out, they found a bait place with water and a place to rest. However, there was another old man there. Overall, the cyclist's journey was filled with hardships due to the setting and the people they met.
376	6354	3	2	In the essay, the setting is significantly influenced by the cyclist's characteristics. If the cyclist had not been traversing the desert, readers would not have perceived the high - level of danger he was in. Upon reaching the grape factory, the cyclist claimed to be on the verge of dehydration. Subsequently, when he arrived at the bait shop, he drank water from the faucet. This shows how the cyclist's journey through the desert - related setting brought about these particular circumstances.
377	6355	3	2	The setting's features have a notable impact on the cyclist. The presence of rolling hills that go up and down demands a great deal of strength from the cyclist. Moreover, due to the extreme heat, the cyclist keeps drinking water and runs out early. In the story, it is stated that “He barely noticed that the sun was starting to beat down,” which indicates the increasing heat. Also, when the cyclist says, “I checked my water supply,” it implies that he is becoming aware of his dwindling water resources. Overall, the hot, abandoned setting with no available water source significantly affects the cyclist.
378	6356	3	2	The setting is a crucial factor in the story. The story is set in a desert, where there is a scarcity of water. The cyclist is on a bike, which is a dangerous situation. This is because pedaling the bike requires physical exertion, which expends energy and uses up the body's water. In such a water - scarce desert environment, the cyclist is at a high risk due to the combination of the setting and the mode of travel.
379	6357	3	2	The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting. He was cycling uphill in extremely hot conditions, which demanded a large amount of energy. Additionally, he had a limited water supply and was heading in the wrong direction. These aspects of the setting combined to put the cyclist in a difficult and potentially dangerous situation.
380	6358	3	2	The features of the setting have a substantial impact on the cyclist. The incorrect directions provided by the elderly person cause the cyclist to get lost. The lack of water makes the cyclist consider sucking pebbles to alleviate his thirst. The rolling hills force the cyclist to use more energy. In conclusion, the setting, with its misdirection, water scarcity, and hilly terrain, has multiple negative impacts on the cyclist.
381	6359	3	2	"The features of the setting significantly influenced the cyclist. As she cycled around a bend, she felt as if ""my troubles, thirsts, and fear were all behind me."" This shows that the setting had a profound impact on her mental state during the ride."
382	6360	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's story ""Rough Road Ahead,"" a cyclist embarked on a bike ride in the sweltering California summer while staying there. He encountered some elderly individuals who provided him with a ""shortcut."" However, most of the places they mentioned were deserted ghost towns devoid of any drinkable water. Had he been near a river or spring, he could have easily stopped and quenched his thirst. Even in a more populated and industrial area, he could have entered a building and asked for a drink. But he found himself in the arid, hot, and abandoned hills of California, parched and without water. Under these circumstances, he grew fatigued, thirsty, dehydrated, and desperate for a drink. Eventually, he came across a bait shop that had water, which came as a relief."
383	6361	3	2	"During the cyclist's journey, the setting frequently affected him. At the start of his cycling, the heat was not overly bothersome. He stated, ""The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it."" This indicates that although he was aware of the increasing heat, it did not initially impact him. Another factor that influenced him was the time of his travel. He said, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high deserts in California in June."" This shows that due to the time of day and the month of his outing, he was constantly drinking. All these elements demonstrate that the setting had an impact on the cyclist during his trip."
384	6362	3	2	I firmly believe that the features of the setting have a substantial impact on the way a person rides a bike. Different places have distinct terrains. Some terrains are not ideal for bike riders. For instance, if the ground is bumpy, a rider may fall off the bike. Moreover, in the dark, one may not be able to see the path ahead, which can lead to serious injuries. This is why bike riding can be dangerous. On the other hand, if the environment has a smooth surface, one can enjoy a pleasant bike ride. In conclusion, the setting plays a crucial role in determining the safety and enjoyment of a bike ride.
385	6363	3	2	"In the story ""Do not Exceed posted speed Limit,"" the features of the setting physically affected the cyclist. He was in the California desert in mid - June with no water remaining. This took a physical toll on him, and it also made him feel hopeless. He remarked, ""It was a sad hopeless laugh mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself."" Clearly, his physical suffering from dehydration affected his emotional state as he felt helpless. If he had been in a different location, say @LOCATION2, where it is not as hot as California, he would not have endured dehydration and would not have been in such an isolated predicament. His cycling experience can be compared to that of climbers lost in a snowstorm in @LOCATION3. Instead of dehydration and heatstroke, they suffered from hypothermia. Had they been on a different mountain, there would have been no snowstorm, and they would have been fine. In both cases, the outcome was determined by the setting."
386	6364	3	2	"The harsh conditions of the environment presented the cyclist with seemingly insurmountable challenges at times. The intense heat of the land and the desolate features of the setting were so severe that the cyclist felt hopeless. For instance, the cyclist expressed, ""I hope I make it to the horizon because there's nothing else to compare."" With no buildings or mailboxes in sight, the cyclist was acutely aware of the vast emptiness of the desert. The desolate landscape made the cyclist feel utterly alone, believing that no one could help and that death by dehydration was inevitable. As the situation worsened, the sight of the Welch's grapefruit building initially offered a glimmer of hope for survival. However, upon discovering that it was deserted, the cyclist's last shred of hope vanished, and they gave up. On the verge of unconsciousness, the cyclist stumbled upon a fishing store and managed to take a sip of water. Ultimately, the unforgiving features of the setting were the primary cause of the cyclist losing hope."
387	6365	3	2	The setting's features have a significant impact on the author, leading to dehydration. The scorching desert sun causes the author to sweat profusely, and without water to replenish electrolytes, the situation becomes dire. Moreover, once the author reaches the hills, a substantial amount of energy is expended, making pedaling uphill an arduous task. If I were in the author's position, I would also become fatigued because water is essential for survival. In conclusion, the harsh setting, with its combination of intense heat and challenging terrain, severely affects the author's physical state, highlighting the importance of water in such an environment.
388	6366	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. At the beginning, the cyclist starts with a positive attitude, as evidenced by the statement “with strong legs and a smile on my face.” As the journey progresses, the cyclist encounters a fort - like structure, which troubles him. Despite this, he retains the confidence to continue. Subsequently, the cyclist notices a change in the terrain, with the flat road being replaced by short, rolling hills. This means that greater effort and force are required to pedal over the hills. Compounding the problem, the weather is unfavorable, and the cyclist is running out of water, leading to the fear of heatstroke. The cyclist describes the desolation, saying, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind.” At this point, the cyclist's mind is filled with sad and hopeless thoughts, yet he perseveres. The cyclist is extremely thirsty and believes death is near, stating, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” However, as he continues, he spots an old man, which restores his hope. Overall, the setting's features have both physical and mental effects on the cyclist. Physically, the cyclist is exhausted, and mentally, he becomes negative and pessimistic about his journey. Thus, the setting's features significantly interfere with the cyclist's physical and mental well - being.
389	6367	3	2	In my opinion, in the story “No Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting has a profound impact on the cyclist. When the road is long, downhill, and cool, the cyclist has no issues. However, when faced with straight uphill roads and extreme heat, the cyclist struggles to keep pedaling. In the hot desert, with no one around, the cyclist becomes extremely weary. This clearly shows that the setting has a huge influence on the mood of the story. The harsh conditions of the setting can quickly turn the cyclist's experience from pleasant to unbearable, emphasizing the powerful role that the setting plays in shaping the cyclist's emotions and the overall atmosphere of the story.
390	6368	3	2	A cyclist is an individual who rides a bike. Cyclists can either ride in groups or choose to cycle solo. Some cyclists embark on short rides of just a few miles, while others are capable of covering longer distances, such as @NUM1 miles. Cyclists are not limited to flat roads; they may traverse hills and even ride through water, engaging in a variety of cycling experiences. To be able to ride a bike for such long distances, cyclists must have a significant amount of free time at their disposal. In summary, cyclists come in different forms and undertake diverse cycling feats, all of which require time and dedication.
391	6369	3	2	The environment is as hot as a desert, with no one in sight and extremely dry. The intense heat outside impacts the cyclist as he becomes sweaty and requires water. The heat gradually exhausts him. The absence of people around means he cannot obtain the water he needs for his journey. All these factors make him weak and make it more difficult for him to find a place to get water.
392	6370	3	2	The setting has an impact on the cyclist, which can either be positive or negative. If a cyclist adjusts their own settings, it is beneficial. However, if someone else interferes with the settings, it can be detrimental. In conclusion, the nature of the impact on the cyclist by the settings depends on who makes the adjustments.
393	6371	3	2	In this narrative, a cyclist is riding in California, heading for Yosemite National Park. He encounters a shortage of water and receives bad directions from a group of old men sitting on a porch. The setting, ranging from pine - trees to barren hills, plays a significant role in his “challenge”. At the start of his trip, he passes a “ghost town” that is clearly past its prime, which plants the first seeds of doubt in him, and he continues with caution. Then, the pines that he felt a connection with, “had my name written all over them,” give him hope and reassurance. But the rusty pump and “ramshackle shed” take that hope away, making him cautious again. The hills make him work hard to cross, the snake slows him down, and the abandoned Welch's juice company only worsen his situation. Finally, he gets some water at a bathroom, and things improve. If the setting remained the same throughout, he either wouldn't have any hope, or his hope wouldn't ebb and flow, which is what makes the story interesting.
394	6372	3	2	The cyclist faces troubles such as winding hills, limited water, and poor directions. First, he gets very inaccurate directions from a group of old men who haven't left their porch in a while. Then, he passes through the first town without filling his water bottles. Subsequently, he gets lost and runs out of water. Fortunately, he finds a fishing store where there is water and people who provide him with a better map. In the end, these setbacks and the eventual help shape his cycling journey.
395	6373	3	2	The lack of water and direction significantly affects the cyclist. As Kurmaskie stated in the essay, “I could drop from heatstroke,” highlighting the impact of water shortage. Moreover, the absence of proper direction is also a major issue. Without direction, the cyclist will be riding aimlessly for a long time. In conclusion, the lack of water and direction are the main problems the cyclist faces in the story.
396	6374	3	2	The cyclist assumed he had packed sufficient water and set off on his journey. However, he drank most of his water before reaching even half of his destination. He didn't realize how sweltering it was until he was left with only a couple of sips. As he started to become dehydrated, he recalled that the old men had said the next town was about eighteen miles away. So, he persevered. When he finally reached the town, there was nothing to drink, just an old, dilapidated factory. He picked up some rocks and sucked on them, but when he went over a bump, he accidentally swallowed one. He told himself that next time he would simply follow the map. Everything he had passed on the way was run - down and abandoned. Eventually, he reached a bait shop, went inside the bathroom, and got some water.
397	6375	3	2	The features of the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist. For instance, the absence of hills led to him getting dehydrated. He traversed a rusty, bumpy road, which only exacerbated his dehydration. Additionally, he found a place where he could make a change and figure out the best route to his destination. In conclusion, the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist.
398	6376	3	2	The cyclist journeyed through numerous natural settings that influenced him. First, he rode into a barren area. When he came across the first “town,” he described its barrenness, stating that “it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” Then, a large and dangerous snake approached him, but fortunately, he managed to maneuver out of its way. The most challenging setting for the cyclist was the lack of water, which poses a threat to all living beings. In the end, he found some water, and the story concluded on a positive note.
399	6377	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting is related to the author's feelings. Initially, when the author saw the abandoned first “town,” he was not overly concerned and continued his journey. He said, “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” At this point, the author was fine and still had enough water. As he started to run low on water, he became more panicked, and the day seemed even hotter. He mentioned, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” As the author's water supply dwindled, the day became more unbearable. Later, he encountered a rattlesnake, which increased his panic. He described, “and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamond - back blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” However, when he reached the bait store and drank from the sink, things improved, and there was no more mention of water or the heat. In conclusion, the setting was related to the author's moods.
400	6378	3	2	In this short story, the features of the setting had a notable impact on the cyclist. The setting is a hot and dry terrain, which can be identified as California. The heat of the desert climate began to affect the cyclist after he reached the first town. This can be inferred from his statement: “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time – say, before the last war – but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down.” During this time in June, the summer heat was intense, and he was consuming a lot of water. The setting caused him to deplete his water supply and start the process of dehydration. I understand how the summer heat can impact one during such activities; it can sometimes feel like you're on the verge of collapse. For the cyclist, relief was always just around the corner. In conclusion, the setting significantly affected the cyclist.
401	6379	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting's features severely impact the cyclist's condition. Cycling “through the high desert of California” is inherently challenging. Without proper hydration, individuals are prone to heat - strokes, fainting, and in some cases, death. For this cyclist, the situation is exacerbated by the effort of pedaling over “short, rolling hills.” Moreover, the trail set by a few very old, eccentric men does little to alleviate the depleted water supply. The first town the cyclist encounters hardly fits the traditional definition of a town, and the only other water pump emits sewage and extremely hot brackish water. The sight of water on the cyclist's path only makes the heat more unbearable. This combination of setting features causes great distress to the cyclist, almost pushing him to the brink of death.
402	6380	3	2	In this story, the setting affects the cyclist in multiple ways, including the weather, food and water supply, misjudgment regarding old people, and the road. Firstly, the weather is extremely dry, with a temperature of two hundred degrees. This makes the cyclist sweat profusely and struggle to breathe. Secondly, the water supply is scarce. When the cyclist tries to get water, the pumps do not yield usable water. These two factors, the weather and the water supply, have a major impact on the cyclist. In conclusion, the unfavorable conditions of the setting significantly impede the cyclist's journey.
403	6381	3	2	At the start of the story, the author is in a happy state. As the quote “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face” (@NUM1) shows, she is in high spirits and content to be on her journey, feeling untouchable. However, the story takes an unexpected turn. The author, after getting lost in a seemingly desolate town, expends her last burst of energy to maneuver down a hill as described in “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill” (@NUM2). Then, she hears people, and is extremely relieved to find someone who can help. She gets water and is eternally grateful. The setting is terrifying for her; it makes her feel as if survival is impossible even for those who live there. She experiences profound loneliness and fears for her life. Had the setting been a city surrounded by buildings, the author would have felt some sense of security even without water. In summary, the change in the author's mood is closely tied to the harsh and desolate setting of the story.
404	6382	3	2	The setting's features have an impact on the cyclist, primarily due to water and hills. The water situation is a factor as the cyclist's water cools down after he fills his container to the brim. Additionally, the rolling hills present a challenge. The combination of these two aspects of the setting affects the cyclist's experience. In conclusion, both the water conditions and the terrain of the rolling hills contribute to the overall impact of the setting on the cyclist.
405	6383	3	2	The setting has several notable features, including the blazing heat from the sun, “short, rolling hills,” and a lack of water. The cyclist also feels as if he is in the middle of nowhere. These features have both physical and emotional effects on the cyclist. The intense heat, scarcity of water, and continuous uphill riding drain the cyclist's energy, making it extremely difficult to ride. Moreover, the lack of hope undermines the “mind - over - matter” principle. When all these setting features are combined, they can lead to significant trouble for the cyclist. In conclusion, the harsh setting poses a serious threat to the cyclist's well - being and progress.
406	6384	3	2	The setting's features had a significant impact on the cyclist. After cycling approximately @NUM1 miles, when in need of water, the cyclist discovered a rusty pipe. First, a tarlike substance emerged from it, followed by brackish water. For a cyclist, clean water is essential during the journey. Subsequently, the terrain transformed from flat to extremely hilly. When already in search of water, the additional challenge of the hills was the last thing the cyclist needed. Further along the way, there were no cars or buildings in sight. When feeling at one's worst, it is comforting to have someone nearby in case of difficulties, but the road was completely deserted. Finally, the sight of the old Welch's Grape Juice Factory affected the cyclist. Seeing a drink factory right in front yet it being out of business must have made the cyclist feel as if they would never make it. In conclusion, these setting features undoubtedly influenced the cyclist.
407	6385	3	2	The features of the setting had a dramatic impact on the cyclist. Initially, the cyclist's journey was going smoothly until he ran out of water and reached the hilly terrain. Had he been in a more favorable location, he would not have faced dehydration. The hills also played with his mind. The most notable setting was the Welch's grape juice factory. He could have had all the grape juice he desired, but it was abandoned, which he considered an ironic twist. Fortunately, there was a bait - shop that saved his day. An old man at the bait - shop offered him directions. Overall, the setting features significantly affected the cyclist's experience.
408	6386	3	2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist as he found himself in a desolate area with no water and no sense of direction. The man was extremely thirsty, with his water bottle empty. An example of his thirst can be seen in the statement, “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water - depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” By cycling at @NUM2 when the speed limit was @NUM1, he was expending a lot of energy and getting exhausted, clearly in need of water to refresh himself. Moreover, the absence of anyone in sight to provide directions also had an impact. As the text states, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” From the cyclist's perspective, he likely thought civilization was miles away and that he might not be able to reach it. In summary, the setting made the cyclist likely start to stress and panic.
409	6387	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. For instance, cycling through the desert with a lack of water makes him feel dehydrated and tired. I can relate to this feeling as I often experience similar exhaustion when jogging for long periods. The men in the story who “haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” also play a role. Their presence leads the cyclist to take an unmarked shortcut that turns out to be a disaster. The Welch's factory further affects the cyclist. It heightens his thirst as the sign of grape juice looks incredibly irresistible to him, motivating him to keep going in search of something to drink. Additionally, the change in terrain is a significant factor. Instead of riding on flat ground, he now has to work much harder to climb the hills, which further drains his energy. In conclusion, the various features of the setting have multiple and far - reaching effects on the cyclist.
410	6388	3	2	The features of the setting have numerous effects on the cyclist. As described in paragraph @NUM1, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The intense heat in the desert during June caused the cyclist to dehydrate rapidly. Due to the heat, he drank more water, which led to his water supply running out quickly. To conserve water, he then tried to limit his drinking, but this only exacerbated his dehydration as he was losing body fluid through sweating. In paragraph @NUM2, it mentions that “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These hills required the cyclist to use more energy to cycle uphill, causing him to become exhausted much faster than on flat land. Had the setting been different, such as a non - hilly and cooler area, the cyclist would not have become as dehydrated and tired. In conclusion, the features of the setting have a substantial impact on the cyclist.
411	6389	3	2	"The features of the setting have a direct impact on the cyclist. In June, the cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California. The intense heat of June, combined with the arid desert environment, made the situation worse. As a result, the cyclist continuously drank water until it was depleted. Moreover, the physical exertion of cycling caused sweating, leading to increased water consumption. The presence of ""one ramshackle shed, several rusty pipes, and a corral that couldn't hold the lamest mule"" also posed a problem. Since the cyclist couldn't replenish the water supply, they had to conserve it and limit energy usage. Clearly, the desert setting with no water affected the cyclist more significantly than cycling on a cold day."
412	6390	3	2	"In the story ""Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the cyclist was significantly influenced by the features of the setting. Firstly, the extremely hot weather made the cyclist feel exhausted and unmotivated. Secondly, the absence of other people made the cyclist feel small and helpless. The author can relate to this feeling of fear when alone. Finally, the lack of available water was a major issue. The cyclist was clearly suffering from thirst, and the desolate surroundings exacerbated this feeling. Overall, the setting had a profound impact on the cyclist's physical and mental state."
413	6391	3	2	"The setting had a notable impact on the cyclist. The rough roads made it difficult for the cyclist to pedal, causing great physical strain. During the ride through the ""town,"" the sight of a snake instilled fear in the cyclist. Additionally, the cyclist was running out of water, and the water they managed to find tasted like battery acid. All these factors combined show that the setting was extremely challenging for the cyclist, making the journey a tough one."
414	6392	3	2	"The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist, inducing fatigue, fear, thirst, and worry. It was a hot day in June in California, and the cyclist was riding through the sweltering heat, over hills, and across difficult terrain. The cyclist described the land, stating, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" and ""Over one long, crippling hill."" As the journey progressed, doubt crept in. Fear and thirst began to take their toll, with the cyclist despairingly saying, ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" By the time the cyclist reached the bait - shop, hope was almost lost, as evidenced by the statement, ""Slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" However, upon seeing the bait shop, the cyclist regained strength, claiming, ""Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me."" In conclusion, the features of the setting subjected the cyclist to an unsteady ride filled with fear, hope, and confidence."
415	6393	3	2	The features of the setting play a dual - role in affecting the cyclist. On one hand, they assist the cyclist in getting water to quench their thirst and enable them to get back on the road to their intended destination. However, it's worth noting that there is no mention of the cyclist getting bait for fishing. On the other hand, the cyclist was in a dire situation as they almost died from thirst due to the lack of water and proper roads. In summary, the setting both helped and endangered the cyclist during the journey.
416	6394	3	2	He is in a race, attempting to reach Yosemite while navigating a rushing river. This challenging situation tests his determination and skills as he strives towards his goal.
417	6395	3	2	The features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist in multiple ways. Desert regions can make a cyclist want to stop and not proceed further, as the end is unknown. In contrast, grassy and flowery landscapes offer a more inviting route, inspiring the cyclist to continue and explore. Hills and uneven terrain present a greater challenge, making it more difficult to keep going but also providing a good workout. Clearly, the setting has a notable influence on the cyclist.
418	6396	3	2	"When the cyclist received directions to Yosemite Park from the ""old - timers"" he met, he was confident in their knowledge. However, to his disappointment, these elderly men sent him through life - threatening conditions in a deserted area. In the hot June weather, he started his journey, riding with strong legs and a smile. As he went on, he noticed the absence of buildings, cars, and people. He passed abandoned towns and entered the desert flatland, which then turned into challenging hills filled with tumbleweeds and snakes. The cyclist's physical condition rapidly deteriorated due to tiredness and lack of water, leading him to think he was going to die. Miraculously, he reached ""Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp"", where he was quickly replenished. This experience taught him to rely on his map in the future."
419	6397	3	2	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit"", the features of the area the cyclist rides through have a great impact on him. For instance, when the narration states, ""At some point, humble weeds crossed my path"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1), it shows despair creeping into the cyclist's mind. Another example is when the narration says, ""@CAPS1 hill, a building came into view"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1), indicating that the cyclist sounds more hopeful than before. Evidently, the area the cyclist enters significantly affects his state of mind."
420	6398	3	2	In the story, the cyclist is affected by several features of the desert. The most prominent one is the heat, as he was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. He was also running low on water, with only a few sips left in his water bottles. Facing extreme heat and a lack of water, he was tired and had a long way to go. All the towns he passed were deserted. Finally, he reached a bait shop, refilled his water, and promised to rely on the map from then on.
421	6399	3	2	In the essay, the setting impacts the cyclist in various ways. For instance, the course was likely arduous as the cyclist was dehydrated, and the presence of rolling hills and rough roads indicates a challenging path. Additionally, the cyclist encountered dangerous animals such as snakes. In conclusion, these factors demonstrate how the setting affects the cyclist.
422	6400	3	2	"The terrain described in the essay influences the cyclist's struggles. When the author mentions that there were no cars or buildings in sight, it emphasizes that the cyclist is in a desolate area. Moreover, when the cyclist comes across an abandoned juice factory and is so thirsty that he puts stones in his mouth to produce saliva, it further highlights the impact of the setting. Also, when he finally finds water and an ""old - timer"" asks if he knows the best way to go, it adds to the overall influence of the setting. In conclusion, the setting significantly affects the cyclist's experiences."
423	6401	3	2	In the essay, the cyclist is riding in the desert during June. The extreme heat of June causes numerous problems for him. He expresses fear of dehydration due to the high temperature. Additionally, the hilly roads make him exert more effort, leading to greater water loss. In conclusion, the hot desert environment in June and the hilly roads pose significant challenges to the cyclist.
424	6402	3	2	"The characteristics of the setting have a negative impact on the cyclist. When the cyclist reaches the first ""town"", he senses there will be problems as it is a deserted and dilapidated area with hot water. As he continues, the terrain changes from flat land to hills, and he encounters a big snake on the road. Navigating hilly areas with little water leads to severe dehydration for the cyclist. In conclusion, the setting's features create a difficult and dangerous situation for the cyclist."
425	6403	3	2	I believe they did a decent job, but it was not entirely satisfactory. They took the right steps in some aspects, yet they also made mistakes. Overall, their performance had both positive and negative elements, and while they showed some competence, there is room for improvement.
426	6404	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting's features significantly impact the cyclist. The heat causes dehydration as the cyclist lacks sufficient water, leading to sweating and nausea. The description “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke, caused me to laugh” shows that the cyclist is aware of the dire situation due to his current state. In conclusion, the features of the setting have a profound effect on the cyclist.
427	6405	3	2	The features of the environment have a substantial impact on the cyclist. The intense heat makes the cyclist sweaty, hot, and fatigued. It also causes thirst, and the cyclist consumes a large amount of water in a short time, running out before reaching the next town. Since the cyclist is in the desert, there are no trees to provide shade for rest, and there are no people around to offer help or water. As a result, the cyclist struggles more during the ride than anticipated. In conclusion, the environmental features pose significant challenges to the cyclist.
428	6406	3	2	Several factors affect the cyclist. The lack of water is a major issue. As stated, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,” and water is crucial for the human body to function properly. The humid and dry weather in California also has an impact. In June in the high deserts of California, the cyclist fears dropping from a heatstroke as the sun is unbearable, especially without shade and water. The absence of people is another problem; “There was no - one in sight,” which would have made the journey easier if there were stores or people around. Additionally, the presence of animals like a large snake that “blocked the majority of the pavement” adds to the cyclist's concerns. In conclusion, these various factors all have an impact on the cyclist.
429	6407	3	2	Rolling hills, open terrain, and high deserts are all setting features that affect the cyclist. Rolling hills require the cyclist to expend energy when traveling for long distances. The open terrain exposes the cyclist to the beating sun, which exerts pressure on the cyclist. High deserts present a challenge as the cyclist has to pedal for miles on rough, dry terrain, putting overall strain on the cyclist. In conclusion, these setting features have a notable impact on the cyclist's journey.
430	6408	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting has a huge impact on the cyclist. Primarily, the weather leads to dehydration. The cyclist mentions regularly sipping from water bottles and tries to get water from an old well, demonstrating his great need for water. The owner of the well says the water is “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,” indicating the extreme heat outside. The author implies the harsh conditions by stating it's June in California, with an agarsears day and the sun beating down. The lane, a dirty “ghost - town” infested land, also affects the cyclist. As the cyclist sees no signs of human life, “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” which makes the cyclist feel empty. Moreover, the cyclist's unfamiliarity with the setting causes confusion. Not knowing the best path to the destination, the cyclist relies on others for help and ends up lost and in a difficult situation. In conclusion, the setting in multiple ways significantly affects the cyclist's experience.
431	6409	3	2	The cyclist was affected by numerous conditions during the journey. Firstly, he lacked an adequate amount of water. As he himself stated in the story, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,” which made the journey arduous. Additionally, the terrain and hills posed challenges. He also encountered snakes and passed through very deserted areas. However, his determination led to success, and he finally arrived in a town.
432	6410	3	2	In the short - story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting significantly impacts the cyclist. When he reaches the first “town” as directed by the old men, he “chuckled and moved on,” showing indifference to the old town. Twenty miles up the road, at “the fork of sorts,” the sight troubled him. His water supply was deteriorating, causing him to become a bit uncertain. When he read the sign “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a large part of his confidence vanished. After encountering these places, he was dehydrated, tired, and had lost much hope. When he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, he was extremely happy. He knew he could drink water, continue his journey the next day, and no longer follow the old men’s directions. In both stories and real life, people are affected by their settings. In the novel *Of Champions* by [Author], a character named [Organization] went on a journey to find an art exhibition. On the way, he faced many problems, which often made him lose hope of reaching his destination safely.
433	6411	3	2	Certain features can have an impact on cyclists. Weather is one such factor. For example, if it is either too cold or too hot outside, it can slow down the cyclist. In conclusion, weather conditions are among the features that can affect a cyclist's performance.
434	6412	3	2	The setting features affect the cyclist, particularly the road he is on. The road is filled with snakes, and fallen trees block the way. It is winding like a snake and has a large, steep hill. Going down the hill makes one go fast, and it is difficult to start or stop because the hill is steep. If more people were riding on this hill, it would be easier as there would be someone to help in case of an accident. Moreover, there are no lights. If the cyclist rides at night, they can't see where they are going unless they attach a light to their bike or helmet. These are the setting features that affect the cyclist going down a desolate hill, where help may not be readily available when needed.
435	6413	3	2	The features of the setting have a substantial impact on the cyclist. There are numerous detours and distractions along the route where the cyclist rides. The cyclist must pay full attention to the road to avoid serious injury. Additionally, the cyclist has to navigate steep hills and windy turns. In conclusion, the features of the setting play a crucial role in influencing the cyclist's journey and safety.
436	6414	3	2	The setting can have multiple impacts on a cyclist. As described in a story, being in a desert led to the cyclist becoming dehydrated. The environment was hot, the roads were bumpy, and there were threats from poisonous snakes. The cyclist faced numerous life - threatening situations such as heatstroke, falling off the bike, dehydration, and snake bites. Similarly, when cycling in the mountains, one would encounter a variety of problems. In conclusion, the setting can significantly endanger a cyclist's safety.
437	6415	3	2	The features of the setting had a notable impact on the cyclist. In the high deserts of California, the cyclist was regularly hit by his water bottle. Not far into the next part of the ride, the cyclist noticed a terrain change; flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills. After overcoming this, a large highway sign warned of a rough road ahead with a 55 - mile - per - hour speed limit. As the author noted, “Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” In summary, various elements of the setting affected the cyclist throughout the journey.
438	6416	3	2	The features of the setting influenced the cyclist in several ways. Due to the hot conditions, the cyclist would consume all their water and become extremely thirsty. This shows that the setting, with its high temperatures, had a direct impact on the cyclist's physical state. In conclusion, the setting's heat feature affected the cyclist by causing excessive thirst and rapid water consumption.
439	6417	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed the speed limit,” the setting and the mood of both the essay and the cyclist change. At the beginning, at a reservoir campground outside Lodi, California, the cyclist enjoyed the serenity of an early - summer evening, indicating a happy mood as they prepared for a bike ride. However, after getting directions from a couple of “old - timers,” the trip took a turn for the worse. About forty miles into the ride, the cyclist reached a ghost town with the sun beating down. Continuing another distance to a different ghost town with only a few rusty water pumps with acid - flavored water, the cyclist became worried due to the heat and lack of water, especially knowing there were still miles to go through rolling hills and under the hot sun, along with the sight of a “Rough Road Ahead” sign and a diamondback snake. But then, a sign for a bait - shop changed the situation. This demonstrates how the author, Joe Kurmaskie, effectively uses the setting to influence the mood.
440	6418	3	2	The dusty and dry setting had a severe impact on the cycling author. The long and hot conditions were so extreme that the author's mind was affected, with a blues tune “summer time” rattling around in their deteriorating brain. The author had cycled for a long time in the heat, and with very little water remaining, their body and mind were under great stress. Additionally, except for the last building, every town and building was deserted. With no opportunity to refuel and restock, it was a battle between the author and nature. The directions the author received were from old people who, according to the author, “haven't left their porches since Carter was in office.” The world has changed significantly; towns have become ghost towns, buildings are rundown, yet the roads are maintained. These old - mentioned towns were of no help to the author. In conclusion, the setting, combined with unreliable directions, made the author's cycling journey extremely challenging.
441	6419	3	2	As the cyclist progresses on his ride, alterations commence in the surroundings, which ultimately impacts the cyclist's attitude. At the start of his journey to Yosemite, the cyclist began that morning “with strong legs and a smile on my face”. He had obtained information from several of the older locals that would assist in reducing the time taken to reach Yosemite National Park. However, while riding, the cyclist realized that perhaps the older men's travel advice was somewhat outdated. With scarcely any water remaining to hydrate himself and being surrounded only by more road and desert, the cyclist couldn't help but laugh. “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” At this juncture, the cyclist was angry with himself for not simply using the map he had brought instead of listening to the locals. Although the cyclist remained resolute in finding water, he started to lose hope when he unexpectedly came across a bait store. There, he was able to rehydrate himself, and with his restored spirit, he continued his journey, this time relying on his map.
442	6420	3	2	The cyclist was traversing a rough, bumpy, and perilous road. He needed to be vigilant for animals that might attempt to harm or even kill him. Due to having no water, he was becoming dehydrated. Additionally, the road was hot and not well - maintained, which required more energy to navigate. As a result, his cycling became increasingly difficult, and he faced a challenging situation on this arduous journey.
443	6421	3	2	The features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist. The cyclist appears to be on a highway in the desert, riding either a motorcycle or a bike. The scene gives the impression that he might be on a vacation, either coming or going. The way he is riding makes it seem as if he is moving at a high speed and on the verge of falling. Overall, the setting's characteristics, such as the desert environment and the high - speed perception, influence the cyclist's experience.
444	6422	3	2	The cyclist is in the desert, which has led to him feeling tired. Moreover, he is running out of water, causing him to become dehydrated. In the harsh desert environment, his lack of water and increasing fatigue pose a significant threat to his well - being as he continues his journey.
445	6423	3	2	The setting of the story influences the cyclist by altering his mood. At the beginning, he had a certain level of enthusiasm, which diminished once he entered the barren desert. However, his mood improved when he found a rest stop. A clear example is the transition from “strong legs and a smile on my face” to “the growing realization that I could drop dead of a heart - stroke on a gorgeous day in June because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their perch in decades” and then to “I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait”. The overall mood of the story is based on how the author feels, which is reflected in the cyclist's changing emotional state throughout the journey.
446	6424	3	2	In the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed limit,” the setting significantly impacts the cyclist. The cyclist was cycling through a desert - like area in California. As the writer describes, “wide rings of sweat circled my shirt,” indicating the intense heat. The combination of this sweltering environment and the cyclist running out of water put him in serious danger and led to dehydration. Moreover, the sparsely - populated area meant there was no readily available water source. Had the setting been cooler and more populated, the cyclist would have been able to find water. Clearly, the setting is a crucial element that shapes the course of the story.
447	6425	3	2	The setting has a substantial impact on the cyclist. The statement “I maneuvered down the hill” depicts the cyclist's descent. If there were no hill, it would have been far easier for the cyclist to reach his destination and he would have conserved more energy. The presence of the hill added an unnecessary obstacle to his journey. In conclusion, the hill in the setting affected the cyclist's ease of travel and energy expenditure.
448	6426	3	2	The story's setting, characterized by hot weather and rolling hills, significantly influenced the cyclist. The hot climate was detrimental to the cyclist due to his limited water supply. As the text states, “The sun was beginning to beat down,” indicating a rising temperature. Additionally, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” Compounding the cyclist's difficulties, the author's battery was leaking acid, making it arduous to surmount the hills. Despite all these adversities, the cyclist managed to persevere. The setting clearly played a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's challenging journey.
449	6427	3	2	In the story “Do not exceed speed limit,” the time of year and the place setting were the primary factors affecting the cyclist. The story unfolds in the deserts of California in June. June is summer across the country, and in a California desert, the heat and humidity are particularly intense. This climate is what caused the cyclist's dehydration. The combination of the desert location and the summer month created an environment where the cyclist faced the risk of dehydration. Overall, the setting was a determining factor in the cyclist's experience in the story.
450	6428	3	2	Throughout the story, the settings had a notable impact on the cyclist. Peddling on winding roads and hills is already a tough, tiring, and challenging task. When the cyclist has little knowledge of the roads, it becomes ten times more difficult. Additionally, the lack of landmarks or visible places makes it hard for the cyclist to maintain confidence as there is no clear goal in sight. The settings thus create a mentally and physically strenuous situation for the cyclist, greatly influencing his journey.
451	6429	3	2	"Don't let anything impede you from achieving your goals. When going to Yosemite National Park, the journey takes you far from home. After traveling forty miles, you reach a town. At a water station, you find nothing because some old men claim that ""the water tastes like buttery acid."" As you head towards the hills and isolated towns, you might have to continue without anything to drink. People can die from heat - attacks because they don't stop to rest and replenish with water and food. In the end, it's crucial to be well - prepared and take necessary breaks during such a challenging journey."
452	6430	3	2	The setting in which the cyclist is situated indeed has numerous effects on him. The passage describes a setting characterized by an absence of people, no buildings, a dirty and bumpy terrain, hot weather, and abundant vegetation. All these features have negative impacts on the cyclist. For example, the dry weather leads to dehydration in the human body, and the cyclist is affected by this condition. In conclusion, the unfavourable setting significantly hampers the cyclist's experience.
453	6431	3	2	The setting in the story has a substantial impact on the cyclist. It is June in the California desert, and the sun is beating down on him. Additionally, he has to deal with a very rough terrain. All these factors combined cause him to consume his water at a faster rate. The setting makes him feel extremely desperate, which only exacerbates his situation. Ultimately, the harsh setting poses a great challenge to the cyclist's well - being and progress.
454	6432	3	2	Every person has a remarkable ability that sets them apart. Some are good - looking, intelligent, or confident. There are those who never give up and pursue their desires. The cyclist in the story is a man of strong will. He wants to survive. On his way to his desired destination, he encounters numerous difficulties. He follows the advice of some old men and loses his way. The sun begins to scorch, and he runs out of water, yet he keeps riding to reach his goal. He is losing his strength. The weather is extremely hot, and the water tastes like acid from a battery. He believes in his ability to stay alive. Despite the loss of strength, his self - belief gives him the power to keep going. Every place he passes through is a new life experience, like a game he manages to succeed in. He never gives up and does everything in his power to keep his sanity and not lose the internal battle. In the end, his unwavering will is his greatest asset.
455	6433	3	2	The features of the setting make the cyclist more fatigued and parched. The rolling hills, where he has to pedal up and down, and the desert with no water in sight, only dry land, all contribute to increasing the conflict in his story. The old Welch's Grape Juice Factory is a mockery, as it seems like there should be drinks but there are none. If he were in Yosemite with cool pine trees and rivers, he would feel completely different. The lack of people means a lack of security and water, and there are no buildings either. The tumbleweeds offer no hope of progress, and the snakes and vultures waiting to feed on a dead body add to the desolation. Everything in the story is the opposite of what he desires until he reaches his last hope, the bait shop. In conclusion, the harsh setting creates a difficult and desperate situation for the cyclist.
456	6434	3	2	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the setting significantly influenced the cyclist. The story reveals that in June, the cyclist was passing through the high deserts of California. The intense summer heat placed a considerable strain on the cyclist, compelling him to consume large amounts of water. Unfortunately, the ""towns"" were widely spaced, and many did not have access to good - quality water, leading to a dehydration problem. The desolate landscape, with ""no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind"", would not have presented such issues if the cyclist had been cycling in a marathon where water could be obtained upon request or if he had followed a reliable map."
457	6435	3	2	"The setting's features had an impact on the cyclist. As seen on page @NUM1, Kurmaskie stated, ""I got down on my hands working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength"", which clearly indicates the cyclist's desperation due to the lack of water. This shows that the elements of the setting, specifically the water scarcity, affected the cyclist's state and actions."
458	6436	3	2	The setting's features had a major impact on the cyclist in the story. On regular roads, the ground is usually smooth, but here it is winding. The cyclist also encounters bumps and unpaved roads, which make it difficult to navigate. To make matters worse, there are few towns, and the cyclist is in blazing heat with limited water. Clearly, the setting of this passage played a crucial role in the story, influencing the cyclist's journey and experience.
459	6437	3	2	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is in the high deserts of California, where the extreme heat necessitates a large amount of water. As he requires more water, he finds a water pump. However, he cannot use the water as it is ""somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees"". Additionally, the terrain changes, as he mentions that ""Flat road was replaced"". These aspects of the setting significantly impact the cyclist's situation and journey."
460	6438	3	2	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The reference to ""exceed posted speed limit"" and the statement ""Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office"" implies that following the wrong advice can lead to problems in one's travels. In other words, blindly following the advice of those with limited real - world travel experience may not work for one's journey. So, the cyclist should make the right choice and do what is appropriate for their own travel situation."
461	6439	3	2	The setting's features influence the cyclist, as the cyclist must act, behave, and speak in accordance with the setting. This implies that regardless of their location and the appearance of the place, they need to adapt. They also have to match the mood of the location. According to the story, the cyclist is comfortable and does not require any change in the setting or location. In conclusion, the setting's features affect the cyclist, who must make improvements and adjustments based on their location.
462	6440	3	2	At the start, the cyclist was eager and happy to set off. As he reached the halfway point, he began to “lose hope.” The weather was swelteringly hot, and he was all alone. By the end, he felt relieved because he not only found water but also discovered an easier route to Yosemite. The first group of old men offered no help, but the second man did. Overall, the cyclist's journey was filled with challenges at first but ended on a positive note with the assistance and discoveries he made.
463	6441	3	2	In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting's features impact the cyclist. The cyclist gives us a sense of his surroundings and his feelings about them. The text states, “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold the lamest mule greeted me.” The author further mentions that this troubled him. In fact, it made the author scared, thinking he might be alone in the desert with a ghost - town. The unforeseen situation was that the roads were rusty where the speed limit was 55 mph, yet he was going only 12 mph due to his scarce water supply. This shows that he was troubled and confused about his surroundings. As the desert landscape continued, it seemed as if the author was gradually losing hope as he traveled further. I believe it's similar to how some people start losing hope and their good judgment as soon as trouble appears, making life seem much harder.
464	6442	3	2	In this story, everything appears to be dry. The rider is bound to be extremely thirsty. Being all by himself, he might feel vulnerable because in case of an accident, there would be no one to help. Moreover, he is cycling up and down steep hills, so he has to be extremely cautious. Overall, the dry environment, his solitude, and the challenging terrain all pose difficulties for the rider.
465	6443	3	2	The setting's features have a significant impact on the cyclist in multiple ways. For example, cycling in a cold climate would result in less sweating and less need for water. However, in the story, the cyclist is in a hot climate and runs out of water. The quote “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide circles of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June…” clearly shows that the cycling setting plays a crucial role. Additionally, the terrain can also affect the cyclist. Riding on a flat terrain causes less wear and tear on the cyclist's body, making it an easier option. In conclusion, these factors demonstrate that the setting affects the cyclist in numerous ways.
466	6444	3	2	"The setting significantly influences the author's mood. Upon discovering the dilapidated ghost town, the author remains in high spirits and finds amusement in the fact that the old men's ""town"" is now abandoned. As stated, ""(the town) fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled…"", indicating the author's positive mood as they can still laugh. However, at the next stop, when a tar - like substance oozes out of the water pump, the author becomes slightly unsettled due to low water supplies, yet they maintain an optimistic outlook. When the rolling expansive hills come into view, the author emits a ""sad, hopeless laugh"", showing that they are depressed, dehydrated, and nearly ready to give up. Nevertheless, the author perseveres and ultimately reaches a water source."
467	6445	3	2	In the passage “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Speed Limit”, the setting clearly impacts the cyclist. When the cyclist first encounters the abandoned “town” and searches for water, they find only water that tastes like battery acid, as described: “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” This makes the cyclist's dehydration seem more severe because they have water but it is undrinkable. The rough road ahead gives a sense of determination. The quote “a flat road was replaced by short rolling hills” shows that despite being on the verge of exhaustion, the cyclist must persevere to get water. Also, the presence of “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” creates a feeling of desolation and isolation for the cyclist. Overall, the setting of this story directly correlates with the cyclist's feelings.
468	6446	3	2	On a hot June day, a cyclist set off on a bike ride through the desert, heading towards Yosemite National Park. Some old men, who hadn't traveled that way in years, showed him the route on the map. At the start of the day, the cyclist was eager and thought they could stop regularly to get water. However, they soon realized they were in the middle of the desert with no water in sight. The cyclist pushed themselves and tried to stop thinking about water. They even put pebbles in their mouth to suck on. This was a smart move, and this experience has made the cyclist stronger.
469	6447	3	2	Flat roads, hills, and buildings are all settings that affected the cyclist. When the hills were flat, the cyclist was determined and refused to give up on themselves. As the hills became steeper and more difficult to pedal, the cyclist started to feel exhausted and tired. Finally, the sight of buildings made the cyclist want to quit. When the cyclist saw the Welch's Grape Juice Factory and a young boy drinking, they “hung their head”. As the journey continued, the cyclist grew more tired, and the land made them feel reluctant to keep moving forward.
470	6448	3	2	The setting had a profound impact on the cyclist. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June without any water. The combination of the desert environment and lack of water posed a life - or - death situation, causing the cyclist to feel stressed and extremely thirsty. Coupled with the physical exertion of biking, the cyclist became severely dehydrated. When the cyclist was between the “ghost town” and the bait shop, they observed, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This would lead the cyclist to believe that if they passed out, there was little hope for survival. Clearly, the deserts of California have a significant impact on any cyclist, especially one without water like the cyclist in this story.
471	6449	3	2	I believe it signifies the pursuit of reaching one's full potential.
472	6450	3	2	The characteristics of the setting have an impact on the cyclist due to the high temperature, the large hills, and the lack of cold water. For instance, the heat is so intense that the cyclist doubts he can continue. Moreover, all he can manage is a water - depleting @NUM1. The hills grow so large that he crests the first few, until a sign warns of a rough road ahead and to not exceed the posted speed limit. Finally, he encounters rough terrain and has no water, reaching a dehydrated state. When the speed limit is @NUM3, he can only perform a water - depleting @NUM1. In conclusion, these setting features severely impede the cyclist's progress.
473	6451	3	2	The features of the setting impact the cyclist by leading him to become dehydrated and begin to lose consciousness. For example, the town he was supposed to reach turned out to be just an abandoned factory, and he had to travel another @NUM1 miles or so without water. As a result, the challenging setting takes a heavy toll on the cyclist's physical condition.
474	6452	3	2	The humid climate and hot weather can make a person feel extremely uncomfortable if they do not have water. Towards the end of the essay, the individual sucked on stones in an attempt to retain water, a method that may seem unusual. This kind of weather causes the character's dehydration, which is a condition resulting from a lack of water in the body. In conclusion, the adverse weather conditions are clearly the root cause of the character's dehydration.
475	6453	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. In paragraph @NUM1, it states that the temperature was rising, and the water he drank tasted like battery acid. This situation would be problematic for him because in the high heat and with the water getting warm, it would be difficult for him to get through the day without passing out. Additionally, in paragraph @NUM2, it mentions that the roads changed to hills. Riding up and down hills makes one tired from pumping their legs, leading to feelings of heat and exhaustion, and a lack of desire to continue cycling. In conclusion, these setting features significantly affect the cyclist's ability and willingness to ride.
476	6454	3	2	The cyclist in the story is significantly influenced by the features of the setting. The hills pose a challenge as they are difficult to traverse, which has an impact on the cyclist's progress. This situation clearly shows how the setting can affect the character's experience in the story.
477	6455	3	2	The setting, or environment, in which the cyclist finds himself has a profound impact on him. After receiving directions from the older gentlemen and leaving the campground, he enters a highly isolated area. As described in paragraph @NUM1, he notes that the place, which might have once been bustling, on @TIME1, met the traditional definition of a ghost town. This isolation becomes a critical factor as his dehydration worsens and becomes life - threatening; a collapse could likely lead to death, compelling him to keep going for survival. The extremely hot temperature is another obstacle. In the text, it is implied that the weather is hot as he is traveling through the California desert in June. The heat adds to his struggle to reach the next town for water. Additionally, in paragraph @NUM2, the terrain changes to gently rolling hills, presenting both physical and metaphorical challenges. He must overcome the heat and isolation and also find the mental strength and determination to continue. Overall, the setting creates a series of difficult circumstances that the cyclist must face on his journey.
478	6456	3	2	The setting affects the cyclist in multiple ways. Firstly, if the cyclist is unaware of their route, they are at risk of getting hurt. Secondly, poor road conditions can also have a negative impact on the cyclist. These factors combined illustrate how the setting can significantly influence the cyclist's experience.
479	6457	3	2	In this essay, the features of the setting make the cyclist's journey to Yosemite more arduous. For instance, the cyclist is in the high deserts of California during the hot month of June. The intense heat makes the journey more difficult for the cyclist. Moreover, in the desert, there is a lack of water supply. Once the cyclist runs out of water, dehydration sets in, causing the cyclist to become weaker and reducing their pedaling speed. The author also mentions that the terrain changes from flat roads to short rolling hills. These hills require more effort, and with the heat and lack of water, the cyclist's ability to function is severely impaired compared to when they are hydrated. In conclusion, the setting's features create a multitude of challenges that make the cyclist's journey to Yosemite a tough one.
480	6458	3	2	The features of the setting in this story have a substantial impact on the cyclist. Throughout the story, the poor cyclist gets lost and ends up in a desolate place. This isolation affects her cycling. She is trying to reach her destination and accomplish her tasks, but she faces difficulties. Despite the challenges, she continues to move forward. The story effectively showcases her determination and strong desire to achieve her goal, making it a compelling account of her struggle against the setting.
481	6459	3	2	In this particular story, a cyclist was required to ride through the desert in June with a limited supply of water. This situation had a significant impact on the cyclist, as he suffered from severe dehydration and was at risk of heat - stroke. Additionally, he had to carefully maneuver past a large snake that could have caused him harm. Personally, I find it quite reckless of him to undertake such a journey alone through the desert, and this recklessness is the root of his problems. His actions put him in a very precarious situation, and it's fortunate that he managed to get through it.
482	6460	3	2	The setting described in the “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit” has multiple effects on the cyclist. Firstly, the heat takes a toll on him. He becomes extremely hot and tired, as evidenced by the statement “I could die from a heat - stroke on a gorgeous day in June,” indicating the extreme heat. Secondly, the lack of water leaves him very thirsty. The text “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” shows his severe thirst due to water shortage. Lastly, when he enters a town, he finds it empty. The description “on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town” reveals that he had expected to rest there but was disappointed. All these aspects clearly demonstrate how the setting affected the cyclist.
483	6461	3	2	The characteristics of the setting have a couple of notable impacts on the cyclist. The primary effect is that he was cycling through the desert. This led to excessive sweating and severe dehydration. The second impact is the presence of rough roads and hilly sections, which made him tire more quickly. In summary, the setting provided no assistance to the cyclist; instead, it presented numerous challenges that hindered his journey.
484	6462	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. In my opinion, the cyclist made a grave error by following the old man's advice instead of consulting his map. All the necessary information was available on the map, and his failure to use it nearly cost him his life. If the cyclist had been traveling in a car, he might have had better luck as a car would have allowed him to move faster than on a bike. His decision to rely on the old man's words rather than the map was a misstep that put his life at risk.
485	6463	3	2	During the cyclist's journey in the middle of summer in California, numerous factors affected him. The heat was unbelievably and ridiculously intense. As he said, “… I could drop from heat - stroke …,” highlighting that he was severely overheated and dehydrated, and at risk of death at any moment. He also faced the danger of a giant snake, described as “… look like a diamondback - blocked the majority of the pavement …,” which could have easily killed him if he wasn't cautious. However, with his determination and tenacity, he persevered and reached a fresh supply of water. Had he given up, his life would have ended. His ability to push through these challenges showcases the power of determination in the face of adversity.
486	6464	3	2	A cyclist asked an old man for directions, and the old man told him it was a good route to take. However, the old man hadn't seen the area for a long time and was unaware of the changes. When the cyclist set off on the road, he found himself in a difficult situation and didn't know what to do.
487	6465	3	2	The features of the setting can affect cyclists in both mental and physical ways. Mentally, cyclists may lose determination and pride if they struggle with the cycling journey. Physically, a hot and rough setting can lead to a lack of water and food supplies. In conclusion, these are the ways in which the features of the setting can impact cyclists both mentally and physically.
488	6466	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead,” a cyclist was riding his bike in California in the middle of June. Both the time and location are challenging for a lost cyclist. June is typically hot, and California is generally warm. Since the cyclist is on a bike, he has to pedal everywhere, which not only uses up his energy but also makes him hot. Staying hydrated is crucial in such heat, but being lost means that using up all the water before finding safety can lead to major trouble. Additionally, California has hills and mountains, and pedaling uphill is no easy feat. In summary, the cyclist faced numerous difficulties due to the time and location of his journey.
489	6467	3	2	The features of the situation affected the cyclist in various ways. When he ran out of water, the buildings around him resembled a ghost - town with no one in sight. As the story states, “the building abandoned years earlier.” If I were in his position, I would have turned back to avoid the risk of dying in an abandoned area. Overall, the desolate environment and lack of water significantly impacted the cyclist's situation.
490	6468	3	2	The setting is the primary factor affecting the cyclist. The cyclist's main issue is being low on water and dehydrated, as evidenced by the statement “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” The author would not have been so dehydrated if the setting were not so hot. Moreover, all the problems he encounters, such as the snake and the rough road, are related to the setting. If the story had taken place in a more temperate area, there would likely have been no conflicts. In conclusion, the setting plays a crucial role in creating the cyclist's challenges.
491	6469	3	2	In the story, the cyclist is influenced by the setting. The @NUM1 paragraph describes the cyclist seeing an old water - pump and attempting to obtain water from it. Towards the end of the story, upon seeing the old Welch's juice factory, the cyclist becomes angry as he realizes that the old men were misinformed. However, he feels relieved when he finds Gary and @ORGANIZATION1 since there is water there. This shows how the setting impacts the cyclist's emotions throughout the story.
492	6470	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting significantly affects the cyclist. As he rides, he is surrounded by an empty expanse with “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” In a state of near - dehydration, the realization of his solitude leads him to despair. The seclusion of the setting, with only “one ramshackle shed in many miles,” almost causes the cyclist to lose hope. Nevertheless, his hope is rekindled when he thinks of “the cool pines and rushing rivers of @CAPS1.” Thus, the setting first induces despair in the cyclist but then transforms it into hope.
493	6471	3	2	The setting has a notable impact on the cyclist. The hot weather causes him to start losing energy. His riding speed, as well as when he stops, drinks, or eats, all depend on the weather conditions. For instance, in the story, when it was extremely hot outside and he saw a building, he wiped the sweat from his face to confirm it wasn't a mirage. This clearly demonstrates how the setting affects the cyclist's actions and perception during his ride.
494	6472	3	2	In the essay “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting features have a substantial impact on the hard - working cyclist. The weather, land, and surrounding objects shape the cyclist's mood and ability. For example, the mention of “cool pines, rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them” makes the cyclist feel confident, energized, and ready due to the refreshing nature and cool air. On the other hand, when he encounters “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule,” he feels troubled and a bit curious about what lies ahead. The water there isn't the best, and he becomes worried. Also, when “a flat road was replaced by short rolling hills...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake,” the cyclist tries to stay focused despite distractions. The area is deserted, and he feels dehydrated. As his journey ends, various aspects of the setting continue to evoke different feelings and abilities. In conclusion, the places his bike traversed and the things he saw influenced his choices and capabilities.
495	6473	3	2	Several features of the setting impact the cyclist. He is cycling in the middle of California under the sun with a limited supply of water. This situation affects him severely as he almost collapses due to heatstroke and lack of water. In summary, the specific features of the setting, such as the location and the water shortage, have a direct and detrimental effect on the cyclist's well - being during his ride.
496	6474	3	2	In the essay, the setting's features had numerous impacts on the cyclist. As Kurmaskie stated, “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me.” The cyclist anticipated a small town with inhabitants and a proper water supply. Instead, he encountered a deserted ghost - town with only a non - functioning rusty pump. This situation was distressing as he was running low on water and at risk of dehydration. Kurmaskie also wrote, “The speed limit was @NUM2. I was doing a water - depleting @NUM3. sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The cyclist was likely being overtaken by cars on the highway going at @NUM2 while he was only traveling at @NUM3, which made him feel as if he was making no progress. This could have been a reason for him to give up, but his determination to finish the journey was strengthened by this feeling, and he continued striving towards his destination.
497	6475	3	2	The cyclist was in a tough situation. The amount of water he had was extremely limited, and the weather was swelteringly hot. He still had a long distance to cover. The road was extremely bumpy, forcing him to maintain a slow speed to avoid bursting his tires. Moreover, there were no cars in sight. So, if he were to break down, it would significantly delay his journey. Given all these challenges, the cyclist's ability to persevere and continue his ride despite such unfavorable conditions was quite remarkable.
498	6476	3	2	The setting had a profound impact on the cyclist, and following the advice of the old - timers was a poor decision. In the essay, the cyclist was on his way to Yosemite National Park. He had a map and confidence in his cycling skills. However, he met a couple of men who offered him a shortcut. He trusted them, which he shouldn't have. The setting was harsh. He was cycling through a California desert, where the heat was intense, and he was desperately in search of water. The only water source he found tasted like battery acid and was useless to him. The terrain changed from flat land to rolling hills, and the next town was @NUM1 miles away. As he rode through this desolate area, there were no buildings or cars in sight, making it seem like a dead road. Those old men had led him into a difficult situation. Once he reached the next town, he was well - aware of the harsh conditions he had endured.
499	6477	3	2	While on his way to Yosemite National Park, the cyclist received directions from a group of old men. Unfortunately, these directions led him to a deserted place. As described, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This desolate setting had a negative impact on the cyclist as there were no places for him to stop and eat or refill his water bottle. The only available water sources were rusted water pumps with hot water, which could not cool him down. Due to these surroundings, the cyclist was pushed into a state of dehydration. In the end, the poor directions from the old men and the unforgiving setting put the cyclist's well - being at risk.
500	6478	3	2	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting features such as vast emptiness, hills, heat, and lack of water pose significant obstacles for the cyclist. Due to the vast emptiness of the area he was traveling through, he had no place to stop for help or rest. There were also no other travelers to offer assistance. The hills were another challenge; pedaling uphill required more energy, causing him to tire quickly and take longer than expected. The extreme heat made him sweat profusely and increased his thirst, leading to him running out of water. As he wrote in the story, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He was becoming increasingly thirsty and at risk of dehydration if he didn't find water. He searched for a place with water to rest but was unsuccessful. All these obstacles made the cyclist devastated and almost made him lose hope. However, he continued his journey and eventually found a place to rest. These obstacles were interconnected, each exacerbating the others, but the cyclist's perseverance allowed him to overcome them.
501	6479	3	2	I firmly believe that the story lacked coherence, and the setting was utterly absurd. I simply could not engage with it at all. In my opinion, it was not a good story.
502	6480	3	2	The setting's features have numerous impacts on a cyclist. A bumpy ride makes cycling more difficult for the cyclist. Similarly, a hilly terrain is not only more challenging but also takes more time. As described, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” which means the cyclist will take longer to reach the destination. Animals in the setting can also pose problems. For instance, “a ridiculously, large snake - it really did look like a diamondback - blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” Just like this snake, animals can get in the way. A squirrel or other animals running across the road suddenly can scare the cyclist and potentially cause a collision. Trees can provide shade, making the ride cooler as the sun doesn't beat directly on the cyclist's back. A fresh - water stream allows the cyclist to stop, wash off sweat, and have a drink. In conclusion, the setting in which a cyclist rides can either assist or hinder the cyclist.
503	6481	3	2	It had a detrimental effect on him, causing dehydration and wearing him down to the verge of giving up. However, he persevered and did not give up. In the end, he achieved a sense of satisfaction from his perseverance.
504	6482	3	2	The landscape was adorned with trees, which added red hues to the scenery. Volcanoes and tall pine - covered areas were also part of the landscape. Millions of years ago, the swampland in this area transformed into a desert. This long - term geological change has shaped the current landscape we see today.
505	6483	3	2	Several features of the setting affected the cyclist. Firstly, the cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California, as stated in “I was travelling through the high deserts of California.” Moreover, he was there in June, one of the hottest months of the year, as indicated by “I was travelling in June.” Being in the desert during June increased the risk of dehydration. The heat was extreme; when at the water pump, the cyclist described the water as “blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,” showing both the high temperature and the water's dirtiness. The water “had the flavor of battery acid,” which was a problem for the cyclist who had been consuming water regularly, as “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” These factors, namely the desert, high temperatures, and bad - tasting dirty water, combined to create a difficult situation for the cyclist. With limited water, it was harder for him to combat the harsh conditions. In conclusion, the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the desert, high temperatures, and the undrinkable bad water.
506	6484	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead,” the cyclist, filled with excitement and determination, set out to reach Yosemite National Park. As he cycled, he likely envisioned the beautiful waters with “His name written over them.” However, the rough terrain and harsh weather took a toll on the unsuspecting cyclist. The sun blazed down on his back. He initially tried to ignore the heat, but soon, the sweltering conditions forced him to ration his water, sipping it sparingly. An old man informed the cyclist that a town was only @NUM1 miles away. When he reached the town, it was a classic ghost - town. This sight likely shattered any hope of finding help to reach his destination. The poor road conditions and water shortage made him hallucinate a mirage, causing him to lose trust in the old man who had directed him to such desolate places. Despite these adverse effects of the setting, the cyclist received a small glimmer of hope in the form of a traditional map at the end.
507	6485	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting's features negatively affected the cyclist, making survival and the journey more arduous. The essay describes the cyclist arriving at a supposed “town” that once thrived but now fit the definition of a ghost town (@NUM1). The cyclist sought directions from a few old men to reach Yosemite National Park. Traveling on a humid day with limited water, the cyclist nearly exhausted his supply while cycling up “short, rolling hills” (@NUM2) in the heat. Had the town been prosperous, he could have replenished his water, easing his journey. A flat road would have also reduced his fatigue and water consumption. The cyclist's challenges are reminiscent of the main character in the movie @PERSON2, who also had to navigate extreme desert conditions to reach his destination. In conclusion, the setting clearly had a detrimental impact on the cyclist's journey.
508	6486	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist embarked on a challenging journey. At the start, the terrain was smooth, but it soon transformed into rolling hills. While dehydrated, the cyclist also had to navigate around a large snake. The most significant challenge was when he ran out of water while cycling through a desert - like area. Despite this, his determination to reach water kept him going, and he managed to make it through the difficult journey.
509	6487	3	2	In the selection “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” there are numerous vivid details about the area around the cyclist. The text makes it evident that the cyclist's route is extremely desolate. The description of the drinking water oozing out and tasting like battery acid indicates that the place had been uninhabited for a long time. Knowing that he was traveling through a desert in June, it's easy to understand how parched he must have been. Moreover, cycling for miles over rough terrain and “crippling hills” would have left him utterly exhausted. Given the troubles he faced, it's no wonder he was so frustrated with getting wrong directions. When he finally reached the camp and drank water, I, like anyone, was relieved that he had found a non - deserted place.
510	6488	3	2	The features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. He was traveling through a hot region during a hot time of the year with limited water. The text states, “I was traveling the high deserts of California in June.” Deserts are inherently hot, and June is a particularly sweltering month. The intense heat made the cyclist thirstier at a faster rate, and due to his scarce water supply, he could not drink as much as he needed. This combination of heat and water shortage severely hampered the cyclist's journey.
511	6489	3	2	In the California desert during June, the sweltering heat and aridity of the setting took a toll on the cyclist. The intense conditions made him extremely thirsty, causing him to consume all his water. As his water supply neared depletion, he started to feel exhausted. In the desolate desert, there was no one around to assist him if he suffered from dehydration and passed out. Thus, if he wanted to survive, he had to persevere and push through the difficult situation. Eventually, he found a bait shop and had a drink there, which restored his well - being.
512	6490	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting significantly impacts the cyclist. The long rides, hilly roads, and limited water supply presented challenges. Despite these difficulties, the cyclist maintained composure. Instead of getting angry, he remained calm, demonstrating remarkable self - control in the face of adversity.
513	6491	3	2	The towns, the terrain, and the Welch’s Grape Juice factory are all elements of the setting that influence the cyclist. The cyclist describes the town, saying, “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time—say, before the last world war, but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” The desolate town intensifies the cyclist’s growing sense of doubt. At this point, he deeply regrets following the old guy’s advice to take the “shortcut.” The cyclist reveals, “Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.” Already filled with worry and doubt, the cyclist finds that the terrain exacerbates his feelings, mirroring the effect of the earlier - visited town. When the cyclist exclaims, “By the looks of it—had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory,” he experiences a surge of excitement and hope. Throughout the story, the setting where the cyclist is located affects his mood, instilling both doubt and hope.
514	6492	3	2	During the warm summer months, the cyclist was biking through the California deserts. The heat and the uninhabited canal posed the greatest challenges. The cyclist had assumed there would be numerous water stops during his trip, but this assumption was incorrect. Due to the intense heat, he quickly became dehydrated and ran out of water. He grew irritated with himself for trusting someone else’s directions for a shortcut. Clearly, the setting had a negative impact on the cyclist’s mood.
515	6493	3	2	Multiple features of the bike - race setting affected the cyclist. As stated, “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist pedaled smoothly until the large hills appeared, and his energy gradually diminished as he continued. Additionally, “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The debris and the snake scared the cyclist, forcing him to stop and slowing him down. Overall, various features of the setting impeded the cyclist, causing him to lose speed and energy.
516	6494	3	2	A cyclist's riding can be affected by numerous factors, as demonstrated in this essay. The story's setting, for instance, had a significant impact on the cyclist. One issue with the setting was the absence of stores and people. More importantly, there was a lack of water in the vicinity. Thus, a cyclist's ride can be influenced by various elements, including their surroundings.
517	6495	3	2	The second photograph more effectively conveys ideas similar to those presented in the essay “A Sea Worry”. The story revolves around a boy who surfs as a job, and in the second picture, a boy is shown surfing. The author mentions, “My son body - surfs. He says it’s his ‘job’.” This quote indicates that the boy is a body - surfer and that surfing is his occupation. This is the reason for choosing the second photograph.
518	6496	3	2	The condition of a cyclist significantly impacts their riding. For example, the cyclist stated, “I was travelling through the high desert of California in June.” Due to this, the cyclist entered a “dehydrated state” because of the limited water supply. When traveling in hot areas with insufficient water, the body loses moisture through sweating and becomes dehydrated. Clearly, different cycling conditions affect cyclists in different ways.
519	6497	3	2	In “Rough Road Ahead,” multiple features of the setting affected the cyclist. The intense heat of the desert in June was a major concern, pushing the cyclist to the verge of dehydration. The text notes, “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This illustrates the impact of heat exposure on the cyclist. Additionally, the terrain threatened the cyclist's well - being. The statement “I toiled on” shows the increased effort and strain the terrain imposed on the cyclist during the journey. Overall, the setting's features had a notable impact on the cyclist's experience.
520	6498	3	2	In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting's features affect the cyclist in multiple ways. The high temperature made the cyclist thirstier. Being in the middle of the desert meant there was no access to water. The hills exhausted the cyclist, making them tired and weak. All these features of the setting combined to leave the cyclist feeling powerless and extremely thirsty.
521	6499	3	2	The cyclist is riding his bike in the desert without any water. This situation affects his journey as he becomes dehydrated. Consequently, he has to find water urgently, which slows down his progress towards Yosemite. This lack of water is a significant factor that impacts the cyclist's journey.
522	6500	3	2	In the story, the setting significantly impacts the cyclist. After following the advice of some elderly individuals, he found himself in a desert devoid of cars, buildings, and people. With his water supply running low and no means to replenish it, he became severely dehydrated. The heat and lack of water made him extremely tired, and he almost gave up. All these difficulties were a result of the desolate setting he was in.
523	6501	3	2	"As the author described, the setting was a ""ghost town."" It was a sweltering summer day in June, so it was inevitable that the cyclist would start to dehydrate. With no one around, he had no one to turn to for help. It resembled an old - fashioned town, as he encountered old men who seemed out of touch with the modern world, giving him incorrect directions. The combination of the heat, isolation, and misinformation made the cyclist's situation quite challenging."
524	6502	3	2	"The setting had multiple effects on the cyclist. Initially, it was beneficial. As the text states, ""The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers."" The pines and rivers allowed him to ignore the heat of the sun. However, later on, the setting turned against him. There was no source of water, and he started to become dehydrated. The terrain grew rougher, and there were no people nearby to offer assistance. To make matters worse, there was a snake. All these elements hindered his progress until he finally reached a bait store. The bait store provided him with water and a useful map, which helped him overcome the challenges posed by the setting."
525	6503	3	2	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe @PERSON1, it chronicles the journey of a cyclist headed to Yosemite National Park and the obstacles he encountered. One of the major problems the cyclist faced was the heat. The statement ""Drop from heatstroke"" in the story indicates that the setting, specifically the heat, had a negative impact on the character. Heat was a prominent aspect of the setting that affected the cyclist's journey."
526	6504	3	2	"The characteristics of the setting significantly influenced the author's story. It made the journey appear more arduous to the reader by describing the intense heat and the bumpy, hilly road. The text mentions ""over one long, crippling hill,"" which makes the reader perceive the trip as extremely difficult due to the numerous hills the cyclist has to ascend. If the road were less hilly, the journey would seem less challenging, and it would also suggest that the old men provided good directions. However, the essence of the story lies in the impact of the difficult setting on the overall narrative."
527	6505	3	2	Once the cyclist obtained information about the route, he embarked on his journey through tall, cool pine trees. These pines instilled a sense of confidence in him and physically cooled his body. As he rode along the road, he passed through several small towns, none of which seemed promising. Coupled with his dwindling water supply, this filled him with despair. Further into the journey, he came across a dilapidated factory in the last town, which intensified his thirst and made him resent the old men who had given him advice. Fortunately, he soon found a bait house where he could get water and escape the heat. He was grateful to the owner and realized that he should never trust the old men's advice again.
528	6506	3	2	The setting has a significant impact on a cyclist's state of mind. For instance, being in a city can make one feel rushed, tired, and overwhelmed. In contrast, cycling in a forest can bring about a sense of happiness and reduce stress. The setting not only sets the mood but also influences the attitude in the story. In conclusion, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience and the overall tone of the narrative.
529	6507	3	2	"The features of the setting influence the author's disposition and ability to complete the journey, presenting an obstacle that the author must overcome. In paragraph five, the author states, ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California."" This setting is significant as it adds a sense of urgency to the journey when the author starts to run out of water. This is similar to a personal experience of backpacking when a bear took most of the food, turning a normal trip into a survival situation. The water issue is clearly the main conflict presented in the setting. Additionally, the author notes that ""Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This aspect of the setting makes it more difficult for the cyclist to progress compared to a downhill road. In summary, the setting of the story presents the main points of conflict to the author and is essential to the essay."
530	6508	3	2	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the unbearable setting with its harsh conditions affects the cyclist. Initially, as the cyclist puts it, ""things began well enough."" However, this situation quickly changes. The road is long and full of obstacles, and the cyclist has very little water. Despite this, he does not give up. As the text states, ""got back on the bike, but not bothered gathered up a few peldder and stuck them in my mouth."" He does this to reduce his need for water and continues his journey, disregarding the difficulties the setting presents. In conclusion, the cyclist shows remarkable perseverance in the face of the challenging setting."
531	6509	3	2	"In ""Rough Road Ahead"", the cyclist is affected by the setting. The road, as a physical space, has a direct impact on the traveler, who is the cyclist. If the road is rough or its conditions are unknown, it poses challenges. For example, when the road presents a hill, the cyclist must climb it. The text mentions ""over a long crippling hill"", which emphasizes that the setting includes a difficult hill that the cyclist has to overcome."
532	6510	3	2	The features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. The lack of water, presence of hills, and deserts all play a role. When the cyclist spots water, all he can think about is quenching his thirst, comparing his parched state to that of battery acid. The hills slow the cyclist down, preventing a quick reach to the water. The desert, with its arid conditions, only intensifies the cyclist's desire for water. These features of the setting clearly affect the cyclist's experience and journey.
533	6511	3	2	The setting in the story presented numerous challenges for the cyclist on his journey to Yosemite National Park. In June in California, the extreme heat was a major issue, with the speaker stating that he could have succumbed to heatstroke. The rough road, characterized by bumps, hills, and wildlife, also hindered the cyclist's progress. However, the most pressing problem was the lack of water. To cope with the intense thirst, the cyclist resorted to sucking on stones. In conclusion, these elements of the setting significantly affected the speaker's journey.
534	6512	3	2	The cyclist is significantly affected by the features of the desert setting. Riding in an area with little to no rain means that if he runs out of water, he has no means of collecting more. The high temperatures in the desert accelerate the dehydration process, increasing his water requirements for survival. Running out of water could lead to his death. When the cyclist finds a building, it turns out to be abandoned and empty, offering no relief. With no water in sight, he must conserve his remaining supply. The heat is taking a toll on him, and the desolate landscape with an abandoned building only adds to his despair. Throughout this ordeal, thoughts of death fill his mind. However, when he puts pebbles in his mouth to distract himself from thirst and thoughts of death, he spots a bait - shop, which ultimately saves his life. His shift in focus from death to survival leads him to find a place where he can drink.
535	6513	3	2	"The setting had a profound effect on the cyclist during his ride. The quote ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke (pG @NUM1 kurmaskie)"" indicates that due to the heat, the rough terrain, and the length of what was supposed to be a ""shortcut"", the cyclist was running out of water. This realization dawned on him that he could die from heatstroke, a consequence of following the advice of a group of old men. In the end, the combination of these setting - related factors put the cyclist's life at risk."
536	6514	3	2	The setting significantly impacts the cyclist. Being in the desert with a limited water supply, the cyclist tires easily. Coupled with the need to pedal a bicycle, the cyclist experiences thirst and fatigue due to the desert environment. In conclusion, the setting has a notable influence on the cyclist.
537	6515	3	2	The setting has a substantial effect on the cyclist. The cyclist must be concerned about road conditions; poor conditions necessitate a reduction in speed. Additionally, the time of day matters. At night, cyclists need to be cautious as cars may not easily spot them. In the given text, the cyclist faced extremely hot weather, which can be perilous without proper preparations like having an adequate water supply. Overall, the setting poses various challenges to the cyclist.
538	6516	3	2	The setting has a profound impact on the cyclist. The cyclist anticipated a short, flat journey to Yosemite but instead encountered a long, hilly, and hot one. Having prepared only for a quick ride with just a few bottles of water, the cyclist was ill - equipped for the reality. Cycling in the middle of the day in the high deserts of California in June is extremely hot; typically, one would need six to seven liters of water, but the cyclist had far less. Moreover, the cyclist trusted the old men's advice on a safe path but came across a potentially poisonous diamond - back snake. Due to water shortage, the cyclist barely managed to pass it. Also, expecting a flat terrain, the cyclist found short, rolling hills that required more effort and water. The setting clearly makes reaching the destination difficult, yet it offers a valuable life lesson.
539	6517	3	2	The cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting. The dry and hot environment makes the cyclist constantly thirsty. Ghost towns in the area make it challenging to obtain supplies. Bad roads slow the cyclist down, potentially cause harm to both the cyclist and the bike, and require more physical exertion. In summary, the setting creates multiple obstacles for the cyclist.
540	6518	3	2	The features of the setting have numerous negative impacts on the cyclist. As the text states, the cyclist struggled to maintain balance in a dehydrated state in an unfamiliar place. This indicates that the combination of an unfamiliar setting and dehydration made the cyclist's situation difficult. In conclusion, the setting clearly had a detrimental effect on the cyclist.
541	6519	3	2	The biker initially traversed flat desert roads, which were easy to navigate. Upon reaching his first town, he persevered in his journey towards Yosemite. As his water supply dwindled, he searched for more to sustain his ride. Continuing on, he came across a fork in the road. After passing the fork, he encountered a new problem. An elderly person informed him that the town was @NUM1 miles away, but he was skeptical of the man's words. Nevertheless, he followed the advice and continued down the road. Subsequently, he faced yet another challenge. The flat road transformed into a series of short, undulating hills, which significantly depleted his stamina. Next, he had to contend with a rocky and bumpy desert road. Then, he had to avoid a snake to prevent an attack. Finally, after conquering the last long hill, he found a bait and tackle shop stocked with plenty of water.
542	6520	3	2	In the passage “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist's situation is worsened by the features of the setting. The cyclist is lost, has only managed to find dirty water, and is traveling on rough terrain. The setting is described as having “cool pines and rushing rivers,” but the cyclist discovers that the “rushing river” is not as refreshing as expected. He also experiences a change in terrain, from a flat road to short, rolling hills. There is a sign, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” which is also the name of the passage, with a speed limit of 55 mph, while the cyclist is only moving at 12 mph. Ironically, he comes across a picture of a boy drinking grape juice at a factory, which makes him hang his head in misery due to his intense thirst. Eventually, he arrives at a fish camp, where he meets the owner, who, ironically, tells him that he would be better off using his map.
543	6521	3	2	The features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist as he is on the road for an extended period. The absence of buildings, people, and cars makes the cyclist feel helpless when his water supply runs low. A ghost town does not offer any assistance, as an old man mentioned it, and the cyclist had hoped to obtain more water there. The abandoned grape juice factory also affects him, as he had expected to get a drink but was disappointed. In summary, these features of the setting have a detrimental effect on the cyclist.
544	6522	3	2	If I were the cyclist, the features of the setting would greatly impact me. I'd likely feel like I was on the verge of death, just as the cyclist did. There was nothing interesting to look at, no breeze or wind. He saw a snake and had no water. He passed through three towns that were completely barren. The sun was setting, and the heat was intense, leaving him with no hope. Perhaps if he had followed the map's directions, he would have been in a better situation.
545	6523	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. The cyclist is running out of water and is exposed to the intense heat of “the high deserts of California in June.” The tumbleweeds that cross his path further exacerbate his desperation. These setting features not only physically affect the cyclist by dehydrating him in the heat but also take a toll on his mental state. The cyclist encounters rolling hills, tumbleweeds, rattlesnakes, and ghost towns, all of which cause him to start losing hope. In conclusion, the features of the setting have both physical and mental effects on the cyclist.
546	6524	3	2	The setting's features had a significant impact on the cyclist. In the middle of the story, the setting was desolate, with no available water sources. This instilled doubt and despair in the cyclist, who feared for their life. The extreme heat also made the cyclist thirsty. Ultimately, the cyclist felt regret for following the advice of the old men as they failed to reach their intended destination.
547	6525	3	2	The author believes that the setting implies he is not approaching his destination. However, he discovered that there were still people nearby. He panicked and feared for his life. The places were deserted, and he thought they led nowhere. He was somewhat frightened by the possibility of death due to the lifelessness of his surroundings. Overall, the setting had a profound and distressing impact on the author's state of mind.
548	6526	3	2	The setting had a substantial effect on the cyclist. As the cyclist was biking in the desert, the intense sunlight made them hot and tired. This was evident from the description “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt,” indicating the cyclist's over - heating. In conclusion, the desert setting clearly took a toll on the cyclist's physical state.
549	6527	3	2	The extreme and unchanging features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist. The cyclist was riding on a small desert road. The intense heat in the desert caused the cyclist to sweat profusely and become dehydrated. Additionally, the cyclist had no sense of direction due to the vast expanse of the desert. The towns in the area were dilapidated and lacked any resources, so the cyclist could not obtain water to rehydrate. It was only when the cyclist reached a nearby small bait shop that they were finally able to get water.
550	6528	3	2	The setting had a considerable impact on the cyclist. The sun and the hot weather led to the cyclist's dehydration. The cyclist had nearly exhausted their water supply, as evidenced by the statement “The bottles contained only a few drops.” Moreover, the text “the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke” shows that the heat was severely affecting the cyclist. In conclusion, the harsh setting endangered the cyclist's well - being.
551	6529	3	2	As he set off on his bike, the surroundings were calm and peaceful. He wore a smile and his legs were full of strength. When he reached the @NUM1 town and saw a dilapidated shed, rusty pumps, and a corral, he started to worry because he was running out of water. As the flat roads gave way to short, rolling hills, his anxiety increased. Upon seeing a building, he felt happy, but his mood plummeted when he found it was in a state of disrepair. He was sad, thirsty, and exhausted. Finally, when he saw an old man and told him he had a map, he perked up a bit as he knew it would help him reach Yosemite. As the environment deteriorated, his spirits sank lower due to his dwindling water supply and a sense of hopelessness. However, the sight of the man brought him joy as the map offered a glimmer of hope.
552	6530	3	2	The story unfolds in a rather harsh setting. At the start, the boy was in good condition, carrying a bottle of water to prevent dehydration. While cycling, he gradually noticed the sun climbing higher in the sky, though the shade from the pine trees and the coolness of the nearby river made the heat less noticeable. When he reached the second town on his journey, he had been consuming water throughout the day and was nearly out. He discovered a water pump, knelt down, and pumped, but all that came out was blackish water. He was repulsed by it and claimed it tasted like battery acid. He resumed his ride. Just two miles up the road, the terrain changed. There were rolling hills, and the temperature was rising. He was severely dehydrated, with only a few tantalizing sips of water left. Dry sweat ringed his shirt, and he feared he might suffer from heatstroke. He found himself in the middle of nowhere, with no buildings, cars, or structures in sight. In the distance, he thought he saw a building and wiped the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage. It turned out to be a Welch's @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Factory. So dehydrated and tired, he could imagine a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth. Unfortunately, the factory was abandoned. He was hallucinating. He got back on his bike and put pebbles in his mouth to distract himself from the thirst.
553	6531	3	2	"I read ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" written by Joe Kurmaskie. In the story, the features of the setting influence the cyclist as he takes advice from ""old - timers who haven't left the confines of their porches @CAPS1 was in office"". This shows how the local environment and the wisdom of those who are deeply rooted in it can shape the decisions and experiences of the cyclist during his journey."
554	6532	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's essay ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"", the setting has multiple impacts on the cyclist. The sun is a significant factor, causing the cyclist to feel hot and become dehydrated. As the cyclist states, ""The sun was beginning to beat down"", highlighting its strong influence. Additionally, the country roads with their hills are challenging. Cycling up and down hills requires a great deal of energy. The cyclist mentions that ""@CAPS2 were replaced by short, rolling hills"". Moreover, the presence of snakes on the road makes the cyclist cautious to avoid getting bitten. He describes a situation where ""dimond back - blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me"". There is also an old factory that first gives the cyclist hope but then dashes it, and it even makes him thirstier. In conclusion, the setting has numerous and diverse effects on the cyclist."
555	6533	3	2	The setting's features take a heavy toll on the ill - fated cyclist. For instance, he was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The California deserts in June are extremely hot and dry, causing the cyclist to quickly deplete his water supply. As he continued his arduous journey, the terrain became even more challenging. He had to struggle over one long, exhausting hill. By this point, the cyclist was so worn out from the physical strain imposed by the setting that he could barely muster enough energy to get over a single hill. In the end, the harsh setting significantly hampered the cyclist's progress and well - being.
556	6534	3	2	The setting of this story has an encouraging impact as it presents a challenging yet similar ride. The terrain is rough, as indicated by a sign that reads, “Rough road ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit.” The cyclist has to navigate up and down hills with rocks and no water sources. Such a setting for a highly athletic ride can be extremely difficult. In conclusion, the challenging setting significantly shapes the nature of the story and the cyclist's experience.
557	6535	3	2	The cyclist and the settings in this story are not ideal, with several incidents posing problems. One issue is the bad weather, with a temperature close to @NUM1 degrees. The cyclist stops at a water pump, but the water that comes out is far from cool. Taking just two small sips, it tastes like battery acid; drinking more of it could potentially kill or severely sicken him. With another town @NUM2 miles away, he desperately needs something to keep going. As he rides down the road, he sees a sign warning of a rough road. Even at 12 mph, he could hit a hole and fly over his handlebars. If that happens, he might encounter the snake he saw earlier and then be vulnerable to birds as he would lack the energy to get up. Despite these difficulties, there are some interesting scenes in the story. Overall, the combination of adverse conditions makes the cyclist's journey fraught with challenges.
558	6536	3	2	Heat, water supply, and energy are all crucial aspects of the setting that can impact a cyclist. Excessive heat makes cycling more difficult and inconvenient. A limited water supply is also a major problem; as the author describes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” If a cyclist is not adequately prepared for their journey, running out of supplies can be extremely inconvenient. Energy is equally important, as it is what keeps a cyclist moving and motivated. The author states, “With what I believe, was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.” Once a cyclist runs out of energy, the ride effectively ends. In conclusion, these factors should be carefully considered before embarking on a cycling journey.
559	6537	3	2	The features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. The heat and lack of water lead to dehydration and may cause the cyclist to see mirages. The numerous hills in the terrain cause the cyclist to lose strength. Additionally, there is a very large snake that the cyclist has to pass by, which poses a potential danger as it could bite. In summary, the challenging elements of the setting make the cyclist's journey arduous and perilous.
560	6538	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in multiple ways. Climbing hills with limited water and the intense heat of the desert can both lead to dehydration. To reach the goal, it is essential to pace oneself and drink an appropriate amount of water. Rest is also crucial, as without sufficient energy, the cyclist will not be able to cover much distance. In conclusion, a cyclist must carefully manage their water intake, pacing, and rest to overcome the challenges presented by the setting.
561	6539	3	2	The characteristics of the setting have an impact on the cyclist. The presence of hills makes it arduous for the cyclist to pedal the bike uphill, and the tall and menacing - looking grass instills fear in the cyclist. In summary, the setting's features significantly affect the cyclist's experience.
562	6540	3	2	In the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed limit”, a cyclist embarks on a journey through the terrain to reach Yosemite. This part of California has few towns and people. The road the cyclist is riding on is long and dangerous. Moreover, the area is extremely dry and hot. Despite these challenges, the cyclist perseveres in their journey.
563	6541	3	2	The setting can influence a cyclist in multiple ways. Temperature is one factor; when it is hot, cycling long - distance becomes more difficult. This is evident in the story where the narrator states, “...and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke...”. Another aspect of the setting that impacts cyclists is the terrain. Cycling on flat, smooth ground is far easier than on rolling hills with rough, rocky surfaces. The quote “...ride down into distances I could see over the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine” illustrates this. In conclusion, the setting, whether it is smooth or rocky, hot or cool, can greatly affect a cyclist.
564	6542	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed the Speed Limit”, the features of the setting have a substantial impact on the cyclist. Each feature prompts a corresponding action from the cyclist. For instance, upon reaching the “ramshackle shed”, the cyclist discovers the water is unusable. As a result, the cyclist conserves water and attempts to head for the next town, leading them deeper into the high deserts of California in June. When the terrain changes from a flat road to short, rolling hills, the cyclist must adjust their speed to survive in a dehydrated state. The scarcity of buildings in the dry desert terrain compels the cyclist to search every “shack or building” for water. In this story, the setting's features play a crucial role in dictating the cyclist's actions in their desert survival quest.
565	6543	3	2	The cyclist in the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” experiences an adventure that turns sour. Although he has everything he needs, things go awry. He runs low on water, and the setting is dreadful. He is traveling from a campground in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 to the Yosemite River. He receives bad directions from some old men at the campground. On his journey, he encounters two abandoned towns and starts running out of water. Then, he comes across a sign that says, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. As he pedals over hills and becomes dehydrated, thinking he might die, he reaches a bait shop, gets water, and meets an old man who offers directions. He decides to stick to the map instead. Despite the deteriorating setting throughout the story, he endures and reaches the end of his journey.
566	6544	3	2	The cyclist's journey is significantly influenced by factors such as heat, hills, and ghost towns. The intense heat leads to dehydration and exhaustion, almost resulting in a heat - stroke. As a consequence, the cyclist drinks more frequently and nearly runs out of water. Hills demand a large amount of energy to climb, further exacerbating the dehydration. Ghost towns, on the other hand, make the journey seem hopeless, potentially causing the cyclist to lose the will to continue. In summary, these elements of the setting pose substantial challenges to the cyclist's journey.
567	6545	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist finds himself in the desert where the temperature is @NUM1 degrees. The water he has tastes like battery acid. The harsh desert environment causes him to see mirages and makes his sweat get into his eyes, adding to his discomfort during the journey. This difficult desert setting greatly impacts the cyclist's experience.
568	6546	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author recounts how following the advice of “old folks” led him to get lost. The setting had a profound impact on his journey. For instance, descriptions like “tumbleweeds crossed my path, and a ridiculously large snake…” and a “crippling hill” illustrate that the setting was quite intimidating. Overall, the setting played a crucial role in shaping the author's challenging journey.
569	6547	3	2	He is in a desert with a very hot climate, where he requires a large amount of water. However, his water supply is limited. Riding on hills makes his situation even more difficult. Moreover, he is unable to find any non - abandoned towns. These circumstances create a tough and challenging environment for him during his journey.
570	6548	3	2	In the story, the features of the setting have multiple effects on the cyclist. Time is one aspect affected; due to the nature of the road, the cyclist has to go slower, which means it takes him longer to reach the town. Additionally, the difficult road surface makes pedaling harder, causing him to get thirsty. And to make matters worse, the available water is really hot. In conclusion, the setting's features significantly impede the cyclist's journey.
571	6549	3	2	In the story, multiple aspects of the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist. Firstly, the cyclist was cycling in a sweltering desert. This environment typically makes it difficult to access water. Since water was essential for the cyclist, the scarcity of it in the desert led to the problem of dehydration. Moreover, the deserted town instilled a sense of doubt in the cyclist's mind. The cyclist then had to continue the journey with a doubtful mind and a body in desperate need. By the time the cyclist reached the old factory, extreme dehydration had set in. The cyclist's head was filled with annoyance, and the body was crying out for water. This abandoned juice - factory nearly extinguished the cyclist's hope. A person is almost nothing without hope, so the abandoned factory had a negative influence on the cyclist. The only reason the cyclist kept going was the instinct of survival. In conclusion, the desert deprived the cyclist of water, and the abandoned homes and factory took away hope. All three factors combined had a negative impact, and the cyclist was fortunate to have survived.
572	6550	3	2	The setting had a profound impact on the cyclist, who was left in a state of uncertainty about life and death. Due to the intense heat, the cyclist had consumed all of their water, leaving their mouth parched. This lack of water, brought on by the setting, put the cyclist's life at risk. In summary, the setting created a difficult situation for the cyclist, and it was a challenge for them to endure.
573	6551	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's short story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the setting significantly affects the cyclist in various ways. The cyclist is in an extremely hot environment, causing them to constantly drink water and worry about running out. Kurmaskie writes, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in @NUM1)"". Throughout the story, the cyclist is constantly affected by this concern. They realize that if they don't manage their water intake, they could die of heat - stroke. This is a common challenge that many people face, mainly due to dehydration. In conclusion, the hot desert setting in the story poses a significant threat to the cyclist's well - being."
574	6552	3	2	"It's often said that with age comes wisdom, but the world is constantly changing. For a solo cyclist, a better piece of advice is to not rely on the advice of old - timers who never leave the confines of their porches. The flat road the cyclist was on gave way to short rolling hills. A sign warned ""Rough Road ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit"". In conclusion, the cyclist needs to be cautious as the changing road conditions and the limitations of old advice can make the journey more challenging."
575	6553	3	2	"In ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", numerous elements of the setting affect the cyclist. The terrain is hilly and desert - filled. This causes the cyclist to constantly crave water. Riding on the hills and through the desert also exhausts the cyclist significantly. The cyclist is severely dehydrated, and when they do find water, it is described as ""tarlike"" and ""in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees"". It is evident that the cyclist is highly determined to reach Yosemite National Park, given the hardships they are willing to endure. The old men in Lodi, California, who had not left the town in decades, provided the cyclist with faulty directions that could have been life - threatening. The cyclist sought directions but received inadequate information, which made their journey extremely difficult. In conclusion, the challenging setting and unreliable advice made the cyclist's pursuit of reaching Yosemite National Park a grueling and dangerous one."
576	6554	3	2	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” impacts the cyclist in multiple ways. In mid - June, the cyclist is riding through a desert where the heat is intense. This forces the cyclist to consume more water. However, as his water supply dwindles, he struggles to stay hydrated. He starts to worry that he could suffer from heatstroke even on this seemingly beautiful June day. Additionally, the long - distance journey to Yosemite National Park, with its ever - changing terrain, takes a toll on him. The flat road gives way to short, rolling hills, which slows his speed and drains his energy, making it difficult for him to complete his trip.
577	6555	3	2	A response regarding how the setting features affect the cyclist goes awry when the cyclist gets wrong directions from an old man. One aspect of the setting is when the cyclist passes through a ghost town. The old people there unknowingly give him incorrect information. This makes his journey more difficult as he encounters tougher roads and has less access to water. He comes very close to death, highlighting the significant impact of the setting on his experience.
578	6556	3	2	The features of the setting pose challenges for the cyclist. The hilly roads are a problem, especially since the cyclist is old, making it arduous for him to pedal uphill. The sweltering heat exacerbates the situation, and his limited water supply is a major concern. He starts to hallucinate, seeing things that aren't real. When he attempts to get water, the high temperature causes the water from the pump to be hot, further adding to his discomfort and difficulties during the ride.
579	6557	3	2	Some features of the setting, such as the extreme heat, are affecting the cyclist. For instance, he is riding through the high deserts of California and is consuming a large amount of his water. When he stops at a place, the pipes and water - getting facilities are rusty and old. He also thought he could reach the next town for water. But the roads are hilly and short at first, and then they turn bumpy. No matter what, the cyclist is facing a lot of trouble due to the setting.
580	6558	3	2	In this short story, the character's mood changes according to his surroundings. At the beginning, he is enjoying his ride, saying, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name all over them.” As time passes, he realizes that the path he is on is uninhabited. His mood turns cautious, and the terrain becomes more challenging, which further affects his state of mind and the overall experience of his journey.
581	6559	3	2	The features of the setting significantly influence the cyclist. For example, in a desert, the lack of humidity exacerbates the issue of water scarcity. Moreover, numerous hills require the cyclist to exert maximum effort to ascend, further increasing the importance of water. In conclusion, if the temperature were stable and the terrain flat, the cyclist could cover more distance with a smaller water supply.
582	6560	3	2	When cycling, one should never take travel advice from a group of old - timers who haven't left their porches since Carter was in office. It's hard to determine if their advice is reliable as some of these people have been confined to their porches for a long time. It's quite puzzling why they haven't left their porches since then. In conclusion, relying on such advice can lead to unforeseen problems during a cycling journey.
583	6561	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's essay “Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist accepts directions from old men for a shortcut to Yosemite National Park. As a result, he finds himself cycling in a desert with no water, barely able to pedal his bike. The setting impacts the cyclist severely. The intense heat, lack of drink, no access to water or food, and the possibility of seeing mirages all take a toll. The essay states, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat - stroke.” This shows that the lack of water and the harsh environment make him lose hope of survival. Also, when he says, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get too excited,” it reveals that the desert makes him question his senses and constantly face disappointment. Clearly, the desert setting in this essay affects the cyclist in multiple ways.
584	6562	3	2	In my opinion, in “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting had a profound impact on the cyclist. He was in the desert with no water left, feeling extremely thirsty and fearing for his life. He regretted not taking the stranger's advice and was dying of thirst. Moreover, he lacked the will to live. All these factors show that the desert setting, with its lack of water and harsh conditions, greatly affected his physical and mental state. In conclusion, the setting in this story was a major factor in the cyclist's difficult situation.
585	6563	3	2	The setting's features have a substantial impact on the cyclist. Firstly, the hot weather and location play a role. The cyclist mentions being in “the high deserts of California in June”. The heat in the desert area intensifies the situation, as he states, “I could drop from a heat - stroke.” The sun's heat depletes the cyclist's energy for cycling. Secondly, the lack of water affects him. When he says, “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,” it shows that dehydration makes him tired. This tiredness makes it difficult for him to climb hills on his bike. Thirdly, the numerous hills on his route are a challenge. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” Given his lack of water and the heat, these hills are extremely hard to ascend. Overall, these features cause the cyclist to lose energy, become tired, and frustrated due to their negative influence.
586	6564	3	2	"Nature impacts everyone, even those who may not think so. This is particularly true for cyclists traveling far and wide. Joe Kurmaskie's ""Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit"" is a prime example of how settings can affect cyclists. When cycling as a means of cross - country transportation, one must be well - informed about their actions and destination. In the story, the cyclist took advice from older individuals and ended up on the wrong route. The so - called ""towns"" along the way had no water as they were no longer proper settlements. Without water, the hills could be life - threatening. The cyclist knew some survival tips, like gathering pebbles and putting them in his mouth as he had read that sucking on stones can distract from thirst. Had he not dealt with his thirst and the challenges of the hills, he might have suffered a stroke. These are just some of the ways in which the setting can harm a cyclist."
587	6565	3	2	In June, a cyclist was riding through the high deserts of California. One of the features of the setting that affected the cyclist was that the seal of something (presumably related to the bike) started to give way, but the cyclist only truly noticed it about twenty miles up the road when he came across a sort of park. The cyclist got on his hands and knees to work on the heated handle of a rusty pump. The pump then shot out a tarlike substance, and the water coming out was around two hundred degrees. After traveling two more miles, the cyclist noticed the terrain changing from a flat road to short, rolling hills. Tumbleweeds crossed his path, and a large snake slithered across the pavement. Remembering that sucking on stones can help with thirst, the cyclist gathered some pebbles and put them in his mouth. Clearly, these settings had a significant impact on the cyclist.
588	6566	3	2	"The features of the setting had multiple effects on the cyclist. Initially, the ""town"" the cyclist encountered was described as a ghost town. Even though the cyclist laughed it off, this setting foreshadowed the long and arduous journey ahead. There were other negative - impacting features as well. For instance, the terrain changed from flat land to short, rolling hills (pg @NUM1). Flat land is far easier for cyclists to pedal on, and this change affected the cyclist's stamina and will to continue. He had to exert a great deal of effort to go up and down each hill. However, his determination eventually led him to ""Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp"" (pg @NUM2), where he finally found hope."
589	6567	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's ""Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit"", the features of the setting had a predominantly negative impact on the cyclist. The large hills made the cyclist tired. The only positive aspect was that the cyclist liked the scenery. The cyclist's water bottle had only a few tantalizing sips, leaving him thirsty. Moreover, a ridiculously large snake, which really did look like a diamondback, blocked most of the pavement. This was a dangerous situation, and even though he was on a bike, the cyclist could have been bitten. All these factors clearly demonstrate the negative effects of the setting on the cyclist."
590	6568	3	2	The desert - like land had a detrimental effect on the cyclist. It made the cyclist tired and caused a loss of body water, making it necessary for the cyclist to have water to continue the journey. The thought of being extremely thirsty likely made the cyclist weaker. If the cyclist had not been constantly preoccupied with thirst, the ride would not have been so difficult. In conclusion, the harsh desert environment significantly hampered the cyclist's ability to have a smooth and easy ride.
591	6569	3	2	From the cyclist's account of his journey through Yosemite Park, readers can vividly envision riding alongside him. The bike - ride route is incredibly scenic. The cyclist encounters a diverse range of landscapes, including meandering rivers, arid sandy deserts, and lush areas filled with cool pines and other trees within the park. Additionally, a gentle breeze blew, likely maintaining a pleasant temperature throughout the ride. In conclusion, the description paints a picture of a captivating journey through Yosemite.
592	6570	3	2	In June, a cyclist embarked on a bike ride through California to Yosemite. The journey was fraught with challenges. The high - desert areas were swelteringly hot and lacked water sources. These conditions took a toll on the cyclist, leaving him dehydrated and exhausted. As he struggled to find water and reach Yosemite, he felt the full brunt of the harsh environment. He described the sun beating down on him and having only a few sips of water left in his bottles. All these factors significantly hampered his progress and his ability to access water. Ultimately, the features of this journey made the cyclist's trip extremely difficult.
593	6571	3	2	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, multiple features of the setting had a notable impact on the cyclist, mostly in a negative manner. The hills in the essay likely added to the cyclist's distress, especially with the sun blazing down on him. The road sign indicating a speed limit of @NUM1 while he was traveling at a water - depleting @NUM2 made him feel that life was cruel. He probably despaired of ever reaching his destination. The sign advertising grape juice further rubbed salt into the wound with its ironic undertone. However, towards the end, the bait shop provided much - needed relief to the cyclist. In summary, the setting plagued the cyclist until the last moment when he found some respite.
594	6572	3	2	Several features of the setting had a detrimental impact on the cyclist. The heat was a major natural factor that threw him off balance. It led to dehydration due to lack of water, and he started to become delirious. His vision became distorted, and he thought he was seeing things. The water from the pump was undrinkable because of a tarlike substance and was at a temperature of @NUM1 degrees. The Welch's factory he passed by was a constant tease as he desperately needed liquids, and the image of a little boy drinking Welch's juice on the building only made matters worse. Along with getting off - track due to directions, the setting made his bike adventure to Yosemite an almost unbearable experience. In conclusion, the combination of these factors made the journey extremely arduous for the cyclist.
595	6573	3	2	The setting has a profound impact on the cyclist in several ways. Firstly, the desert is extremely hot, which can quickly sap his energy and lead to dehydration. Secondly, there are few towns in the area. This means that finding shelter, supplies, or simply a place to rest is difficult. Finally, water is scarce. If the cyclist gets thirsty, it will be a challenge to replenish his water supply without coming across a town. In conclusion, the harsh desert setting makes the cyclist's journey a tough one.
596	6575	3	2	The setting significantly impacts the cyclist throughout his journey. The scene is set on a hot June day in the desert. The terrain is hilly with several changes. Due to the intense heat, the cyclist consumes large amounts of water, quickly exhausting his supply. As the story states, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This indicates that the heat led to excessive water consumption and subsequent depletion. Additionally, “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This shows that the hilly terrain made the cyclist tired and hot, causing him to drink water more rapidly than on a flat road in cool conditions. In conclusion, the setting causes the cyclist to become tired, hot, and thirsty, which has a profound impact on his entire journey.
597	6576	3	2	The story describes the cyclist in a desert - like area in Lodi, California. The setting is extremely hot, with sand everywhere and few places to cool off. The water and the environment in Lodi are about @NUM1 degrees in temperature. The cyclist is on a mission to reach Yosemite to escape the heat, find cool, shady pine trees to rest under, and access cool fresh water. However, the intense heat causes the cyclist to become dehydrated. In conclusion, the features of the setting in Lodi have a significant negative impact on the cyclist's well - being during his journey.
598	6577	3	2	The features of the setting have a substantial influence on the cyclist. For instance, if a cyclist is cycling in the snow, they can consume snow to prevent dehydration. In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” if the cyclist were cycling in winter, they would constantly be thirsty. Moreover, if the entire ride were downhill, the cyclist would become very tired. In conclusion, the characteristics of the setting, such as the weather and the terrain, can greatly affect a cyclist's physical state and experience during a ride.
599	6578	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the conditions for the cyclist are quite dangerous. As Kurmaskie (@NUM1) writes, “a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement balance my dehydrated state bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” There was a large snake in the cyclist's path, and since the cyclist couldn't identify it, it's evident that they are not a snake expert. Being in the desert on a long bike ride, the cyclist is dehydrated, and their water supply is nearly depleted. Throughout the journey, the cyclist faced many feared and dangerous challenges. In conclusion, the combination of the snake and dehydration made the cyclist's journey perilous.
600	6579	3	2	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist include the terrain, the lack of provisions, and the power of self - determination. The terrain forces the cyclist to ride through rough paths to reach their destination. For example, walking on sharp rocks can lead to rough spots where progress seems difficult. This is where self - determination becomes crucial. It is the ability to keep moving forward despite obstacles, knowing that there will be a better path or a reward at the end. Another feature is the lack of provisions. Without the right provisions to stay energized, the cyclist struggles to overcome obstacles or even push themselves to act. In conclusion, these features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist's journey.
601	6580	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit"", the terrain negatively impacts the author. He states, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June"" (Kurmaskie). This indicates that due to the summer heat in the desert, he drank water too quickly. After traveling for a long time without water, he chuckles, realizing he shouldn't have ignored the old man's advice. He explains, ""It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself."" This clearly shows how severely the terrain affected him, to the point where he even commends himself for having the energy to feel self - pity."
602	6581	3	2	The cyclist is already tired and thirsty, and the features of the setting exacerbate the situation. The setting is a desert - like area in California, where it is extremely hot. There are no signs of civilization, and the roads in the desert are hilly throughout. Moreover, the cyclist is dehydrating as his water supply has diminished. In conclusion, these features of the setting significantly impede the cyclist's journey.
603	6582	3	2	"The setting of the shortcut has numerous effects on the cyclist. For instance, he mentions rusty water that ""tasted like battery acid"", preventing him from drinking it and leading to dehydration. The story also states that ""flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills"", which made the journey more arduous as he had to exert more effort to climb the hills. Towards the end, he says, ""I began breaking my ride down into distances, I could see the horizon telling myself I could make it there."" This suggests that he has given up to some extent and realizes the journey will seem endless until he reaches his destination or worse, until he dies. In summary, the setting in the story has a profound and mostly negative impact on the cyclist."
604	6583	3	2	"Certain features of the setting affect the cyclist. The rolling hills, the presence of a poisonous snake, and the road conditions worry her. For example, @CAPS1 says, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and the diary."" This quote reflects @CAPS1's high level of doubt and the belief that she may not make it. Eventually, @CAPS1 reaches another destination and once again asks an older man for directions. In conclusion, the setting's features create significant challenges and doubts for the cyclist."
605	6584	3	2	"In @PERSON1's ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the features of the setting have a substantial impact on the cyclist. Firstly, the flat road turning into ""short, rolling hills"" increases the difficulty of the journey and makes the cyclist doubt his ability to reach his destination. Another significant aspect of the setting is the deserted desert. As described, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" However, the horizon serves as a source of hope for the cyclist. He says, ""I began breaking the ride down into distances: I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I'd be fine."" Without the challenging setting, the cyclist would not have faced such a serious situation. Fortunately, in the end, the setting also instilled in him the determination to succeed."
606	6585	3	2	Safety should always be the top priority. When cycling on the streets, one must exercise caution. Since I have limited understanding, I am unable to elaborate further.
607	6586	3	2	The biker gained confidence after listening to the old men. He cycled to the first town, but it was deserted, like a ghost - town. After that, he saw nothing: no cars, no buildings. He grew sad and dehydrated. The old men assured him that another town was ahead, so he put his trust in them again. When he saw a building approaching, it turned out to be just an old, dilapidated factory. He felt let down and was certain he would die on the spot. Then, he spotted a sign for a fish company! He was overjoyed as the place was real. He regarded them as his saviors. Clearly, the settings had a huge impact on the cyclist.
608	6587	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Limit”, multiple settings influenced the cyclist. For instance, when he reached a water pump and tried to get water, only a tar - like substance oozed out as he “worked the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength” (Kurmaskie). Another example is when he encountered rolling hills, scorching heat, and a snake that occupied most of the pavement. These settings significantly affected the cyclist during his journey.
609	6588	3	2	The features of the settings can impact the cyclist. If the cyclist is surrounded only by buildings and cars, they cannot break free and cycle freely. Thus, the settings have an effect on the cyclist's experience.
610	6589	3	2	The story's setting was hot, causing the biker to sweat profusely. The entire town was empty, and he passed by empty buildings. He also had to cycle through rivers and over large hills. As described, “somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” The lack of people in the town and the presence of high hills affected the cyclist. The desolate and challenging setting made his journey more difficult and demoralizing.
611	6590	3	2	The setting, a California desert in June, significantly influenced the cyclist. With no water available in the desert, he had to rely on the limited water he carried. As he cycled, the sun beat down more intensely, and the terrain transformed into short rolling hills. These hills demanded more effort from him, leading to dehydration. Given the lack of water in the desert, he was at risk of dying from dehydration. In such a harsh environment, the combined effects of the setting posed a severe threat to his well - being.
612	6591	3	2	When you're with your family in Ocean City, biking along the boardwalk, the only obstacle you face is other people. However, when you're in a race on winding roads, there can be numerous obstacles. The weather can be the biggest hurdle. You might pass out due to lack of water and scorching heat, or slip and fall on roads made slippery by rain. Moreover, nature can also present unexpected challenges. For instance, a ridiculously large snake once blocked most of the pavement in front of a cyclist. Just like encountering a snake, you never know what else nature might throw your way. All in all, the challenges in a race on winding roads are far more complex than a leisurely bike ride on the boardwalk.
613	6592	3	2	Numerous features of the setting impact the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through deserts. The quote “A ridiculously large snake” indicates that not only weather and climate are against the cyclist, but nature also poses a threat. The statement “I could drop from heat stroke” reveals the extreme heat in the cyclist's location. The description “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” vividly portrays the deserted area where the cyclist is. The mention “The bottle only contained a few tantalizing sips” shows that the cyclist has a scarce water supply in the desert, which is extremely dangerous. These quotes effectively draw the reader in and offer insights into the various features of the setting and the cyclist's difficult situation.
614	6593	3	2	In the text “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting have multiple effects on the cyclist. When the author mentions that the cyclist is in the deserts of California, it gives an indication of the high temperature and the potential harm caused by the lack of water. Additionally, the description of the water pumps and their output can evoke a feeling of disgust in the cyclist and emphasizes the importance of maintaining a good water supply. Overall, the setting in this text significantly influences the cyclist's experience and safety.
615	6594	3	2	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” several aspects of the setting affected the cyclist during his journey. A crucial factor was the cyclist being in a desert with an inadequate water supply. Another challenging aspect of the setting was the long - distance nature of his journey. The combination of these two factors - the arid desert environment with limited water and the extensive journey to Yosemite - likely presented the most difficult and demanding challenges for the cyclist. These elements together made his journey an extremely tough one.
616	6595	3	2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist as he was in the high deserts of California with a lack of water. For instance, the text stated that when he tried a drop or two of water from a pump, it had the flavor of battery acid. This clearly shows what came out when he attempted to get water. The extremely hot setting made the cyclist miserable in various ways.
617	6596	3	2	"In the story, the setting's features impact the cyclist as he has limited resources to rely on. Being in the desert, where there is usually little, the cyclist has a restricted supply of necessities, and cycling through it doesn't help. The old men who gave him directions made him think he could go longer before needing to stop. This affected him as his lack of water throughout the journey slowed him down and made him doubt he'd reach his destination. When he finally reached ""Gary & Wilber’s fish camp,"" he learned a lesson. When an old man asked if he knew the quickest route to Yosemite, he replied, ""Yes, I have a very good map."" This shows how the setting influenced his journey and his realization."
618	6597	3	2	"In numerous real - life scenarios, nature or the setting can be the most significant obstacle to success or even survival. The cyclist endured the blazing sun as he pedaled through an area that seemed like a desolate living room: dry, barren, and extremely harsh. The statement ""Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June"" depicts the intense desert heat. Another aspect of the setting was the ever - present hills. While pedaling down the hills was easier, going up and maneuvering the twists and turns presented a direct conflict. For example, ""with what I believed was my last burst of energy I maneuvered..."" Ultimately, the cyclist reached his destination with great relief, but the setting was the biggest hindrance along the way."
619	6598	3	2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by presenting him with even the simplest of challenges. A lack of water and the presence of a snake in his path are prime examples of how the setting influenced his journey. These elements made his cycling experience more difficult and added to the overall challenges he faced.
620	6599	3	2	"By accepting the old men's advice, the cyclist put himself in a position to face hardships that he could have easily avoided by using his map. First, he came across a ""ghost town,"" which was lifeless and, most crucially, without water. Then, he found a pump that dispensed water tasting like ""battery acid."" Next, he rode past a ""Rough Road Ahead"" sign, which was not encouraging on his journey. To make matters worse, he had to navigate around a tempting yet empty juice factory. Finally, the thirsty cyclist arrived at ""Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp."" To him, this simple bait shop was like a beacon of hope for sustenance. This shows how following the old men's advice led to a series of difficult situations during his journey."
621	6600	3	2	In this narrative, a cyclist set out with the goal of reaching Yosemite, California. At the start, feeling confident, he asked a group of elderly men for directions. These men, who seemed to have rarely left their porch, ended up leading him into the heart of the desert. Once in the desert, the scorching sun beat down on him, and his water supply was limited. There was no sign of any civilization. The intense heat made him extremely hot, tired, and desperately thirsty. Despite these hardships, he persevered. Eventually, he came across a small town where he could drink cool water and take a well - deserved rest.
622	6601	3	2	Throughout the story, the features of the setting had a predominantly negative impact on the cyclist. For example, he reached a town that a man had assured him existed, but it was abandoned. He let out a sad and hopeless laugh and indulged in self - pity. Another such feature was the Grape Juice Factory, which was also deserted. This made him hang his head, and the tune “Summer Time” echoed in his mind. Thirst was yet another issue; he put pebbles in his mouth to distract himself. Then he considered his possible fortune if he checked, though it seemed negative to him. In conclusion, the setting's features continuously challenged the cyclist, making his journey a difficult one.
623	6602	3	2	The features described in the essay impact the cyclist in multiple ways. As he progresses, he becomes fatigued and consumes more water. The roads turn rough, forcing him to slow down. Slowing down leads to increased tiredness and a greater need for water, but he has run out. Moreover, the old men he asked for directions seemed clueless. All these features cumulatively affect the cyclist, making his journey arduous.
624	6603	3	2	The setting had a profound impact on the cyclist. During his long ride, the unbearable heat beat down on him. There were no places nearby where he could refill his water bottle. As a result, he was dying of thirst and was completely lost, not knowing where he was headed or how far he had to go. The setting was crucial in this story, as it created a series of challenges that the cyclist had to face.
625	6604	3	2	At the beginning of the story, the cyclist encountered a flat and easy path. However, as the route became unfamiliar, it was filled with numerous hills and turns. This change in the setting had a significant effect on the cyclist. He was already low on water and starting to become dehydrated. The difficult terrain only exacerbated his situation, making his journey even more challenging.
626	6605	3	2	The setting has an impact on the cyclist. As he progresses, he begins to perceive things that influence his mental state. With the passing scenery swirling around him, he starts to feel deserted and misled due to the absence of signs indicating he is on the right path. Eventually, despite these challenges, his journey continues.
627	6606	3	2	The cyclist encounters numerous obstacles during his ride. For instance, there is a snake in his way, forcing him to carefully maneuver around it. Moreover, there are many hills, and he is uncertain if he can ascend them. Additionally, he is nearly out of water, putting him at risk of heatstroke or dehydration. In the end, he manages to overcome these obstacles and reach his goal.
628	6607	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead,” the author traverses various landscapes. All the places he visits fuel his determination as he seeks water and aims to reach Yosemite. This determination compels him to keep moving forward. Eventually, his perseverance pays off. After rounding a turn, he spots a place where he can get a drink and cool down, achieving a moment of relief.
629	6608	3	2	The characteristics of the setting influence the author during his cycling journey. They transform his hope into doubt. The absence of buildings and cars makes him think he will never reach Yosemite. Moreover, the rough terrain makes him question whether he will ever find water. Undoubtedly, if the setting had signs of civilization, such as buildings and people, the cyclist would have been in a better state of mind and more confident in his journey.
630	6609	3	2	Scorching temperatures, water scarcity, and waning hope are all elements of the setting that affect the cyclist. The high temperatures lead to excessive perspiration and a lack of hydration. As the water becomes hotter, it becomes difficult to replenish the lost moisture, and the body struggles to function without an adequate water supply. The cyclist begins to doubt his survival. However, he tries his hardest, pushes himself beyond his limits, and ultimately succeeds in making it through alive.
631	6610	3	2	The setting's features impact the cyclist as he becomes fatigued. In the story, the character rides his bike for an extended period, which leads to tiredness. He rides alone, surrounded only by trees and wild animals. This solitude and the long - distance cycling contribute to his exhaustion, ultimately showing how the setting affects the cyclist.
632	6611	3	2	The cyclist faces a rough journey due to various features of the setting. Hills offer a breeze when going downhill but make uphill rides arduous. Snakes pose a danger of biting, which can harm the cyclist. The heat can cause illness, and an insufficient amount of water leads to dehydration. These factors combine to make the cyclist's journey extremely challenging.
633	6612	3	2	The features of the setting have multiple impacts on the cyclist. One such impact is through the posted speed. Additionally, the cyclist encounters a rough hill in the setting. These aspects of the setting create difficulties for the cyclist, demonstrating how the environment can influence the cyclist's experience.
634	6613	3	2	The cyclist is significantly hampered by the conditions of his journey. The hills and bumpy road slow his progress. Dehydration also acts as a hindrance as his body craves water. Obstacles in the road, like a large snake lying across the middle, further impede his movement. With no water and at risk of heatstroke, his situation is dire. If he doesn't find help soon, his life could be in serious jeopardy.
635	6614	3	2	He was aware of what he was getting into. So, if he finds himself in need of water or anything similar, it is likely his own fault. He should have been more prepared and brought supplies with him. This lack of foresight leaves him vulnerable in his current situation.
636	6615	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit,” the setting significantly impacted the cyclist and his journey. The “deserts of California in June” made him prone to rapid fatigue. The shift from flat roads to hills eroded his confidence as the road sign stating “DO NOT Exceed 55 mph” seemed to taunt him, considering he could only manage @NUM1. Moreover, a large snake obstructed most of the pavement in front of the cyclist, creating an obstacle. All these elements of the setting affected the cyclist in various ways.
637	6616	3	2	The story advocates that more car - owners should choose to ride bicycles for commuting to work or school. By doing so, the amount of air pollution would be substantially reduced. This shift in transportation mode can contribute to a cleaner and healthier environment.
638	6617	3	2	The setting in the story exerts multiple effects on the cyclist. The local temperature influences his water - drinking behavior, leading him to fear for his life as he nears running out of water. The deserted “towns” he encounters make him doubt if he is on the right path. However, all these settings also serve as motivation for him not to give up and to persevere. Despite the self - doubt about his survival, he persevered. In the end, he achieved his goal, and all his efforts were worthwhile.
639	6618	3	2	Multiple aspects of the setting impact the cyclist. The terrain around him, the obstacles he faces, the presence of wild animals, and the scarcity of water all play a role. Additionally, an old man provided him with unimportant and outdated information. These factors collectively take a toll on his physical and mental strength, wearing him down and instilling fear.
640	6619	3	2	I believe several factors contributed to the cyclist's state at the end of the story. Firstly, the time of his journey was significant. Cycling in June, during summer, meant extremely hot weather. Secondly, he was traversing California, a place that is warm even in early @DATE1. Thirdly, he was traveling through deserts. Combining these factors, he was cycling on a sweltering June day in the deserts of California. These @NUM1 elements led to his predicament. He passed through abandoned towns in search of water and found an old well pump with scalding water that tasted terrible. He drank too much water at the start, leaving him with little more than spit towards the end. Fortunately, he stumbled upon a fish camp in the middle of nowhere and found water. These three factors caused him to over - consume water initially and left him with barely enough later.
641	6620	3	2	"The features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist. In some respects, they cause a bit of distraction with additional details, leading to confusion about what is actually being described. For instance, the line mentioning ""before the last world war"" is a minor detail that can throw one off, and it slightly affected me. In conclusion, these seemingly small features of the setting can disrupt the understanding of the cyclist's situation."
642	6621	3	2	"The setting that affected the cyclist was the limited supply of water. The text states that ""the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" Additionally, it mentions that ""I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing the spit to circulate."" The fact that the cyclist was trying to distract himself from thirst indicates that he was indeed thirsty. In conclusion, the lack of water in the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist."
643	6622	3	2	The features of the setting influence the cyclist due to the month being June and the cyclist having limited water. The cyclist became dehydrated as there were no buildings or water sources for many miles. Moreover, the cyclist followed the advice of old - timers, who did not seem to have accurate knowledge. In conclusion, both the weather conditions and the geographical location had a notable impact on the cyclist's journey.
644	6623	3	2	A cyclist pedaled through various terrains including hills, high desert, flat roads, and woods. He took the advice of a group of old men who claimed to know a shortcut to Yosemite National Park. However, this shortcut turned into a nightmare. The cyclist had only brought a limited number of water bottles and quickly drank them all. The changing setting of the story made the cyclist pedal at different speeds at times. The cyclist soon became exhausted and started to lose hope. The constantly changing terrain made him extremely thirsty. Eventually, he ran out of water and feared dying of dehydration or heat - stroke. As he climbed a long hill, he saw a bait store, stopped inside for a drink, and vowed never to listen to old guys' advice again. In conclusion, the challenging terrains and bad advice severely affected the cyclist's journey but he found a solution at the end.
645	6624	3	2	"The features of the setting made the cyclist happy because he met some people who told him about a route that could save a significant amount of time on his trip. As the text says, ""what I shouldn't have done was let them have a peck at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a 'shortcut' that was to slice away hours from my ride."" He also expresses the idea of not taking directions from old - timers. In conclusion, the promise of a time - saving shortcut in the setting initially made the cyclist happy, but there were implications as he later warns about following old - timers' advice."
646	6625	3	2	During the cyclist's journey to Yosemite, numerous obstacles impeded his progress and caused delays. For instance, he followed the advice of some old men who provided incorrect directions to his intended destination. Additionally, his water supply was dwindling, which led to a more rapid depletion of his energy than normal. The intense heat also contributed to his energy loss. The heat made him sweat profusely, rendering the water in his body ineffective. Overall, these factors significantly hindered the cyclist's journey to Yosemite.
647	6626	3	2	The setting's features had a substantial impact on the cyclist. In June, he found himself in the California desert. The high temperatures and scarce water supply can lead to dehydration, fainting, or even death. Water sources are scarce in deserts. The terrain was also unhelpful; the hills required a great deal of energy and made him perspire, causing him to lose fluid from his body. In conclusion, the cyclist was severely affected by the characteristics of the setting.
648	6627	3	2	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the rider has an analytical mind that is influenced by his surroundings. Initially, the rider ""rode into the morning...with a smile"" due to the bright sun, ""cool pines,"" and ""rushing rivers."" He placed great confidence in the directions given by the old men. His first disappointment occurred when he came across the ""ramshackle shed,"" and the sight of it troubled him, yet he continued riding. As he pedaled over the ""crippling hills,"" he began to doubt the wisdom of his journey. Eventually, he reached an old bait shop, and the ""modern bathroom"" he entered to drink from provided relief from the desert he had just traversed. All in all, the rider's experience was shaped by his environment and the events along the way."
649	6628	3	2	The features of the setting had a profound impact on the cyclist. The landscape presented challenges for cycling, with intense heat and limited water availability. Consequently, the journey was long, and the cyclist faced difficulties in reaching his destination. In summary, the setting's characteristics made the cyclist's trip arduous.
650	6629	3	2	At the start of the trip, the path was flat and the going was easy. It was a pleasant day, but the water supply was gradually running out. Soon, the path turned hilly and rough. Although the pine trees provided some shade, it was insufficient to assist the cyclist. After enduring a strenuous climb and a cycling journey through the woods, he finally reached a somewhat civilized area. In conclusion, the cyclist overcame various challenges during his trip to reach a more developed location.
651	6630	3	2	"The ""Rough Road Ahead"" essay addresses the perils of speeding and assault. It emphasizes the importance of following instructions and paying attention to signs. One should consistently be vigilant for signs and relevant details. In summary, adhering to these guidelines is crucial for safety."
652	6631	3	2	The factors in the setting that affected the cyclist were water temperature, rolling hills, and road conditions. Water was a significant factor as the cyclist needed cool water to stay hydrated. After running out of water, he came across a shed with pumps. He started pumping the water, but it was hot. He attempted to let it cool down, yet it remained so. Rolling hills presented another challenge. The road began flat and then turned hilly. Cycling uphill strained his legs and made it more difficult to continue. Road conditions also posed a hardship; the road was initially smooth but later became rough and rocky. In conclusion, the cyclist had to overcome these various challenges in the setting.
653	6632	3	2	The setting influences one's ability to move. The town and its hills had a mixed impact on the cyclist. The town hills were helpful, while the uphill climbs were not. When the cyclist saw the towns, he developed a negative attitude. He was upset and angry, fearing for his life as he thought he might die. He also declared that he would no longer trust old men as they seemed to have no idea about the directions. One might question why he trusted them in the first place. In conclusion, the setting and the interactions within it significantly affected the cyclist's state of mind.
654	6633	3	2	"The features of the setting have a substantial impact on the cyclist. For instance, the quote ""I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" indicates that his surroundings presented difficulties and challenges during his journey. Describing the hills as ""rolling"" enables the reader to visualize the obstacles he faced. Additionally, the sign reading ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" gives the impression that the character is in danger. Moreover, the description ""no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind"" foreshadows that if something were to happen to the character, he would be stranded and alone, with no one to assist him. Without these examples, the reader would struggle to grasp the troubles the cyclist had to overcome. In conclusion, these examples enhance the emphasis and meaning of the text."
655	6634	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in numerous ways. When the cyclist's water was too hot to drink, he put pebbles in his mouth, having heard that it would dilute his spit. The terrain in the story was rocky and hilly. These are the main features of the terrain that influenced the cyclist. In conclusion, the setting's features, such as the water situation and the terrain, had a notable impact on the cyclist's experience.
656	6635	3	2	The setting's features have a notable impact on the cyclist. Hills pose a challenge as they make pedaling more difficult. The abandoned town also affects him; upon arrival, he hoped to replenish his water supply and take a break, but finding it deserted dashed his hopes. Moreover, the highway is tough to ride on, and there is no accessible water source nearby. In conclusion, multiple aspects of the setting significantly influence the cyclist's journey.
657	6636	3	2	The features of the setting gradually fuel the cyclist's anger. At the story's start, the cyclist encounters poisonous snakes, a dilapidated shed, rusty pumps, and a corral in poor condition. These sights trouble the narrator, who begins to feel frightened and neurotic. As he cycles, his water supply dwindles. When he stops to refill, the water is uncool and tastes like battery acid, frustrating him. The increasing steepness of the hills further annoys him. The final blow comes when he passes what he thought was a Welch's Grape Juice Factory. In a fit of outrage, the narrator expresses a desire to die on the road to escape the dreadful setting. In summary, the cumulative effect of the setting's features drives the cyclist to despair.
658	6637	3	2	"While traveling, the cyclist is significantly affected by the features of the setting. He is extremely thirsty and tired, and the setting offers little hope of survival. His first encounter is a ""ghost town"" with no inhabitants. This initial experience of isolation doesn't have a major impact as it's the first such place he finds, but the rest of the setting follows suit. As he journeys on, he encounters barren land, no water, and no people. It's June in California, and he fears heat - stroke if he doesn't find water. An abandoned juice factory, which taunts him with the one thing he needs, only worsens his situation. In conclusion, the setting makes the cyclist lose hope and feel that he'll die without water."
659	6638	3	2	"The story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" is set in the hot and dry terrain of California. This setting influences the character's mood as some of its features can be seen as metaphorical of certain moods. For example, the quote ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite..."" suggests a calm and relaxed tone for the scenery. The mood of the scene being observed is transferred to the character. In conclusion, the setting in the story plays a crucial role in shaping the character's emotional state."
660	6639	3	2	"The impact of the setting's features on the cyclist depends on the location. In this story, the desolate desert, the heat, and the sense of nothingness around him give him no hope. His statement ""It didn't really matter I was going to die"" reflects his thoughts while dying of thirst. He feels hopeless and certain of death until he spots a sign of civilization nearby, which restores his hope. In conclusion, the cyclist's state of mind is closely tied to the nature of the setting he is in."
661	6640	3	2	The setting's features have numerous impacts on the cyclist. The long, hot, and desolate journey instilled fear in him, causing him to continue for a longer time. With no water to drink, he thought he was on the verge of death, which weakened him. The snake on the path further prolonged his journey, and every previous stop also affected him. In essence, the setting presented multiple challenges that significantly influenced the cyclist's experience.
662	6641	3	2	I believe that cycling for an extended period can be uncomfortable for one's posterior. However, it also serves as excellent exercise, particularly for the legs, as it builds muscle strength. Figuring out the route can be a time - consuming task. Cyclists have to confront various weather conditions, but as long as they are properly equipped, they can avoid harm. All in all, cycling has its pros and cons related to comfort, exercise, navigation, and weather.
663	6642	3	2	Initially, the cyclist was angry because he took advice from old men who never left their porch. As he drank all his water and didn't know when he'd get more, he became terrified of dying. He made a mistake by consuming his water so rapidly, considering he still had a long way to go. Then, upon seeing the bait sign, his mood shifted to happiness, and he quickly biked down the hill. In conclusion, the cyclist's emotions fluctuated greatly during his journey due to his actions and the events he encountered.
664	6643	3	2	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the setting's features have a profound impact on the cyclist. The depressing and frightening setting affects him right from the start. When he first spots the 55 - mph speed - limit sign, he remarks that life can be cruel, as he can only manage 12 mph on his bike. After that, a snake crosses his path. It scares him as it resembles a diamondback, and he struggles to maintain his balance while passing it. The main issue he faces is the lack of water, and the dry, long hills exacerbate his weakness and tiredness. Tumble weeds pass by, and there is no water in sight. These are the ways in which the setting's features influence the cyclist."
665	6644	3	2	"The setting's features had a substantial impact on the cyclist. It led to his dehydration. For instance, in the story ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist said, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This statement shows that the heat and climate of the setting made him lose his balance and ultimately led to his dehydration. In conclusion, the setting in the story had a clear and significant effect on the cyclist."
666	6645	3	2	In this story, the setting significantly impacts the cyclist. Currently, California is experiencing extremely hot weather as the narrator is on a ride. This causes the cyclist to become overly excited quickly during a “short hit” that leads nowhere. The description “Wide signs of dried outcast winded my limb, and the growing realization that I could drop from a gorgeous day in June” depicts the calmness of the day. The fact that the cyclist is sweating profusely indicates the substantial influence of the weather on him. The rolling hills in the story also affect the cyclist. Frequent up - and - down cycling makes his journey more challenging. It forces him to take a longer route to reach a town with water. The deserted areas in the setting also have a negative impact on the narrator. The lack of places to stop and the depletion of his water supply make his narration hopeless. Overall, the setting in the story creates numerous difficulties for the cyclist.
667	6646	3	2	Joe Kurmaskie faced a difficult journey while trying to reach Yosemite National Park. He got directions from an old man and followed them, unaware that many hardships awaited him. After reaching the first town, he checked his supplies. As he traveled about @NUM1 more miles through the high deserts of California, he noticed his water bottle was getting low. The weather there was hot, and then the terrain changed. With less water, he encountered a snake, which he claimed was an almond - back. Finally, he reached another town, replenished his water supply, and left after passing through ghost towns. Cycling in hot and unfamiliar conditions is tough, and combining hills with the heat is a bad idea. With nothing around, it can be very dangerous, even life - threatening. Therefore, before going on a bike trip, one should consider the conditions ahead.
668	6647	3	2	He was determined to make it right, so he decided to go. He was driving at speeds of 55 mph and sometimes 12 mph. Life can often feel cruel, and that's just the way it is. Sometimes, the journey is filled with difficulties, especially when driving at such varying speeds. In the end, it's a fact of life that things don't always go smoothly, and we just have to accept it.
669	6648	3	2	Whenever the author reaches a point where the setting is unappealing or unhelpful, he loses hope of reaching his destination or finding a suitable place to rest and obtain fresh water. For instance, the text states, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). At this moment, the author adopts a negative and sarcastic tone, which indicates his frustration and the loss of some hope. His mention of the “sight was troubling” shows the significant impact that the surrounding features and scenery can have on him. In conclusion, the setting in the author's journey has a notable influence on his mental state and outlook.
670	6649	3	2	Many features of the setting have an impact on cyclists. In @MONTH1, factors such as the heat, flat roads that are difficult to ride on, and other elements can affect them. These aspects of the setting can make cycling more challenging, whether it's due to the physical exertion in the heat or the lack of favorable road conditions. Overall, the setting plays a crucial role in the cycling experience.
671	6650	3	2	This essay tells an American tale that depicts the arduousness of undertaking a task. However, it is accomplished through determination. The cyclist faces numerous changes, not only physically but also mentally. There is nothing in sight, no buildings or anything else. As the cyclist reflects on the substantial beating endured during the ride, he is exhausted, and with no sign of the destination, he begins to doubt his ability to continue. In the end, the cyclist's perseverance in the face of such difficult circumstances is what will determine whether he can complete the journey.
672	6651	3	2	The setting's features significantly impact the cyclist. In June, he is traveling through a California desert. The extremely hot weather makes him desperately need water. As the water he brought runs out and he can't find any more on his own, he becomes thirsty and nearly dehydrated. Moreover, when he does find water, it is not only hot but also tastes like battery acid, which is frustrating. When the cyclist decides to conserve water and head to the next town, another obstacle arises. The poor road condition limits his speed to no more than 12 mph. So, even if he reaches the next town, he will have to wait longer for the much - needed water. Fortunately, he manages to escape a snake, another setback. In conclusion, the cyclist's primary concern remains the lack of water.
673	6652	3	2	The features of the setting had a profound and varied impact on the cyclist. At the start, it was a bright, sunny day, and the cyclist was in high spirits. When he reached the first town, a ghost town, it dampened his mood. As he continued riding, he started losing water. The once - sunny day now bore down on him with intense heat. When he reached a dilapidated shed, his hope began to fade. He lost water rapidly and became more dehydrated. The terrain turned into slopes and hills, making the ride much harder. By the time he reached the grape - drink factory, his hopes were almost gone. But just beyond the hill was a fishing shop. He summoned his remaining energy to speed down the hill, get water, and regain his strength. Ultimately, the cyclist overcame the challenges posed by the setting through his determination and the lucky discovery of the fishing shop.
674	6653	3	2	The setting's features influence the cyclist in multiple ways. For instance, the description “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them” shows that such a setting makes the cyclist determined. Another case is “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake – it really did look like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” This kind of setting makes the cyclist brave and courageous. The statement “I hung my head” indicates that the corresponding setting makes the cyclist despair. In conclusion, different features of the setting can evoke various emotions and states of mind in the cyclist.
675	6654	3	2	In the essay “Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit,” the setting affects the cyclist both positively and negatively. The setting refers to the surroundings where the story takes place. In the story, the cyclist loses his way and is put in danger because of it. The story's setting can be described as mountainous with many rolling hills. The author describes the setting by stating “Two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.” This change in terrain makes it more difficult for the cyclist. However, he also uses the land as a source of hope, telling himself that he'll make it if he gets over the next hill. Overall, the setting provides both hope and problems for the cyclist on his journey to survive.
676	6655	3	2	The cyclist was influenced by inaccurate advice from some elderly men. Subsequently, he cycled across a sweltering desert. With a limited water supply, his situation deteriorated significantly, and he nearly suffered heat - strokes multiple times. It's likely that he was angry at himself for following the men's advice and getting into this predicament. When he finally found the fish camp, he felt overwhelming relief. However, had he sought directions from someone else, he wouldn't have been in this mess in the first place. This left him in a confusing state, feeling both relieved and angry. Later, another old man asked if he knew the best way there. He was wise to answer yes because otherwise, the old man might have given him more misleading directions, potentially leading him back into a situation where he'd be on the verge of another heat - stroke.
677	6656	3	2	The setting's features impact the cyclist as they speed down a hill, experiencing an exhilarating rush. The fresh morning air fills their lungs, and it's a liberating feeling of just them and their bike. They pedal as fast as they can, their heart pounding in their chest. There are no boundaries; they can go wherever and whenever they please. With no people to impede their need for speed, the setting truly enhances this sense of freedom and excitement, making the cycling experience all the more memorable.
678	6657	3	2	"In the short story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", it is evident that the features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist throughout the narrative. The cyclist embarks on a mental and physical journey while riding his bike, and his lack of awareness of his location on this journey makes the setting's influence more pronounced. As he progresses, he is affected by the old towns and desert landscapes he encounters; he even remarks that ""The sight was troubling."" Traveling to California in June, the intense heat and the long - distance journey take a toll on him both mentally and physically. For instance, he says, ""I got down my hands and knew working the hands of the rusted water pump with all my strength."" This quote shows that after biking for a long time, in search of water with no town in sight, he becomes weak. Despite his determination to complete the journey, the setting makes him feel more hopeless and self - pitying. In conclusion, the setting in the story plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience."
679	6658	3	2	Directions, the month of June, and a lack of water are all factors that affected the cyclist on his journey. He took directions from older individuals who promised him a shortcut. Unfortunately, the so - called shortcut turned out to be incorrect. The trip took place in June in California, where the weather was extremely hot. Moreover, he had consumed most of his water during the journey. He could have died if he hadn't found another water source. These elements significantly influenced the cyclist's trip, highlighting the importance of accurate information and proper preparation for such a journey.
680	6659	3	2	"In ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. These features alter the speaker's mood throughout his journey. At the start, upon encountering a deserted town, he became cautious. Then, a fork in the road troubled him. As he passed a snake and faced the challenges of the hills, his determination grew. Finally, when he reached Gary and Wilber's fish camp, his determination transformed into relief. In summary, the setting in the story substantially affects the cyclist by changing his moods and attitude towards his journey, demonstrating how the environment can shape a character's emotional state during an adventure."
681	6660	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed Limit,” a man follows some inaccurate directions and gets stuck in the middle of a desert without water. As the setting changes, he begins to lose confidence in the directions. He remarks, “After forty miles of pedaling, I reached the first town, which perfectly fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” He was told it was a thriving town but found it desolate, which was a major disappointment. The cyclist then started to doubt if this was the right choice. He continues riding and encounters another disheartening sight. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold even the tamest mule greeted me.” This place, too, was said to be good, but all he got was water that tasted like battery acid. On the last stretch of his bike ride, he faced rough rolling hills, a diamondback - like snake, and an abandoned juice factory. All these experiences gradually lowered his spirits until he thought he might die. Eventually, the cyclist found a store, but he was discouraged by the hot environment. He was in a perilous situation where he could have died.
682	6661	3	2	In the essay, the cyclist is significantly influenced by the features of the setting. Under the given conditions, he can barely survive and reach his destination. It becomes evident that the setting affects him when he says, “The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water - depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cruel.” As he makes efforts, he grows weaker. The signs he sees only worsen his mood as they seem to mock him. He also states, “I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate. With any luck, I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” This shows that he is on the verge of giving up completely and doesn't care if he dies. Based on the author's tone, it is clear that the features of the setting do have an impact on the cyclist.
683	6662	3	2	The setting's features, including the hot sun, lack of potable water, and “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp,” had a substantial impact on the cyclist. Since the cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June, the high temperature was intense. The hot sun left “wide rings of dried sweat” on his shirt, making him aware that he could collapse from a heatstroke. Moreover, the only available water felt “somewhere in the neighborhood of two - hundred degrees” and “had the flavor of battery acid,” preventing the cyclist from drinking it and leaving him in a “dehydrated state.” However, “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp” alleviated the cyclist's dehydration problem as there was cold water available for him upon arrival.
684	6663	3	2	The features of the setting have numerous effects on the cyclist. Firstly, if the cyclist hadn't listened to the old man, he wouldn't have encountered such troubles. Additionally, setting out on his ride with insufficient water led to severe dehydration. He should have turned back as soon as he ran out of water. The intense heat also made him extremely hot and thirsty. He ought to learn not to trust strangers blindly and instead rely on his own judgment.
685	6664	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. The setting makes him feel thirsty, dry, hot, and lost. In the story, the setting plays a crucial role in the cyclist's determination to ride to the next town. First, the cyclist asks for directions from a man who hasn't left his house in decades, which creates doubt in his mind. The story also mentions, “Tumbleweeds cross my path,” which makes the cyclist feel lost. Finally, it states that “the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,” making the cyclist both thirsty and tired. Clearly, the features of the setting have a definite effect on the cyclist.
686	6665	3	2	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the cyclist is significantly influenced by the setting. The story takes place in the middle of summer in the extremely hot state of California. The sweltering heat causes the cyclist to sweat profusely and deplete his water supply, putting him at risk of dehydration. Moreover, the roads are hilly, which demands a great deal of extra energy from the cyclist to ascend them. Considering these factors, it is evident that the setting has a profound impact on the cyclist in the story."
687	6666	3	2	The cyclist faced challenging conditions during his ride. In June, he found himself in the high deserts of California, a place that typically evokes an image of extreme dryness and heat. The cyclist struggled to find the water he needed and feared succumbing to heatstroke in such harsh conditions. Additionally, there were hills on his route, including one long, arduous hill that he had to traverse. As an experienced cyclist, I can attest that hills are the most difficult part of a ride, especially when one is thirsty. With the hot and dry climate and hilly terrain, it is clear that this was a dreadful bike ride.
688	6667	3	2	The biker had to contend with a host of challenges due to the specific settings. In the desert, he encountered a diamond - back snake. The temperature soared to around @NUM1 degrees, making the heat almost unbearable. While cycling, he had to climb steep and exhausting hills. The conditions he had to bike in were truly absurd. In my opinion, I would never have the ability to endure what he went through.
689	6668	3	2	The cyclist encountered numerous issues due to his surroundings. The intense heat led to a rapid depletion of his water supply, resulting in dehydration. With little to no civilization in the area, there was no one available to assist him. Moreover, the path he chose was long and strenuous. In summary, the combination of these factors made the cyclist's journey extremely difficult.
690	6669	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the author portrays the setting as hot, tiring, and oppressive. Through the bikerider's description of his surroundings, we can envision the high deserts of California in June, characterized by a hot and stuffy atmosphere and rough terrain. This description allows us to understand both the physical and emotional state of the bikerider. It shows how exhausted, parched, and determined he is. By using words, metaphors, and imagery, the author effectively places the reader in the bikerider's shoes, both physically and emotionally."
691	6670	3	2	The characteristics of the setting in the area around @LOCATION1 have an impact on the cyclist. Receiving advice from older individuals in an open - land area can also influence the cyclist. In conclusion, the setting and the advice from the local older people both play roles in affecting the cyclist.
692	6671	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the settings influence the cyclist in terms of the difficulty of his ride. When the road was smooth, he could ride fast, but when there were hills, it took him longer to reach the next town. In conclusion, the nature of the road, a key aspect of the setting, significantly affected the cyclist's progress.
693	6672	3	2	In the text, various features of the setting impact the cyclist's journey and mobility. The desert is one such feature. The cyclist is “traveling through the high deserts of California in June”, which makes him extremely thirsty. As a result, he regularly drinks from his water bottles and later runs out of water. With no buildings or establishments in sight, he becomes hopeless. Another influential feature is the people who gave him directions. They told him about a shortcut, and following their advice threw his plans off, leaving him in despair. The Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, on the other hand, led to his success in finding water, which restored his hope. In conclusion, multiple features of the setting had diverse and significant impacts on the cyclist's mood.
694	6673	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for multiple reasons. If the setting is dark and rainy, people are not likely to be running outside. Similarly, if it is snowing, people will not be swimming in the water. In conclusion, different weather - related features of the setting restrict the cyclist's activities and overall experience.
695	6674	3	2	This explains how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Some people do not pay attention to these features. Everyone is working towards achieving good features, yet there are others who still take from those who work hard every day to have new features. In conclusion, the lack of respect for the efforts related to the setting's features and the act of taking advantage impact how the setting affects the cyclist.
696	6675	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's ""Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the setting influences the cyclist, causing him to be doubtful. The cyclist doubts his ability to reach Yosemite National Park. The statement ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the vultures would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom and their keen senses of direction"" demonstrates his doubt. Ultimately, in the story, the cyclist believes they won't make it."
697	6676	3	2	"In the passage, the characteristics of the setting impact the cyclist as every time he encounters something new, a thought about his survival enters his mind. Initially, when the cyclist spots the mule, he remarks, ""This sight was troubling."" He becomes troubled because he hasn't seen a town yet and starts to question the old men's advice. Additionally, when he sees the juice factory, he puts some pebbles in his mouth and says, ""It didn't really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" This indicates that seeing the dilapidated juice factory gives him no hope, and he convinces himself that he will die."
698	6677	3	2	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the setting significantly affects the character. The cyclist is attempting to reach Yosemite National Park, but on the way, he faces difficulties. The lack of civilization means he cannot refill his water bottles, leaving him extremely thirsty. Moreover, the numerous hills and the summer heat greatly impact him, as he tires more easily and cannot pedal as fast. The description ""A tar - like substance oozed out. Wouldn't cool down"" shows his inability to drink. Passing the grape juice factory must have been torture for him due to his intense thirst. Had he not followed the advice of the men, his ride would have been much shorter, and he would not have been so exhausted. Clearly, the setting has a substantial impact on the cyclist in this essay."
699	6678	3	2	"At the start, the cyclist embarks on what seems like a great idea and from a good place. However, the conditions soon turn hot, dreadful, and perhaps sticky. The unrelenting heat without a breeze starts to affect the cyclist. He thinks he sees mirages. He even begins to believe he might die. His statement ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean…"" shows his despair. The heat must have been so bad that he isn't thinking clearly and seems to be losing his sanity. Although the painful heat is a harsh way to learn a lesson in cycling, especially with the so - called ""help"" of the old men with directions, it is a valuable but tough experience."
700	6679	3	2	"When the cyclist starts his journey, he has complete faith in the directions given by the old men. After reaching the first town and finding no water, he continues riding. When he comes across a ""ramshackle shed"", he becomes troubled. Since he has been regularly drinking from his water bottles and is traveling through the ""desert of California in June"", his water supply is running low. When he sees a building over the hills and maneuvers his way down, he finds it deserted and nears despair. He is desperate for water and needs it urgently. Finally, he arrives at ""@CAPS1 and Wilber’s Fish Camp"", quenches his thirst, and feels relieved. After this experience, he becomes wiser and no longer takes directions from old men who know little about cycling."
701	6680	3	2	"In the story ""DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the setting's features have numerous impacts on the cyclist. Firstly, the cyclist suffers from a severe lack of water, and there are no water sources for miles around. As described in the text, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" This evidence indicates that the cyclist is growing worried. Secondly, the temperature is a significant factor. The cyclist is in a hot, unforgiving desert. The author writes, ""Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."" By using natural elements, the author aims to make readers concerned for the main character. Lastly, the long distance the cyclist has to travel and the road conditions pose challenges. Despite the desert being flat, the cyclist notices hills on the road. The combination of the long distance and the heat can be life - threatening. In conclusion, the elements of the setting have a profound effect on the cyclist in this story."
702	6681	3	2	"The cyclist in ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"" endured significant pain and displeasure due to the setting of his bike ride. In June, he travels through the high deserts of California. He exaggerates that the water situation there was dire. The intense heat made him drink water rapidly, depleting his supply much faster than he had hoped. It also sapped his energy, making the ride more difficult. Along the way, there is nothing around, and he has no place to replenish his water. The hilly and rough terrain requires strenuous pedaling, further draining his energy. The combination of the heat, the terrain, and the lack of stopping places made the ride an awful experience for the cyclist. In conclusion, the setting of the ride was a major obstacle for the cyclist."
703	6682	3	2	"In ""@PERSON1""'s ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit"", the lone biker is strongly influenced by the landscape features. The sun is the most crucial factor. It compels the biker to consume water quickly and then search for a water source. The quote ""The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it...I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly"" shows that even though the biker didn't consciously feel the sun's impact, his body's need for water depleted his water - bottle supply. The biker describes the lack of water as ""feeling two hundred degrees...it had the flavor of battery acid."" The only water he can find is unfit for consumption. In terms of survival, the fish camp the biker finally reaches is of utmost importance. As stated, ""I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink."" The biker was on the verge of dehydration, and the fish camp gave him the strength to continue his journey. In conclusion, the landscape features, especially the sun and the availability of water, had a significant impact on the biker's survival and journey."
704	6683	3	2	The dryness, thirst, and tedium of the setting all have an impact on the cyclist. The environment is extremely dry, and the cyclist is far from any town that could offer assistance. He has been pedaling in the heat outdoors for a long time. Thirst is also a major issue. The way he is traveling indicates his need for water. He cycled forty miles before reaching the first town to stop at. Since he is on a bike, he has limited space to carry water. The trip is also tedious. He has traveled forty miles, while the speed limit is 55 mph, but he has not exceeded 12 mph. Overall, the cyclist's trip is an arduous adventure that requires a great deal of determination. In conclusion, the setting makes the cyclist's journey a challenging one.
705	6684	3	2	"In the story, the setting has a strong impact on the cyclist because he was neither mentally nor physically prepared for his destination. As the text states, ""No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who hasn't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office."" A young cyclist took bad advice from older men about how to reach a backpacking spot. In their day, it might have been a shortcut. However, this ill - advised route likely led the cyclist into a difficult situation. In conclusion, the setting, combined with the wrong advice, made the cyclist's journey much more difficult than expected."
706	6685	3	2	The sweltering heat of the setting took a toll on the cyclist. As he pedaled on, he found himself out of water, and there were no towns with potable water in sight. It was not until he reached a fishing compound that he found some relief. Due to the lack of water, he became dehydrated and extremely weak. His claim, “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” clearly indicates his dwindling energy and the onset of dehydration.
707	6686	3	2	The setting of a bicycle ride can significantly influence its quality. A hot day with numerous hills presents challenges, while a sunny, breezy day on flat terrain makes for an enjoyable ride. In the essay, the biker was going downhill, which was likely an easy part of the journey. However, the fact that he had run out of water was a major drawback. Overall, the combination of setting elements can either facilitate or impede a cyclist's experience.
708	6687	3	2	In June, during a hot summer day, the setting of the story had a profound mental impact on the cyclist. As he pedaled hard, the sun was constantly on his mind. With very little water and the scorching sun beating down on him, his situation was far from ideal. He faced a series of difficult events, including pedaling up slopes at a faster - than - normal pace, encountering a snake on the path, being advised by old men to take a different route to avoid infection, and having a low water supply, which made him fear passing out under the burning sun. Nevertheless, his determination was unwavering. He continued to pedal and eventually reached a town with people, fish, and water.
709	6688	3	2	The setting can affect a cyclist through various conditions, such as the weather, the surrounding environment including hills, streams, and the types of animals present, and whether those animals are poisonous. These factors have the potential to change the decisions a cyclist makes. In essence, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping a cyclist's journey and choices.
710	6689	3	2	The characteristics of the setting have multiple effects on the cyclist. The intense heat of the sun causes the cyclist to become dehydrated, and the absence of nearby water sources means the cyclist cannot replenish lost fluids. Additionally, the rough terrain tires out the cyclist. In conclusion, the setting's features, like the sun and terrain, can have a detrimental impact on the cyclist's physical state during the ride.
711	6690	3	2	The various features of the Californian desert significantly influenced the cyclist's journey. Ghost towns, rolling hills, and dangerous snakes all had an impact on his experience as he took the “shortcut” to Yosemite. The ghost towns along the way symbolized a world that seemed to abandon him. They offered no assistance in terms of water supply or a place to cool down. The road sign warning of rough terrain presented another obstacle. The cyclist, dehydrated, had to overcome this challenge to reach his goal of Yosemite. The diamondback rattlesnake added to the horror of his “ride from hell.” Dehydrated and unstable, he had to carefully maneuver around the serpent. All these elements of the riding setting affected his journey to Yosemite.
712	6691	3	2	The features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist. If it is raining or snowing, the pavement can become wet and icy. This condition causes the cyclist to slip, and there is a high risk of injury. Additionally, the cyclist must wear appropriate gear. In very hot weather, wearing winter clothes would make the cyclist unfocused and unable to complete a race. In conclusion, the setting's features, such as weather - related conditions and the need for suitable clothing, play a crucial role in a cyclist's performance and safety.
713	6692	3	2	The features of the setting pose challenges to the cyclist. The presence of hills and a snake prevent him from going farther. When he discovers a bait shop, he feels relieved. This is because he can get something to drink and also buy worms to eat. The cyclist is disoriented as there are no cars, buildings, or structures in sight. So, he continues riding until he reaches the bait shop or what he calls the first “town” in the essay. When he comes across a road with a 55 - mph speed limit and realizes he is only 12, he understands that he is far from Yosemite National Park. In summary, the setting's features greatly affect the cyclist's journey and his ability to reach his destination.
714	6693	3	2	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” have multiple effects on the cyclist. Firstly, the appearance of the setting does not match what the cyclist was told. He stopped to get directions from a group of older men, but their directions were out - of - date. Secondly, the road conditions impact the cyclist. As described in the essay, flat roads are replaced by short, rolling hills. Lastly, the temperature is a factor. The hot sun beats down on the cyclist. In conclusion, the features of the setting in this piece have diverse and significant effects on the cyclist.
715	6694	3	2	I firmly believe that the different settings in the essay have a profound impact on the cyclist due to their old and hopeless appearance. When the cyclist stops at the first town, he expects to find a charming, lively place but instead encounters abandoned and dilapidated old houses. Imagining being in his situation, one can understand how discouraging and almost terrifying it must be. As the cyclist rides on for a few more miles, he gradually becomes dehydrated. When he finally sees a building, he initially thinks it's a mirage. It turns out to be an old juice factory, which makes him feel that everything is going against him and there's no hope left. However, when he finds the fishing camp, his entire outlook changes, and he is extremely thankful to be saved. In conclusion, the settings in the essay can either crush the cyclist's spirit or restore his hope.
716	6695	3	2	The setting had a significant impact on the cyclist. People from Lodi led him astray, and he found himself in a dire situation. The area was extremely dry, with no water available. The next stop was at a bait - store, and he was determined to reach it. Despite the challenges, when a man offered him directions, he refused, not wanting to be deceived again. He persevered and managed to keep going, driven by the goal of reaching the next destination.
717	6696	3	2	Riding a bike through a desert is far from an “easy” feat. The presence of rough pavement, rusty water pumps, and unfriendly animals exacerbates the discomfort. The cyclist in this story faced all these issues, turning what was supposed to be an enjoyable ride into a somewhat brutal experience. As described in the quote “it got down on my hands and knee, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. Alike substance ooed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,” the poor water - supply conditions ultimately led to his dehydration. The quote “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT @CAPS1 SPEED LIMIT” indicates that the difficult riding conditions made it hard for the cyclist to maintain speed. Also, the quote “at some point tumberweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake - it really did look like a diamond back - beaked the majority of the pavement in front of me” shows some of the dangers he encountered. Without these adverse features, the story might have been about a pleasant bike ride, but instead, it becomes a tale of disaster.
718	6697	3	2	The setting had a profound impact on the cyclist. The intense heat made him consume water unconsciously until he had only a few sips left. The hilly terrain also contributed to his thirst; the more he ascended and descended hills, the more water he drank. Moreover, seeing only one ghost town for miles made him doubt his ability to reach the next town. Clearly, the setting played a major role in shaping the cyclist's experience, as it affected him in multiple significant ways.
719	6698	3	2	Setting is a crucial element in this story. If the story were not set in a hot desert on @DATE1, there would be no conflict. The need to conserve water to avoid dehydration would lose its importance. The long, flat roads symbolize that the journey still has a long way to go. However, when the straight roads transform into hills, it indicates a change in the journey, suggesting that something better is about to occur. In essence, the setting not only creates the conflict but also provides symbolic meaning to the story.
720	6699	3	2	In the short story “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit,” the setting has a substantial impact. The cyclist had been traveling for a long time when he reached the first town, only to find no water. At this point, it is evident that he has lost faith in the “old timers” directions. The quote “a ton - like substance oozed out” shows that after @NUM1 miles of pedaling and expecting to reach two towns, his one hope for water was gone. Later, when he came across a rusted - out building, he said, “I hung my head,” which reveals that he almost lost all hope and was convinced he was going to die. The setting, thus, plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's state of mind and the overall story.
721	6700	3	2	The cyclist is influenced by several factors. Firstly, he receives outdated directions. Then, he has to endure the heat of the early - summer weather in California. As if that were not enough, he runs out of water, which is in great need. He also encounters additional problems, such as spotting a large snake and coming across a former juice factory that is now dilapidated and empty. After overcoming all these obstacles, the cyclist perseveres and reaches a fishing store, where he obtains water.
722	6701	3	2	During his cycling adventure, a young cyclist has several interesting experiences, each shaped by the setting. At the start, he is confident and hopeful about reaching Yosemite National Park. His first stop is a ghost town. Although this sight doesn't have an immediate impact, it has long - term effects. He decides to continue his journey. By the time he reaches the next ghost town, he is dehydrated due to a lack of water. He resolves to keep going, believing there will be water in the next town. To reach it, he must face precarious situations, including changes in terrain. Eventually, when he finds a source of running water, he is filled with joy and relief. Clearly, the different settings have a significant impact on his confidence.
723	6702	3	2	The setting affects the rider. When it is hot, the rider gets thirsty, and if there is no water, it becomes a problem. Answering this kind of question is not straightforward. In conclusion, the relationship between the setting and the rider's well - being is complex and difficult to precisely define.
724	6703	3	2	The features of the setting made the cyclist's journey more dangerous and difficult. In the reading, it mentions that extremely large, poisonous diamond - back snakes blocked most of the pavement. The cyclist had to maintain balance to pass them. Additionally, the terrain changed to short, rolling hills, further increasing the difficulty of the journey. In the end, the combined impact of these setting features posed a significant challenge to the cyclist.
725	6704	3	2	The features in the setting of the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the author mainly through causing dehydration. The author is riding through a desert in California, where the sun constantly beats down on him. Moreover, the change from a “Flat road” to “short, rolling hills” also contributes to his dehydration. Climbing the hills requires more energy, which makes him thirstier and leads to more water consumption. In summary, these setting features play a crucial role in dehydrating the author.
726	6705	3	2	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting significantly impact the cyclist. The challenging terrain presented a formidable obstacle as the cyclist attempted to reach Yosemite. Despite being fatigued, the cyclist had to surmount hills, as the flat road transitioned into short, rolling hills. Additionally, when the cyclist encountered a snake, the setting further affected him. He was dehydrated and struggled to navigate around the large snake, which resembled a diamondback and blocked most of the pavement. The cyclist also faced the issue of having no one around to assist him, as there were no buildings, cars, or structures in sight. As a result, the cyclist had to rely on himself to reach Yosemite. In conclusion, the setting features in the essay affected the cyclist by forcing him to overcome rugged terrain while fatigued, avoid a dangerous snake, and continue his journey without external help. Clearly, the features of the setting had a substantial impact on the cyclist.
727	6706	3	2	At the start of his trip, the cyclist received advice from “old coggers” and set out with strong legs and a smile. As he reached the first town, he described it as a “ghost town,” lacking water and any human contact for some time. This should have prompted him to stop and seek an alternative route to Yosemite. However, driven by strong determination, he continued riding. Along the way, he encountered a ramshackle shed, rusty pumps, snakes, and difficult terrain. The short rolling hills tested his “inner spirit” and exacerbated his dehydration. The land around the cyclist not only affected his health but also made his vacation experience less than ideal. In conclusion, the features of the land around the cyclist forced him to confront nature and presented numerous challenges that negatively impacted his journey and well - being.
728	6707	3	2	The harsh elements of the setting impede the cyclist's journey to Yosemite National Park. While traveling through “The high deserts of California in June,” the cyclist faces several problems. The intense heat from the desert sun causes the cyclist to consume more water, rapidly depleting his supply. Instead of stopping at proper rest stops to refill water and rest, the cyclist passes through small “ghost towns.” Moreover, during his journey, he encounters hazards such as short rolling hills in the ghost - town terrain and even a snake. All these setting features undermine the cyclist's confidence in reaching his destination and his positive attitude towards the journey. In conclusion, the harsh features of the setting have a detrimental effect on the cyclist's ability to complete his journey to Yosemite successfully.
729	6708	3	2	I believe cycling is an excellent sport. People who cycle tend to be in good physical shape and have strong calf muscles. However, I also think it can be quite dangerous. Cycling offers numerous health benefits, but the risks associated with it cannot be ignored. In conclusion, while cycling has its advantages in terms of physical fitness, one must be aware of the potential dangers it poses.
730	6709	3	2	In the story, the author writes, “The sun was beginning to beat down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This indicates that the heat is taking a toll on the cyclist and steadily depleting his water supply. At one point, the cyclist nearly succumbs to despair and faces the risk of dying from dehydration. It seems as though he will never reach his goal and will continue to endure the grueling heat. I can vividly imagine the sweat and the intense heat that the cyclist is experiencing. Moreover, when he says, “with any luck Iíd hit a bump and lodge a pebble in my throat,” I can almost feel the lump in my throat too. Clearly, the heat has a severely negative impact on the man's cycling. He is exhausted and unable to continue without water. In conclusion, the heat in the story has a detrimental effect on the cyclist's ability to complete his journey.
731	6710	3	2	The cyclist found the cycling difficult and was perturbed that the older individuals provided inaccurate directions.
732	6711	3	2	The setting has a significant impact on the cyclist. Being in a desert with only dilapidated sheds and rusty camps meant he had no access to water. The short rolling hills and rough roads made cycling arduous. Tumbleweeds and large poisonous snakes obstructed his path. The intense heat made it challenging to keep pedaling. Moreover, the absence of buildings or people nearby meant no one could offer him a lift or water. In conclusion, these aspects of the setting severely affected the cyclist.
733	6712	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's essay, a young man is lured by a group of old men into relying on outdated information. Later, while cycling, he nearly succumbs to heatstroke or dehydration. The setting effectively portrays his feelings of hopelessness, despair, and fatigue. At the start, the road is flat and the weather is cool and breezy. As he runs out of water, the terrain becomes more difficult with bumpy roads. He encounters empty plains, cracked ground, and the scorching sun, which intensifies his despair. When he thinks he can go no further, he spots a store that once held gallons of grape juice, and he laughs at the irony. Overall, the setting does an outstanding job of depicting his sense of helplessness.
734	6713	3	2	In this passage, the cyclist was influenced by the setting. Had he been elsewhere, he would not have endured suffering or gained any learning. The lack of civilization and water in the setting led him to nearly faint from thirst. As the text states, “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.” This indicates that if the setting had been ideal, he would not have learned anything. In conclusion, the setting's harsh conditions had a profound impact on the cyclist.
735	6714	3	2	The characteristics of the setting in the essay led the cyclist to endure hardships while remaining determined. The author employed phrases like “the sun was beating down” and “high deserts of California in June” to highlight the extreme heat that caused the cyclist to experience severe thirst and heat exhaustion. The description of “short rolling hills,” “tumbleweeds,” and “long, crippling hill” in the essay shows the difficult terrain that made the cyclist tired and slowed him down. Additionally, the cyclist faced a “ridiculously large snake” and plants and weeds that blocked his way, forcing him to reduce his speed. In summary, the setting's features had a substantial impact on the cyclist's journey.
736	6715	3	2	The setting significantly impacts the cyclist, particularly due to the extremely dry climates.
737	6716	3	2	"In the story ""Rough road ahead"", the setting plays a crucial role in the cyclist's journey. The story mentions features like intense heat, a rough road, long and arduous hills, and an abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat makes the cyclist desperately thirsty. Despite her best efforts to conserve water during the trip, the dry desert heat makes it impossible. Next comes the rough road, where the cyclist tries to maintain a steady pace while pedaling over the bumps and cracks. Then, the long, tiring hills require the cyclist to exert all her energy to climb. After wiping the sweat from her eyes to ensure it's not a mirage, she spots the abandoned factory. At this point, she loses all hope, fearing that if she doesn't get water soon, she'll be at the mercy of the birds. However, ""Then, and easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. Gary and Wilber Fish Camp."" She rushes to the bathroom, drinks the refreshing water from the sink, and is overwhelmed with pride and a sense of accomplishment."
738	6717	3	2	"The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist, inducing a feeling of hopelessness. When the cyclist received directions to Yosemite from two elderly individuals, he believed he was getting a good shortcut. In fact, he was led onto a seemingly endless road. Along the way, he encountered various elements that contributed to his despair. For instance, the author writes, ""I toiled on. At some points, tumbleweeds crossed my path and an unusually large snake. It really did move like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This shows that the cyclist was fatigued, and the sight of tumbleweeds, which typically symbolize desolation, and deadly snakes in his way intensified his sense of hopelessness. Thus, the setting clearly leads to his feeling of despair."
739	6718	3	2	"The story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" depicts a cyclist's arduous journey through harsh climate and terrain. The description in the story presents a scorching expanse of nothingness as far as the eye can see. In paragraph @NUM1, the text states, ""Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could die from heatstroke,"" which effectively conveys the intensity of the heat and how the cyclist felt during this experience. Overall, this entire trip seems to have been a great ordeal for the cyclist."
740	6719	3	2	The features of a setting can have multiple effects on a cyclist. For instance, when the cyclist was riding under the hot sun, he became extremely thirsty as he only had a few drops of water remaining. This example clearly demonstrates how the setting can influence the cyclist.
741	6720	3	2	The characteristics of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. The heat makes it difficult for the cyclist to concentrate and renders the situation unbearable. The setting induces drowsiness and thirst, creating an environment of a dry, bitter land filled with longing. In conclusion, the setting's features severely affect the cyclist's experience.
742	6721	3	2	In numerous aspects, the setting had an influence on his journey to Yosemite. Had the setting not been so unfavorable, the long - distance bike ride would not have taken such a toll on his body. The setting was a sweltering day in June in a California desert. When he found a well, he described the brackish water as feeling around two hundred degrees. One crucial aspect of the setting is that if it were not so hot, he would not have required as much water. Moreover, if he could have obtained the necessary water despite the heat, it would not have been as physically exhausting. This is evident as he said, “I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” In conclusion, the setting played a vital role in the story.
743	6722	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a man was cycling through rough terrains. His journey would not have been an adventure if he had merely ridden on a flat and smooth surface. It was the steep, rocky, and numerous hills that transformed his bike ride into what it was. In conclusion, the challenging landscape was essential in making his bike ride an adventure.
744	6723	3	2	In the cyclist's journey, he received advice from old - timers on how to reach a certain place. The town they directed him to was a ghost town. As he continued, the place they told him to get water from was old and rusty. When he pumped it, what came out resembled tar. Later, as he traveled through the desert, a snake appeared on the road, and he had to go around it. Based on these experiences, it's clear that one should be cautious about taking advice from old - timers. In conclusion, the old - timers' advice led the cyclist into various difficulties.
745	6724	3	2	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the setting's features impact the cyclist by highlighting the arduous conditions he endured and how he managed to persevere. The author repeatedly mentions the scarcity of water and the rolling hills. The description of the brackish water feeling around two hundred degrees shows the hardships he faced, which supports the significance of the setting in the story and its impact on his trip. It also demonstrates his determination to overcome these struggles and make an effort to complete his journey. In conclusion, the setting was a key factor in shaping the cyclist's experience and his perseverance.
746	6725	3	2	The rider faced a challenging terrain that transitioned from flat land to rolling hills. For someone experiencing dehydration, this journey was bound to be arduous. Along the way, a snake appeared in his path, forcing him to take a detour. This situation was fraught with danger as he was at risk of blacking out due to water shortage and getting bitten by the snake. The combination of the difficult terrain and the unexpected snake encounter made the rider's journey extremely perilous.
747	6726	3	2	The cyclist in the essay is significantly influenced by his surroundings. Initially, he describes a blazing sun, pine trees, and rushing rivers. These elements are highly dynamic, with the river described as rushing rather than violent, suggesting an active setting that mirrors the cyclist's own state. Subsequently, a dilapidated shed, rusty pumps, and a poorly - sounding corral are noted. When these old and abandoned things are mentioned, the cyclist begins to show signs of despair. To top it off, he drinks water that tastes like “battery acid,” which, like battery eating at skin, reflects how the setting is wearing down the cyclist. In conclusion, the cyclist's emotional state is clearly intertwined with the nature of his surroundings.
748	6727	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting impacts the cyclist's emotions and moods both positively and negatively. As the author traverses the desert, the sweltering heat and scarcity of water make him upset, indicating a negative influence of the terrain. For instance, when he first spots the old water pump, he feels relieved, a positive effect. However, the pump dispenses a shiny substance that he claims tastes like “battery acid,” which quickly sours his mood. Later, the cyclist's act of putting pebbles in his mouth shows his desperation and a new positive outlook on surviving in the desert. But then, a pump “lodges in his throat,” creating another negative influence. All these factors guide him towards “Gary and Will Fish Camp” and give an extra push to his desert journey. Overall, the setting's dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual dual

749	6728	3	2	"The features of the setting affect him because it is hot and their is no where to go. An example from the test is when they said ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" There was also a part where he got to a sign that said ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.The speed limit was 55 mph. He was doing a water a water - depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. Thats what affected the cyclist the heart the hilly roads, no water, snakes, rough roads, and most all no directions."
750	6729	3	2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because where they were.It was like in te middle of nowhere and every person they asked are having all times.They go the wrong directions to the nearest town.The old guy told him it was @NUM1 miles down the road when he went @NUM2 miles to the next town and said to him self he will never take directions from a gut that has all timers and hasnít left the confines of their porches since carter was in office.
751	6730	3	2	During the serene early - sunset evening, the cyclist was enjoying his ride, with the hope of cutting his cycling time in half. After receiving some advice and starting down the road, he encountered a ghost town, which was an unfavorable sign. Then, he reached a fork, and the town he arrived at had no water. On his way to the new town, he faced a bumpy road and was traveling at @NUM1. He ran out of water, but through his determination, he finally reached a pleasant place. Evidently, the features of the scenery along the road had a significant impact on him.
752	6731	3	2	In my opinion, the setting enabled the cyclist to discover more inner courage. This courage allowed him to conserve his water and journey to the next town without any water supplies. This shows that the environment can play a crucial role in bringing out one's latent strength.
753	6732	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the environment had a severe impact on the cyclist. The harsh conditions of cycling in California, combined with the cyclist taking faulty directions from older people at a stop, wore him down. The heat and lack of water supply led to his dehydration. As stated in the essay, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a glorious day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen.” This passage illustrates how the long - distance cycling, the intense sun, and the absence of water due to the lack of towns exhausted him. He nearly died from heat exhaustion because of the wrong directions given by the old people. In the future, he should ensure to carry extra water and rely on the map for directions.
754	6733	3	2	As the cyclist embarks on his journey to Yosemite, the setting fills him with worry and concern. Initially, the narrator is happy and excited. He is engaged in an activity he loves, is headed towards a beautiful destination, and has found a shortcut to save hours of travel time. He trusts the directions provided by the old men. However, as he progresses along the winding road, the environment makes him question their judgment. The first town he reaches is completely deserted. At first, he tries to laugh it off, but later realizes the trouble he is in if he doesn't reach a populated area soon. He comes across “ramshackle shed[s]” and closed - down factories. As his water supply dwindles, the road seems to mock him. He passes a water pump, which he desperately needs, but the water is almost toxic. A road sign warns him not to go too fast, yet he might die if he doesn't speed up. He has to look at a picture of a happy boy drinking grape juice while he is dehydrating. All these elements of the setting, along with the overpowering heat and sun, push the narrator to his limit.
755	6734	3	2	The features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist because the issues that occurred years ago, such as wars and rights - related matters, are still present in today's world. The current features are similar to those of the past, indicating that history is repeating itself. This cyclical nature of events shows that the setting can have a long - lasting and recurring influence on individuals, and we should learn from the past to better navigate the present.
756	6735	3	2	When cycling, it may not initially seem overly difficult. However, for a serious cyclist, every aspect becomes far more challenging. The unwavering determination to win and be the best, even at the cost of one's own well - being, drives them. In this account, the writer underestimates the experienced cyclist. In reality, these are the individuals with profound knowledge. Some of the difficulties cyclists face include rough roads. There is also the constant threat of dehydration or being run over. Riding a bike in hundred - degree weather is extremely arduous. Cyclists consume drink after drink yet often find themselves without water. The combination of no water and extreme heat can lead to a heat stroke. As the roads deteriorate, the likelihood of encountering tumbleweeds and snakes increases. Despite these challenges, the cyclist remains determined to win. After facing the harsh realities nature presented, the cyclist realizes the error of underestimating the sport and its practitioners.
757	6736	3	2	The setting in which the cyclist finds himself has a multitude of effects on his journey. Being in the California desert, the intense heat takes a toll on him. With limited water and the constant expenditure of energy while cycling, the heat exacerbates his situation. The so - called “towns” he encounters also impact him negatively, as he is unable to obtain more water or find a place to rest. His statement, “I was doing a water - depleting @NUM1 sometimes life can feel so cruel,” clearly shows the combined effects of the hilly terrain, dehydration, and the sweltering heat. In conclusion, the setting, with its heat, lack of resources, and difficult terrain, significantly challenges the cyclist.
758	6737	3	2	Two prominent settings in this story are the desert and the rolling hills. These settings have a substantial impact on the cyclist due to the dehydration he is likely to experience. The desert environment is inherently hot, causing the cyclist to sweat profusely. The hills, on the other hand, place additional strain on the cyclist's body as they require extra effort to climb. All in all, these factors make for a very difficult bike ride. In summary, the combination of the desert heat and the challenging hills creates a formidable cycling experience.
759	6738	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist suffers from dehydration during his journey. The cyclist takes directions from older men who appear to have rarely left their porches. Following their advice turns out to be a poor decision in the long run. On a hot @DATE1, he struggles to find water. He hikes uphill under the scorching sun, constantly fearing a heat stroke. The desolate landscape offers no sign of civilization, with no buildings or cars in sight. In conclusion, the cyclist's reliance on the advice of these older men and the harsh environmental conditions lead to a difficult and perilous journey.
760	6739	3	2	The setting can have either a positive or negative impact on the cyclist. In Joe Kurmaskie's “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting affects the cyclist in both ways. The story frequently mentions the lack of water. The cyclist's comment, “When I tried a drop or two it had the flavor of battery @NUM1,” indicates that the heat has made the water warm, rendering it ineffective in cooling him down. However, there is a positive aspect. The pebbles in the setting offer some relief. As the cyclist notes, “I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to @NUM2.” This shows that even in the absence of water, the pebbles can alleviate his thirst to some extent. In conclusion, the setting in this story has a dual effect on the cyclist, presenting both challenges and small sources of relief.
761	6740	3	2	The story clearly depicts the arduous journey of the cyclist. He must overcome wrong directions, water scarcity, rattlesnakes, and the fear of death. Nevertheless, he demonstrates remarkable determination and self - control. For instance, his determination is evident in the statement, “The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that.” This shows his resolve to undertake such a long journey. His self - control is exemplified in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. When he found the building abandoned and all useful items like juice were gone, most people would have become frustrated and wanted to give up. However, this cyclist kept his anger in check and again showed determination. In the end, his perseverance paid off as he found water and survived. This story is an excellent illustration of determination and self - control.
762	6741	3	2	In the early morning, a cyclist, full of eagerness, set out to follow the adventurous route mapped by older travelers. He scarcely noticed that “the sun was beginning to beat down.” Calmly, he anticipated reaching “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” Little did he know what awaited him. As he neared the desert, he realized his water supply was running low. The strenuous cycling, combined with the searing desert heat, started to take its toll. So desperate for water, he resorted to putting pebbles in his mouth, recalling that “sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.” Dehydration set in, and he began to hallucinate. Losing hope, he was severely affected by the heat, the hilly terrain, and the lack of water. Had he not been cycling through a hilly desert one afternoon in June, he would have been fine.
763	6742	3	2	In the cyclist's story, the setting played a crucial role in how the story unfolded. Water had a significant impact on the cyclist. The story was set in the high deserts of California in June. Just reading this makes it clear that something is amiss. In the story, he mentions, “the sun was beginning to beat down.” This affected him as he was cycling through the desert, leading to dehydration. He tried to keep his balance in a dehydrated state. Due to the lack of water caused by the setting, he started to lose his mind. Every aspect of the setting posed problems for the cyclist. The heat, the location, and the water shortage almost cost him his life.
764	6743	3	2	The setting has multiple effects on the cyclist. Firstly, he was cycling in the middle of a desert in June. If he were riding in @LOCATION1, the heat would not be so unbearable. Additionally, the rolling hills made the situation worse. If the path were mostly downhill, he would have been fine. Cycling uphill when tired is nearly impossible.
765	6744	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the features of the path to Yosemite National Park significantly affected the cyclist. On the way to the park, the cyclist encountered a large snake covering the road, which greatly frightened him. Moreover, the roads were long, bumpy, and windy, making the ride far from comfortable. There was nothing for the cyclist to see along the way. He lacked energy as he had no hope. As the author states, “... gaining elevation while losing hope.” Lastly, the hot and dry weather tired the cyclist out. With no water and such weather conditions, he had neither the energy nor the hope to complete his journey to Yosemite National Park.
766	6745	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist faced several life - threatening situations during his adventure. One notable instance was when he found himself in a desert with temperatures of @NUM1 degrees. The little water he had tasted like battery acid. As he attempted to continue, he lost hope and believed he was going to die. This loss of hope led him to think negatively about his situation and doubt his ability to survive. However, he eventually found the strength to press on. Clearly, in this story, the setting has a profound impact on the characters.
767	6746	3	2	The setting's features cause the cyclist to become frustrated, thirsty, and confused. The cyclist is made frustrated because he thought he was on the correct path when, in reality, he was going astray. This shows how the setting can mislead and distress the character, ultimately affecting his journey.
768	6747	3	2	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist as they are the driving force behind the story's climax. For example, the line “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California” reveals two crucial conditions. First, it indicates that the cyclist is in an extremely hot environment, being in a desert. Second, it shows that he has a limited water supply. These two factors combined create the climax, where there is a real possibility that the cyclist could collapse at any moment due to heat exhaustion. Thus, the features of the setting have a direct and impactful effect on the cyclist.
769	6748	3	2	Certain features of the setting had an impact on the cyclist. In Joe Kurmaskie's essay, he recounts his experiences cycling through the desert. When he “arrived at the first town,” it met the traditional definition of a ghost town. Initially, the cyclist was somewhat amused and a bit unsettled by the town, as the old “codgers” had described it as a thriving place. Half - way through his journey, he stated “sometimes life can be so cruel.” With his water running low and a long way to go before reaching the park, he felt as if the journey would never end. All around him were hills of nothingness under the scorching sun, and there were no buildings in sight. The ghost town and the lack of shade or solutions are features of the setting that made the cyclist feel foolish for taking advice from the older men.
770	6749	3	2	I will explain how the cyclist's setting affected him. The setting made the cyclist extremely hot, causing him to drink his water rapidly. As a result, he was at risk of running out of water and becoming dehydrated. In the story, the cyclist frequently mentioned the little water he had left. Throughout the essay, he also talked about the signs of dehydration he was experiencing and even contemplated death. Another indication of the setting's impact was the relief he felt when he drank water from the sink. In conclusion, the setting affected the cyclist by endangering his health through dehydration and influencing his mental state.
771	6750	3	2	When on the roads, one must exercise great caution and be aware of numerous potential situations. A multitude of things can occur, so it is essential to maintain control while driving. In conclusion, road safety demands constant vigilance and self - control.
772	6751	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting features significantly impact the cyclist. For instance, the town the cyclist reaches while en - route to Yosemite, which might have been thriving before the last world war but now fits the traditional definition of a ghost town, affects the cyclist's confidence. Initially riding with confidence, the sight of this desolate town lowers the cyclist's confidence. Similar to how travelers feel less confident when they reach an unfamiliar place, the cyclist experiences a dip in morale. Additionally, when the cyclist rides on rolling hills and encounters a ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" sign, frustration and stress set in. After riding a long way, being unable to proceed further and not reaching the desired location adds to the cyclist's woes. In conclusion, the setting features in Kurmaskie's work have a substantial impact on the cyclist."
773	6752	3	2	The bicyclist faced numerous conditions that negatively affected the trip. The extreme heat made it difficult to think, move quickly, and make good decisions. Loose gravel on the road made maneuvering challenging and required careful speed control, preventing rapid progress. The abundance of hills led to an uncomfortable and tiring ride. Moreover, the bicyclist ran out of water, risking dehydration, poor judgment, heat - stroke, or exhaustion. Being in the middle of nowhere meant there were no places to stop for a drink, with nothing around for miles. These conditions collectively made the journey extremely difficult. In conclusion, the existence of these adverse conditions made the road trip a rough one for the bicyclist.
774	6753	3	2	The setting was a hot and dry desert. This environment affected the biker by causing severe dehydration and excessive heat. It became extremely difficult for the biker to continue, yet they knew they had to press on. The barren land further compounded the biker's difficulties. Clearly, the setting had a significant impact on the biker. In conclusion, the harsh desert setting presented formidable challenges for the biker, influencing their ability to complete the journey.
775	6754	3	2	The setting had an impact on the cyclist as they were traveling on back roads in California in June with no available water stops. Had the cyclist followed their intended path, the ride would likely have been more enjoyable. They would not have had to worry about heatstroke or running out of water and would have been in a better situation. In conclusion, deviating from the planned route in this particular setting led to a less - than - ideal cycling experience.
776	6755	3	2	The setting's features had a significant impact on the cyclist. The presence of hills, rocks, snakes, and the absence of buildings and people were notable factors. The hills and rocks made it extremely challenging for the cyclist to maintain strength and continue riding. The desolate environment, with abandoned buildings and no human presence, took an emotional toll on the cyclist, causing a loss of hope and determination to reach the destination. After encountering a deserted town, the cyclist expressed a sense of despair, stating, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die … ” (Kurmaskie). In conclusion, the harsh and desolate setting severely affected the cyclist both physically and mentally.
777	6756	3	2	The cyclist was significantly affected by the setting, specifically the fact that it was June and the intense desert heat. As Kurmaskie stated, “ … I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June … ”. This highlights the extreme heat in the middle of the California desert during June. The cyclist suffered from dehydration and was in a remote location with no one to assist him. In summary, the combination of the month of June and the desert heat had a detrimental impact on the cyclist's well - being.
778	6757	3	2	In the story, the setting's features had a profound impact on the cyclist. When he reached the road sign warning of a rough road ahead, he was already running low on water. The rough road made pedaling more difficult, causing him to exert more energy and become thirstier. At the old Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, he noticed pebbles on the ground and put them in his mouth, as he had read that sucking on stones can help with thirst by circulating saliva. Finally, “GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP” was a potential lifesaver. Stopping there, the cyclist got a much - needed drink of water, alleviating his dehydration and fear. Throughout his journey, the setting and its features significantly affected the cyclist.
779	6758	3	2	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the setting influenced the author's emotions. At the start of the essay, the author was confident and happy. The setting, a reservoir campground outside Lodi, California, seemed like a place to feel refreshed and confident. As the bike ride progressed, the author was negatively affected by a barren area. The author described the sight as “troubling”. Finally, upon reaching a modern store, the author felt relief. As the author stated, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me”. Clearly, the areas the author passed through had a substantial impact on his emotions.
780	6759	3	2	The features of the setting have an impact on cyclists. Since they don't ride as frequently, they are unaware of the best routes. They rely on their old routes, assuming they are still the optimal choice. However, when they use these routes, they realize how exhausting and sub - optimal they are. In conclusion, the lack of updated knowledge about routes due to infrequent riding, combined with the features of the setting, leads to a less - than - ideal cycling experience.
781	6760	3	2	At a certain point, tumbleweeds came across my path. Being in the desert with little to no water can make one perceive life as extremely harsh. The sun was blazing down, and when he reached a particular spot, there was no water or shade in sight. The sign that read “Rough Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was likely intimidating. Since he was on a bike, his speed was limited. Those old men probably hadn't left their front porches since Carter was in office. Just as the writer said, “the world is a fluid place. Things change.” Considering the changes that have occurred since that time (when Carter was in office), the old men likely had little understanding of what they were talking about. The snake he encountered must have been quite intimidating. Knowing that there is one such creature implies that there could be more. In essence, I believe the setting was a major factor contributing to the cyclist's feelings.
782	6761	3	2	In the picture, the cyclist is riding in a dry area, indicating that it's very hot. The cyclist appears to be going downhill on a road with many turns. From the cyclist's body position, it seems that he is making every effort to reach his destination. All of this could place a great deal of stress on the cyclist. He might be sweating profusely and feeling tired, and the wind might not be of any help to him. In conclusion, the challenging conditions in the picture suggest that the cyclist is facing a difficult journey.
783	6762	3	2	In the short story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” by @PERSON1, a cyclist undertakes a perilous journey through an extreme climate and challenging terrain in an attempt to reach his destination, which nearly costs him his life. After receiving outdated directions from some elderly local residents, the protagonist sets out on his trip to Yosemite National Park. Soon after starting his journey, the cyclist realizes that something is wrong. The first “town” the locals mentioned is deserted. Twenty miles into his journey, the cyclist needs to refill his water supply. The water from the pump has “the flavor of battery acid.” With the next town @NUM1 miles away, the cyclist has to struggle to conserve his water to make it there. Unfortunately, things only get worse. As he is “traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” the flat road is replaced by short rolling hills. @CAPS1 warns him not to exceed the speed limit of @NUM2 while he is performing a “water - depleting @NUM3.” Eventually, despite having only a few sips of water left, the cyclist manages to find a place to refill his water. He learns from this experience to choose better days and obtain more accurate directions for future travels.
784	6763	3	2	The features of the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist. While riding, the extremely hot weather caused the cyclist to lose energy and become dehydrated. Additionally, when the cyclist encountered a terrain change and the road turned into rolling hills, it made the cyclist tired. Riding up and down the hills fatigued the body. Moreover, the hot weather made the cyclist drink a large amount of water. Eventually, she ran out of water and became dehydrated. This entire situation suggests that one should stick to the original plan. If the cyclist had done so, she would not have had to endure these hardships. In conclusion, the setting's features and the deviation from the plan led to a difficult experience for the cyclist.
785	6764	3	2	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, each new aspect of the setting affects the cyclist in various ways. For instance, in the text, when the narrator had to avoid a “ridiculously large snake” crossing the road, he became more vigilant about his surroundings. He even seemed to forget his thirst until he passed the large reptile. Also, in the text, when “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view,” hope was restored in the cyclist. This hope made the narrator more determined to continue his journey and reach the old building. Whether for better or for worse, several features of the setting emerge and influence the cyclist at every stage of his journey. In conclusion, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experiences and mindset during the journey.
786	6765	3	2	The setting of the cyclist's arduous journey exerts both mental and physical impacts on him. At the start of his trip, the pine - lined paths and flowing rivers accompanied him, filling him with cheer as he cycled through the scenery. However, upon sighting the corral and rusty pumps, his spirits sank. He began to be acutely aware of his fatigue and thirst. When he encountered a rough expanse filled with tumbleweeds and snakes, he reached a state of complete mental and physical exhaustion. Doubts about his ability to continue clouded his mind, and he worried that he might not complete the journey. The abandoned grape - juice factory further dampened his mental state. Just when all hope seemed lost, he finally found water, and from this experience, he learned a valuable and unique lesson.
787	6766	3	2	The setting's features had an impact on the cyclist. In the story, the cyclist mentioned that he was “going to drop from heat exhaustion”. He was cycling through the desert on @DATE1. Additionally, he took directions from three elderly men sitting on a porch. Evidently, the harsh desert environment and the guidance from these men influenced the cyclist's journey, highlighting the role of the setting in shaping his experience.
788	6767	3	2	The setting's features significantly affected the cyclist. Being in the desert, the intense heat led to severe dehydration during his journey. The bumpy roads and rolling hills were so challenging that they reduced the bike's speed to 12 mph, as high - speed travel was beyond his capacity. When he first spotted a building, he felt relief, but it quickly turned to despair as he realized it was deserted. The old men in the area also had an impact; they provided out - dated directions that nearly @CAPS1 him. As a result, he will likely rest again in an old man's short tent. In conclusion, the various elements of the setting had a profound and diverse effect on the cyclist's journey.
789	6768	3	2	It's extremely hot and dry, which can quickly dehydrate a person. The hills are difficult to climb, presenting a real challenge to reach the top. Lack of water is a serious threat, especially for those prone to heatstroke. In such conditions, one's survival can be at stake due to the combination of heat, difficult terrain, and water scarcity.
790	6769	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the features of the setting have an influence on the cyclist. Initially, the cyclist anticipated a pleasant journey. However, this perception changed. As the quote “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” indicates, getting advice from two old men altered his experience. The setting's features clearly play a role in affecting the cyclist throughout the essay, demonstrating how external factors can shape one's journey.
791	6770	3	2	The setting's features significantly impact the cyclist. A desert - like temperature and the terrain on which the cyclist rides increase the likelihood of thirst and exhaustion. The high heat, especially during @MONTH1, causes the cyclist to dehydrate at a faster - than - normal rate. This is exacerbated by the cyclist's lack of water, increasing the risk of fainting or suffering a heat stroke. The rolling - hill terrain tires the cyclist more quickly compared to a flat road. As a result, the cyclist's muscles start to ache, and the body demands water and rest. If the setting were different, the story would change completely. For instance, if the cyclist were biking on @DATE1, a cold day with temperatures in the mid - @NUM1, the chances of a heat stroke would be eliminated, and the risk of dehydration would be significantly reduced. Clearly, the setting is crucial in any story as it can alter the entire narrative.
792	6771	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's essay ""Rough Road Ahead"", the speaker is cycling through challenging terrain under scorching heat over long distances. He believes he has found a shortcut to his destination, which involves riding up and down hills of various sizes. However, his water supply is limited. Along the way, he encounters ghost towns where the only available water is boiling brackish water, unfit for human consumption. One of the worst aspects of the setting is the abandoned Welch's Grape Juice Factory. Adding to his distress, a sand - blasted billboard still shows a young boy pouring a glass of refreshing juice into his mouth, as described by Kurmaskie (@NUM1). For the narrator with a dwindling water supply, this billboard was a particularly intimidating sight during his journey. In conclusion, the setting's harsh elements and such taunting visual cues greatly affected the cyclist's experience."
793	6772	3	2	The setting, including the desert, hills, road conditions, and lack of water, all impact the cyclist. The cyclist reveals being in the California high desert in June, indicating high temperatures. The hills and poor road conditions are also problematic. The cyclist notes that the flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, and a sign warned of a rough road ahead. Additionally, the cyclist initially assumed there would be stops to get water, so he drank freely. Only later did he realize he needed to conserve water, but it was already too late. These examples demonstrate that the cyclist faced more difficult conditions than anticipated. In summary, the setting's various factors combined to make the cyclist's journey much tougher.
794	6773	3	2	The features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist. The winding road poses a risk as the cyclist may turn too far to one side, causing the bike to tip over and resulting in serious injury. Another setting feature is the grass on both sides of the road. If the cyclist attempts to take a shortcut through the grass, they may hit a rock, causing them to flip off the bike and get hurt. In conclusion, the features of the setting can have a detrimental effect on the cyclist's safety and journey.
795	6774	3	2	"The cyclist was in a California desert in the middle of June. Towards the end of his journey, he believes he is going to die, largely due to the directions he received. The statement ""Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office"" implies that one should not take directions from people who haven't visited the place in a long time. In conclusion, the combination of the harsh desert setting and unreliable directions made the cyclist's situation extremely perilous."
796	6775	3	2	A biker traveling to Yosemite National Park got stuck in a hot California desert. The conditions were tough on the cyclist. He followed the advice of some old people, but they led him astray, putting his life at risk. He was running low on water, and his legs felt on the verge of giving out. These difficulties did undermine his trust in the elderly locals. He realized that just because they seemed wise due to their age, their information might be as outdated as museum artifacts. Nevertheless, he gained a lot from this trip.
797	6776	3	2	"The setting's features have multiple impacts on the cyclist. In ""ghost towns"", there are no people to ask for directions or have a conversation with. Moreover, the water pumped from water pumps often tastes like ""battery acid"" and is likely to make someone ill. Additionally, there are poisonous snakes and other dangerous animals in the area. All these factors combine to create a challenging environment for the cyclist."
798	6777	3	2	In the story, numerous features influence the roles, such as running out of water and receiving bad directions. The narrator mentions that the water bottles only contain a few tantalizing sips, indicating that there is hardly any water left. Despite this, the cyclist must continue until he can find more. Water becomes an obstacle he has to overcome, as he runs out of it by the time he reaches the fish store. Overall, these elements add to the challenges faced by the cyclist in the story.
799	6778	3	2	"In this piece, I will discuss how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the short story ""Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the entire event takes place in the ""high deserts of California"". According to the text, the cyclist took ""out - of - date"" directions from elderly people who thought they knew the way. The cyclist also encountered a snake, a ghost town, and a shutdown factory. Throughout most of the journey, the cyclist faced various difficulties due to the setting."
800	6779	3	2	"In ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the setting adds drama to the story through its impact on the cyclist. He was cycling through the ""high desert of California in June"". June is a hot month, and being in the hottest part of the desert multiplied the heat. The terrain changing to ""short rolling hills"" made the ride more difficult, as anyone who rides a bike knows it takes more effort to go uphill than on flat pavement. With the cyclist lacking water, it was a struggle to keep going. He didn't set a specific goal but just aimed for the ""next horizon"". Another issue was the road conditions. When the ""Rough Road Affect"" sign appeared, the journey became even more arduous because a bike tire requires more effort to traverse uneven pavement. All these aspects of the setting combined to create a challenging and dramatic situation for the cyclist."
801	6780	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the setting had a harsh impact on the cyclist. With only a few sips of water remaining, he noted an abandoned Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand - blasted picture of a young boy drinking juice was still visible, which would have intensified his thirst. Another way the setting affected him was the large disparity between the 55 - mph speed limit and his water - depleting 12 - mph pace. This served as a reminder that he was not in a car and was far from reaching even half the speed limit. The setting constantly reminded the cyclist of the long journey ahead, and at this point, he was clearly suffering.
802	6781	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting significantly influences the cyclist. One evening, while resting, the cyclist engaged in a deep conversation with a couple of elders. They eventually discussed his journey, and the two men provided directions for a shortcut. When he reached the first town in the morning, it was a ghost town, completely deserted. This was a problem as he would eventually need more water. As he continued, he encountered a slope on the road. A large highway sign warned “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT,” indicating a bumpy road ahead, which made the cyclist's journey even more challenging. The setting is crucial in this essay as it directly impacts the cyclist's emotions. Abandoned towns make him feel hopeless, bumpy roads tire him out, and reaching a functioning store relieves him.
803	6782	3	2	The features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist as they offer a brief preview of the story's content and the characters involved. The cyclist provides the necessary information, and the effect is related to the time when the setting feature stops playing. Once it does, the appeal of seeing the cyclist fades. In essence, the setting features act as a guide to what the reader can expect from the story and how the cyclist's presence is perceived within that context.
804	6783	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's story “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting features have a notable effect on the cyclist. The setting, which includes the background, place, and time of the story, plays a crucial role. A cyclist is on a mission to reach @CAPS1 Park. He stops to get directions from a group of old men who are out - of - touch with current information, causing him to get lost. In the desert, he faces multiple challenges such as drought and a large snake. He described how tumbleweeds crossed his path and a snake, which looked like a diamondback, blocked most of the pavement in front of him. He managed to carefully pass by it. Overall, the challenging setting makes the cyclist's journey to @CAPS1 Park extremely difficult.
805	6784	3	2	The cyclist made a poor choice by deciding to ride his bike on an “early summer evening” in California. At this time, the sun is scorching, and with little water and being lost, it was far from the best decision. Before embarking on a cycling trip, cyclists should be well - prepared for the weather conditions and check a map of the area. By neglecting these precautions, the cyclist put himself in a difficult and potentially dangerous situation.
806	6785	3	2	The cyclist encountered a diamond - headed snake. He was out of water and in a remote location. I think if I were in his situation, I'd find some rope or cord from an old building or tree and hang myself for taking directions from those old people who haven't left their porches since Carter was in office.
807	6786	3	2	The setting of this story has a cyclist on a journey. Early in his trip, upon reaching the “ghost town”, he initially felt a bit of amusement. However, when he noticed several rusty pumps, a weak corral beside a ramshackle shed, he became deeply troubled. As he neared a 55 - mph speed - limit sign with a strict - obedience warning, he experienced a touch of irony since he was on a bicycle moving at only 12 mph and couldn't reach 55 mph even if he wanted to. Before reaching what seemed to be an abandoned Welch’s Grape Juice factory, he felt that odd amusement again and let out a “sad hopeless laugh”, as he put it. Fortunately, his suffering ended when he found a “fish camp” with a modern bathroom and working sinks. His relief was so great that he had an overwhelming urge to find Gary and Wilber (the owners) and kiss them.
808	6787	3	2	In this story, a man is biking. He takes advice from old - timers about a faster route. From the start, the biker knew he shouldn't have given up his map. But he thought the old folks knew the way and followed their advice. Instead, he should have looked for someone reliable to ask and ensured the route would work. By rushing to follow the advice without proper thought, he ended up dehydrated and facing more struggles than necessary. This shows that it's always wise to think things through before taking action for safety.
809	6788	3	2	The setting significantly affects the cyclist. At first, he was unsure of his route and took directions from people he wasn't certain about. The weather was hot, and he was running out of water. He had no idea where he was, and there were snakes around. With no signs to guide him, he kept thinking that he'd never take directions from old guys again and would rely on modern methods in the future.
810	6789	3	2	Initially, when the cyclist gets directions from the old men, he is confident that everything will be fine. When he reaches the first town, he is tired and nearly out of water but still believes he'll soon reach Yosemite. At the water pump in the middle of the desert, he is exhausted and thirsty, and realizes that the directions from the old men are out - of - date. He is quite unhappy about listening to them instead of following his map. When he arrives at the fishing place, he is grateful for the water in the sink and the chance to rest. When an old man offers to give directions to Yosemite, he decides to just use his map. Throughout the story, the cyclist's state of mind changes from confidence to depression and finally to relief.
811	6790	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting significantly influenced the main character, the cyclist, during his journey. The arid desert environment led him to believe he could survive without water, ultimately resulting in dehydration. The first town he encountered, with water at a certain temperature (@NUM1 degrees), did not meet his standards. The old velches June factory was dilapidated and out of business, much like the desolate, barren desert landscape. Although the cyclist managed to complete the ride, the desert setting posed a substantial challenge. Overall, the setting had a profound and adverse impact on the cyclist's experience.
812	6791	3	2	The setting of the cyclist's journey encompasses several features that affect him. The increasing heat is one such factor; the line “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage” indicates that the heat may already be having an impact. Another aspect is his location in the desert, where he is running low on water. The statement “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” shows his high water consumption and dwindling supply. Additionally, he is riding through the high deserts of California in June, as stated in the story: “and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The combination of the month of June and the desert environment adds to the heat, making dehydration almost inevitable. These features collectively have a significant effect on the cyclist.
813	6792	3	2	The setting has a notable impact on the cyclist as it creates a deserted atmosphere, which sets the mood of the essay. The mood can be described as that of a dry summer day, evoking a sense of “oh my gosh, it's really hot.” The setting is a dry June day with a deserted town, tumbleweeds, and other elements that contribute to a feeling of hopelessness. Despite the cyclist surviving the journey, given the lack of water, the scorching sun, and the long distance, it seemed highly likely that he would not make it. In conclusion, the setting had the potential to be fatal for the cyclist.
814	6793	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the old guys informed him that the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. This information, in the context of the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit,” reveals that the conditions were extremely dangerous and unsafe for people to ride in. The setting's features thus play a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience and the overall perception of the journey's risk.
815	6794	3	2	The setting had an effect on the cyclist as it was bumpy and hilly, forcing him to exert more effort. Moreover, the heat caused him to become dehydrated. After the cyclist had been riding for a long time, the story states, “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). With very little water for his long - distance trip, the combination of the challenging terrain and the heat took a toll on the cyclist. In summary, the setting's characteristics had a detrimental impact on the cyclist's journey.
816	6795	3	2	I believe the cyclist disregards the influence of the setting's features. For instance, at the start of the story, when passing the warning sign, the cyclist still goes down the hill, ignoring it. Moreover, the text states, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face,” indicating the cyclist's non - regard for the setting's potential warnings.
817	6796	3	2	The features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist as he experiences numerous ups and downs. At one point, he passes by blackish water that feels around two hundred degrees. The weather remains hot and does not cool down, which continuously challenges the cyclist during his journey.
818	6797	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him need water. The intense setting wears him out. As the text states, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This shows that the changing terrain of the cyclist's journey has an impact on him.
819	6798	3	2	The features of the surrounding landscape have both physical and mental effects on the cyclist. Physically, the constant sunlight makes the cyclist sweat more, expending more energy, and the sun's rays increase the perceived heat. The rough road requires the cyclist to pedal harder, further draining energy, as seen when the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” reached rough roads, pedaled harder, sweated more, and lost energy. Mentally, the lack of civilization can lead to a feeling of hopelessness, as the cyclist in the essay felt when having no water and seeing no nearby town. This can undermine the cyclist's will to keep going. In conclusion, the setting's features can physically exhaust and mentally strain the cyclist, making it difficult to continue.
820	6799	3	2	Due to specific settings, the biker has to deal with snakes, heat, and hills. He encounters a diamond - back snake. Since he is passing through the desert, the temperature is around @NUM1 degrees. While biking, he has to climb steep and tiring hills. All these elements of the setting pose significant challenges to the biker during his journey.
821	6800	3	2	"In this story, the setting serves as a catalyst, consistently challenging the character until the end. The text states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" indicating that the terrain opposes the character. Additionally, it says, ""The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water - depleted 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cool."" This not only shows how the elements overpower the character but also reveals their resilience and the satirical nature of life. The ultimate moment in the story occurs when the character stumbles upon the Welch's grape juice factory and sees a picture of a boy ""pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth."" Wherever the cyclist goes, they are constantly striving to overcome the elements. In conclusion, the setting plays a crucial role in creating challenges for the cyclist throughout the story."
822	6801	3	2	The setting features have a significant impact on the cyclist. The lack of water affects the cyclist's speed in reaching the next town, and the difficult terrain further slows them down. In summary, the various aspects of the setting combine to impede the cyclist's progress.
823	6802	3	2	"The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. The hot weather in the deserts of California causes the cyclist to use up their last bit of water. There is no one around to offer assistance as the cyclist is in a desolate area. The excerpt ""I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage…"" indicates the intense heat as the cyclist is sweating and might be seeing a mirage. The statement ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or any structure of any kind"" shows the isolation, meaning there is no help available if the cyclist suffers a heat - stroke. In conclusion, the setting significantly affects the cyclist's endurance."
824	6803	3	2	"The features of the setting make it more difficult for the cyclist to ride. The text mentions ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" which shows the change in terrain that poses a challenge. Statements like ""I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June"" highlight the impact of the hot weather. The appearance of a large highway sign saying ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit"" further adds to the difficulties. The cyclist's comment ""sometimes life can feel so cruel"" reflects their struggle. The hot day makes the ride seem longer, and being out of water leads to exhaustion. The cyclist will do anything to withstand the heat. In conclusion, the setting creates multiple obstacles for the cyclist during their ride."
825	6804	3	2	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" author Joe Kurmaskie experiences the perils of a desolate wilderness. As a cyclist in one of California's most undeveloped regions, the lack of water in the setting severely hampers his survival. The trails he followed had no towns or sources of fresh, drinkable water for days. The combination of continuous cycling through difficult terrain, lack of water and resources, the hot California summer weather, and the absence of civilization drained his energy and led to dehydration. Prolonged exposure to these conditions could have been fatal. Moreover, the inaccuracy of the directions due to the modern time period and year led the cyclist into this dangerous area. In conclusion, the setting in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" places the cyclist in a life - threatening situation."
826	6805	3	2	The features of a setting can manifest in various forms. It may be snowy and cold, rainy and wet, hot and dry, or breezy and humid. The setting could feature a busy thoroughfare or a solitary country road, with rough terrain or straight stretches. The characteristics of a place influence the reality of a cyclist's experience. In an essay, a young cyclist follows the advice of an elderly man and rides through the scorching sun and ghost towns, uncertain of his survival. The intense heat makes him feel as if death is approaching, and his thirst drives him to reach the next town to stay alive. Had the setting been different, such as a flat road in a bustling town with a gentle breeze and numerous water stops, he would not have feared for his life. The features of the setting impact the cyclist's emotions and thoughts. He can experience anger, happiness, sadness, or fear and may even start contemplating his own death. These are, in my view, some of the effects settings have on cyclists.
827	6806	3	2	The features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. For instance, when the author mentions that “flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills,” it compels the author to ride more safely. Additionally, when the author states, “the ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement,” the author has to slow down on the bike and find a safe way around it to proceed. Finally, when the author says “no one in sight, no building, car, or structure,” the cyclist is affected as they are lost, thirsty, and unable to ask for directions. The setting makes it difficult for the cyclist to navigate and reach their destination. In conclusion, the features of the setting can greatly impede a cyclist's journey and ability to move forward.
828	6807	3	2	The features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist. The cyclist, after pedaling for a certain number of miles, was extremely fatigued, with his legs and body in need of rest. Moreover, the challenging nature of the ride made it difficult for him to reach his destination. However, he was a resilient individual and was determined to complete his forty - mile cycling journey. Despite feeling restless, he persevered and achieved his goal. In summary, the setting features, with the long distance and associated physical strain, tested the cyclist but he managed to overcome the difficulties posed by the setting.
829	6808	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. The cyclist begins his journey in a town, aiming to reach Yosemite. Along the way, he decides to heed the advice of a group of old men. At the start, he is full of vigor. But when he reaches the first town, he finds it completely abandoned. He continues on to another deserted town. He presses on until he spots a sign. The terrain varies greatly, with rolling hills, tumbleweeds, and even a snake. By following the old men's advice, the cyclist nearly loses his life due to the sweltering heat and lack of water. The setting impacts the cyclist far more severely than he could have anticipated. In conclusion, the diverse and harsh setting in this story poses a life - threatening challenge to the cyclist.
830	6809	3	2	In the story, the setting has a profound influence on the cyclist's attitude. At the beginning, it is an early summer evening, and the cyclist is calm while conversing with the old men. The next morning, as he starts cycling with thoughts of Yosemite in mind, he is relaxed and confident. However, his attitude changes when he encounters a ramshackle old shed, rusty pumps, and a corral at a park on the road. He becomes slightly worried but not discouraged. As the terrain changes, he feels a bit disheartened. When he comes across an abandoned factory, he is clearly very discouraged. Later, when he reaches @PERSON1's Fish camp, he is extremely relieved and grateful to the owners. The cyclist's attitude fluctuates depending on whether the setting is favorable to him. In conclusion, the setting in the story is a key factor that shapes the cyclist's emotional state throughout the journey.
831	6810	3	2	The features of the setting significantly influence the desperate travels of the fatigued cyclist. The ever - changing scenery, which is sometimes disappointing and sometimes uplifting, impacts him both physically and emotionally. When he passes a portion of the road with only a dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral, he becomes perturbed. As the cyclist is running low on water, he grows even more distressed upon seeing a road with a 55 - mph speed limit while he was cycling at a water - depleting pace. The sweltering June sun in the setting dehydrates the cyclist. In an ironic turn, he is emotionally affected when passing an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1 factory. The factory has a picture of a boy pouring juice into his mouth, which upsets the thirsty cyclist. Overall, the setting continuously tests the cyclist's endurance and mental state.
832	6811	3	2	In the reading of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speeding Limit,” the features of the setting have the most significant impact on the cyclist. At the beginning of his cycling journey, the cyclist uses a positive tone to describe the setting. For instance, in paragraph four, he says, “the cool pines and running rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” This makes the reader envision someone excited about reaching their destination on a dry day. As the cyclist's attitude deteriorates, the reader can attribute this change to the setting. In paragraph thirteen, when the cyclist says, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage and that not to get too excited,” it becomes evident that the situation is getting challenging for the cyclist. Overall, as the setting turns into a “burning sun” and extremely hot condition with a water shortage, the cyclist becomes more sarcastic and less upbeat. For example, when talking about the rocks in his mouth, he states, “with only luck I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” This clearly shows that the setting's features have a negative impact on his mood.
833	6812	3	2	At the start, as the road gets rougher, the cyclist shows more determination. However, towards the end, he has the mindset that “it didn't matter, it was going to die.” This mindset takes a toll on him, making it difficult for him to continue. But then he realizes that he doesn't want to die in such a way, so he perseveres. Eventually, his perseverance leads him to civilization. His journey shows that even in the face of extreme adversity, the will to survive can drive a person forward.
834	6813	3	2	The features of the setting have a substantial impact on the biker. The description of the rough terrain implies that the biker likely faced difficulties during the race. Half - way through the story, the biker said, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This statement is used to convey the challenges of the race. The changing terrain also adds an element of excitement. If the road remained flat or there was no terrain change described, the race would be far less interesting. In conclusion, the terrain changes in the setting not only pose challenges but also enhance the overall allure of the race.
835	6814	3	2	“Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” an essay by Joe Kurmaskie, tells the story of a solo cyclist's journey to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist follows the advice of a group of old guys and ends up lost on a rough road with no water or reliable supplies. The flat road is replaced by short rolling hills, and large highways suddenly appear. A sign reads, “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” The rough road forces the cyclist to work harder, makes him crave more water, and generally makes the journey tougher than it already was. Despite these hardships, the cyclist's determination to reach his destination in Yosemite National Park keeps him going.
836	6815	3	2	"The environment's settings often influence one's mood. Consider the cyclist. Initially, he had a positive outlook. However, upon reaching the first town, his attitude began to decline. He described the town as perhaps having once been a bustling place, yet on that morning, it met the classic definition of a ghost town. Ghost towns typically appear old, dilapidated, and dull. This affected the cyclist as the town was not as the old men had described, leading him to become doubtful, which diminished his motivation compared to when he started. Then, when he expected to find water, ""a tar - like substance oozed out."" This made him nervous and angry as he was unsure if he could continue. But as soon as he saw the store, the setting became more positive, and so did his attitude. Thus, it is evident that the setting impacts the cyclist's mood and attitude."
837	6816	3	2	"Numerous features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist. The desert setting is characterized by dry air and high temperatures. The intense heat made it difficult for the cyclist to persevere. In despair, the author stated, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" Another aspect of the setting was the desolate towns lacking water. The absence of water made it extremely challenging for him to continue. His thirst was so severe that he resorted to putting pebbles in his mouth, as sucking on stones helps distract from thirst by allowing the remaining saliva to circulate. Additionally, the abandoned Welch's Grape factory in the setting gave the cyclist false hope. In his thirst - stricken state, having grape juice would have been wonderful. The narrator referred to the factory as an ""ironic twist."" Overall, these various features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist's journey."
838	6817	3	2	"The setting has a profound effect on me. When riding a bike in hot weather with only a small amount of water, I would have given up if there was nothing to drink. The water was bound to be warm. In the text, it says, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" I doubt I could have endured for long if I were dehydrated. Based on the description, I believe I would have succumbed to heatstroke. In conclusion, the combination of hot weather and limited water in the setting would have made the situation unbearable for me."
839	6818	3	2	"Multiple features of the setting influence the cyclist. In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the scarcity of water in the arid desert has a long - lasting impact on the cyclist. The quote ""Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh"" reveals how the heat and water shortage have made the cyclist extremely hot and dehydrated, to the point where she could pass out at any moment. Moreover, by laughing at herself, she is thinking beyond the immediate discomfort and trying to conserve energy. As a result, the lack of water in the setting has instilled in the cyclist a sense of humor and courage to keep going towards her final destination."
840	6819	3	2	The setting's features affect the cyclist in numerous ways. The bumpy roads make the ride uncomfortable. Sand gets into his eyes, and he suffers from thirst due to the hot and humid temperatures. He may have grown tired of pedaling and had to walk instead. When he entered the town, a wild dog chased him. To make matters worse, he had no money to buy a drink. All these factors combined create a challenging situation for the cyclist, severely hampering his journey.
841	6820	3	2	The cyclist in this story is significantly influenced by the heat of his surroundings. As he rides to @CAPS1, the day's heat begins to intensify. The text states, “I had been hitting my water bottle regularly.” Due to the day's heat, the cyclist is consuming large amounts of water at a time. He continues his journey under the sweltering conditions.
842	6821	3	2	When the cyclist describes the terrain as hot, dry, and open, it gives me the distinct feeling that he is in the desert. I'm also certain it's hot because he's sweating and dehydrated. This indicates that the harsh environmental conditions are taking a toll on him.
843	6822	3	2	Initially, the cyclist is in a good state. Although he gets a bit disheartened, he is generally fine. As he says, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them” (@CAPS1). He feels relaxed as he is familiar and at ease with the water and pine trees, which offer him a sense of comfort. He believes that after the first “tree” was unremarkable, the others will be better. He is confident in his ability to continue but is unaware that he has to travel a long distance to get water. When he sees the sign “It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT,” he realizes things will get tough because “the speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water - depleting 12 mph.” At this point, he starts to worry as he is more isolated and realizes he has no water. As he runs out of water, the landscape and his surroundings become increasingly dry. He notes, “tumble weeds crossed my path.” The landscape also seems more threatening, like “a ridiculously large shake.” Clearly, the availability of water is closely related to the changing nature of the landscape.
844	6823	3	2	The setting has a profound impact on the cyclist. The intense heat and lack of human presence drive him to the verge of madness. If he were in @LOCATION2, the only issue would be the heat since there are people everywhere. However, if he were in @LOCATION1, the severe temperature drop and absence of human presence would likely lead to his death. In conclusion, the setting can greatly determine the cyclist's survival and well - being.
845	6824	3	2	The features of the setting that the cyclist encounters do have an impact on him. For instance, when the setting changes from an abandoned town to an empty, deserted road that hasn't been used in thirty years, it reduces the cyclist's motivation and saps his strength. This shows that the environment can significantly affect the cyclist's physical and mental state.
846	6825	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", a cyclist seeks directions from older men. Unfortunately, they inaccurately guide him towards Yosemite, causing him to become lost with scarce water. The setting's features, such as the terrain and the sun, significantly impact the cyclist. On a hot summer day, the intense sun makes it arduous for the cyclist to continue moving due to extreme heat and thirst. As Kurmaskie quotes, “The sun was beginning to beat down… I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Moreover, the bumpy and rough terrain further complicates the journey. Clearly, both the sun and the terrain have a substantial influence on the cyclist during this hot summer outing."
847	6826	3	2	The setting's features present a cruel irony to the cyclist. As he progresses on his route, he passes through a ghost town. Twenty miles further, he spots a dilapidated shed and some rusty water pumps. With his water running out, he tries to draw water but only retrieves muck and what he describes as “water feeling two - hundred degrees, with the flavor of battery acid.” Further along, there's a sign warning of a rough road and indicating a posted speed limit of 55 mph, while he's traveling at 12 mph. To make matters worse, he discovers an abandoned juice factory and at that point, he runs out of water. In conclusion, the combination of these elements in the setting severely challenges the cyclist's journey.
848	6827	3	2	One should not exceed the posted speed limit and should avoid taking travel advice from old - timers who haven't left their porches since Carter was in office. Twenty miles up the road, the cyclist reaches a fork. Desperate for water with only a few sips left in his bottles, he gets down on his hands and knees and struggles to operate the rusted water pump with all his might. There's speculation about another person; he could be a sad individual or just a bum. In summary, the cyclist faces a series of challenges including misinformation and a lack of water on his journey.
849	6828	3	2	The features of the setting can have a significant impact on the cyclist, and in this case, they do. As the text states, “Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” This is evident as the cyclist is aware that the road ahead will be rough, yet he's only traveling at 12 mph. Clearly, the features of the setting, such as the rough road and the overall situation, have affected the cyclist. In conclusion, the setting plays a crucial role in influencing the cyclist's experience.
850	6829	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound effect on the cyclist. The sweltering weather leads to a dry mouth and a shortage of water. To cope, the cyclist resorts to a unique method. He places stones in his mouth, reasoning that “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.” By using this technique, he manages to endure the difficult situation. In conclusion, the setting's hot weather forces the cyclist to find unconventional ways to survive the ordeal.
851	6830	3	2	"The setting features had multiple impacts on the cyclist. A highway sign reading ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT"" was one such factor. The terrain consisted of short, rolling hills, which made pedaling uphill more strenuous as it required significantly more effort and energy. Additionally, there were roadblocks. At one point, tumbleweeds obstructed the cyclist's path, and there was also a ridiculously large snake. These roadblocks posed a danger to the biker, who had to maneuver around them, resulting in the loss of time and energy and causing the cyclist to drink more water. Since it was June and a hot day, the lack of water was a serious threat as the cyclist risked dehydration. Moreover, there was no one around, so if the cyclist desperately needed water, it was not possible to obtain it."
852	6831	3	2	"After reading ""Do not Exceed Posted Limit"", it becomes evident that the setting of an area can influence one's mood and attitude. In this story, the main character is a cyclist who follows the advice of a few old men sitting in a poseh and takes a bad shortcut. While riding, the cyclist encounters hills, which have a significant physical impact. Continuously pedaling up and down the hills makes the cyclist tired. The initial mood is replaced by the presence of short, moving hills. The cyclist struggles to maintain a steady rhythm as it is unclear how long the up - and - down cycling will continue. At one point, the cyclist remarks, ""@CAPS1 can feel so cruel."" The cyclist is upset when a road sign appears on rough roads, instructing not to exceed 55 miles per hour when the cyclist is only going 12 miles per hour. This can also be seen as a metaphor. In life, taking shortcuts often has consequences. Just as dropping out of high school to pursue a journalistic career may not work out, leaving one without a diploma and potentially struggling to find a job."
853	6832	3	2	"In the short story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the setting has a profound impact on the cyclist. The dry, hot air gradually dehydrates the cyclist, causing a loss of rational thinking. The heat also plays tricks on the cyclist's mind. The rolling hills exhaust the cyclist as cycling uphill requires a great deal of effort. Coupled with the heat, this causes the cyclist to consume their much - needed water supply. Overall, the setting in this story significantly affects the cyclist."
854	6833	3	2	The features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist. The area where the cyclist is located plays a major role. The cyclist is in California, which is a large desert. In the middle of the desert, it is extremely hot. Biking on desert roads with no trees or shade is quite harsh. Moreover, riding in an area with little civilization, where it is difficult to obtain water, is a significant problem.
855	6834	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. There is a poisonous snake in the area, and the cyclist is the only person riding down those hills alone. The cyclist has been informed that the next town is @NUM1 miles away from the current location. The lack of water is a major issue as there are no streams or rivers in the desert area. With these factors combined, the cyclist is in a precarious situation.
856	6835	3	2	In mid - summer, a traveler finds himself in the Californian desert. The environment is harsh, with scorching heat, high humidity, and extreme dryness. His water supply in the bag is running low. As he continues his journey along the lost, rough, and arduous roads, the lack of water and the unforgiving conditions pose a significant challenge to his trip.
857	6836	3	2	The setting in the story, a hot June day in a California desert, significantly affected the cyclist. Cycling in the desert for hours under the intense heat with limited water forced the cyclist to conserve their supply to reach the park. The rolling hills made the cyclist's legs extremely tired, to the point where they were reluctant to move. The relentless sun caused excessive sweating, and the cyclist started seeing things, longing only to find water. All these factors had a profound impact on the cyclist.
858	6837	3	2	The cyclist in the story encounters numerous problems due to the setting. In the summer heat of California, after cycling for several minutes, thirst sets in. Although the cyclist brought water, continuous sweating has nearly depleted the supply. Insufficient water can lead to dehydration, which may cause the cyclist to pass out and potentially die. Clearly, the heat and lack of water in the setting have negatively affected the cyclist.
859	6838	3	2	The features of the setting have multiple effects on the cyclist. The cyclist is in a hot and dry area where there is no water in sight for miles, and towns are scarce. The quote “About forty miles into the pedal I arrived at the first town” indicates the rarity of towns. The cyclist's extreme thirst is evident from the statement “I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst”. Moreover, the heat is so intense that the cyclist starts seeing visions, as described by “As the looks often had been a grape juice factory and bottling plant” in the middle of nowhere. These examples demonstrate how the setting can impact a cyclist's mental and physical state.
860	6839	3	2	The condition of the road is a setting factor that affects the cyclist. The road twists and turns in various directions and has uphill sections, making it difficult to pedal. The cyclist has @NUM1 miles to go before reaching a town. There is a risk of running out of water before getting there. To avoid getting sick, the cyclist may have to make stops. Once reaching the town, the cyclist can replenish their water supply.
861	6840	3	2	The setting's features took a toll on the cyclist throughout his journey. As he pedaled along, he gradually became hot and thirsty. With each passing mile, fatigue set in, and his thirst intensified. Initially, he drank water without much thought, but as the ride continued, he found himself rationing it carefully. By the time he reached the second small town, he was so parched and exhausted that he worried it might be a mirage. People typically experience mirages when they are hot, tired, and desperate for water, which perfectly described the cyclist after his long trip to Yosemite National Park following directions from some old men. His arduous journey was clearly affected by the unforgiving setting.
862	6841	3	2	The setting features, described as having no one in sight, no buildings, cars, or any structures, depict the trail the cyclist was on. These characteristics of the setting illustrate how the cyclist is impacted as they highlight his uncertainty about whether he will survive. The desolate nature of the trail adds to the cyclist's sense of vulnerability and doubt. In such an environment, with no signs of civilization, the cyclist's mind is likely filled with concerns about his well - being and ability to make it through the journey. This shows that the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience and state of mind.
863	6842	3	2	Various features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. The speed - limit sign instills in him a feeling that life is harsh. His first view of the Welch's Juice factory fills him with excitement. Encountering the deserted fork in the road troubles him. Finally, when he reaches his destination, he feels relieved. These instances clearly demonstrate that the features of the setting have a profound effect on the cyclist's emotions and mental state during his journey. The setting acts as a catalyst for different emotional responses, influencing how the cyclist experiences and perceives his trip.
864	6843	3	2	The numerous features of the setting have a substantial influence on the cyclist and his performance. For instance, the cyclist is traversing a sweltering region of California, as indicated at the end of a paragraph: “and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The high deserts of California are characterized by strong winds, sandy terrain, dryness, and intense heat. This is not an ideal environment for cycling. If the setting were the mountainous regions of California, the weather would not be as hot, and the cyclist would likely not feel as tired. The mountains are cooler, albeit dry. Personally, if I were cycling, I would prefer a different setting like the mountains rather than an arid desert to avoid the discomfort the cyclist endured. The setting clearly plays a crucial role in determining the cyclist's experience and performance.
865	6844	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting are of great significance to the cyclist. The story is set in California, a place that gets extremely hot during summer. This setting has a profound impact on the cyclist. The hot weather and water shortage pose significant problems. Due to the limited water supply, the cyclist has to conserve it, which slows down his cycling as he can't ride as much. Even though there is a cool wind and a river from Yosemite, the need to quickly descend the hill adds to his difficulties. In conclusion, the setting of the story greatly affects the cyclist and restricts his ability to ride effectively.
866	6845	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting features have numerous impacts on the cyclist. The story details the man pedaling long distances, such as twenty miles here and forty miles there. It is extremely hot outside, and he has a limited water supply. He doubts he can reach his destination as he clearly needs more water. As the narrator states, “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June,” a time when California is very hot. The desert's sweltering weather restricts his water supply, and the fact that he is in a desolate area with no buildings around makes him lose hope of making it through. There are snakes in the desert, which pose a danger to him, and the bumpy road makes it more difficult for him to maintain control and reach his destination. The quote “I began breaking the ride into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself if I could make it there I'd be fine” shows both his struggle due to the area and his perseverance. In conclusion, the features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist in this story.
867	6846	3	2	Numerous features of the cyclist's surroundings influence his speed and confidence. He is the sole individual on the road, with no other cars, bikes, motorcycles, or even buildings in sight. It is as if he is in the countryside. This situation makes him inclined to ride faster since he is unlikely to collide with anything. The fact that he is alone in the vast, open spaces raises his energy level and makes him feel more self - assured. In summary, the cyclist's environment has a positive impact on his riding speed and confidence.
868	6847	3	2	In my opinion, for a bike ride to be enjoyable, an appropriate setting is essential. A good setting, to me, would involve an outside temperature of about @NUM1° and sunny weather. Biking in the snow is not feasible because the tires cannot move effectively in the snow. Riding in rain or hail is also dangerous as the roads become slippery, increasing the risk of an accident that could cause injury or even death. When it is sunny outside, one can ride freely on dry roads with a gentle breeze running through their hair, which is refreshing. Therefore, I firmly believe that having the right setting is crucial for a bike ride.
869	6848	3	2	This story takes place in the scorching desert in June, and the main character is a cyclist aiming to reach a National Park. The setting has a significant impact on the cyclist. As the temperature rises, more water is needed to stay hydrated, but the man is alone in the desert. The quote “about forty miles in the pedal I arrived at my first ‘town’. The place might have been a thriving little spot at one time” illustrates the desolation of the desert. As he rides, there is no one around, no place to re - hydrate, and no place to get directions. He is completely alone. In conclusion, the harsh desert setting in June severely challenges the cyclist's journey.
870	6849	3	2	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting has a profound effect on the cyclist. In the story, the cyclist is on his way to Yosemite National Park. Thinking it a prudent move, he takes directions from a group of eccentric old men. He starts his journey with confidence on flat ground and with a large amount of water. The first of the three promised towns turns out to be a ghost town. The second town offers only water that barely resembles anything drinkable, more like battery acid. The cyclist soon becomes exhausted due to lack of water and the now hilly terrain. He barely reaches the third town only to find that the juice factory is out of business. He becomes convinced that he will die of thirst until he stumbles upon a bait store. Had it not been so hot, had the “towns” along the way provided better resources, and had the terrain not been so hilly, the cyclist would have had a pleasant ride. In conclusion, all these factors of the setting have a substantial impact on the cyclist's experience.
871	6850	3	2	The cyclist was significantly affected by the setting's features, namely the heat, terrain, and isolation. In California, the sweltering weather left the cyclist parched and on the verge of dehydration. Water stops were scarce, and when available, the water was of poor quality and warm. The diverse terrain also contributed to the cyclist's thirst and exhaustion. Being in the middle of nowhere compounded the problem, as the cyclist had no access to water for hydration or a place to rest. Overall, these elements of the setting made the cyclist's journey extremely challenging.
872	6851	3	2	The cyclist faced a harsh and perilous setting. In June, he was traveling through the high deserts of California, where water was scarce and the terrain was tough. He was dehydrated and still had a long way to go. I once went on a long - distance bike ride in @LOCATION2, and like the cyclist, we couldn't take a break to get water. The tough terrain was similar to the author's. The cyclist was so affected by the situation that it was taking a toll on his mind, and he just wanted the ordeal to end. I'm truly relieved that I don't have to bike in such difficult conditions.
873	6852	3	2	"In ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1"", the cyclist was riding through the California desert in June. The arid and barren environment made it nearly impossible to find water. The only water the cyclist found was when it @NUM1 and tasted like battery acid. For miles, there was no water source. The lack of water and the intense heat made the cyclist's progress slow and laborious. He even mentioned that he could only manage 12 mph in a 55 - mph zone. Taking the advice of the old men and using a ""shortcut"", the cyclist passed through ghost towns with no water. This so - called ""shortcut"" likely prolonged his trip by hours. If he had taken the longer route through populated areas, there would have been more water, allowing him to travel faster. The dry and hot conditions of the old men's ""shortcut"" made the cyclist's journey much longer than necessary."
874	6853	3	2	"At the start of his cycling journey, the man thought it would be an easy ride. As he said, ""Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face."" But as he went further, he found himself in the middle of nowhere. The scenery became increasingly desolate until there was nothing but emptiness. This desolate scenery started to erode his hope of getting out of the desert. When he saw a large highway sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", he realized the journey would be difficult. He had to navigate bumpy roads and avoid snakes. The abandoned scenery created a sense of hopelessness. However, when he spotted the bait shop, his spirits were lifted, and he felt hopeful and relieved."
875	6854	3	2	When the cyclist started his journey, he was confident of success. However, throughout the story, he encountered numerous obstacles. His first major difficulty arose when he reached a small, abandoned town. In June, traveling through the high deserts of California, he realized he hadn't conserved his water well, and his water bottles had only a few sips left. On top of that, the heat was unbearable. He was losing water rapidly through sweating. The difficult roads also added to his troubles. Despite all these hardships during his journey, the cyclist was determined to finish. Once he overcame these challenges, he felt a great sense of satisfaction.
876	6855	3	2	The setting's features impact the cyclist. Firstly, he listens to old men who seem unaware of the roads' distance, length, or condition when directing him. Secondly, the road conditions, with tumbleweeds and a very large snake, also affect him. Additionally, the hot weather leads to dehydration. Overall, these aspects of the setting significantly influence the cyclist's journey.
877	6856	3	2	One significant feature of the setting that impacts the cyclist is the daytime heat. Cycling in hot conditions causes a substantial consumption of water. Another factor is the limited water supply. Lastly, the inaccurate directions from elderly men also pose a problem. While older individuals are not always incorrect, their information can be outdated. In conclusion, these elements of the setting have a notable effect on the cyclist.
878	6857	3	2	The setting features in the essay strongly affect the cyclist. As he cycled through California, he entered hot deserts and nearly ran out of water. In a severely dehydrated state, he searched for water or any drinkable substance to relieve his dehydration. After some time, he found himself alone in the desert with no one in sight, as described by the statement “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” Another indication of his struggle against dehydration is “wise rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat - stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades.” Clearly, the settings in this essay have a great impact on the cyclist.
879	6858	3	2	During the author's ride to Yosemite, he lacks the necessary resource, water, for the long desert stretch he has to face. The California desert is extremely hot and can be dangerous depending on one's situation. The author described the impact of the lack of water with statements like “Rattled around the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain.” With his severe water shortage, he cannot withstand the harsh heat. He was on the verge of heatstroke as he passed desert snakes and tumbleweeds. Evidently, the author was struggling against the desert heat.
880	6859	3	2	Settings and features are crucial for cyclists. They may carry a water bottle and a snack, but they need to know their destination and whether they should bring extra supplies. In the story, the cyclist didn't bring enough provisions. He got directions, but they were inaccurate, putting him in trouble. It's essential for cyclists to know where they're going and what surrounds them to avoid getting lost and lacking access to food and water.
881	6860	3	2	In June, a cyclist found himself in a desert. The extreme heat and dryness of the desert took a toll on him. With no trees around, there was no shade to escape the scorching sun that beat down on his back. The terrain was filled with numerous hills, such as the “one long, crippling hill” mentioned. These hills required a great deal of strength to navigate. There was also a large, unexpected twist in his path, and he even encountered a snake. The lack of water, combined with the heat, left him dehydrated. The constant exposure to the sun and the energy - sapping task of climbing hills, all happening one after another without a break, completely exhausted him.
882	6861	3	2	In the story, the beauty of the night and the outdoors were described, and how they affected the cyclist's trip was also explored. The setting was mild, warm, and calm. These features of the setting had an impact on the cyclist. There seemed to be a certain similarity between the setting and the cyclist. In conclusion, the features of the setting clearly influenced the cyclist throughout his journey.
883	6862	3	2	In June, a cyclist was in California. The sun was blazing down on him, making the cycling difficult, especially with a limited water supply. As he rode, he came across several abandoned towns, which further depleted his water resources. The terrain started off long and straight but then transformed into tall hills. Riding on such terrain must have been extremely challenging. All these factors combined made the cyclist's journey a tough one.
884	6863	3	2	The features of the setting, including the condition of the roads, rolling hills, and the heat, significantly affect the cyclist. The rough roads in the setting pose a challenge to the cyclist. As stated in the text, “I noticed that terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” These conditions make it difficult for the cyclist and give him a tough challenge. The rolling hills are tricky and require him to stay focused on the road. The heat and the sun also have an impact. For example, “I chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to heat up but I barely noticed...”. The sun's intensity will increase as he reaches the high deserts. In conclusion, these features of the setting affect the cyclist in multiple ways, yet he continues to push himself forward.
885	6864	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the setting involves a person riding a bike at high speed on a rough road. This setting creates a sense of difficulty and perhaps danger for the cyclist. The roughness of the road likely makes it hard to maintain speed and control. Overall, this setting sets the stage for an exciting and challenging cycling experience.
886	6865	3	2	The cyclist encountered several challenges during his journey. The hills were a significant issue as they consumed most of his energy and slowed him down. Additionally, the lack of water was a problem. Had he had energy - boosting water, it would have given him the impetus to continue. Overall, these factors combined to make his journey quite arduous.
887	6866	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the setting features have a notable impact on the cyclist. The cyclist pedaled through the “high deserts of California”, indicating a hot and dry climate. As a result, he likely experienced regular thirst and exhaustion from the sun. Subsequently, he started riding through hills. It is well - known that cycling on hills, especially uphill, is much more strenuous and can wear a person out. The combination of these hills and the lack of water probably left him extremely tired and made it extremely difficult for him to continue without sufficient water. Evidently, the setting and its differences play a crucial role in affecting the cyclist and his water supply.
888	6867	3	2	The setting has a significant impact on the cyclist as he cannot tolerate the heat. His water supply is dwindling, and he is dehydrated. This is evident from the character's statement, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide wings of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke”. This shows that he fears passing out and dying before finding more water. In conclusion, the setting severely affects the cyclist's well - being.
889	6868	3	2	The setting affected the cyclist in multiple ways. First, he arrived at a “ghost town”. Then, about twenty miles up the road, he reached a water pump. The water from the pump was extremely hot and had a foul taste. As the text states, “...water heating somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees...when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid”. After that, he had to travel without water and became dehydrated. While traveling up and down hills, he thought he saw a building that might have water, but it was abandoned. Eventually, he decided to suck on a couple of pebbles, as he recalled reading that it could help take one's mind off thirst. Overall, the setting made the cyclist's journey extremely difficult.
890	6869	3	2	Due to the intense heat, the cyclist is severely dehydrated, tired, and short on water. The statement “I checked my water supply and headed on” serves as evidence of this. The desolate and sad places with no cars around dampen the cyclist's hope of finding civilization. The scarcity of buildings and the fact that the ones he does see are deserted make the journey very tough for him. Another challenge is when he encounters a pump with tar, dirt, and hot water. The road also takes a toll on him, as indicated by his statement “If I could just make it to that next horizon/hill I'll be alright”. Clearly, the setting and its features affect the cyclist both mentally and physically.
891	6870	3	2	The heat, solitude, and lack of water all contribute to how the setting impacts the cyclist. As the cyclist pedals along, the sweltering heat makes them anxious about dehydration. Riding alone with nothing in view means that in case of an emergency, there would be no one to offer assistance. With only a small amount of water, the cyclist has to ration it to stay active and energized. Staying hydrated becomes a challenge with such limited water. In conclusion, these elements of the setting have a significant effect on the cyclist.
892	6871	3	2	The terrain a cyclist traverses has a substantial impact on them. Hills present a significant challenge; for instance, when the cyclist in the story realized they had to ride on hills, they were clearly disappointed. The smoothness of the road also matters. In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the main character encountered a rough patch on the road and was disheartened, not wanting to continue. Heat is another factor. Multiple times in the story, the cyclist expresses fatigue and dehydration, at one point fearing they might die of heatstroke. In conclusion, these aspects of the setting have notable effects on the cyclist.
893	6872	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting significantly affects the cyclist. The setting is the high deserts of California in June, where the heat is intense. The path recommended by some old men exacerbates the situation as there are no people or water in sight. At the start of the day, the cyclist is confident and excited about the ride to Yosemite National Park. However, after traveling a certain number of miles, they reach a “ghost town,” which they were led to believe would be a settled town for supplies and rest. As the temperature soars to what feels like “two hundred degrees,” the cyclist runs low on water and begins to feel that “sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The heat, lack of people, and water drive the cyclist to desperation, making them feel like they are “going to die.” The setting creates a mood of hopelessness but also amplifies the cyclist's determination to keep going, as stopping could mean death. The author uses the setting to convey the message that blindly trusting others instead of oneself can lead to difficult - to - overcome situations. In conclusion, the setting plays a crucial role in the cyclist's experience and the author's message.
894	6873	3	2	In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit,” the cyclist encounters various settings. It was early summer and quite hot when they set off. Riding into the morning made the cyclist tired. The first town they reached was a ghost town, so they couldn't rest or get supplies. Then they came across cool pines and a rushing river, which likely made them feel relaxed. Next, they arrived at a ramshackle shed with several rusty pumps and a corral that was in poor condition. The presence of some men made the cyclist feel uncomfortable, and the pumps didn't yield any water. Finally, they were riding through the California deserts in June, which probably made them more dehydrated. In conclusion, these different settings had diverse impacts on the cyclist's journey.
895	6874	3	2	The cyclist made a wrong decision by taking the advice of the older men. Using the map would have been a safer and easier option. People, including myself, often seek shortcuts. The cyclist was at risk of dying from heatstroke and lack of water. However, their perseverance saved them as they never gave up. If I were in that situation and setting, I would have given up. In conclusion, while the cyclist's perseverance was commendable, the initial decision to follow the advice was ill - advised.
896	6875	3	2	When cycling, it is crucial to be aware of the terrain type, check the weather, assess the environment, and most importantly, ensure you have sufficient resources. These factors are essential before embarking on any cycling trip as they significantly influence whether the journey will be enjoyable and relaxing or long and miserable.
897	6876	3	2	In the story, a cyclist travels a long distance. After pedaling about forty miles, he reaches the first town. Fortunately, he has water; otherwise, his survival would have been uncertain. I believe his biggest mistake was asking for directions from someone who likely had never been on that road. When he followed the directions, he came across a sign warning of a rough road ahead. That moment made me feel sorry for him, and it was probably the most impactful event that happened to him during the journey.
898	6877	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed” by @PERSON1, the settings have multiple effects on the rider. Firstly, the high temperature causes the rider to become hot and dehydrated, leading to thirst. Secondly, the desolate surroundings mean there are no places for the rider to obtain water, exacerbating the dehydration and increasing thirst. The rider's statement “One ran - shacle shed, several rusty pumps, and the corral that couldn't hold the lamest mal greeted me” confirms the lack of nearby resources. Additionally, the hills in the setting make the rider tired as they require more pedaling and wear him out. Overall, the setting features, including heat, lack of resources, and hills, have a significant negative impact on the rider.
899	6878	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting greatly affected the cyclist. It was a hot June day, and his water supplies were running out. He got wrong directions from some old men, which made him ride longer than necessary. Since he was going in the wrong direction, there were no buildings to get water from, no people to communicate with, and no one to call for help if he over - heated. The combination of these factors due to the setting made his journey extremely difficult.
900	6879	3	2	In the story, the rider encountered several melancholy sights. The “ghost town” he first came across was a burden as he had no one to ask for directions or a place to freshen up. Later, the hill on the road was a physical obstacle that he had to overcome. With the sun beating down on his back and the empty road, he might have wanted to turn back. However, he persevered and managed to continue. The lack of water also made his journey arduous. As his water ran out and he started to feel sick, it became increasingly difficult for him to keep going, but his perseverance ultimately got him through.
901	6880	3	2	The setting in the story has a significant negative impact on the cyclist. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water that felt around two hundred degrees. This prevented the cyclist from getting water from the well, leaving him in a situation where he desperately needed water but couldn't obtain it. Additionally, the poor terrain described in the essay meant that the cyclist had to pedal harder to keep moving and exert more effort to avoid exhaustion. The old abandoned factory where a boy was drinking juice had the most profound effect on the cyclist. He was extremely thirsty and on the verge of giving up at that moment. Overall, the setting in this essay affected the cyclist to such an extent that he thought he might die.
902	6881	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting has multiple effects on the cyclist. The speaker reveals that the cyclist is riding his bike in the middle of the desert in June, indicating that he is likely experiencing intense heat. The road turning into hills and bumps makes the journey more challenging as the cyclist has to expend more energy to ascend the hills. Moreover, the “towns” the cyclist encounters are abandoned and neglected, which is unfavorable as he cannot obtain water for his trip. In conclusion, the setting in this story significantly hampers the cyclist's journey.
903	6882	3	2	The @CAPS1 is influenced in numerous ways, with the lack of water being the most significant factor. Throughout the story, the @CAPS1 repeatedly mentions the scarcity of water and expresses regret for choosing that route. For instance, he says, “I could drop from a heat - stroke on a gorgeous day in June because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, which caused me to laugh.” The @CAPS1 also makes remarks about the older gentleman throughout the narrative. Overall, the lack of water and the decision to take that route have a substantial impact on the @CAPS1.
904	6883	3	2	The setting has a profound influence on the cyclist's mood. Generally, a bad setting is likely to put the cyclist in a bad mood, as mood is closely related to the overall setting. In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist feels very confident, and the setting helps to enhance this confidence and endurance. In conclusion, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's emotional state and self - perception.
905	6884	3	2	The features of the setting in the essay have a great impact on the author. On a hot day, cycling over hills with no water and no nearby town is extremely difficult, especially after riding for more than @NUM1 miles. The hot June weather in a desert - adjacent area can lead to serious problems such as heatstroke. The lack of water also causes dehydration, which instilled a great deal of fear in the author. The setting and the conditions the author faced were extremely dangerous, and he is fortunate to have survived. In conclusion, the setting in the essay posed a life - threatening situation for the author.
906	6885	3	2	The cyclist, with a hurry in his body, was cycling on a steep and rough road yesterday to reach his destination in the town. However, the difficult conditions along the way made the journey quite challenging. In the end, his efforts were affected by these circumstances, and it was a tough experience for him.
907	6886	3	2	In the short - story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the setting has a significant impact on the cyclist. At the start of the story, the cyclist is eager to reach Yosemite National Park. He follows the advice of old - timers who haven't left their porches since Carter was in office and soon realizes it was a mistake. The author describes the first “town” as a classic ghost town. This didn't trouble the cyclist as much as what he saw next: a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold a large mule. The cyclist found this sight troubling. When he says, “It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean,” it's clear he has given up hope. This short story demonstrates that even the most experienced travelers can be worried about their survival due to the setting.
908	6887	3	2	I believe the features of the setting affect the cyclist because the cyclist's knowledge is limited. For instance, the “old - timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” implies that it's time for the older people to relax and observe the younger generation. This limited knowledge, combined with the setting, influences the cyclist's experience. In conclusion, the setting and the cyclist's restricted knowledge interact to have an impact on the cyclist's journey.
909	6888	3	2	The features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist. The area where he is riding is extremely dry and hot. Initially, he can manage the heat with his water supply, but once it runs out, he starts to become disoriented. In the text, he writes, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage.” This shows that the heat and the surrounding images made him feel even hotter, and his lack of water made him almost believe he was imagining the building. Another example is “A sand - blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hang my head.” This quote reveals that the cyclist is in complete despair. Everywhere he goes, he is constantly reminded of how hot and thirsty he is and can't get a drink. Thus, the features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist.
910	6889	3	2	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the setting significantly impacts the cyclist. As Kurmaskie writes, “Not two miles into this next section of ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The cyclist is traveling through hot, dry California in mid - June with little water left. Traveling up and down short hills requires more energy than riding on a flat road, which makes the cyclist even more tired. The loss of energy, combined with the lack of water, makes the cyclist more miserable. Clearly, the setting of this story has a great influence on the cyclist.
911	6890	3	2	The features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist's mood and behavior. Initially, the cyclist believes that taking a shortcut will enable a quicker arrival at Yosemite. However, later he realizes it won't. Subsequently, the intense sun, rough terrain, and lack of water lead the cyclist to lose hope of reaching Yosemite. This also makes him re - evaluate his judgment and consider taking advice from others.
912	6891	3	2	"The setting had a harsh impact on the cyclist. At the start, the cyclist was in good condition and making good progress. But shortly after passing the first ""ghost town"", he started to weaken. Subsequently, the cyclist encountered several problems. He was running low on water, had to deal with rough roads, and faced snakes and a sense of abandonment. Despite these numerous obstacles, the cyclist managed to persevere and emerged strong in the end."
913	6892	3	2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. The description “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling.” demonstrates this impact. The cyclist was troubled by the sight because he was in need of water. The rusty pumps, which reminded him of water, made him aware that there was either no water or that it was unfit to drink.
914	6893	3	2	The environmental conditions and the state of the road can significantly affect cyclists. For instance, cycling on flat land in warm weather requires relatively little determination to pedal. Conversely, in hot weather on rough and hilly paths, cyclists may become dehydrated, and it takes much more effort to climb hills. Clearly, environmental conditions have a substantial impact on cyclists.
915	6894	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, a cyclist traveling to Yosemite National Park has to confront the harsh deserts of California. As is typical in deserts, the sun is extremely hot, and so is the sand. There is a complete lack of water, and dangerous, venomous creatures are everywhere. The lack of water nearly causes the cyclist to have a heat - stroke. Despite this, he is determined to leave the desert and continues cycling alone. A grape juice factory seems to taunt him, but he maintains a steady pace. The desert roads are rocky and bumpy, and his slow speed of 12 mph hardly gets him anywhere. Finally, he reaches a modern area and is able to drink water from the bathroom sink.
916	6895	3	2	In the story, the setting significantly impacts the cyclist. The terrain is often challenging, featuring large hills and winding turns. Moreover, the area is deserted, with no houses, buildings, or people in sight, which makes the cyclist feel isolated and as if death is near. The author describes the terrain in one part of the story: “Over one long, crippling hill a building came into view!” This quote illustrates the substantial size of the hills in the setting and the difficulty of surmounting them. It also highlights the significance of a single building and the cyclist's excitement upon seeing it. Throughout the story, the author depicts numerous features of the setting, all of which have a profound effect on the cyclist.
917	6896	3	2	The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting as he found himself in undesirable places. He took advice from older men who were no longer familiar with the area. While riding, he seemed lost as he tried to follow their advice but encountered many unknown and unwanted areas. He started his journey well but then came across a “Rough Road,” and he even remarked that “sometimes life can feel so cruel.” Later, he encountered a large snake in the middle of the road. It was so intimidating that he had to slowly ride past it as it occupied most of the road. Overcoming these challenges was extremely difficult for the young man. In conclusion, the setting presented multiple obstacles that tested the cyclist's resolve.
918	6897	3	2	The desert environment had a profound impact on the cyclist. He had been consuming water regularly but was on the verge of running out. Unaware that there would be no refills, as the pump was only dispensing a “tarlike substance” according to the text, dehydration began to set in. One consequence of dehydration is poor balance, which would have been useful when passing the “ridiculously large snake” he encountered. Another effect was the appearance of mirages, which could impair judgment. When he saw a building, he “[wiped] the sweat from (his) eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage.” Despite all the harsh desert obstacles, the cyclist managed to take a shortcut and survive the heat, dehydration, and the desert's animals. In essence, the cyclist's ability to persevere through these challenges showcases his resilience.
919	6898	3	2	I firmly believe that the features in the setting of the story “Do not exceed the speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie have a significant impact on the cyclist. Some implied information suggests that it is extremely hot outside, and the townspeople did not offer him any assistance. The text states that “somewhere in the neighbourhood of @NUM1 degrees,” indicating the sweltering heat. The statement “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” implies that the people in towns didn't help him. Some explicitly stated information in the text includes the presence of a rough road and a snake in his path. The warning “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” clearly indicates the rough road, and the mention of “a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the road” confirms the presence of the snake. In conclusion, the story is rife with both implied and expressed information about the setting that affects the cyclist.
920	6899	3	2	The features of the setting had a major impact on the cyclist, almost leading to a very serious situation. The cyclist was in a desert - like terrain that was sparsely populated. There was a shortage of fresh water supplies, and the temperatures were extreme. Due to the lack of water, excessive heat, and the strenuous pedaling, the cyclist could easily have fainted from heatstroke. If the area had been more populated, he would have had more opportunities to replenish his water supply, significantly reducing his risk of heatstroke. There were also snakes, which posed a danger to him. If he had been bitten, he would be at least @NUM1 miles from the nearest help, which could have been fatal. In contrast, if the setting had been a city park or a populated countryside, the challenges and dangers for the cyclist would have been exponentially lower. In conclusion, the specific desert - like setting greatly increased the cyclist's vulnerability and the severity of the potential consequences.
921	6900	3	2	The conditions and features of the setting led the cyclist to become tired and dehydrated, to the point where he believed he would die. For instance, the text states, “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a glorious day in June”. Moreover, when the cyclist says, “I was doing a water - depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life could be so cruel”, it shows his concern about dehydration. In conclusion, the cyclist embarked on this journey without sufficient water, which made him fear death from either heatstroke or dehydration.
922	6901	3	2	The setting impacts the cyclist as he is in a remote area with no water. He had to cycle over @NUM1 miles to reach Yosemite. The quote “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” indicates that he was starting to run out of water. The statement “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” shows that he essentially had nothing to drink. Cycling for over @NUM1 miles in the high deserts of California without water is not a good situation, unless one has a car. In summary, the lack of water in this challenging setting put the cyclist at a great disadvantage.
923	6902	3	2	In the essay, the setting significantly affects the cyclist. He is cycling through the desert with very little water. Pedaling in the dry heat is difficult even when one has water, and there are also hills and deadly snakes. The situation is dangerous enough without these additional hazards. Therefore, I firmly believe one should listen to the cyclist's experience and never heed the advice of old men. In conclusion, the setting's harshness made the cyclist's journey a perilous one.
924	6903	3	2	During the cyclist's ride to Yosemite National Park, he faces numerous hardships due to the setting and the advice from old men. Cycling in the deserts of California in the middle of June, especially when already dehydrated, is extremely challenging. He first encounters “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lament mule”. Based on this description, it seems he might be in a ghost town, which could potentially strand him. He describes the terrain as “short, rolling hills” and “over one long, crippling hill”. These show the obstacles he had to overcome on his bike to reach Yosemite. Once he encountered these terrain features, he realized he was off - track and needed help. After enduring his surroundings for as long as possible, he finally gets help at a real camp. Thus, the settings in the story play a crucial role in the cyclist's difficult experience.
925	6904	3	2	“D o Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is an inspiring and somewhat humorous essay that takes the reader into a cyclist's daily routine. In this story, the author battles dehydration as he tries to reach a national park using shortcut directions from “old timers”. The setting greatly impacts the cyclist and evokes pity from the reader. Half - way through the essay, the biker has already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles, which is astonishing. The fact that he is traveling through the California deserts in June is even more unbelievable. When he first mentions the setting, he says he is in a ghost town, and two sentences later, he notes that the sun was beating down, yet he wasn't overly bothered at that point. Another description of the setting that likely affected his pedaling ability is when he says “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills”. Already dehydrated and having traveled far, the rocky roads probably hindered his journey. The setting is the essence of the story. If he weren't pedaling in the desert, it would have been an ordinary trip. The setting allows the reader to understand what cyclists truly endure. In conclusion, the setting is what makes this story so compelling and gives it real - life significance.
926	6905	3	2	The characteristics of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. This is due to the poor condition of the road and the long - distance travel in bad weather. As a result, the cyclist may become dehydrated. In conclusion, multiple elements of the setting have affected the cyclist.
927	6907	3	2	The features of the setting influence the cyclist. If there were no hills and rough roads, the cyclist could have reached Yosemite Park more quickly and would not have run out of water. In conclusion, the setting's features clearly had a negative impact on the cyclist's journey.
928	6908	3	2	The setting had a major impact on the cyclist. He reported that it was hot and that he was lost. Not knowing where he was going and being exposed to the heat made him extremely stressed. After riding for a long time in the heat, he became thirsty and tried to get water from a water pump. However, the water in it was terrible. He described it as a “substance” with a taste like battery acid. If he were not lost and the outside temperature were cool, he would have had water and would not have been so upset. Clearly, the hot and disorienting setting had a huge impact on the cyclist.
929	6909	3	2	In my view, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in numerous ways. For instance, when he talked about the terrain changing from long, straight roads to sharp, winding ones and the speed - limit alterations, he mentioned that he was in a water - depleting situation, as if he was having a hard time or didn't want to continue. In conclusion, the setting's features are clearly causing difficulties for the cyclist.
930	6910	3	2	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting, which include the hot summer weather, his unfamiliarity with the area, and the California desert. In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist is traveling through the hot desert in June. He realizes he is running out of water, as stated in the text “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie). This situation makes him hot and reduces his water supply. Additionally, the cyclist regrets taking directions from the old men and thinks, “...The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June” (Kurmaskie). This quote shows that the desert heat is taking a toll on him. In conclusion, the setting has had a detrimental effect on the cyclist.
931	6911	3	2	The setting of the story significantly impacts the cyclist. The setting appears to be a dilapidated, outdated town, which offers no assistance when the cyclist gets lost. The town is both out - of - date and sweltering. This heat brings about another issue: the cyclist begins to dehydrate due to a lack of water. As a result, he experiences hallucinations and sees things that aren't real. The intense heat also makes him extremely fatigued. In conclusion, the setting in this short story affects the cyclist in numerous ways.
932	6912	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist, primarily because of the lack of water in his current conditions. Had the cyclist carried more water for his journey, he would have been in a better situation. He ran out of water early in his trip, largely due to the heat of the setting. The cyclist states, “I was hitting my water bottle pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June.” This indicates that the high temperatures force him to drink water regularly to stay hydrated. Moreover, the thin air in the mountains and the heat make the journey more difficult than he anticipated. In essence, the setting's conditions severely hamper the cyclist's progress.
933	6913	3	2	The cyclist faced a challenging trail while biking to @LOCATION1. Biking on flat, smooth terrain is relatively easy, but rolling hills make the task significantly tougher. The biker noted, “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” Along with the difficult terrain, it was also extremely hot. He began to sweat and dehydrate, and even mentioned, “I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst.” With only a limited supply of water, he had eighteen miles to reach the next town. The first deserted town had no drinkable water. Biking in these conditions was arduous, highlighting the importance of being prepared and knowing one's route.
934	6914	3	2	The cyclist had to endure rough terrain, poor road conditions, and a shortage of water, which only exacerbated the problem. There was a high probability that he could suffer from heatstroke. However, his hopes were buoyed by an abandoned Welch's factory. Despite the numerous challenges, the situation presented an uphill battle for the cyclist. In conclusion, the combination of these adverse factors made the cyclist's journey extremely difficult.
935	6915	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1,” the imagery negatively affects the cyclist. The scorching desert and sparse plant life create a sense of isolation and instill fear in him. Being in the desert, the cyclist constantly worries about water and heatstroke, concerns that he wouldn't have in a rainforest. It seems that he allowed his surroundings to get the better of him. If he had visualized an environment filled with water and arctic temperatures, his worries might have been alleviated. An interesting aspect of this story is that mental preparation for the conditions could have spared him from struggling so much at the end. As Kurmaskie writes, “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake - it really did look like a diamondback blocking the majority of the pavement in front of me.” Had the cyclist focused more on the task at hand and less on his surroundings, he could have achieved his goal with less stress.
936	6916	3	2	The characteristics of the setting impact the cyclist, causing him to exhaust his water supply and test his resolve. The statement “Sometimes life can be so cruel” indicates that he was having a difficult time dealing with the environment he was in. He thought to himself that he might die at any moment. In such a challenging situation, the setting's influence on the cyclist was significant, and his perseverance was truly tested.
937	6917	3	2	In the essay “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit,” the author is consistently disheartened by the features of the landscape he traverses. Initially, he passes a ghost town, but since he has an adequate water supply, this sight does not trouble him. However, the subsequent view of a dilapidated old shed and a “rusted water pump” troubles him as he is running out of water. Then, he encounters a huge snake that blocks his path, further dampening his mood. After that, he passes an abandoned Welch’s Grape Juice factory and despairs that he will never find water. The setting and its features serve to disappoint and depress the cyclist in his search for water, highlighting the harshness of his journey.
938	6918	3	2	In the story “Rough Road ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a cyclist faces numerous problems. It is extremely hot outside, resembling a desert, and it is June. The thought of this makes one crave water. The cyclist is running low on water and has not yet reached his destination. The roads are hilly and bumpy, which makes cycling more difficult. These are the challenges the cyclist must overcome, emphasizing the arduous nature of his journey.
939	6919	3	2	At the beginning, the narrator in “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit” was full of energy and enthusiasm about their journey to Yosemite National Park. After receiving some helpful advice about shortcuts, the cyclist embarked on the adventure. The first thing they encountered was a ghost town. The gentleman from whom they took advice had assured them it was a booming and prosperous town, which planted the first seeds of doubt in the cyclist's mind. Then, the problem of water shortage began. They were traveling through the high deserts of California in June and were gradually running out of water. The flat road was soon replaced by short, rolling hills, which only increased the cyclist's deliriousness. After several more disappointments, the cyclist decided there was no hope and that they were going to die. The reader is somewhat drawn in, believing this might be the end for the cyclist. All these disappointments set the stage for a potentially tragic end, making the reader unable to stop reading to find out what happens. If it weren't for the hopelessness of the setting, the reader might not be as engaged.
940	6920	3	2	As the cyclist undertakes his trip, he rides through a desert. Throughout the entire journey, all he sees is a flat road and dirt. He rides on the road, hopelessly hoping to find some form of life. The author describes, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The author tries to stay positive, but it is difficult as the scenery only dampens his hopes. One can imagine how it would feel to be cycling in the middle of a desert without water. If the setting had been a nice, green forest, he wouldn't be as worried as there would be water and shade. In the desert, he has none of these. This entire journey was a mental battle. He constantly kept in mind that everything would be okay, which helped him survive. This is an inspiring story for anyone who needs a boost to stay optimistic, showing the power of a positive mindset in difficult situations.
941	6921	3	2	"In the story, the cyclist set out confident in the directions that promised to ""slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park."" However, as the journey progressed, the heat of the California June day and poor directions took their toll. The intense heat made the cyclist drink water frequently, yet he was traveling through the high deserts of California in June, and soon his water supply dwindled. He was on the verge of heat - stroke, with only a few sips left in his water bottles and struggling to keep his balance in a dehydrated state. Despite these challenges, he persevered, hoping to find a water source. His determination paid off when, as easily as rounding a bend, his troubles, thirst, and fear were left behind. He found a barst shop and obtained water, successfully overcoming the hardships of the journey."
942	6922	3	2	The setting, located in the hot deserts of @LOCATION1, significantly impacts the cyclist. The extreme heat makes the cyclist sweaty and exhausted, and he has nearly depleted his water supply. This lack of water leads the cyclist to become desperate for both food and water. In essence, the characteristics of the setting play a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's reactions to the situation he faces, clearly demonstrating the strong influence of the environment on the cyclist.
943	6923	3	2	The setting's features had multiple effects on the cyclist. The absence of people in the vicinity meant the cyclist was unable to seek help or directions. The poor road conditions, with rocky terrain, made cycling extremely difficult. Coupled with his fatigue and dehydration, the rough roads further drained his energy. Additionally, the presence of poisonous snakes posed a significant threat. If the cyclist disturbed the snakes, they could cause him harm, and a fall from his bike could result in a snakebite, which would likely prevent him from continuing his journey. In conclusion, these aspects of the setting had a substantial impact on the cyclist's experience.
944	6924	3	2	"The setting in the story exerts both physical and mental effects on the cyclist. Physically, the rolling hills and the lack of water take a toll. The cyclist has to laboriously traverse the rolling hills on the rough terrain, which leaves him fatigued and weak. The lack of water exacerbates his situation, as he becomes thirsty from the strenuous effort of climbing the hills. Mentally, as the cyclist progresses, the situation becomes more perilous. With each passing mile, he tries to motivate himself by thinking that he'll be fine if he can just reach his destination. He also blames himself for listening to the old men, which brings doubt. The doubt is so strong that he even doubts his ability to survive, as evidenced by the statement in the story, ""it didn't really matter: I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" Ultimately, the mental strain becomes overwhelming, hindering his ability to persevere."
945	6925	3	2	While riding his bike in the given day - time setting, the rider started to run out of water, and his entire adventure then revolved around finding a water source. Thirst made the journey extremely difficult. He was so tired that he didn't want to continue. However, this challenging situation also instilled more strength and self - confidence in him. He kept pushing forward, using the thirst as motivation to overcome the obstacles and find the much - needed water, ultimately persevering through the tough circumstances of his bike ride.
946	6926	3	2	"Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit"" recounts a tale of learning and perseverance. A cyclist embarks on a journey through the California deserts, facing challenges like snakes and water shortages. The vividly described setting significantly impacts the protagonist during his adventure. The story unfolds in early summer. As the cyclist prepares to end his day, he notices ""the serenity of an early summer evening"" and concludes the day feeling tranquil. The next morning, he is invigorated and eager to resume cycling. As the day progresses, the heat intensifies. By mid - day, the cyclist starts to worry about his water supply. Undaunted, he presses on and reaches new terrain, rolling hills. Here, his hope begins to wane, and he is disheartened when the ""town"" he anticipated turns out to be an abandoned juice factory. Fearing death due to the heat and lack of hydration, he summons his strength to round the final bend and arrives at a bait shop where he can obtain water, finally finding relief. In summary, as the cyclist continues his journey across the California desert, the changes in weather and terrain coincide and influence the cyclist's physical and mental endurance to keep traveling."
947	6927	3	2	"The setting's features have a significant impact on the cyclist. In the story, it is stated, ""I gathered up a few pebbles and stocked them in my mouth."" This quote indicates that the setting was arid and had pebbles. The presence of these pebbles was beneficial to the cyclist as it distracted him from his thirst. Had there been no pebbles, the cyclist might not have survived. In conclusion, in the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist was advantaged by the characteristics of the setting."
948	6928	3	2	The features of the setting have an impact on cyclists. Spending a significant amount of time on a bicycle can lead to back problems for cyclists as they age. When cyclists become older after spending long hours on a bicycle, they may encounter severe issues and may even struggle to walk. In essence, the setting, in terms of the long - term cycling experience, can have a detrimental effect on a cyclist's physical health.
949	6929	3	2	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead; Do not Exceed the speed limit,"" the setting influenced the narrator in multiple ways. Initially, the heat affected his ride. At first, he hardly noticed it, but gradually it started to slow him down. Subsequently, the nature of the roads began to impact his journey. The roads transitioned from flat stretches to short, rolling hills. The combination of the road change and the heat made him exclaim, ""I could drop from heatstroke."" Moreover, the old towns he passed through posed a problem as he was unable to obtain good - quality water. The water pumps were ancient and had been unused for a long time, resulting in water of very poor quality. Overall, the setting presented numerous challenges to the narrator's ride."
950	6930	3	2	"Throughout the story, the intricate features of the setting have a negative influence on the cyclist. As he makes his way towards Yosemite, his journey deteriorates. After getting directions from the ""old codgers,"" the author attempts a shortcut but is disappointed. He reaches the first town, only to find it completely deserted. However, he perseveres, using ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite"" as motivation. He continues pedaling but runs out of water. When he reaches a well, he discovers that the water is unfit to drink and presses on. Matters worsen as the trail becomes rougher and his water supply dwindles. The cyclist becomes dehydrated and starts to lose hope. His pessimism deepens when ""a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement."" He keeps going and excitedly pedals towards a building, only to find it abandoned. He even puts rocks in his mouth to alleviate his dehydration. Finally, when he locates the fish camp, he is relieved. In the end, all the obstacles he overcame were worthwhile."
951	6931	3	2	A solo cyclist's journey is inherently solitary. In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist endured an especially arduous journey, exacerbated by the setting. The primary challenge to his survival was the intense heat. It was a June day in the California deserts, where the sun's rays bore down more severely than in other places at other times. As the terrain became increasingly hilly, his journey grew even more difficult. Cycling on a flat, straight path is relatively easy, but continuously pedaling up steep hills and along winding roads is far from effortless. Just as the buildings around him seemed to deteriorate, so did the cyclist's water supply and his state of mind. His initially joyful trip became increasingly grim. He despaired, thinking, “It didn't really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This cyclist was clearly struggling against the powerful forces of nature.
952	6932	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's short - story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting is of utmost importance. The story unfolds in sunny California, where the cyclist was pedaling at around 12 mph. The heat significantly exacerbated his dehydration. The cyclist despaired, saying, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Despite losing hope, he remained determined to find water. This setting is crucial to the story; if it had taken place at @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION3, the narrative would lack coherence. The setting heightens the intensity of the situation, thus playing a vital role in the story's development.
953	6933	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist as they began to disorient her mentally. She became lost, not knowing where she was. Whether surrounded by nothing or a lot, the feeling of fear is inevitable. In the author's case, while cycling, she was unable to find water. Dehydration is a life - threatening condition, and the overwhelming fear of it was palpable. As she continued cycling, she saw nothing in sight - no buildings, cars, or any structures. The absence of water and people made it seem as if she was doomed to die alone. These settings would affect anyone who encounters them, and they clearly affected the cyclist, who was alone with only a map, her bike, and an empty water bottle.
954	6934	3	2	The features of this story have a significant impact on the cyclist. By taking a shortcut, the cyclist ended up with an even longer journey than before. He found himself in the middle of nowhere, with barely any water left. Moreover, he was exhausted from cycling over the hilly terrain. In the end, the attempt to take a shortcut cost him dearly, highlighting the unforeseen consequences of such a decision.
955	6935	3	2	The features of the setting in the essay affected the cyclist in multiple ways. Firstly, he listened to old folks who hadn't left their front porch in about ten years. Secondly, he failed to seek a second opinion on the route and how to reach his destination. His gravest mistake, however, was not trusting the map he had with him throughout the journey. Had he trusted the map instead of following the advice of the old man, he would not have come so close to dying of heat - stroke.
956	6936	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting has a negative impact on the cyclist. The cyclist is on a bicycle in a hot area with no water. As the quote “I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar - like substance oozed out” shows, the cyclist thought he had found a water pump but ended up with nothing. Additionally, the cyclist initially believed he would never reach his destination. However, in the end, he did arrive and managed to get some water. Overall, the unforgiving setting posed significant challenges to the cyclist but he was ultimately able to overcome them to some extent.
957	6937	3	2	In the story, the heat of the setting has a profound impact on the main character. The main character is biking through a desert in the summer with limited water. The heat creates a serious problem as the main character is at risk of dehydration and heat - stroke. The main character is aware that if he passes out in the barren desert, he will likely die, as evidenced by the statement “The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” The main character is facing a man - versus - nature conflict, and the heat seems to be prevailing. While biking through the desert and desperately trying to reach the next town, the heat and dehydration drain the main character's energy. In conclusion, the heat of the setting is the main character's most significant problem.
958	6938	3	2	The setting around the cyclist had a major impact on him. As Kurmaskie writes, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town’.” The cyclist put “town” in parentheses because it was actually a ghost town, completely abandoned with no one living there. Surrounding the cyclist were deserts and more empty towns. As the cyclist traveled further, it became clear that the advice of some old men was wrong, as he was running low on water and there were no places to stop. Eventually, he found some water and vowed never to follow the directions of old men again. In essence, the desolate setting and bad advice made the cyclist's journey extremely difficult.
959	6939	3	2	All the features of the area have a significant impact on the cyclist. It is a hot June morning, and the cyclist is on his bike, pedaling hard for many miles. He is unable to find any water because all the towns along the road are deserted. As a result, he is becoming dehydrated and losing strength. It seems that he would have collapsed if he hadn't thought he was going to reach a certain place (@CAPS1) and if he hadn't obtained some water at a store. In conclusion, the setting appears to be working against the cyclist, almost as if it intends to defeat him.
960	6940	3	2	In “Rough Road: Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting have a highly negative impact on the cyclist. It starts subtly with the “ghost town.” The narrator “chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on,” showing that he wasn't overly worried at first, but the act of checking his water implies that he would need to ration it. The situation worsens when he reaches the rock and the “ramshackle shed.” The description of the place indicates his dislike, which he confirms by saying “this sight was troubling.” He won't be able to replenish his water there. If this continues, he'll die, either from dehydration or pessimism. Eventually, he comes across a road sign stating that going over 55 mph is a bad idea. This is ironic since he's only going 12 mph, and as he puts it, “sometimes life can be so cruel.” Clearly, the cyclist hates the setting, and it is entirely due to the nature of the setting.
961	6941	3	2	The setting's features had a significant impact on the cyclist. With limited water, he faced the challenge of pedaling harder to climb the hills and endured dehydration due to the heat. For instance, he had limited water because he followed the directions of the old men and likely didn't bring as much as he would have on a longer route. Moreover, to ascend the rolling hills, he had to pedal faster and with greater force, which left him more exhausted. Additionally, it was a June day, and the heat, combined with a lack of sufficient water, led to his dehydration. In conclusion, these aspects of the setting clearly affected the cyclist.
962	6942	3	2	"The features of the setting have a notable influence on the cyclist. Although not explicitly stated, the mention of ""The sun was beginning to beat down"" implies that the cyclist's body heat increased significantly. It is well - known that being outdoors in hot conditions causes one to get hot, and this likely contributed to the cyclist's dehydration. As someone with experience in long - distance running, I understand the impact the sun can have on a person during a hot day. In conclusion, the setting indeed affects the cyclist in these ways."
963	6943	3	2	The features of the setting have a major impact on the cyclist. If the desert were not a deserted, mountainous area in California, the cyclist would not encounter the same problems. Altering any feature of the setting would change the cyclist's behavior within it, thereby altering the entire plot of the story. For example, if the cyclist were in a more developed area rather than a mountainous region, he would not face the same dangers. In conclusion, the features of the setting have a substantial influence on the cyclist.
964	6944	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's story ""Rough Road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit"", the features of the setting seem to have a negative impact on the cyclist. Two miles after the cyclist claimed he could easily cover the next @NUM1 miles, the setting began to worry him. He noticed the terrain changing from flat roads to short rolling hills, and at that point, it became evident that things would not be as easy as he initially thought. As the journey continued, the setting worsened for the cyclist. He even expressed thoughts of dying and being picked clean by birds, which indicated his fear of dehydration. Eventually, the cyclist made it through and realized the significant effect nature can have on a person. In conclusion, the setting in this story clearly influenced the cyclist's experience."
965	6945	3	2	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist through a series of unexpected events. His water supply was depleted quickly, and he struggled to find a nearby town. He was in a desert - like area of California, with the sun beating down on him. When he did reach a town, it was a ""ghost town"" with rusted pumps that dispensed a liquid that tasted like battery - oil. Everyone he asked said water was near, but his dehydration made it take longer to get there. The roads became windy, and small hills appeared. There was also a large snack in the middle of the road as tumbleweeds blew by. Finally, he saw a town with a bait shop where he could get water and cool down. In conclusion, the setting presented numerous challenges to the cyclist but he was able to overcome them."
966	6946	3	2	"The setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit"" significantly influenced the author. As the cyclist noted, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Navigating through these ""hills"" was likely more challenging than on ""Flat roads,"" causing the cyclist to tire more rapidly. The cyclist also stated, ""I could drop from heatstroke"" (Kurmaskie @NUM2), indicating that the extreme heat outside could lead to fainting and slow him down. Additionally, the author mentioned that the water felt ""somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees"" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). Due to the high temperature outside, the cyclist had no access to good - quality water, resulting in dehydration. Clearly, multiple aspects of the setting had a notable impact on the cyclist."
967	6947	3	2	The features of the setting had an impact on the cyclist. Had the old men not given the boy advice, he might not have encountered all the trouble he did. Meanwhile, the boy continued on his way towards his destination. However, in the future, he intends to rely on his map to avoid experiencing such a terrifying situation again. In conclusion, the setting and the advice received affected the boy's journey, and he has learned from this experience.
968	6948	3	2	The features of the setting impact the cyclist as the road condition becomes increasingly rough as the cyclist progresses along the road. The rough road presents challenges to the cyclist's movement, potentially affecting their speed and comfort. In conclusion, the rough road condition, a key feature of the setting, has a clear impact on the cyclist's ride.
969	6949	3	2	"The setting of this short - story exerts a substantial influence on the cyclist. Given that the story unfolds in the desert, the temperature is extremely high. The cyclist only packed an adequate amount of water for the planned trip. However, due to a few wrong turns, more water was required. With no signs of civilization, there were no places to stop and purchase water. When the cyclist came across a ""run - down"" rusty fauret and attempted to drink from it, the water was hot and tasted like battery acid. If the story were set elsewhere, such as @LOCATION1, the cyclist could have easily stopped to buy water, and the story would lose its current sense of urgency. Evidently, the setting is one of the most crucial elements in this story."
970	6950	3	2	The features of the environment affect the cyclist in numerous ways. Elements like the road and the surrounding rocks can pose challenges. A cyclist must be well - informed about the route ahead because failing to do so can lead to problems. For instance, there could be snakes, rough terrain, or rocks in the way. This is why it is important for a cyclist to trust their own judgment. That's also why cyclists are often seen on roads with cars nearby, as a safety measure in case they run into trouble. In conclusion, being aware of the features of the setting and relying on self - judgment are essential for cyclists.
971	6951	3	2	The features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist as they add more life and meaning to the description, making it enjoyable to read.
972	6952	3	2	At times, poor features of the setting can significantly impact a cyclist. For instance, if it is too hot, the cyclist must have an ample supply of water to avoid dehydration. There are also risks such as heat - strokes and the presence of deadly snakes, which cyclists should steer clear of. Being a cyclist can be tough, so one must be prepared for the long journey.
973	6953	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting poses challenges to the cyclist and his journey. In the areas he traverses, there is either a lack of water or the available water is extremely hot or of poor quality. As stated on page @NUM1, “a tarlike substance oozed out, but the water wouldn’t cool down,” which clearly shows the poor condition of the water during the cyclist's travels.
974	6954	3	2	In this essay, the author shares his journey. This sharing of personal experiences gives readers an insight into the author's adventures and the events that took place during that journey.
975	6955	3	2	The setting features started with nice, cool pine trees, followed by a ghost town. The weather was hot, and there were dangers of @CAPS1, poisonous snacks, and increasingly difficult hills. At the start, the pines provided a pleasant and cool environment. However, when the cyclist reached the ghost town, he became discouraged. Then the heat set in, and when he saw the snack, he thought it was a deformed baby, which made him nervous. He also started to worry about dehydration. As he continued, the hills became steeper and more challenging, which summed up his experience.
976	6956	3	2	The characteristics of the setting had an impact on the cyclist. He needed to exert more energy to pedal uphill and across rocky ground, which led to him consuming more water. When he couldn't... (The original text seems incomplete here, so this rewrite maintains the incompleteness in line with the source.)
977	6957	3	2	In the story, a cyclist was significantly influenced by the features of the setting. The journey began on a flat road, which later transitioned into short, rolling hills. In June, while traveling through the high deserts of California, the cyclist grew tired from constant pedaling, as going uphill requires more effort than riding on flat terrain. The intense heat made the cyclist extremely thirsty. The arid, desert - like environment, with miles of nothing but ghost towns, made it impossible to find water. Moreover, a sandblasted picture of a boy pouring juice reminded the body of its thirst. The cyclist had not conserved water properly, exacerbating the situation. Clearly, the setting had a profound effect on the cyclist's experience.
978	6958	3	2	In the story, the cyclist is severely affected by the setting's features. The vast expanse with nothing but ghost towns for miles makes it impossible to find water. The desert - like environment intensifies the cyclist's thirst. In June in California, it is extremely hot. The presence of hills further increases the cyclist's thirst as climbing them demands more energy. The town the cyclist was headed to seemed deserted and had no water. However, the cyclist used a trick of putting something under the tongue to survive more effectively. Overall, the setting had a major impact on the cyclist's journey, making him regret following the old man's advice.
979	6959	3	2	The setting's features had multiple effects on the cyclist. Three prominent features were the water shortage, the heat, and the road's conditions and limitations. The lack of water was a significant issue. When the cyclist was extremely tired, there was nothing to drink. The cyclist had planned to save water until the end, but the exhaustion made the water shortage more difficult to bear. The cyclist was also affected by the conditions they were in. From the start, they were given wrong directions, causing them to be lost throughout the journey. Additionally, the road's limitations, such as hills and different ground surfaces, did not assist the cyclist. In conclusion, factors like the water shortage, road limitations, and the cyclist's conditions all influenced the cyclist's experience.
980	6960	3	2	I firmly believe that the features of the setting have a huge impact on the cyclist. Firstly, the weather conditions are a major factor. In the passage, it states, “I could drop from heatstroke,” indicating that it is extremely hot. This high - temperature environment surely affects the cyclist's well - being. Secondly, the cyclist's lack of water is a critical issue. The text mentions, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,” which shows that the cyclist is very thirsty, and this has a significant impact on their ability to cycle. Finally, the desolate surroundings also affect the cyclist. The passage notes the absence of cars, which can make the cyclist feel isolated and perhaps more fatigued. All these aspects combined have a substantial effect on the cyclist.
981	6961	3	2	"In ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting significantly impacts the cyclist. The cyclist follows the advice of some old men and later regrets his decision. He finds himself on an empty, flat, and dry road. As he travels, he consumes all his water and is compelled to stop for more. He mentions, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" When he stops to refill, the water from the pump is tar - like, and he struggles to find another water source for a long time. The flat road gives way to short, rolling hills, and he encounters a sign warning of a rough road and a speed limit. He also passes tumbleweeds and a large snake, all of which instill fear and caution during his journey. Finally, when he reaches a place to drink, he is relieved. The hot and empty setting exacerbates his thirst, clearly demonstrating how the setting affects the cyclist."
982	6962	3	2	He experiences a sense of isolation as there is no one around to encourage him. Despite this, he perseveres, pushing himself towards the finish line with the goal of winning. The roads are fast but rough, and the hills are tall. However, his determination remains unwavering, and he is resolute in finishing the race. His self - drive in the face of these challenges showcases his strong will and commitment to achieving his objective.
983	6963	3	2	Heat, abandoned roads, and snakes all have a significant impact on the cyclist. The heat causes him to dehydrate rapidly while expending energy. The long, abandoned roads make him doubt his ability to complete the bike ride. He exhausts all his water supply, and when he reaches an old pump, only hot, dirty water comes out. The snake in the story makes his journey perilous. All these difficulties stem from his decision to listen to the old guys. When another old man offers to guide him, he refuses. In conclusion, his choices and the challenging elements of the environment combine to create a difficult and dangerous cycling experience.
984	6964	3	2	"The features and setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. The cyclist is in the desert, as indicated by the quote ""through high deserts of California."" This implies high temperatures, increasing the risk of heatstroke and fainting. Moreover, obtaining water becomes a major problem. The description of ""the rusted water pump"" shows its poor condition. When the cyclist gets water from it, it tastes like old battery acid. In summary, the harsh desert environment and dilapidated water sources clearly demonstrate how the features and setting affect the cyclist."
985	6965	3	2	"The characteristics of the setting have a substantial and cumulative effect on the cyclist. A determined cyclist sets out from Lodi, California, with the goal of reaching Yosemite National Park. He pedals vigorously through the gentle evening. As the setting changes, so does its impact on him. When he reaches the first deserted town, the rising sun causes his energy to wane. Later, in a desperate search for water at a shed, he finds only rusty pumps with contaminated, unsafe water. When the flat terrain turns into rolling hills, he becomes completely exhausted, as described by the quote ""With what I believed to be my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill."" However, when he stumbles upon a fish camp with water, he regains his energy and confidence, just like when he ""rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile."" In conclusion, the ever - changing setting continuously influences the cyclist's physical and mental state throughout his journey."
986	6966	3	2	The setting had a profound impact on the cyclist. He was cycling in the desert, where all the towns he passed through were abandoned. It was June, a hot month, and the sun was relentlessly beating down on him. Moreover, he was cycling with very little water. These conditions made his journey extremely challenging.
987	6967	3	2	In the essay “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit,” the setting influenced the cyclist in multiple ways. When the cyclist reached the first town, he described it as a ghost - town. This made him start to doubt the directions he had received. However, his anticipation of the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite spurred him on. The next landmark had a similar setting with a shed, a few rusty pipes, and a corral that was in such a poor state that it “Couldn't hold in the lamest mule.” As he was running out of water, this made him more wary of the path ahead. The subsequent place was also deserted, with an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. Running out of water, the cyclist began to think he was going to die. Finally, the setting changed; he found an open store. This filled him with happiness and relief. In conclusion, the varying settings had a significant impact on the cyclist's mental state and journey.
988	6968	3	2	The author's description of the setting presented a difficult terrain and harsh weather for the cyclist. The early - summer setting implied hot and uncomfortable conditions. When the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to intensify, indicating a rise in temperature. Cycling in hot weather is strenuous as it requires a great deal of effort and causes the body to dehydrate faster due to sweating. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California, which exacerbated the heat, especially during early summer with the sun high in the sky. After the first few towns, he started riding on short, rolling hills. Hills demand more physical exertion as it takes more effort to pedal uphill. Overall, the setting made the cyclist's journey extremely difficult.
989	6969	3	2	The features of the setting presented a significant challenge to the cyclist. From the ghost town to the bait shop, every location was a hurdle, though sometimes a misleading one. In the desert, water became scarce, and the cyclist employed various strategies to keep going. He stared at the horizon to shift his focus and sucked on pebble stones to avoid thinking about water. When he reached the bait shop, a wave of relief washed over him; it felt like a safe haven. He decided that he would never take directions from an old - timer again. In this story, luck was not a determining factor. Instead, it was the cyclist's drive and the overall climate of the setting that shaped his journey. Even when there were only two - hundred degrees left and no water, he pushed himself towards the light. When he saw a building, his determination to reach it was unwavering. In conclusion, the setting had a profound and lasting impact on the cyclist's experience.
990	6970	3	2	The cyclist aimed to reach Yosemite National Park. He was in Lodi, California when he asked old codgers for directions in hopes of taking a shortcut. Unknowingly, he should have stuck to his original directions. In June, he was traveling through the high deserts of California. The desert heat made him extremely hot and thirsty. The text states “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid,” indicating that he had no potable water and was dehydrated during his journey. Also, “with what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill” shows that he was running out of energy. In conclusion, the combination of following misleading directions and the harsh desert setting made his journey to Yosemite a struggle.
991	6971	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's essay ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" he presents various settings that can either improve or worsen the situation. Kurmaskie notes, ""I noticed the terrain changing; flat roads were replaced with short rolling [*terrain description*]."" This indicates that the journey is becoming more challenging as he has to cycle uphill and is nearly out of water. He also states, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" This shows that the cyclist cannot obtain water or a ride from the surroundings as there is nothing available. These are the ways in which the setting features impact the cyclist."
992	6972	3	2	"Nearly all aspects of the setting have an impact on the cyclist. For example, the hot weather makes him drink a large amount of water and be in constant need of it. The story details how thirsty and sweaty he is. The description ""The water bottles contain only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of sweat circled my shirt"" suggests that he is extremely hot, as he is sweating profusely and has been consuming a lot of water. Another feature of the setting is the rolling hills, which make him feel as if he will never reach the next town. He says, ""I began breaking the ride down into distances I could make it test for."" By doing this, he is making the long ride seem like a series of short rides to help him persevere. In conclusion, the setting features significantly affect the cyclist's experience."
993	6973	3	2	The author describes the setting as highly challenging for three main reasons: distance, water availability, and heat. These factors interact and multiply each other's effects. As time passes, the cyclist becomes fatigued due to the heat. In one instance, the cyclist clearly describes the impact of the heat. Overall, the combination of these setting - related challenges makes the cyclist's journey arduous.
994	6974	3	2	"The features of the setting influence the cyclist in multiple ways. The scenery first makes the cyclist worried, then unconfident, and finally, ironically, hopeful. When the cyclist reaches the first so - called ""town,"" he describes it as having ""one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral."" This is when the cyclist realizes something is amiss and starts to worry. Moreover, he cannot refill his water supply, so the fear of dehydration sets in. Already tired, the cyclist becomes unconfident upon seeing the sign ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" Knowing that the journey will be long and slow, he doubts his ability to complete it. Finally, when he passes the sign ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp – If you want bait for the big ones, we've your best bet,"" he becomes hopeful as he knows he has found civilization again. It is evident that one's atmosphere and surroundings can greatly affect their general mood, as is clearly demonstrated by the cyclist's experience."
995	6975	3	2	"The features of the setting can either make the cyclist's ride easy or difficult. In the essay, it mentions ""No Town."" Without a town, there is no water, and a lack of water can lead to dehydration. It also states that flat roads turn into ""short, rolling hills."" This means that the path becomes tough, making it hard for the cyclist to stay focused. These examples clearly illustrate how the setting impacts the cyclist's journey. In conclusion, the setting plays a crucial role in determining the ease or difficulty of the cyclist's ride."
996	6976	3	2	The setting has an impact on the cyclist. If the path is on a road with numerous hills, it will make the cyclist tired. Additionally, if the cyclist is in a place with extreme cold or heat, it will affect their body temperature and attitude. In conclusion, the setting can significantly influence a cyclist's physical state and mental outlook.
997	6977	3	2	The settings described in the article impact the cyclist as they are required to bike many miles to reach the next town. The cyclist has a limited supply of water, and the outside temperature is very hot. Moreover, there is nothing in sight for miles around. In summary, these challenging settings pose difficulties for the cyclist during their journey.
998	6978	3	2	The aspects of the setting that affect the cyclist are that he showed his anger to other people, which he shouldn't have done, and he should not have disclosed to others where he had to go. In conclusion, the setting influenced the cyclist's behavior and decision - making regarding information sharing.
999	6979	3	2	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” multiple features of the setting affected the cyclist. These settings, which were clearly presented in the middle part of the essay, led to the cyclist becoming exhausted on his journey. Firstly, the road changed from flat to having short, rolling hills. The cyclist had to expend more energy to ascend the hills, resulting in a loss of a certain amount of energy. Secondly, his lack of water led to a state of dehydration, causing him to lose another large amount of energy. Furthermore, since he was riding alone with no one in sight, no buildings, cars, or any structures around, it might have caused an emotional breakdown, further depleting his energy. Overall, the cyclist suffered energy loss during his journey and had no one to support him.
1000	6980	3	2	The setting affects the cyclist as it can offer landmarks and directions. As an illustration, the narrator states, “They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This indicates that landmarks can serve as guides during a journey. In conclusion, the setting's landmarks and directions play a crucial role in assisting the cyclist on their way.
1001	6981	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed posted speed limit”, a cyclist faces numerous rough obstacles on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Suffering from a lack of water and exhaustion, he encounters a large snake, which he believes to be a diamond black snake. He manages to pass the snake easily and continues his journey. Despite the intense heat and lack of water, he never gives up and remains confident that he can reach the park safely. The reason he takes this difficult route is that he follows the directions of “old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in the office”. These individuals provided him with incorrect directions. If he had paid more attention to his surroundings and the people around him, many of the difficulties he faced would have been avoided. In conclusion, the cyclist's journey was made much more arduous due to the wrong directions and his own inattentiveness.
1002	6982	3	2	The setting's features impact the cyclist in various ways at different times. When the cyclist arrives at the first town, the author describes it as an average ghost town, yet the cyclist continues with confidence. The next building he spots is an abandoned Welch’s Juice bottle factory. On the building, there is a sign depicting a boy drinking a cold glass of juice. This sight makes the cyclist start to question the advice of the old men. As he keeps going, he reaches another building. To his relief, it is a bolt shop that is still operational. He immediately heads to the sink to drink water. At this point, he is relieved to have access to water and to be near civilization rather than being in the desert with no sign of life or buildings. In summary, the cyclist's surroundings throughout the story evoke feelings of indifference, confidence, and relief.
1003	6983	3	2	The features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist. The roads are rough and uneven, which requires the cyclist to exert more energy to pedal his bike compared to riding on nice, paved, and even roads. Additionally, the cyclist is out of water, so he is expending all his energy without any means of replenishment. In conclusion, the rough roads and lack of water in the setting place a significant physical burden on the cyclist.
1004	6984	3	2	The impact of the setting on a cyclist can be quite complex. To be a successful cyclist, one must prepare for many factors. Firstly, cyclists need to be prepared for the weather. In severe weather conditions such as rain or snow, they must be cautious of slippery roads. Secondly, they have to be ready for long rides. Some rides might be up to @NUM1 miles, so they need to bring an ample supply of food and water. Another factor is the condition of the bike. Cyclists must ensure that their bikes are in good condition and functioning properly. If any work is needed on the bike, it should be done. The physical shape of the cyclist is also important. A cyclist in good shape can ride for a longer period. Finally, cyclists need to know their destination. As seen in the story, the man who didn't know where to go faced difficulties. In conclusion, all these aspects related to the setting and the cyclist himself are crucial for a successful cycling journey.
1005	6985	3	2	The setting of a cyclist's journey has an impact on the cyclist. In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the cyclist encountered a conflict with the setting. The weather was extremely hot, and he failed to utilize small resources to survive. This clearly shows that the setting of where a cyclist takes their journey is significant. In conclusion, the setting can pose challenges to a cyclist, and being aware of and adapting to it is essential for a successful journey.
1006	6986	3	2	In the short story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” the setting significantly impacts the cyclist. The rough terrain and scorching sun present arduous challenges, causing the cyclist to endure hardships beyond imagination. After cycling for hours, the cyclist remarks, “Over on long crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage…” The harsh setting has led to severe dehydration, impairing the cyclist's ability to think clearly. The cyclist is well - aware of the perils of the surrounding setting. Evidently, the setting exerts a powerful influence on the cyclist.
1007	6987	3	2	The cyclist's long - hours of bike riding in unfamiliar areas had an impact on him. As he pedaled through these uncharted regions, the unfamiliarity and the physical exertion took their toll. This long - distance journey into unknown territory affected his physical stamina and mental state. In conclusion, his venture into areas he had never visited before through hours of cycling left a distinct mark on him.
1008	6988	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist experiences both mental and physical effects due to the setting. Mentally, the desolate environment of desert and sand with a lack of water takes a toll on him. He expresses the thought of death, stating, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Had he access to water, such despairing thoughts would likely not have arisen. Physically, the rough, seemingly endless road drains his energy. Riding up hills with little water in his system makes him tired. The heat and the sense of hopelessness are palpable. If the cyclist were riding through an evergreen forest instead, his experience would have been different. In conclusion, the setting's physical and mental impact on the cyclist is evident, and a different setting would have spared him from such distress.
1009	6989	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead,” the cyclist encounters various settings during his ride, each influencing his mood and physical state. When the author describes a place as “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mute greeted me. This sight was troubling,” it marks a turning point where worry sets in. The cyclist is running out of water, the sun is beating down, and fatigue from pedaling is likely setting in. To make matters worse, he then faces rolling hills, which require more effort and deplete his limited water supply. However, when he reaches a “modernized” town, his spirits are lifted. He can obtain water to cool down, which gives him the strength and will - power to continue his journey to Yosemite Park. In conclusion, the different settings he encounters play a crucial role in shaping his experience and ability to continue his trip.
1010	6990	3	2	The setting of the story has a substantial impact as the empty terrain forces the cyclist to rely solely on himself due to the absence of others to assist. For instance, if he were cycling through a city for hours, he could easily stop at a store to take a break or obtain water from numerous sources. In contrast, the desert setting truly tests his inner strength. It challenges him to persevere and reach safety. In conclusion, the desolate setting of the story is a significant factor in pushing the cyclist to rely on his own resources and inner fortitude.
1011	6991	3	2	In the essay, it is evident that numerous land - related features influenced the cyclist. For instance, the text mentions “ridiculously large snake…blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” For those with a severe fear of snakes, this could completely spoil the entire trip. Although the cyclist was initially scared, they overcame the fear and continued. Another significant factor was the lack of water. As stated, “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…” The scarcity of water could have dire consequences. In conclusion, these various features had a substantial impact on the cyclist and their journey.
1012	6992	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's “Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” multiple features affected the cyclist. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June, as Kurmaskie notes, “...and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” June deserts are extremely hot and dry, causing the cyclist to quickly become dehydrated. Additionally, the change from flat roads to “short, rolling hills” made the ride more strenuous. These conditions directly influenced the cyclist's experience. In conclusion, the environmental and terrain features had a notable impact on the cyclist's journey.
1013	6993	3	2	A cyclist was on a journey to Yosemite National Park. In June, the cyclist was riding through the deserts. By the end of the stony stretch, the cyclist had barely any water left. Just when water was most needed, many of the buildings along the way were abandoned. The hot, dry desert environment and the lack of available water sources in the abandoned areas clearly affected the cyclist. In conclusion, the setting of the desert in June and the abandoned buildings had a significant impact on the cyclist's journey.
1014	6994	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist has been pedaling for a long time and is becoming dehydrated, as shown by the statement “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly. I was in the @LOCATION1.” Another way the setting impacts the cyclist is that they are starting to see mirages. For example, “A sand - blasted picture of a boy pouring a refreshing glass of grape juice into his mouth could still be seen.” In conclusion, the long - distance pedaling and the hot, arid setting lead to dehydration and the appearance of mirages, which clearly affect the cyclist.
1015	6995	3	2	Features such as insufficient water and a lack of a sense of direction impact the cyclist. The cyclist requires water to continue pedaling and maps to know their direction and destination. Due to the lack of water, the cyclist said, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a lost entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and their sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph.” This statement implies that the old men's sense of direction was outdated, and they were essentially lost. In conclusion, the lack of water and a proper sense of direction significantly hampered the cyclist's journey.
1016	6996	3	2	The setting is characterized by its hot and dry conditions. These conditions affect the cyclist significantly. He becomes extremely hot and consumes almost all his water, having only about @NUM1 sips remaining upon reaching the other town. However, he did have an advantage as he set off before sunrise, which allowed him to experience cooler temperatures. Additionally, when he encounters some hills, he gets a bit of wind. Moreover, when the cyclist feels thirsty, he puts pebbles in his mouth.
1017	6997	3	2	Setting has a significant impact on a cyclist's mood and energy. For instance, on a cool @DATE1 day while riding gently downhill, the cyclist is likely to be happy and full of energy. Conversely, traveling through the high deserts of California in June is far from an ideal environment for a relaxed and enjoyable ride. The cyclist in the story was hot, exhausted, and struggling to stay hydrated. He even thought, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Evidently, the location where a cyclist rides can greatly influence the cyclist themselves.
1018	6998	3	2	A cyclist was on a bike journey, aiming to reach Yosemite. Despite having a shortage of water, he decided to continue. Along the way, he had to pass by a snake, which frightened him. In the end, despite the challenges of lack of water and the scare from the snake, his determination to reach Yosemite kept him going.
1019	6999	3	2	In my opinion, all the features of the settings have an impact on the cyclist's rhythm, determination, and will to win. These settings can slightly divert him from his goal. Instead of getting distracted by the settings, he should try his best to ignore them. If I were in his position, I would focus on riding my bike and keep the thought of winning in mind. By doing so, he can better overcome the negative influence of the settings and strive towards victory.
1020	7000	3	2	For a cyclist, the surrounding setting can lead to either success or failure. The cyclist was provided with very old directions, which directed him to back - roads that are now abandoned. Usually, the fact that these towns are unpopulated might not be a problem, but he was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. If there were shade, a breeze, and @NUM2 weather, he would be fine. However, he is pedaling a bike in a desert during the summer. A “ghost town” with no access to good water could have been fatal to him. Therefore, it is crucial for cyclists to be aware of their surroundings and be prepared for whatever nature presents.
1021	7001	3	2	"The setting's features have a profound impact on the cyclist. When encountering the ""ghost town,"" the cyclist likely felt a sense of isolation and discouragement, believing he might never find his way and that no one was available to assist him. The long, hilly highway flanked by desert on both sides gave the impression that the road would never end and that he was trapped in the situation he had embarked upon. Moreover, the arid conditions, with no water in sight, exacerbated his thirst. Overall, the setting had both physical and psychological effects on the cyclist."
1022	7002	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's story ""Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the cyclist faces several obstacles during his long - distance bike ride. As described in the story, the cyclist encounters tumbleweeds crossing his path and a large snake blocking most of the pavement, all while in a dehydrated state. These are just a few of the problems he faced. To combat dehydration, he resorted to putting pebbles in his mouth as he had heard it could help. Throughout the story, the cyclist overcame numerous difficulties, demonstrating his resilience."
1023	7003	3	2	"The setting features significantly impact the cyclist. These features include heat, dangerous animals, sparse civilization, and challenging terrain. In the essay, each of these elements affected the cyclist negatively. For example, due to the intense heat, the cyclist needed to find a town. The first ""town"" he found was a ""ghost town."" As he traveled through the high deserts of California in June, regularly consuming water from his bottles, he became severely dehydrated and on the verge of collapse. The change from a flat road to short, rolling hills further exhausted him as it increased the effort required to continue. Additionally, he had to deal with dangerous animals; a large snake blocked most of the path, posing a potential threat. In conclusion, the setting features had a multitude of negative impacts on the cyclist."
1024	7004	3	2	The setting's features have a detrimental effect on the cyclist. The heat, especially during the sunny days of June, causes the cyclist to overheat. The hills in the terrain make the cyclist extremely tired, as he loses energy and has to constantly push himself forward. Moreover, the lack of helpful places in the setting is a major issue. The cyclist struggles to find a place with water to drink. All in all, the setting has a very negative impact on the biker, hindering his journey.
1025	7005	3	2	The features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist. The extreme heat causes the cyclist to rapidly become dehydrated. Additionally, the buildings in the area appear to be either abandoned or in a state of disrepair. These aspects of the setting create a challenging environment for the cyclist, making his journey more difficult and uncomfortable.
1026	7006	3	2	The characteristics of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. Currently, the cyclist is in the California desert on a sweltering day. The intense heat causes the cyclist to consume all of their water, eventually leading to dehydration. Moreover, the desolate desert, lacking any landmarks, causes the cyclist to lose their way, which is the primary issue the cyclist faces.
1027	7007	3	2	The setting of the story is a crucial factor in determining the final outcome. The author mentions traveling through the high deserts of California in June. This simple statement indicates that it is extremely hot. It is not the kind of hot experienced in @LOCATION2, where the temperature might reach @NUM1 degrees by noon. In this desert, the day starts at @NUM2 and exceeds @NUM3 by noon. Additionally, the author comes across a sign warning of a rough road ahead and advising not to exceed the posted speed limit, yet they note that they are only traveling at 12 mph. Before reaching any civilization, the author has already drunk most of their water, taking the last “tantalizing sips.” The main problem is the lack of water. The author drank most of it at the start of the ride, thinking they would be fine, but later regretted this decision. In conclusion, the harsh setting and the author's miscalculation regarding water consumption led to this challenging situation.
1028	7008	3	2	The features of the setting have multiple effects on the cyclist. The cyclist found themselves in a desolate area, on the verge of dehydration. There were no signs indicating resting areas with water fountains nearby. To combat the thirst, the cyclist put pebbles in their mouth. However, due to the bumpy surroundings, they accidentally swallowed one. The cyclist continued their journey, uttering the words “I was going to die.” Initially, the cyclist was at risk of dehydration, which could have ended their journey. Fortunately, the cyclist spotted Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp and survived. Until then, the difficult setting was a constant challenge. In the end, the cyclist's perseverance paid off as they made it to safety.
1029	7009	3	2	Dehydration already plagues the cyclist, and the setting exacerbates the situation. The cyclist is biking in California, specifically in @LOCATION2. The area is likely sun - scorched and hot. The combination of the intense heat and the physical exertion of biking makes the cyclist even thirstier and more fatigued. In conclusion, the unfavorable setting further deteriorates the cyclist's condition.
1030	7010	3	2	The features of the setting have various effects on the cyclist. The cyclist was riding in the “high deserts of California in June.” Along the way, the cyclist encountered a “ridiculously large snake.” For miles, there were no signs of civilization. There was nothing in sight, no buildings, cars, or any structures. The cyclist faced numerous obstacles while traveling to Yosemite. It is evident that the settings had a substantial impact on the cyclist's journey. In conclusion, the harsh and desolate setting presented multiple challenges for the cyclist on their way to Yosemite.
1031	7011	3	2	The setting's features have a significant impact on cyclists. Elements such as weather, terrain, temperature, and altitude can either facilitate a cyclist's journey or pose insurmountable obstacles. In this account, the heat and hilly roads present challenges to the cyclist. Despite these difficulties, the cyclist perseveres and ultimately reaches a civilized area. This demonstrates that one should not let nature control them; instead, they can overcome nature's challenges through determination.
1032	7012	3	2	The setting's features have a profound effect on the cyclist. The cyclist, who was traveling through the high deserts of California in June, is becoming increasingly fatigued and running out of water rapidly. This clearly shows that the harsh setting is causing the cyclist to become extremely exhausted, highlighting the significant influence of the environment on the cyclist's physical state.
1033	7013	3	2	The setting's features had a tremendous impact on the cyclist. Initially, the cyclist was confident about covering the eighteen - mile distance. However, after passing through the flat ground, which was replaced by short rolling hills, his confidence wavered. He stated, “I toiled on,” and his words convey a sense of hopelessness, as if he doubted he could make it. Evidently, the change in the setting significantly affected the cyclist's mental and physical state.
1034	7014	3	2	The setting of “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was a sweltering desert. During a bike ride in such an environment, there are few places to stop for food or water. Moreover, cyclists can only carry limited luggage, mainly essential materials and a large enough jug of water. An instance from the text illustrates the harsh conditions: “I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted pump with all my strength.” This shows that the cyclist was so thirsty and exhausted that he had to resort to extreme measures to obtain water, emphasizing the challenges posed by the desert setting.
1035	7015	3	2	In the given setting, the young man encounters several challenges that contribute to his personal growth, making him a stronger individual. For example, at the end, he expressed pride in himself by saying, “yes sir! I own a very good map.” He managed to overcome the heat, dry air, snakes, and a low water supply to reach his determined destination, Yosemite. These challenges not only tested his physical endurance but also his mental strength, proving that he could emerge victorious and gain self - confidence through adversity.
1036	7016	3	2	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the setting significantly impacts the cyclist. It is a dry area in California during June. The cyclist desperately needs water, and being lost in a ghost - town compounds his situation. Thus, the lack of water and misleading directions are the primary factors affecting the cyclist.
1037	7017	3	2	In the story, the description of the cyclist is quite appealing. I'd describe it as a fun portrayal, and it seems this was one of his best times. For instance, he appears happy as he mentions starting the morning with strong legs and a smile on his face, which clearly shows his positive mood. He also seems competitive, likely due to his good health and his inclination to go for a bike ride. Moreover, when he says “As easily as sounding a bond, my trouble, thirst and fears were all behind me,” it gives a sense of his care - free state. Overall, these aspects combine to create an engaging picture of the cyclist.
1038	7018	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's “Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit,” the features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist. The author writes “that road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” indicating that it is difficult for the cyclist to ride on this road. The speed limit also affects the cyclist; when the speed - limit sign appears, the character feels “life can feel so cruel,” suggesting that the character is restricted from doing what he intends. In conclusion, the poor road conditions and the speed - limit signs both have a negative effect on the cyclist.
1039	7019	3	2	In the essay, the setting features had a clear impact on the cyclist. At the start, when the setting was at the old man's place, the cyclist was happy and confident. However, upon reaching the ghost town and running out of water, he became upset and frustrated. Seeing a building initially brought relief, but the discovery that it was abandoned left him sad. Finally, when he reached the store, he was excited and relieved. In summary, the changing setting throughout the cyclist's trip had a series of emotional impacts on him.
1040	7020	3	2	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” multiple setting features affect the cyclist. At the story's start, it's mentioned that “The sun was beginning to beat down,” and though the temperature was rising, it didn't much affect the cyclist as he had enough water. Later, the story reveals that the cyclist was traveling through California's high deserts in June, a time when temperatures are extremely high. With little water left, the high temperature started to take its toll, leaving the cyclist tired, hot, and dehydrated. Towards the end, the terrain changed with more hills and a dirt road that was less smooth than pavement. The hills made cycling more strenuous, further exhausting the cyclist. With the high temperature still persisting and almost no water remaining, by the end of the ride, the roads, temperature, and distance had left the cyclist exhausted and dehydrated.
1041	7021	3	2	In the short story “Rough road ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist encountered numerous difficulties due to the setting. The story is set in “the high deserts of California in June.” June is a warm month, and California typically has a hot and dry climate, which led to problems for the cyclist. Additionally, the cyclist was traveling through the desert, and there were several abandoned towns along the way, exacerbating the situation. Soon, the cyclist ran out of water and found that the towns ahead were unoccupied. As a result, he had no option but to continue his journey.
1042	7022	3	2	The setting's features impact the cyclist in multiple ways. The hilly terrain requires the cyclist to exert more effort, leading to fatigue. As the cyclist becomes increasingly tired, his water consumption rises. Consequently, he depletes his water supply rapidly and desires more water. To conserve water until reaching the next town, he reduces his water intake, which causes dehydration, increased tiredness, and weakness. Moreover, the hilly terrain makes his legs work harder to climb the hills, leading to leg fatigue. The rising temperature also makes him feel thirsty more frequently. In conclusion, the setting significantly affects the cyclist's physical condition and journey.
1043	7023	3	2	In the poem “Do not exceed speed limit,” the setting is depicted as extremely rough and dry. The cyclist states that he was running low on water. He mentions, “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake,” which portrays the setting as dry, empty, and potentially dangerous. The cyclist also refers to a sign that read “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” which made it challenging for him to ride. These elements of the setting had a notable impact on the biker in the story.
1044	7024	3	2	Its features include the landscape, characters, plot, beginning, and end. These elements collectively contribute to the overall nature and experience of the work. The landscape sets the scene, the characters drive the story, the plot provides the narrative arc, and the beginning and end book - end the entire experience. In this way, all these features work in harmony to create a complete and coherent piece.
1045	7025	3	2	In “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted speed limits,” the setting has a significant impact on the cyclist's mood. Every time the setting changes, the cyclist's mood also changes. At the beginning of the story, the cyclist is riding through “cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” During this time, the cyclist enjoys the trip and is in a positive mood. As the story progresses, the description “there was no one in sight, not a building, a car, or structure of any land” emerges. At this juncture, as the cyclist's water supply starts to dwindle, his positive mood gives way to a desperate one. In conclusion, the changing setting in the story effectively influences the cyclist's emotional state.
1046	7026	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting presents the biker with a formidable challenge that he must surmount. When the flat road transitioned to short, rolling hills, the biker had to exert more energy to pedal uphill. This made it arduous for him to overcome his physical exhaustion. Additionally, he mentions traveling through the high desert of California in June. The hot and dry weather caused him to quickly deplete his water supply. Moreover, being in the desert meant there were no signs of towns, people, or any form of assistance. These conditions were difficult for the biker as he was aware that if he succumbed to dehydration, no one would be around to rescue him. In conclusion, these harsh conditions posed a significant challenge to the biker.
1047	7027	3	2	The cyclist was on a long bike journey to Yosemite National Park. The features of the setting affected him in numerous ways. On the way, he had to cross a desert - like terrain. The blistering sun beat down on his back for miles, building up his thirst for water. He was extremely tired, and the terrain made him drenched in sweat. If the weather hadn't been so hot, he wouldn't have faced such a difficult time. The high temperature in the desert makes physical activities harder to endure, even for those with high endurance. The heat made him tired and caused him to lose a lot of energy. To make matters worse, an elderly man gave him terrible directions. In my opinion, these aspects of the setting had a substantial impact on the cyclist.
1048	7028	3	2	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the setting significantly affects the author. The setting is characterized by “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The emptiness around the author led to a loss of hope and trust. When the author saw an old juice factory, he initially felt that things were going in his favor. However, upon realizing it was abandoned, he lost all hope. His despair is further evident when he talks about his impending death. He also shows a loss of trust in old men, stating that he'll never accept advice from “old - timers who haven't left their porches since Carter was in office.” In conclusion, the features of the setting and the directions he was given made him lose all hope of survival.
1049	7029	3	2	At the start of the bike ride, the cyclist is in high spirits, feeling good and strong as the day and the journey commence. The sun begins to shine down on him, but he remains positive, hardly noticing the heat. When he reaches an old, rusty water pump, he's disappointed and tastes a liquid that resembles “battery acid.” As the terrain starts to feel more hilly, his struggle intensifies. The cyclist drinks more water and starts to feel tired. When he encounters a rough road, he remarks, “sometimes life can feel so cruel,” indicating the negative impact of what he thought would be a pleasant bike ride. A snake blocks his path, and he becomes dehydrated. However, a sign for a fish camp brings him refreshment and relief. In the restroom, he takes a satisfying gulp of water, quenching his thirst. The water in the setting revitalizes the cyclist, while the hot sun, rough terrain, and unfamiliar area make him feel lost and fatigued.
1050	7030	3	2	The setting's features have multiple effects on the cyclist. The sand and the intense heat, two prominent elements of the setting, make him extremely thirsty. The quote “... followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees” illustrates the intense heat the cyclist is experiencing. The sun is another crucial feature that impacts him. All these aspects of the setting work together to affect the cyclist. In conclusion, the combination of sand, heat, and the sun in the setting has a significant influence on the cyclist's condition.
1051	7031	3	2	The cyclist is influenced by the setting's features as he seeks a remarkable destination. For instance, he mentioned longing to reach a particular spot. When he finally arrived, it turned out to be a ghost - town. He chuckled and rode away since it didn't meet his expectations. In my opinion, this cyclist judges places based on their appearance rather than what they offer. He was skeptical about getting directions from an old man but still accepted them. It seems he is determined to reach his desired place, not allowing anyone to hinder him. He appears to be in search of a perfect spot, believing that once he finds it, he'll have great stories to tell. In conclusion, his approach to his journey is driven by his ideal of a perfect place and his self - determination.
1052	7032	3	2	The setting can have multiple effects on a cyclist. In hot weather, the cyclist will become thirsty and sweaty. If there are hills on the route, he will not only be tired but also thirsty. Despite being in this uncomfortable state, the cyclist is resolute in finding a town. He stated, “I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” This shows that he is confident in his ability to cover the distance and is determined to do so. The difficult terrain further complicates his journey, yet he knows he must overcome these challenges. With his strong spirit and the self - encouragement he has, he can overcome almost any obstacle. In conclusion, the cyclist's determination and positive mindset are crucial for him to succeed in this challenging cycling journey.
1053	7033	3	2	The features of the setting cause the cyclist's mood to fluctuate. In @LOCATION1, which is pleasant, shaded, and cool, he feels quite good. He is excited and eager to embark on the adventure of a new path. His good mood persists when he reaches the first town. However, as he continues and his water supply runs out, his mood deteriorates, and he becomes more frustrated. In an ironic turn of events, when he comes across a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, he is on the verge of quitting. He is dejected and nearly ready to admit defeat. But he forces himself to carry on. When he finally reaches a place with water, his relief is mingled with wariness of the old man sitting on the porch. He has learned not to take water or advice from old men for granted. In conclusion, the setting has a significant impact on the cyclist's emotions and experiences during his journey.
1054	7034	3	2	The features of the setting gradually erode the cyclist's willpower. The sights he encounters are discouraging. For example, he was greeted by a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold the largest mule. This desolate scene was troubling. The lack of signs of a building or town wears away his hope, and sometimes these sights are psychologically damaging. In an ironic situation that might amuse sadists, he came across a building that, judging from its appearance, had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant, abandoned years ago. A sand - blasted picture of a young boy drinking grape juice was still visible. For a cyclist running out of water, this irony can shatter his resolve to continue. The presence of a snake and rolling hills slow him down and make him expend more energy. The heat dehydrates him even faster. Overall, the environment is extremely hostile for a cyclist, making his journey a real struggle.
1055	7035	3	2	The features of the setting impact the cyclist in various ways. The climate has the most significant effect. The heat makes him drink a lot of water, leading to dehydration. As a result, he loses energy. The condition of the road also plays a role. It is rocky, bumpy, winding, and hilly. Coupled with his dehydration, the road makes him feel like giving up. Moreover, the lack of shade, no remaining water, and the intense sun beating down on him exacerbate his situation. The combination of these factors from the setting makes his cycling journey extremely difficult. In conclusion, the setting's features, mainly the climate and the road conditions, pose great challenges to the cyclist's ability to continue his journey.
1056	7036	3	2	Throughout the cyclist's trail, numerous factors act as disadvantages. There are rough roads, a malfunctioning water - pump, an abandoned battling plant, and the fact that it wasn't even the cyclist's intended path. These elements bring about a transformation in the cyclist. When the cyclist reaches the first town and finds it depopulated, they are initially amused. Then, as they continue pedaling, they realize their water supply is dwindling. What initially seems like a sign of hope, a water pump found just in time, turns out to be a letdown as the water is no longer usable. Subsequently, they encounter “rough roads,” making the journey even more arduous. Finally, the cyclist spots a building in the distance, only to find it deserted. The only glimmer of hope for the poor cyclist is when they come across a bait “tar,” a sign of civilization that keeps them going. Hope after hope emerges, only to end in a series of setbacks. These experiences would make anyone pessimistic about the task, but the cyclist perseveres. These encounters create an engaging narrative. Every time there is a glimmer of hope, one becomes eager to know what will happen next and then feels sorry for the cyclist after so many dashed hopes. The steadily rising plot keeps the reader engaged and wanting more.
1057	7037	3	2	The setting had an impact on the cyclist due to the poor - condition roads. Additionally, the presence of hills made the journey more difficult for the cyclists. In such a setting, the combination of bad roads and hills presented significant challenges, ultimately affecting the cyclists' ability to complete their journey with ease.
1058	7038	3	2	“There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or any kind of structure.” This desolation makes it difficult for the cyclist to hold onto hope and figure out where to get water. In June, in the desert at @LOCATION1, with little water around and no one in sight, the cyclist could easily suffer from heatstroke. This situation leaves the cyclist in a state of extreme desperation as they are abandoned. The lack of resources and human presence in this desolate environment poses a serious threat to the cyclist's well - being and makes their situation truly dire.
1059	7039	3	2	The primary factors that affected the cyclist were the rough terrain and the scorching sun. The rough terrain made pedaling more challenging and caused the cyclist to tire out more quickly. Simultaneously, the hot sun contributed to the cyclist's distress by dehydrating them during the ride. The combination of the difficult - to - pedal rough terrain and the dehydrating hot sun had a significant impact on the cyclist, pushing them to the point of exhaustion.
1060	7040	3	2	The setting features in the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit” have an impact on the cyclist. As the cyclist makes their way to the destination, they face obstacles and observe their surroundings. The author sets the starting scene in the second paragraph as “a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California on an early summer evening.” The reader learns that the temperatures are typical of California summers. This creates the cyclist's main conflict: the lack of water. High temperatures make it easy for the cyclist to become dehydrated quickly. The author notes, “The sun was beginning to beat down and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Moreover, the cyclist encounters an extremely large snake in the middle of the road. The reader becomes aware that cycling can present many conflicts. There are also several features of the setting that inform the cyclist of their current location and their desired destination, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite. In the essay, the cyclist is determined to reach Yosemite. Despite facing difficulties, they do not give up and are relieved when they finally obtain water.
1061	7041	3	2	"The desert's features transformed the speaker's perspective on his journey. As the road started to change, so did the speaker's determination; flat roads gave way to short hills. The changing terrain made the speaker doubt the old man who directed him towards the shortcut. He thought, ""I could succumb to heat - stroke on a beautiful June day just because I listened to a man who hadn't left his porch in decades."" The intense desert heat made the speaker extremely thirsty, causing him to drink all his water. With no water source in sight, he decided to suck on a stone, recalling that it could distract from thirst. However, the bumpy terrain prevented him from doing so. He hit a bump and swallowed the stone, which sent him into a panic. He feared, ""I was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean."" Fortunately, his thoughts changed after he found a water supply. Clearly, the desert's features had a profound impact on the cyclist."
1062	7042	3	2	"The setting has a severely negative impact on the cyclist. With the lack of buildings, people, and cars on the so - called ""shortcut,"" he has serious doubts about his survival. He thinks, ""I was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean."" Since there is nothing around him, he believes he won't find any water and will die of dehydration or heatstroke, as he realizes, ""And the growing realization that I would die of heatstroke."" In conclusion, the desolate setting poses a significant threat to the cyclist's life."
1063	7043	3	2	"The setting of the story has a multi - faceted impact on the bike rider. The heat during his ride makes him extremely thirsty. For instance, as described on page @NUM1, ""The sun was beginning to heat down."" The sun's intense heat leads to his dehydration. Another factor is that he is traveling through the California desert in June, as mentioned on page @NUM2. California is a relatively hot state, and June is one of its warmer months. Moreover, the terrain is not in the rider's favor. Page @NUM2 states that ""Flat road had turned into short rolling hills."" Short rolling hills are more physically demanding on a biker than flat terrain. In summary, the setting, including the heat and the terrain, significantly affects the bike rider."
1064	7044	3	2	The setting had a notable impact on the cyclist. It was June, and the temperature was rising. The book mentions that he was passing through the desert. With the sun beaming down on him, the cyclist did not have an adequate supply of water to survive in the harsh desert environment. The combination of the hot month, the desert setting, and the lack of water put the cyclist in a precarious situation. In conclusion, the setting clearly presented great challenges for the cyclist.
1065	7045	3	2	This passage will elaborate on how the features of the setting influence the cyclist. The setting affects the cyclist through elements such as weather, road structure, and the presence of animals. These are all factors beyond the cyclist's control. As the cyclist rides through the area, these aspects of the setting have a direct impact on his journey. In conclusion, the setting's features play a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience.
1066	7046	3	2	The setting features in this story instill determination in the cyclist, likely due to the challenging environment of the desert. The harsh conditions of the desert can act as a motivating factor, pushing the cyclist to persevere.
1067	7047	3	2	The setting significantly affects the cyclist. It's summertime and extremely hot. Had he not been in a “ghost town” with the “sun beginning to beat down,” he wouldn't have grown so tired and exhausted. In June, in [location of @CAPS1 for nia], it was swelteringly hot, and the water was @NUM1 degrees. The text mentions rolling hills and tumbleweeds, indicating a desert - like area. The long journey, “about forty miles into the pedal,” also contributed to his fatigue. In summary, the setting was a desolate and scorching place.
1068	7048	3	2	The features of the setting are of utmost importance for cyclists. An inappropriate setting can expose them to numerous dangers. Therefore, having a well - defined and suitable setting is crucial for their safety and the success of their cycling endeavors.
1069	7049	3	2	The features of the setting had a terrible impact on the cyclist. For instance, he faced severe problems and was helpless to solve them. He started his journey in good condition but soon became dehydrated. With only @NUM1 miles on the road, he had very little water left. In June, traveling through a desert, water loss was a major issue. The poor condition of the road also affected him as he was on a bike and had difficulty maintaining balance. The weather, temperature, water loss, road damage, and the presence of snakes all affected him in multiple ways. Being on a bike, he couldn't protect himself well, and he was both dehydrated and tired. Overall, the setting severely hampered the cyclist's journey.
1070	7050	3	2	During his journey, the protagonist in the story confronts various obstacles in the setting. He is cycling in a hot, dry desert where there is no civilization or natural water source, leading to the risk of dehydration. The terrain is difficult; the rolling hills require a great deal of energy to climb. There are also signs warning of a “rough road ahead.” Another obstacle is a mental one. When he needed an occupied building, he came across an abandoned juice factory. After finding @NUM1 abandoned examples of civilization, he must have lost hope in [@CAPS2 civilization]. This discouragement made his journey even more mentally taxing.
1071	7051	3	2	The characteristics of the setting significantly influence cyclists. Cyclists need towns with a water supply to replenish their water, especially after climbing hills. Additionally, they require a place to eat and rest. In conclusion, the features of the setting play a crucial role in meeting the basic needs of cyclists during their journey.
1072	7052	3	2	The setting, characterized by heat, lack of water, rough roads, dry air, snakes in the desert, and hills, severely impacts the cyclist. The cyclist is aware of the dire situation and fears death, imagining being consumed by birds. In summary, the harsh elements of the setting create a life - threatening and mentally distressing situation for the cyclist.
1073	7053	3	2	In June, a cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California. The hot and dry desert setting affected the cyclist in multiple ways. The cyclist was extremely hot and thirsty, but the available water was of poor quality, being a tar - like substance followed by brackish water. Flat roads were later replaced by short, rolling hills, which made the cycling more difficult and left the cyclist thirstier and more tired. An old picture of a young boy drinking juice on a Welch's grapefruit factory made the cyclist envious and discouraged. To conclude, factors such as bad water, terrain changes, and the enticing picture, combined with the cyclist's high water consumption, led to fatigue, heat stress, envy, and overall exhaustion.
1074	7054	3	2	The features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist. At the start, when there is an abundant water supply, the terrain is smooth, and the cyclist doesn't need to use much water, although riding @NUM1 miles still requires a fair amount regardless of the terrain. As the trip progresses, especially towards the middle and end, the terrain becomes rough and hilly, and the cyclist needs more water but has less due to not conserving it well, expecting to refill at the first stop. This results in dehydration. In essence, the setting features work against the cyclist; the terrain deteriorates as the cyclist's water supply dwindles, greatly hampering the cyclist's journey.
1075	7055	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in various ways. The cyclist is initially scared to climb a large hill. As he ascends, the heat, presence of snakes, and his own fear and fatigue take a toll, draining almost all of his energy. Despite wanting to stop, he is determined to climb the hill. He consoles himself with the thought that the descent will be relaxing. In conclusion, the combination of the hill, environmental factors, and the cyclist's mental state makes the climb a challenging yet persevered - through task.
1076	7056	3	2	"After reading ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit"", it was evident that the setting of the adventure had an impact on the narrator. Firstly, the heat made the narrator uncomfortable and extremely thirsty. During the journey, he described the trip as a ""water - depleting"" one, which clearly indicated his water shortage, a significant issue. Moreover, the description of the road as ""rolling hills"" suggested that they seemed endless, diminishing the narrator's hope of reaching the destination quickly. Additionally, the desert environment also gave the narrator little hope of getting to his destination. In conclusion, the setting affected the narrator both physically and mentally."
1077	7057	3	2	The setting of the story had a profound impact on the cyclist. Being alone on the journey was a driving force as it maintained his high level of determination. Had he had a partner, they might have stopped for a break or shared the water. The lack of buildings, houses, or any signs of civilization in sight also influenced him. The mere sight of a building in the distance gave him a surge of strength. If there had been buildings, he could have stopped to ask for more water and rest. The fact that he was cycling in a desert in California in the middle of June was another crucial factor. In such a situation, he felt a lack of determination as there was little he could do to improve his circumstances. At one point, he even feared for his life. In conclusion, the setting played a decisive role in determining the cyclist's endurance and will - power.
1078	7058	3	2	The features of the setting had various effects on the cyclist. For instance, he asked some older men who hadn't left their porches since Carter was in office about the location of the next water source. He found himself in the middle of nowhere. It was June, and the warm weather added to his troubles as he didn't have an ample supply of water. In conclusion, these aspects of the setting significantly affected the cyclist's journey.
1079	7059	3	2	"Multiple features of the setting had an impact on the cyclist. The cyclist's presence in the ""high desert of California in June"" affected him in several ways. It led to severe dehydration, forcing him to conserve water and chew on pebbles to collect any available spit in his mouth. The rough road presented new challenges; the difficult terrain required him to exert more effort and caused him to lose energy rapidly. The long distance he had to travel, much farther than planned, also took a toll on him. Thoughts of possible death and the inability to reach his destination affected his energy and spirits. In conclusion, these features of the setting had a substantial impact on the cyclist."
1080	7060	3	2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in numerous ways. Since the cyclist was in an isolated area, he had no access to water. He mentioned that he'd read sucking on stones could distract from thirst, which shows how desperate he was due to thirst. His lack of energy to continue was evident, and the thought of dropping from heatstroke, combined with the hot weather and no water, severely affected his energy levels. In conclusion, the setting features had a significant and negative impact on the cyclist's ability to continue his journey.
1081	7061	3	2	The setting's features have a significant impact on the cyclist. The harsh terrain presented a challenge as the cyclist had a low water supply and all the towns were abandoned, leaving no opportunity to refill. The heat also played a role, quickly making the cyclist weary and tired. During the bike ride, there was a glimmer of hope at an old water pump, but the cyclist was quickly disappointed when the hot liquid tasted like battery acid. The setting established the conflict and helped achieve the tone the author intended to affect the cyclist.
1082	7062	3	2	The setting around the cyclist can affect them in various ways. The roughness of the ride due to the setting impacts the cyclist. For instance, the cyclist may ride over a lot of rocks, which could cause the tire to puncture. At other times, the ride could be smooth and easy. Additionally, the area could be far from towns, making it difficult to return. There might also be a lack of water, leading to dehydration. In conclusion, these aspects of the setting can have a notable effect on the cyclist.
1083	7063	3	2	The setting depicted in the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” would be a nightmare for any biker. On a summer day, a biker is riding in the middle of a desert. The sweat dripping down the biker is accelerating their dehydration. As the narration states, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie), this shows the extreme heat of the desert and the risk of the biker dropping dead. The desert is deserted, with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, and the biker passes abandoned towns and factories. The level of danger for a biker in this area is very high. Fortunately, the biker managed to survive these surroundings.
1084	7064	3	2	The desert area of California was causing the cyclist to become dehydrated. The trip was long, and the cyclist had enough water to reach the destination if they followed the map's route. However, a group of old men, who “haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” gave the cyclist a shortcut. The cyclist followed their advice and almost died from heatstroke and dehydration. If the cyclist had stuck to the map, they could have stopped at a store for more water if the situation was bad. In the end, it's clear that following the map would have been a safer choice.
1085	7065	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in multiple ways. The setting was a dry California desert; if it were a bustling city, the events in the story would not have occurred. The author asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park and, “like a foolish youth,” followed their advice. Initially, everything went well, but when the cyclist reached the second town, they were almost dehydrated. In an ironic twist, the cyclist reached an abandoned grape - juice factory. Almost all hope seemed lost until the cyclist rounded a bend and found a new hope: “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp - if you won’t bait, put the big ones, we’re your best bet.” In the end, the cyclist learned to stick to a map rather than relying on old people who “haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.”
1086	7066	3	2	The setting's features had an impact on the cyclist. Initially, he understood that seeking advice from individuals who no longer drive or even leave their porches would be unhelpful. When the author mentioned “old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” this was the situation being described. Then, when the cyclist stated “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face,” he was referring to being alone on the road, with no cars in sight. The turns had such sharp curbs that only a bicycle could navigate them safely. As he “whipped the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage and tried not to get too excited,” it was evident that this long, solitary cycling experience would have excited many. In conclusion, the unique features of the setting significantly influenced the cyclist's journey and state of mind.
1087	7067	3	2	The features of the setting made the cyclist's journey to the Yosemite National Park longer, more difficult, and more dangerous. He was advised by some old folks, whom he described as “haven’t gotten off their porches since Carter was in office.” Although these old folks may possess wisdom, there are reasons not to follow their advice. In the end, the setting's characteristics presented challenges that the cyclist had to face while making his way to the park.
1088	7068	3	2	The setting was devoid of cars and buildings, which meant there was no immediate help available. The cyclist, in the desert where no one was around, ran out of water and became tired and dehydrated. Despite this, he continued towards his destination. The road was straight for the most part, but near the end, there were numerous hills. While cycling up these hills, he almost encountered a snake. With the hot weather and no water, he was at risk of death. In conclusion, the harsh conditions of the setting posed severe challenges to the cyclist's journey.
1089	7069	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting have a significant impact on the biker. The heat continuously dehydrates the biker. At the first town, the old water pump was useless as the water tasted like “battery acid.” Subsequently, there was a sign posting a maximum speed limit, yet the biker was traveling at about one - fifth of that speed. This realization affected his mood and made him aware of the long ride ahead. Fortunately, the pebbles he found were helpful as he recalled that putting pebbles in the mouth can alleviate thirst. Finally, the bait store provided the much - needed relief at the end of his trip. In conclusion, the setting made the rider's journey arduous, but the bait store offered the solution he required.
1090	7070	3	2	The features of the setting had a notable impact on the cyclist. For instance, the towns were not close to each other. This was a problem because if the towns were nearer, he could have easily found stores to replenish his water supply if he ran out. Moreover, in case of a heatstroke, there would be no one around to offer help, and he could die. In my opinion, the cyclist's location was the primary factor affecting him. In conclusion, the sparse distribution of towns in the setting posed significant risks to the cyclist's well - being during his journey.
1091	7071	3	2	The sweltering weather is causing the cyclist to lose water rapidly, and he is unable to find additional water sources. The rough terrain of the hills is sapping the energy he possesses. The intense heat is so overwhelming that he has to break the journey into segments based on the landmarks he wishes to reach. Physically and emotionally, he becomes exhausted. His journey is indeed arduous, but despite the difficulties, he perseveres.
1092	7072	3	2	The characteristics of the setting have an impact on the cyclist in terms of his hydration status. In the text, after the description “wide rings of dried sweat clinched my thirst, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June,” there is a sign stating “Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This indicates that the sun, a feature of the setting, is causing the cyclist to become dehydrated. Additionally, the description “a tarlike distance surged out, followed by a cockish water feeling somelane in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees” shows that the cyclist is aware that there is no water in this area, which is another aspect of the setting that affects him. In conclusion, the setting plays a significant role in the cyclist's experience.
1093	7073	3	2	The setting features have multiple effects on the cyclist. In Joe Kurmaskie's essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist encounters numerous obstacles. When he first showed the old men his map, he might have thought to himself, “My goodness, what have I gotten myself into?” Relying on the shortcut suggested by the old men, he later felt doubt, anger, and determination throughout the day. The extreme heat and dwindling water supply made him worried about dehydration and death as he started to fear getting lost. The hills also made him tired. Eventually, through his determination and effort, the cyclist found a small store. This demonstrates that despite the challenges posed by the setting, the cyclist's perseverance led to a positive outcome.
1094	7074	3	2	The cyclist is in a desert setting, which can pose a risk of heatstroke. The text indicates that he is short on water, and severe dehydration is unhealthy and can be fatal. However, when the wind blows against his face, it can cool him down along with the evaporation of sweat. As long as he has some liquid remaining, his situation may be manageable. Overall, the desert setting presents both dangers and a small measure of relief for the cyclist.
1095	7075	3	2	The story is set in a dry and hot desert in the middle of June. These setting features influence the author, as they show a transformation from being strong and determined at the start to becoming weak and doubtful later. At the beginning of the story, the author states, “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face,” which conveys the confidence he had before embarking on the trip. Later, he describes the setting as “the high deserts of California in June,” highlighting the heat and the challenges he faces. The text then details his dehydration and exhaustion. However, when he reaches a town and “cool water drips from my head as I slumped against the wall,” he feels relieved. Evidently, as the setting changes, so does the author's attitude. This relationship between the setting and the author's state of mind is a key aspect of the story.
1096	7076	3	2	The setting's various features significantly impact cyclists. Temperature, for instance, can completely alter the cycling experience. Excessively high temperatures lead to rapid fatigue, while extremely low temperatures make breathing difficult. In the story, the cyclist was in a desert area during June, where the intense heat made the ride tiring. Terrain also plays a crucial role. Uphill roads are strenuous, downhill roads are easy, and level terrain is relatively manageable. The cyclist in the story initially encountered level terrain, which later turned into hilly areas, exhausting him. Evidently, the features of the setting have a substantial influence on cyclists.
1097	7077	3	2	The setting poses challenges for the cyclist. The roadways are unfamiliar, the weather is hot and dry, and there are wild animals present. As the text indicates, these factors from the setting affect the cyclist's journey, highlighting the impact of the setting on the cyclist's experience.
1098	7078	3	2	The setting exerts a significant influence on the cyclist's condition. In June, the environment is extremely hot and dry. The cyclist is navigating through the “high deserts in @LOCATION1,” where numerous hills await him, requiring him to climb up and then carefully maneuver down. These obstacles, combined with the sweltering heat, slow him down. Given the circumstances, he urgently needs water, yet his supply is already running low. Clearly, the setting has a considerable impact on the cyclist's well - being and progress.
1099	7079	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the narrator faces the arduous task of crossing a challenging and dangerous desert. Instead of traveling by car, the narrator is on a bike. Crossing a desert on foot is already tiring, let alone on a bike. The speed limit was @NUM1, but the narrator was going at a water - depleting @NUM2. In the brutal @NUM3 - degree heat, the narrator is gulping down water bottles so quickly that there is a risk of running out. Moreover, after pedaling for a long time, the narrator might pass out from exhaustion. As the narrator says, “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades.” It's evident that the narrator is severely troubled by the surroundings.
1100	7080	3	2	The setting affected the character in typical ways that would affect most people. Upon reaching the first town, the character ran out of drinking water, and the town's water tasted like battery acid, making it unsafe to consume. As the character set off, the scenery changed. “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This suggests that the town the character is heading towards might be abandoned or unused. The character also saw a large rattlesnake and tumbleweed, typical signs of a desert. In a dehydrated state, it was difficult for the character to maintain balance, as they said, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” Eventually, the character resorted to putting rocks in their mouth to deceive their mind into thinking they weren't thirsty. Clearly, the setting had a profound and challenging impact on the character.
1101	7081	3	2	The cyclist's performance on the bike was affected by various features of the setting. Firstly, he had to be vigilant about snakes that frequently crossed the roads. Secondly, the streets were winding and uneven, which disrupted his cycling rhythm. Additionally, cycling in June brought sweltering heat, and his lack of water put him at risk of heat - stroke. All these factors combined had a significant impact on how the cyclist fared during his ride.
1102	7082	3	2	A cyclist is pedaling through the high deserts of California. The vast expanse of this environment presents a monotonous landscape where everything looks the same for miles. The cyclist is severely dehydrated, and the situation worsens as there is no protection from the sun. With no towns or water sources in sight, it's difficult for the cyclist to maintain a positive attitude. After about forty miles of pedaling, the cyclist reaches what he calls the first “town.” This place, perhaps once a bustling spot before the last world war, now fits the description of a ghost town. This sight makes the cyclist question the directions given by old - timers. In the open desert, the cyclist encounters something only after traveling at least twenty miles. The heat, lack of water, and absence of civilization make the cyclist fear for his life, thinking that he'll die and be picked clean by birds. When the cyclist spots the abandoned Welch's factory, he uses his last bit of energy. Clearly, these harsh conditions had a profound impact on the cyclist.
1103	7083	3	2	The setting has an impact on the cyclist, causing him to display a degree of anger. He mentions not remembering the saying “don't take candy from strangers,” which indicates his discontent. His annoyance stems from an older man giving him incorrect directions. The cyclist realizes the mistake halfway through his journey. He also remarks that “the old man hasn't been off his porch since Carter was in office,” suggesting that the old man's directions are outdated. Overall, the cyclist starts with a negative attitude due to the setting and the events related to it.
1104	7084	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting has a notable effect on the character. The character believes he won't reach the park because of the surrounding scenery. The presence of rolling hills and snakes makes him think he can't go anywhere and that he's going to die. Thus, the setting significantly influences the character's state of mind and expectations.
1105	7085	3	2	As the cyclist attempted to reach Yosemite National Park, he listened to some old men who provided him with directions for a shortcut. At the start of his journey, everything seemed fine. However, as he followed the “shortcut,” he discovered that there were no buildings along the way. By the time he realized the old men were wrong, he was almost out of water and there was nothing to drink in the vicinity. The fact that he was in the deserts of California in June only added to the difficulty of his task. About halfway through the ride, he encountered rolling hills, which further complicated his journey. Towards the end, he spotted a building and used all his strength to reach it, only to find it was an abandoned juice factory. Gazing at a picture of a boy drinking juice made his water - deprivation even more agonizing. Eventually, he managed to reach a paint shop where he drank as much water as he could.
1106	7086	3	2	The setting's features had a significant impact on the cyclist. When cycling on the road, he would select a destination and pedal towards it, followed by a rest. If the destination was a building, he'd display strong will and determination. Conversely, if all that lay ahead were hills, he'd keep riding, seemingly uncaring until he collapsed from exhaustion. In conclusion, the nature of the setting clearly influenced the cyclist's mindset and actions.
1107	7087	3	2	As I arrived, I was met with a dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral so poorly constructed that it couldn't even contain the most docile mule. This dismal sight troubled me. There was no one to be seen, and not a single building, car, or any other structure was in view. I thought that with bad luck, I might hit a bump and choke. If he didn't follow the old man's advice, he was in for a rough journey. He would have enjoyed his bike ride more if he had a new map. In summary, the desolate scene and the potential missteps indicated a challenging situation for the traveler.
1108	7088	3	2	The features in the story have a profound impact on the cyclist. Firstly, the lack of anything to drink is a major issue. The cyclist is traveling to a distant place with no food or water for miles, putting his life at risk. Another significant feature is the isolation; there is no one around for miles. If the cyclist were to die out there, no one would know for days, as evidenced by the statement in the story, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind.” Additionally, the heat is a factor. The story mentions that the cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. June is hot, and California's deserts are even hotter. In conclusion, these features combine to create a perilous situation for the cyclist.
1109	7089	3	2	Travelers often encounter difficulties, and this is true for the main character in this story. His first error was taking directions from the “old - timers,” which led him far off course. In the story, he talked to the old men on the porch and said, “what I shouldn't have done was to let them see my map.” Another problem he faced was running out of water, which led to dehydration. He stated, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Moreover, the desert area he was riding through was an issue, as there was no one around to help if needed, as shown by his statement, “There was no one in sight, not a building, cars, or structure of any kind.” From this story, we learn that people face problems everywhere, but any problem, regardless of its size, can be overcome.
1110	7090	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. On page @NUM1, it describes how the cyclist had to descend a hill and then search for a factory to get juice. If the cyclist failed to find a building, he would continue down the hill, expending his limited energy in vain. In conclusion, the layout of the setting and the availability of resources play a crucial role in the cyclist's decision - making and energy management.
1111	7091	3	2	The cyclist was extremely thirsty, and the desert setting was far from appealing. One could tell she was under stress as she was sweating profusely and having difficulty pedaling.
1112	7092	3	2	The setting impacts the cyclist in a way that most people cannot fathom. Cycling forty miles with perhaps only a gallon of water is arduous, especially in California. The cyclist stated, “I had been consuming water from my bottles quite regularly while traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The effect on his body would be quite severe.
1113	7093	3	2	In the story, the features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist. When he is riding, he has very little water. He takes advice from old men, encounters a snake, and rides down a dirt road where he has no water at that time. Eventually, he leaves the dirt road and joins the main road he usually travels. He also promised to stick to it in the relevant situation. This shows that one should persevere in similar circumstances in the future.
1114	7094	3	2	The biker's story is rich in features. The descriptive words used paint vivid pictures in my mind. For instance, the phrase “One long, crippling hill” allows me to visualize the challenging terrain. Similarly, “There was no one in sight” creates a clear image of the desolate surroundings. These descriptive elements in the story are beneficial as they help the reader better understand the narrative.
1115	7095	3	2	The features of the setting have an influence on the cyclist. The “rolling hills” in a certain month make the rider more fatigued. The severe heat leads to a lack of water. Additionally, the path chosen and the number of stops made along the way also matter. The heat, water shortage, rolling hills, and the advice received can all have a negative impact on the outcome. Therefore, a rider should formulate a plan and maintain determination to reach their destination.
1116	7096	3	2	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the setting has an impact on the cyclist. A cyclist is riding his bike and takes directions from some old men. Later, he realizes that these old men likely had no awareness that things change over time. As he puts it, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office.” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist follows the old - timers’ “shortcut,” and it takes an extremely long time to reach his destination. Eventually, he arrives at his campsite, and another person asks him for directions. This time, the cyclist responds, “Yes, sir! I own a very good map,” and says, “I’d always stick to it in the future.” The cyclist’s message is that one should follow a map, something known to be reliable, rather than a person who might be lying or irresponsible.
1117	7097	3	2	The characteristics of the setting have an adverse effect on the cyclist, causing him to become dehydrated and overheated. He is cycling through deserts, with his water supply dwindling. The rough roads, filled with numerous hills, make it extremely difficult for the bicycle to progress. Despite the outrageous heat and the onset of dehydration, he perseveres. In the end, his tenacity in the face of such harsh environmental conditions is remarkable, though the situation remains a challenging one for him.
1118	7098	3	2	I firmly believe that the boy should ask for directions to the place he is going. While it is possible for him to reach the destination without water, this is not a prudent course of action. Water is essential for survival, especially during a journey. Therefore, asking for directions and ensuring he has an adequate water supply is the wisest decision for the boy.
1119	7099	3	2	Throughout the essay, the features of the setting significantly influence the cyclist, Joe. Initially, Joe is happy and confident, as indicated by his “smile on the face.” He writes, “Things began well enough… flat roads…” which shows that at the start, everything was favorable. However, as he progresses, the situation changes. When he encounters changing terrain, he notes, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This change in the landscape makes him lose water as he continues to push forward towards the next “town,” and he becomes determined yet feels helpless. Finally, when he reaches “Gary & Wilber’s fish camp,” he is relieved upon seeing an old guy sitting there. When the two men ask about the best way, he says, “Yes sir! I own a very good map.” This shows that Joe made a mistake by not asking for more directions earlier. Evidently, changes in the setting can have a profound impact on a person’s mood and attitude.
1120	7100	3	2	The features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. The fact that the setting is in the desert during summer, combined with the cyclist riding a bike, creates a challenging situation. For example, in the story, the cyclist is running out of water and beginning to get dehydrated. The harsh desert environment, with its high temperatures and lack of water sources, makes the cyclist extremely vulnerable. In conclusion, the desert - summer setting poses a serious threat to the cyclist’s well - being during his bike ride.
1121	7101	3	2	The setting significantly influenced the cyclist due to the mood it created and the changes that occurred. For example, when the setting changed, the cyclist's emotions shifted accordingly. In a sunny and pleasant town, the cyclist felt good, while in a dark town, the cyclist did not feel happy. Therefore, the setting had a substantial impact on the cyclist.
1122	7102	3	2	"After some time on his journey, he stated, ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" I believe this setting motivated him to continue pedaling to survive. However, he then began to think he might die, yet he was not sad or upset; instead, he was happy and even chuckled to himself because he followed the advice of some old men. In my view, he was having the time of his life cycling through this Californian setting. It shows that sometimes, even in potentially life - threatening situations, one can find a strange kind of joy in the experience."
1123	7103	3	2	The cyclist's location presented more disadvantages than advantages. The advantages were the downhill slopes. However, the disadvantages were numerous: uphill climbs, running out of water in the middle of nowhere, the intense heat, getting lost in the desert, and having little hope until spotting a factory. The biggest drawback was that he was on a bike instead of a car, lacking mechanical assistance and having to pedal continuously. Being in the desert on a bike without water and being in a dire situation is extremely perilous. He was very fortunate to have made it up the hill; otherwise, he would have perished. He even thought he was hallucinating, but it was a good thing he investigated. In my opinion, for future reference, it's wiser to use a car instead of a bike in the desert.
1124	7104	3	2	"The features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. When the cyclist is solely concerned with finding a water source, fear and panic set in. As the cyclist looks around, the setting is a vast desert with no buildings in sight. The story quotes, ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" Upon seeing this desolate landscape, the cyclist panics and believes they won't make it, which has a detrimental effect on their mental state. In conclusion, the setting can greatly influence a person's mental well - being in such challenging circumstances."
1125	7105	3	2	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in various ways. A woman who followed the advice of older men to reach her destination ran out of water and nearly died of thirst. During her journey, she encountered a snake. As described in the text, ""At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondback"" (@NUM1). Subsequently, she started to hallucinate. The harsh setting clearly took a toll on her physical and mental state, highlighting how settings can have a profound impact on those traveling through them."
1126	7106	3	2	"He was influenced by multiple factors, including water scarcity, the presence of hills, a snake on the path, and the condition of the road. The water bottles held only a few meager sips, highlighting the problem of insufficient water. The hills were ""crippling,"" which affected his progress. There was a snake on the long - stretch of the road, and he was unsure how to get past it. Moreover, the roads were rough, and the speed limit was 55 mph. Evidently, he was affected in numerous ways, not just by a single factor."
1127	7107	3	2	"The desolate features of the desert path unnerve the cyclist, yet they also spur his determination to overcome them. As he cycles, he encounters ""ghost towns,"" ""abandoned buildings,"" and diamondback snakes. These are classic symbols associated with getting lost in the desert and would strike fear into most solo travelers. The author even comments that sadists might find the cyclist's story enjoyable. The cyclist frequently voices fears of dropping dead, being eaten by vultures, and at one point, jokingly wishes for death by choking. Despite these fears, he remains resolute to survive. Against all odds, he presses on, even after exhausting what he thought was his last burst of energy. He also manages to keep a sense of humor, writing a diary entry about the wisdom of old men. Eventually, when he finds a place to rest, he distills the experience into a valuable lesson: always follow the map."
1128	7108	3	2	"The cyclist is impacted by several elements of the environment, namely the heat, the hills, and the scarcity of people. For instance, the cyclist is running low on water, with ""wide rings of dried sweat on his shirt,"" and is at risk of ""dropping from heatstroke."" The hills likely force him to expend more energy. Additionally, the lack of people in the area exacerbates his situation. Had the towns been populated, the cyclist would not have been as affected by the setting."
1129	7109	3	2	"The characteristics of a setting can significantly influence one's actions and the manner in which they are carried out. In the case of the cyclist, factors such as water availability, access to help, and safety are affected by the setting. The statement ""I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirsty by allowing what spit you have to circulate"" reveals his extreme need for water, resorting to sucking on a rock and swallowing his own spit. The rough terrain and the outdated, abandoned road recommended by the old men leave him unable to ask for directions and uncertain if he is on the right track. Along the way, he encounters a snake. Being far from civilization, a snake bite could be fatal as there would be no one to help. Similarly, in case of a heatstroke, he lacks both water and assistance. Clearly, water, help, and safety are integral aspects of the setting that impact the cyclist."
1130	7110	3	2	"The features of the setting pose significant challenges for the cyclist's ride. The area has numerous hills, which demand more energy from the cyclist. Additionally, since it is a desert, the climate is extremely hot and dry. As a result, the cyclist requires more water than usual. The author mentions, ""…I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" The author is well - aware of the danger of traveling in such a place without adequate water, stating, ""…I could drop from heatstroke…"" Had the setting been cooler, the level of danger would have been substantially reduced."
1131	7111	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist is significantly influenced by the setting's features. Firstly, the “shorecay” route to @CAPS1 isolates him from others, leaving him in a remote area with a limited water supply. Secondly, the water shortage causes him to despair, feeling on the verge of collapse and death. As he states in the story, “It really didn’t matter. I was going to die and the lards would pick me clean.” This clearly demonstrates that the setting's features instilled a sense of hopelessness in him. Overall, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience and emotional state.
1132	7112	3	2	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, multiple features of the setting impact the cyclist. One such significant feature is the intense heat of the sun. As the narration indicates, “The sun was beginning to beat down” (@CAPS1). This heat would have made the cyclist's journey more arduous and physically demanding. In conclusion, the heat of the sun is a notable setting - related factor that affects the cyclist in the story.
1133	7113	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting's features have a profound impact on the cyclist. The text reveals that the cyclist was traveling through the high desert of California in June, a time when the weather is hot, and water is essential for survival, especially for someone cycling. Later, the quote “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” shows that the cyclist struggled to endure the harsh setting. Given that California deserts are hot and dry, especially in summer, working outside without water leads to dehydration and potentially death. The author effectively portrays how the setting affects the cyclist, highlighting the challenges the cyclist faces due to the environment.
1134	7114	3	2	In June, a cyclist was making his way through the high deserts of California, as described in the story. The surroundings had a negative impact on him. His water bottle was gradually emptying, and the only available water in the town he reached tasted like battery acid. Things seemed bleak until he spotted a @ORGANIZATION1 factory. He was extremely thirsty, and there was a sand - blasted picture of a young boy drinking juice on the side of the building. However, the building was abandoned. After that, he said, “Somehow I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” The lack of water in the landscape made him lose hope and essentially give up. In conclusion, the setting's features, mainly the water scarcity, had a severely negative effect on the cyclist.
1135	7115	3	2	The cyclist's journey is affected by the setting. There are numerous hills and a scarce water supply. These factors make the cyclist's ride more challenging. The hills require more physical effort, and the lack of water can lead to dehydration and fatigue. In conclusion, the combination of hills and limited water in the setting has a significant impact on the cyclist's experience.
1136	7116	3	2	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting's features had multiple impacts on the cyclist. The water situation was a significant factor. There was scarce water, and it was extremely hot. The cyclist took a sip and described the taste as similar to battery acid. In my view, one should avoid tasting such hot water. Another aspect was the land. It transitioned from flat to hilly, which started to slow the cyclist down. Finally, the time of day became an issue. As it began to get dark, the cyclist was still pedaling and aimed to cover as much distance as possible. Overall, these elements of the setting presented various challenges to the cyclist's journey.
1137	7117	3	2	The cyclist, biking in the desert in June, was significantly affected by the setting's features. Due to the lack of rivers in the desert, he had no access to water. The intense heat caused him to sweat profusely, and the sweat getting into his eyes impaired his vision. Moreover, because of the high temperatures, there were no people around. All these factors contributed to the cyclist getting tired very easily during his desert biking experience.
1138	7118	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting had both mental and physical effects on the cyclist. When the setting was pleasant, the cyclist had a positive attitude and abundant energy. However, as the setting became less inviting and more treacherous later in the essay, the cyclist started to feel weary and distressed. This shows that the changing setting had a direct correlation with the cyclist's state of mind and physical condition.
1139	7119	3	2	Cyclists invariably encounter numerous problems, including adverse weather conditions and the state of the roads. These challenges can significantly impede their progress and make the cycling experience more arduous. In conclusion, cyclists must be well - prepared to face these issues to ensure a safe and successful journey.
1140	7120	3	2	The setting's features had diverse effects on the cyclist. One major impact was that the entire trail was deserted, leaving the cyclist alone and without access to water. The story describes the place as “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time – say, before the last world war – but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town,” which clearly indicates his solitude and the desolation of the first town he visited. In summary, the desolate setting presented a difficult situation for the cyclist.
1141	7121	3	2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. The lack of water made him tired and a bit delirious. The lack of shade increased the rate of dehydration. The rough road made it difficult to balance. And the snack slowed him down. He thought he was going to die. In such a harsh setting, the cyclist's situation was extremely perilous, and his sense of impending doom was a natural consequence of the adverse conditions.
1142	7122	3	2	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting is crucial to the events that unfold. The story takes place on a highway with a speed limit of @NUM1, while the cyclist can only manage @NUM2. This is significant because cycling at @NUM2, which is a great effort for a cyclist, nearly led to dehydration. Additionally, the hilly terrain added to the challenge. Ultimately, these factors led to the cyclist's demise. Evidently, the setting plays a vital role in determining the story's outcome."
1143	7123	3	2	The setting is in California, which is not known for being the coolest place in terms of temperature. California's climate often leans towards the warmer side, and this characteristic of the setting sets a certain tone, potentially influencing the mood and actions of those within the story's context.
1144	7124	3	2	"At the start of his journey, the cyclist is relaxed and appreciates the features of his environment. He remarks, ""I enjoyed the serenity of an early - summer evening."" At a campground in @LOCATION1, the setting is calming and relaxing. When he reaches the first town, the setting shocks him but also amuses him, and he begins to feel nervous. After looking around, he says, ""this sight was troubling."" As he reads about the next town, his situation worsens. He notes, ""the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This part of the journey affects him the most. The environment and the land's features have made him tired and thirsty. Clearly, the setting has a major impact on the cyclist."
1145	7125	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's essay ""Rough Road Ahead; Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting is essential in shaping the cyclist's feelings and behavior. As the setting around the cyclist becomes increasingly bleak, his desperation grows. At the start of the trip, the cyclist encounters a ghost town. He says, ""I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on,"" indicating a positive mindset at this stage. Later, he comes across another abandoned set of buildings and finds the sight ""troubling."" Although he is worried, he is not yet depressive and pessimistic. Further down the road, the terrain changes, and he sees the sign that gives the essay its name. The speed limit is 55 mph, while he is cycling at a water - depleting @NUM1. He laments, ""Sometimes life can feel so cruel."" As he rides on, his surroundings deteriorate, but eventually, he finds a place with working water. He is so overjoyed that he wants to find the owners and kiss them. This shows how the setting can swing the cyclist's emotions from hope to despair and back again."
1146	7126	3	2	During his cycling journey through the California desert in June, the cyclist faced numerous challenges. The intense heat of the desert took a toll on him as he pedaled his bike under the scorching sun. The road conditions added to his difficulties; it was bumpy and curvy, and a sign warned of a rough road ahead with a speed - limit of @NUM1, while he was going at @NUM2, making it arduous to navigate the bumps. To make matters worse, he encountered a poisonous snake that blocked most of the pavement in front of him. Being dehydrated and having to deal with the snake would have been terrifying. Overall, the setting of this journey did not offer much assistance to the cyclist.
1147	7127	3	2	The cyclist's travel to @LOCATION1 was fraught with difficulties. They had to overcome multiple hardships, including lack of water, getting lost, the intense desert heat, and minor issues such as snakes and poor road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June, along with the shortage of water, was the most severe challenge. The heat caused the cyclist to experience mirages and affected their cognitive abilities. In conclusion, the heat and the overall setting significantly increased the difficulty of the cyclist's journey.
1148	7128	3	2	The setting had a profound impact on the cyclist. In June, the sweltering heat of California made it an inhospitable environment for anyone to be outdoors. The heat drained the cyclist's body as they struggled to keep cool. When the cyclist reached the first town, they had very little water. As described in the story, “A tar - like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” So, there was no cool water to drink. Not long into the next part of the ride, the flat road gave way to short, rolling hills. With little water, the cyclist now had to endure the most difficult part of the journey. Later, the cyclist mentioned changing a paragraph if they lost consciousness and also talked about the possibility of getting a heatstroke. Clearly, the setting affected the cyclist in numerous ways.
1149	7129	3	2	The setting of the essay “Do not exceed posted speed limit” is extremely dry, sandy, hot, and deserted. On the way to Yosemite, the cyclist took a “shortcut” through the desert. At the start, when leaving the hot and flat part of the desert, the cyclist was in high spirits and full of confidence. As the text states, “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” When the cyclist reached the first “town,” having plenty of water, they were unconcerned and moved on. However, the terrain started to pose problems. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, and a large highway sign warning of a rough road ahead and to not exceed the posted speed limit appeared. This lowered the cyclist's confidence, especially considering the desolation and the risk of a heatstroke with no one around to help. Despite this, the cyclist maintained determination when seeing a factory and continued. When the cyclist saw the first camp, relief washed over them as the terrain flattened again. When asked for directions, the cyclist said they had their own map, preferring to stick to the familiar terrain and follow their own set of directions. In summary, the setting and terrain had a significant impact on the cyclist's journey and mindset.
1150	7130	3	2	As someone who has ridden a bike, I know how relaxing it can be. But when you're forced to cycle miles on @CAPS3 terrain without water, that relaxation seems like a distant dream. Riding through beat - up roads in a dry environment really dampens the experience. @CAPS2, the dry air and the energy exerted during the ride increase your thirst. In such situations, you just want to block out all the discomfort and focus on something more manageable. While @CAPS3 terrain can build character in a cyclist, considering the lack of water and the surrounding dryness, it sounds like pure torture. I sincerely hope that if I ever become a cyclist, I'll never have to go through such a situation.
1151	7131	3	2	Cyclist Joe Kurmaskie endured a difficult journey to Yosemite National Park. Although he was misdirected, more favorable terrain and climate conditions would have significantly eased his plight. Traveling through a California desert in June, he faced sweltering heat and had only one water - bottle. Had the route been a straight shot, the single water - bottle might have lasted longer, but the roads were full of ups and downs, with hills and even ghost towns. The water he could pump was scalding and acidic. Moreover, a straight path would have saved him much energy. In a desperate measure, he resorted to putting rocks in his mouth to produce saliva. Despite these extremely unfavorable conditions, his determination was unwavering, and he was fortunate to survive the ordeal.
1152	7132	3	2	The setting's features have a substantial impact on the cyclist. When pedaling through the high deserts of California in June, the story's intensity is heightened considerably. In contrast, if the date were different and there was a pleasant breeze, the experience of the cyclist would be entirely distinct. The setting's elements, such as the time of year and the geographical location, play a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's journey and the overall feel of the narrative.
1153	7133	3	2	The features of the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist. The lack of water was a major issue as the cyclist could not continue without it; without an adequate water supply, the cyclist risked fainting. A poisonous snake in the area also posed a grave threat. If bitten, the cyclist could die due to the absence of immediate help. Additionally, the condition of the road, with its hills and winding paths, made it more difficult for the cyclist to reach the destination. In conclusion, these aspects of the setting combined to make the cyclist's journey extremely challenging.
1154	7134	3	2	The features of the setting affect cyclists in multiple ways. In hot weather, when cycling long distances, a large amount of water is necessary to prevent dehydration. Additionally, looking at the sun for an extended period can impair a cyclist's vision. The condition of the road also matters. If the road is bumpy and in poor shape, it can significantly impact the way a cyclist rides. Overall, the setting's features have a notable influence on a cyclist's experience and performance.
1155	7135	3	2	The story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by @PERSON1 contains some statements that seem rather pointless. In one sentence of the essay, there are words that could be omitted. For instance, in the sentence “about forty miles into the pedal, I arrive at the first ‘town’,” the phrase “into the pedal” does not add any descriptive value. Such extraneous elements detract from the story's clarity and conciseness.
1156	7136	3	2	The setting of the story is a desert environment. It is extremely hot, forcing the cyclist to exert great effort to continue. The road conditions are harsh, with numerous sharp turns. At one point in the story, the cyclist gains a burst of energy, pedals hard down a hill, and then relaxes. This is an overview of the setting and the story. In conclusion, the desert - like setting with its heat and rough roads significantly influenced the cyclist's journey.
1157	7137	3	2	The setting had a notable impact on the cyclist. The hot environment caused the cyclist to become dehydrated more quickly, increasing the need for water. The presence of many hills required the cyclist to pedal harder and expend more energy to ascend them. The surroundings were free of cars, buildings, and smog, consisting only of nature, which made the bike - ride peaceful and relaxing. In conclusion, the various elements of the setting affected the cyclist in both physically demanding and calming ways.
1158	7138	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. The cyclist's journey would have been far less arduous if these factors had not emerged. Climate, location, and population all play a role. In the story, the cyclist is in the dry climate of California during the heat of June. There is a scarcity of water, forcing the cyclist to ration sips carefully. Additionally, there are few towns, making it difficult to obtain good advice and supplies. The cyclist also encounters a snake, which shows the influence of native wildlife. The dry climate and lack of water lead to self - doubt; the cyclist is constantly worried about fainting and dying of dehydration. Road signs reminding the cyclist of the slow pace also cause doubt. The snake adds to the sense of danger on the journey. Overall, these elements of the setting affected the cyclist. However, the journey teaches that through determination, one can be rewarded. The author also emphasizes that maintaining a positive attitude is crucial for success.
1159	7139	3	2	The features and settings affected the cyclist due to the many dangers involved. The cyclist took advice from elderly people to embark on this journey. Although it started well, the favorable conditions did not last. The cyclist is riding in the middle of summer, in the desert with little water. The cyclist comes across abandoned towns, and with only @NUM1 miles to the next town, rough roads lie ahead. Even when reaching an abandoned town, there seems to be no hope until the cyclist spots a man in a chair. In conclusion, the challenging settings posed significant difficulties for the cyclist, but the glimmer of hope might change the course of the journey.
1160	7140	3	2	The features of the setting have multiple effects on the cyclist. The cyclist is in a desert environment with 200 - degree weather and very little water. Moreover, the cyclist lacks a map and asks for directions from someone who hasn't left their porch in decades. As the quote “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades” shows, the extreme heat and the unreliable advice can endanger the cyclist. In conclusion, the environmental and human - related features of the setting have negatively affected the cyclist's journey.
1161	7141	3	2	The non - town setting impacts the cyclist. This is evident as the cyclist mentions “old timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” This indicates that the cyclist is disoriented and unaware of his location.
1162	7142	3	2	During the cyclist's journey to Yosemite, multiple factors impede his progress. Firstly, the elders provided false information. As a result, the cyclist carried an insufficient amount of water, leading to dehydration. Additionally, the route included obstacles such as snakes, rocky roads, old ghost towns, and abandoned buildings, which diminished the cyclist's confidence. These features of the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist.
1163	7143	3	2	The setting has an impact on the cyclist. The cyclist made some mistakes, such as not sticking to his own map, not packing an extra bottle of water, and taking advice from people who haven't left their porches in years. These actions, influenced by the setting, affected his journey. In conclusion, being more self - reliant and better prepared could have helped the cyclist deal with the setting more effectively.
1164	7144	3	2	In the story, the setting significantly affects the cyclist's mood. The cyclist takes a shortcut filled with abandoned towns, buildings, and a bumpy terrain. When he reaches a fork in the path with a water pump, he pumps the water, only to find it unfit for drinking. Despite this, he remains determined to reach the next town, saying “I could make that.” However, when he encounters a warning sign on the road, his mood sours, and he admits to being sad. Finally, upon reaching @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 Fish Camp, he is thankful and wants to show his gratitude. Overall, the setting initially finds the cyclist determined, but as it deteriorates, so does his mood. When the setting improves, his mood brightens as well.
1165	7145	3	2	The features of the setting had a severe impact on the cyclist. The intense heat made him extremely thirsty, and he was on the verge of running out of water. He even nearly died when, while drinking water, he hit a bump and a bit of spit got lodged in his throat. Moreover, the tiring hills seemed never - ending. These elements of the setting combined to make the cyclist's journey extremely difficult and perilous.
1166	7146	3	2	The features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. Initially, the cyclist was ill - prepared. He obtained directions from an old man who had not left his porch for years, so the old man was unaware of the recent changes in the area. Starting his journey with a limited water supply, when the cyclist reached the second town, he noticed a change in the terrain. The flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. As the quote “I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills” indicates, he did not anticipate the hills and expected a flat route. In the @NUM1 - degree weather with limited water, cycling up and down the hills became extremely difficult. However, going downhill provided a brief respite. In conclusion, the features of the setting clearly influenced the cyclist's journey.
1167	7147	3	2	I believe that numerous factors affected the cyclist in the story. Temperature, terrain, and directions all sowed seeds of doubt in his mind. The high - temperature conditions in the high deserts of California left the cyclist feeling hot, thirsty, and irritable. Throughout the story, he was left with only a few sips of water. Knowing he was running low on water, he was on the verge of feeling sorry for himself. As he cycled further, the terrain changed from flat to “rolling hills”. This change could have a significant impact on someone who has never biked on different levels before. Moreover, the feeling of hope, or rather the lack of it, might have affected him the most. Not believing in oneself is the most challenging obstacle to overcome. Taking casual instructions from an old man cost the cyclist hours of suffering. The author did an excellent job using hyperbole to exaggerate the cyclist's sense of lost hope. The detailed text also painted a vivid picture for the readers. These literary elements made it easier for me to understand how temperature, terrain, and hope affected the cyclist.
1168	7148	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. The immediate surroundings mislead the cyclist into a false sense of security, not realizing that it would lead him into danger. When he encounters a rock in the road and discovers that the water pumps are not working, he is in serious trouble. As the text states, “The sun was beginning to heat down, but it hardly noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” The setting allowed the cyclist's mind to wander so much that he failed to notice the increasing heat. In conclusion, the setting's features put the cyclist in a precarious situation by distracting him from the real - world dangers.
1169	7149	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's short story “Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit”, the features of the setting, such as the lack of water and the inability to find help, have a major impact on the cyclist. During his desperate situation, the cyclist says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise old men their wisdom.” The lack of necessities in his surroundings made him lose his pride and give up hope. However, when he finds hope, he says, “And drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.” He was astonished by what he had found and grateful to be alive. The cyclist should not have taken the old people's advice for granted. From this experience, he will now value people's sense of directions more. In conclusion, the setting's features first pushed the cyclist to the brink of despair and then offered a glimmer of hope, teaching him an important lesson.
1170	7150	3	2	In stories, the setting can have a wide - ranging impact. In this particular story, the setting affected the cyclist significantly. The hot setting slowed him down considerably. For instance, he mentioned that he was only able to cover 55 miles. This shows that the heat in the setting restricted his cycling speed and progress. In conclusion, the hot setting in the story had a clear and negative impact on the cyclist's performance.
1171	7151	3	2	The story is set in the high deserts of California in June. Initially, the cyclist was highly confident and enthusiastic about his journey. However, during the ride, his mindset changed. As his water supply dwindled, he stopped to pump water from a water - pump, but all he got was a water with an acidic taste. He then set off towards the nearest town, which was @NUM1 miles away, believing he could reach it. As he headed there, the terrain transformed from a flat road to short rolling hills. During this time, the cyclist began to lose hope. He feared dying of dehydration and imagined birds picking his body apart. Just when he thought he couldn't make it, he spotted a sign that read “Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp”. He rushed into the shop and took long drinks from the bathroom sink. When he exited the store, an older gentleman offered help, but the cyclist declined, stating that he had a good map. The high temperature and rolling hills had a detrimental impact on the cyclist. He went from being confident to doubting his senses and fearing for his life. The story quotes “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage” and “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean”, indicating his self - doubting behavior. Overall, the challenging setting of the journey significantly affected the cyclist's mental state and his perception of the trip.
1172	7152	3	2	The setting features have a profound impact on cyclists. A reliable water supply is essential; without it, cyclists risk dehydration and even death. Shade trees are also crucial as they shield cyclists from the intense sunlight. It is advisable for cyclists to plan their rides during cooler parts of the day to increase their chances of survival in case their water runs low. Having a companion can be extremely helpful in case of injuries. Additionally, the presence of nearby buildings provides a safety net in emergencies. Carrying a cell phone is also a wise precaution. In conclusion, considering these setting features can greatly enhance a cyclist's safety and comfort during a ride.
1173	7153	3	2	The setting features have multiple and significant impacts on the cyclist. The initial features, including a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral in poor condition, instilled doubt in the cyclist. The outdated appearance of these elements made the cyclist question whether he had taken the right route. Moreover, he was unable to obtain cold and clean water from the pumps, which became the first obstacle he faced. Subsequently, tumbleweeds and a “ridiculously large snake” scared the cyclist, causing him to take a detour. His fear is evident from the quote “I eased past”. When the flat road transitioned to short, rolling hills, the cyclist's journey became arduous, seemingly never - ending, and difficult. Two signs also affected the cyclist. The sign “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” had a negative impact, as the tired and dehydrated cyclist saw no hope in the rough road ahead, leading to anger and frustration. On the other hand, the sign “GARY AND WILBER'S FISH - IF you want bait for the big ones, we're your BEST BET” had a positive effect as it led him to water. In conclusion, these various setting features had both positive and negative impacts on the cyclist's journey.
1174	7154	3	2	The setting had a notable impact on the cyclist, primarily due to changes in terrain. A challenging phase for the cyclist occurred when the flat stretch of road changed to rolling hills. As the author wrote, “I tolld on” (Kurmaskie @NUM1), indicating that the cyclist was struggling through this difficult part of the journey. Another tough part of the trip was when the cyclist saw an abandoned juice factory. The narration “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view” (Kurmaskie @NUM1) shows the difficulty. The words “long” and “crippling” in the context provide a sense of the cyclist being dragged through the harsh setting of the trip. In conclusion, the changing terrain and the sight of the abandoned factory in the setting made the cyclist's journey a strenuous one.
1175	7155	3	2	The cyclist encountered numerous difficult obstacles on his ride to Yosemite. He obtained directions from a group of old men who hadn't visited the places they recommended in a long time. The so - called “town” they mentioned turned out to be more like a ghost town. The day of his ride was extremely hot, and he was cycling through the desert, which exacerbated the situation. To stay hydrated in the heat, he drank water regularly, causing his supply to deplete rapidly. Since the old men's directions led him through closed places, he couldn't replenish his water. Additionally, the poor - condition roads further slowed him down. These features of the setting had a substantial impact on the cyclist during his trip. In conclusion, the inaccurate directions, harsh weather, and bad roads all combined to make the cyclist's journey to Yosemite a very challenging one.
1176	7156	3	2	The setting's features significantly impact the cyclist. Initially, the cyclist is unable to access water, leading to dehydration. Subsequently, the rough terrain of the ride causes the cyclist to expend more energy. Eventually, the cyclist discovers a source of water, which helps improve their condition. All these factors combined have a substantial effect on the cyclist's state.
1177	7157	3	2	The setting of the cyclist's journey in the California desert had a profound impact on him. He had to cycle through the arid expanse, and the intense heat quickly drained his energy. With no rivers or available water supply in the desert, he struggled with a severe lack of water. However, at the end of his ordeal, he found a store where he got a cool drink and some supplies. In summary, the harsh surroundings first took a toll on him but then provided relief.
1178	7158	3	2	"A bicyclist was on a ride to Yosemite National Park. Along the way, his water bottles were nearly empty, with only a few tantalizing sips left. Then, the flat road gave way to short rolling hills, which made him more tired and thirsty. The rider felt despair, thinking, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" Fortunately, he found a place to get water, drank deeply from the sink, and was able to finish his ride."
1179	7159	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's story ""Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting had a considerable influence on the cyclist. At the start of the morning ride, the conditions were ideal, with a gentle breeze, shade from trees, and the presence of rivers. However, after a few hours, the cyclist entered a desert area with bumpy hills. As the story states, ""Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" The poor road conditions and lack of water took a toll on the cyclist. Climbing and descending the hills without shade required more energy and increased the need for water, which the cyclist didn't have. Clearly, the setting's conditions affected the cyclist, and a more favorable cycling environment might have prevented severe dehydration."
1180	7160	3	2	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in multiple ways. They disrupt the cyclist's ride on the road by dictating where they can and cannot go, as indicated by signs like ""no entering"" or ""one way."" Additionally, they limit the cyclist's speed. If the setting features specify a speed limit of @NUM1, the cyclist can only ride at approximately that speed, which means it takes longer to reach their destination and they cannot travel faster. Moreover, these features can make the actual distance traveled longer than the original travel plan, as seen with signs like ""Rough road ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit."" In conclusion, the features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist during their journey."
1181	7161	3	2	The setting's features have an impact on the cyclist as they either cast doubt on or reduce his survival chances. However, the cyclist's determination enables him to survive.
1182	7162	3	2	"In the essay, the setting's features influence the cyclist. One such feature is the lack of water. As stated, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" This shortage made the cyclist extremely desperate, particularly when he reached the Welch's grape juice factory. The building, abandoned years ago, was once a Welch's grape juice factory and bottling plant. After arriving at the abandoned factory, his desperation was succeeded by disappointment and a vague sense of hopelessness, as indicated by the phrase ""I hung my head."" These are among the setting features that affect the cyclist."
1183	7163	3	2	The boy is not faring well due to several reasons: lack of water, rough terrain, and unreliable information. The lack of water causes dehydration, and he has to ration it carefully as he could die from heat exhaustion. The rough terrain poses a risk of falling and getting injured with no one around to assist. Moreover, he relied on information from elderly people who were ill - informed. These examples from the essay support my analysis.
1184	7164	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's story, a cyclist takes on the challenge of cycling through California's scorching deserts in June. Initially, the cyclist was confident, then determined, and later felt relief. The setting had both physical and mental effects on the cyclist. It was unwise to listen to the old men, risky to embark on the journey without being sure of having enough water, and foolish to travel through the desert in June. The cyclist also started to doubt himself, which was not conducive to the success of the trip. When he reached a fish camp, an old man, even older than those who gave him false information, claimed to know the way to Yosemite. Fortunately, the young cyclist did the right thing and said he already knew the route. Spending hours in the desert heat is simply unhealthy.
1185	7165	3	2	"When cycling, a cyclist is affected by numerous factors, many of which are related to the setting. The terrain is one such setting feature. If the terrain is rough, it becomes more challenging for the cyclist to control the bike, especially for non - professional riders. For instance, in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit"" on page @NUM1, the author had difficulties on rougher roads, partly because of his level of experience. Another environmental aspect that can impact a cyclist is the climate. Most cyclists who know the sport well dress appropriately to maintain a comfortable body temperature. However, the weather can be unpredictable. A cyclist might suddenly encounter a heatwave or a drop in temperature."
1186	7166	3	2	The setting's features intensify the cyclist's desperate state. During the entire journey, the cyclist rides alone, with no people, cars, or buildings in sight. This isolation amplifies his desperation, as in the event of dehydration, there would be no one to assist him, potentially leading to his death. Moreover, he encounters things like the “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant,” which initially raises his hopes but soon dashes them. These incidents further exacerbate his desperation, as he lacks support and has nothing to rely on in this life - or - death situation.
1187	7167	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting significantly impacts the cyclist. As he rides about @NUM1 miles up the road, the changing terrain scares him. He states, “This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The more the surroundings change, the more frightened he becomes, and he drinks water to calm his nerves. After passing the “Do Not Pass” sign, he notes that “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM3), which further instills fear. Despite the road changes and his nearly depleted water supply, he has the courage to continue. Although the setting brings fear, he manages to persevere.
1188	7168	3	2	In the story, the cyclist runs out of water, and he remarks that it tasted like battery acid. The desolate surroundings, with no one in sight for miles, bring him despair. He is in a desert where the hot sun beats down, and all around are sand and cacti. Such a scene evokes thoughts of a lack of water and shade. The combination of running out of water and the harsh desert setting severely affects the cyclist, leaving him in a desperate state.
1189	7169	3	2	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting impacts the cyclist both physically and mentally. Physically, the lack of water in the setting weakens him. Mentally, the features of the setting have a profound effect. For instance, when he sees the abandoned Welch's factory and a picture of a boy “pour a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” he hangs his head as he rides on and starts thinking he will die there. In conclusion, the features of the setting have a detrimental impact on the cyclist, affecting his physical well - being and mental state.
1190	7170	3	2	I think the first photograph has a strong connection to the story “As Worry” because the author's son suffers a great deal. It shows what he and his friends look like in @MONTH1 and emphasizes their status as surfers through the surfboards. In contrast, the second photograph only has a slight relation as it simply depicts a surfer surfing. Overall, the first photograph is more accurate in representing the story compared to the second one.
1191	7171	3	2	While searching for Yosemite, the bicyclist encountered a desolate yet captivating landscape. At the start, he conversed with old men on a porch before setting off into a vast expanse of desert. As he rode, he passed a rickety shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't even contain the most docile mule. Tumbleweeds crossed his path, and a large snake, resembling a diamondback, blocked most of the pavement ahead. Tumbleweeds typically indicate a desert environment. Eventually, he spotted a grape juice factory and a bait store, where he finally found someone to provide directions.
1192	7172	3	2	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead,"" the cyclist is significantly influenced by the setting. Since the story takes place in a desert in June, the intense heat made the cyclist thirsty. The high temperatures also put him at risk of dehydration and heat - strokes. Moreover, the presence of wild animals such as snakes and lizards in the desert posed a threat of injury or poisoning, which could potentially lead to death. In conclusion, the desert setting in the story had multiple adverse effects on the cyclist."
1193	7173	3	2	In the work “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by @PERSON1, the cyclist endures hardships while cycling through the desert. The desert setting, lacking vegetation, meant there was no available water, causing the cyclist to become dehydrated. The towns he passed through were devoid of living organisms and people, so he couldn't quench his thirst there either. In one town, there was a spigot, but the water was unappealing and hadn't been pumped for a long time. He then reached an abandoned Welch's juice factory and thought his situation was hopeless. However, he finally found a shop with bathrooms, where he drank water from the sink and felt relieved. Additionally, the rocky roads were challenging as he had very little water left, and cycling on rocky terrain requires more strength and endurance. Overall, the desert setting and its features significantly affected the cyclist's journey.
1194	7174	3	2	In the passage “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the desert's features had no positive impact on the cyclist. The desert had “rolling hills.” According to the laws of gravity, cycling over hills consumes more energy. As the cyclist climbed the hills, he exhausted so much energy that he could only “feel sorry” for himself. The more hills he encountered, the more energy he lost and the more tired he became. The desert was also hot and dry, as it was the “deserts of California in June,” which made the cyclist thirsty. When he stopped for water, a “tarlike substance” came out. Later, when he stopped again, the water was “cool” and presumably refreshing. In summary, cycling in the hilly, dry, and hot desert left the cyclist tired and thirsty.
1195	7175	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist through various obstacles. An obstacle is an object that impedes one's progress towards a destination. In the story “@CAPS1 Road Ahead @CAPS2 Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist encounters several obstacles such as hills, forks in the road, and rough roads. For instance, a large highway sign suddenly appeared, warning “Rough road.” These obstacles in the setting make the cyclist's journey more challenging and arduous.
1196	7176	3	2	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the setting significantly influences the cyclist's riding. The setting is a desolate area with no water in sight, and the cyclist can only see roads stretching out. This impacts the cyclist as he is hungry and thirsty. Moreover, he is about to descend a very steep hill, fearing a crash and serious injury with no one around to offer assistance. In this story, the desolate setting clearly affects the cyclist's experience and actions.
1197	7177	3	2	The story's features indicate that it is set in a very dry and sparsely - populated area. It describes rolling hills in a California desert, emphasizing the dryness. These factors likely dehydrated the cyclist. Cycling up and down hills is extremely tiring, especially when one has limited water and must conserve it. The quote “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” provides valuable insights. Cycling in a California desert in June, during summer, is both a very brave and foolish decision as it is twice as hot during this season. Overall, the harsh desert setting in summer had a major impact on the cyclist's well - being.
1198	7178	3	2	The setting features affect the cyclist due to the lack of reliable directions from the old - timers. As the text states, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in the office.” This implies that the cyclist did not receive good directions. The roads may have changed over time, and the old - timers, who have been sitting on their porches constantly, are unaware of these changes. Therefore, the setting, in terms of the unhelpful advice from the old - timers, has a negative impact on the cyclist's journey.
1199	7179	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a gentleman is riding a bike to Yosemite but doesn't know the exact route. He stops and asks some old folks for directions. He remarks, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” suggesting that these old - timers are not familiar with the current road conditions. After leaving the old folks, he continues his long and hot journey. As he progresses, he starts to run out of water and begins to panic. Then, he comes across a sign that says “Rough.” His journey is fraught with difficulties due to the lack of proper directions and the harsh conditions.
1200	7180	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. The extreme heat causes the cyclist to drink water continuously and sweat profusely, leading to severe dehydration and fatigue. Additionally, the sense of insecurity in the area adds to his distress. For instance, he spots a ridiculously large snake, and the temperature keeps rising. All these factors combined make the cyclist's experience extremely challenging and physically and mentally draining.
1201	7181	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting's features significantly impacted the cyclist both physically and mentally. The cyclist's journey in California presented a challenging environment. The sweltering heat and lack of water took a physical toll, leaving him fatigued and frustrated. Mentally, the changing landscape from flat roads to hilly terrain tested his resolve. As he pedaled on, seeing no buildings for miles, his determination and hope began to wane. He started to doubt his decision to listen to the men. However, upon spotting the sign “Gary and @CAPS1 Fish Camp,” his hope was rekindled, and his frustration subsided. Overall, the setting's features initially cast doubt and frustration on the cyclist but ultimately led to a more hopeful and satisfied state.
1202	7182	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. The text indicates that “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind,” which made the cyclist feel insecure and upset. Another description, “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me,” shows the cyclist's frustration with the poor - quality water from the pumps. This situation also likely sparked fear as the cyclist was running out of water. The water's taste, like “battery acid,” made him terrified that he wouldn't last long. In conclusion, the setting's features affected the cyclist in multiple ways, including feelings of insecurity, frustration, and fear.
1203	7183	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” numerous features of the setting complicate the cyclist's journey. The rusty water pump, highway sign, and abandoned juice factory all add to the difficulty. When the author comes across a “ramshackle shed” surrounded by “several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule,” he is eager to check the pump for water. However, finding the bitter - tasting water undrinkable, his hope diminishes, as if the sun were taunting him. Next, he passes a large road sign reading “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” Initially feeling hopeless, he then turns his angst into determination. He remarks that “sometimes life can be so cruel” upon noticing the @NUM1 speed limit but continues pedaling. Finally, seeing a lone building in the distance, he discovers it's an abandoned grape juice factory, his last hope for water. He reflects on the irony of his situation, saying it “should please all sadists.” In summary, the setting's features highlight the negativity of his situation, which ultimately drives him to keep pedaling.
1204	7184	3	2	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” the setting's features affect the cyclist in various ways. The high temperature is a major factor. With the heat outside, his water couldn't stay cool, and since cool, refreshing water is essential for hydration, this posed a problem. When he reached a fork in the road, he was confused as to which way to go. The sight of a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold the lamest mule was troubling. Moreover, the water pump wasn't functioning well. He got on his hands and knees to pump, but the water remained warm and tasted like battery acid. These aspects of the setting significantly influenced the cyclist during his journey.
1205	7185	3	2	The setting's features have several negative impacts on the cyclist. The rolling hills create a strenuous pedaling experience. The statements “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” and “One long crippling hill” illustrate how the changing terrain made the journey more difficult. The desert environment with high temperatures led to the cyclist's dehydration. Phrases like “Trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state” and “I could drop from heatstroke” convey the extreme heat he endured. The sight of the old abandoned factory also affected the cyclist. Seeing a boy with a refreshing glass of juice made him lose hope and doubt his survival. “I hung my head” and “abandoned factory of juices and dreams” show his despair. In conclusion, all these features of the setting had detrimental effects on the cyclist.
1206	7186	3	2	The setting in which the cyclist was biking had a significant impact on him, weakening his physical state. By choosing the longer route, he spent an extended period in the desert. The extreme heat in this environment led to severe dehydration. The cyclist's own words, “...but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst...”, clearly indicate his desperate state of thirst. If he was willing to put dirty stones in his mouth to alleviate the feeling of thirst, it shows the high level of dehydration he was experiencing. Another factor that contributed to his dehydration was the challenging terrain towards the end of his journey. The rough ground forced him to exert more energy, causing him to sweat profusely and become even more dehydrated. This incident demonstrates how the features of one's environment can have a profound and sometimes detrimental effect on an individual.
1207	7187	3	2	The setting presents multiple challenges for the cyclist. It is a hot day in June, as the cyclist remarks, “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The intense heat is getting to the cyclist, making him fear heat - stroke. The terrain is also unfavorable for cycling on this hot day. The flat road gives way to short, rolling hills, as described: “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The cyclist is already tired, and the hills exacerbate his exhaustion. Moreover, his water supply is dwindling rapidly, with only “a few tantalizing sips” left in the water bottles, and there is no nearby source to replenish it. These aspects of the setting, including the extreme heat, rough terrain, and limited water, all work against the cyclist, highlighting how an unfavorable setting can impede one's progress.
1208	7188	3	2	As stated in the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting have a substantial impact on the cyclist. Firstly, the mountains in the setting contribute to the cyclist's fatigue. With no water, going up and down the hills wears him out quickly and accelerates his dehydration. Secondly, the encounter with a snake adds to the cyclist's distress. The fear caused by the snake further exacerbates his already - deteriorating physical state due to dehydration. Thirdly, the Welch's Grape Juice Factory in the setting makes the cyclist even more aware of his thirst. The sight of the factory intensifies his thoughts about dehydration. In conclusion, the various features of the setting in this essay significantly affect the cyclist's physical and mental well - being.
1209	7189	3	2	The features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist. In the story, the character describes the weather as being extremely unpleasant. For instance, when he says, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt,” it vividly portrays the harsh conditions. This description allows the reader to almost feel as if they are in the story, experiencing what the cyclist is going through. The detailed account of the setting effectively conveys how the environment can directly affect the cyclist, highlighting the importance of setting in depicting the character's situation.
1210	7190	3	2	The features of the setting pose numerous difficulties for the cyclist on his journey to “@CAPS1 National Park.” He takes advice from some old men and decides to take a shortcut. Along the way, he stops at a so - called “town,” which he perceives as a ghost town. Then he reaches a Welch's Grape Juice Factory, but it has been abandoned for years. As a result, he starts to feel weak and dehydrated, fearing a heat - stroke. Finally, at the end of his ride, he arrives at a fish camp where he finds water. A man at the camp asks him about his destination, and the cyclist replies. When the man asks if he knows the best way to get there, the cyclist, having had a rough journey following the advice of old men, confidently says, “yes, sir: I own a very good map.” Through this experience, the cyclist realizes that he will no longer accept advice from old - timers, showing how the setting and the events during his journey have shaped his future decision - making.
1211	7191	3	2	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting had an impact on the cyclist's sense of direction. The cyclist was initially aware of his destination and the route to get there. However, some old men provided him with what they claimed was a “shortcut.” This advice disrupted his own sense of direction as it was based on outdated knowledge from individuals who had not left their porches since Carter was in office. This is how the setting affected the cyclist in the essay.
1212	7192	3	2	The features of the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist. A peaceful and calm setting is more motivating than one filled with a lot of distractions. This shows that the nature of the setting can greatly influence the cyclist's state of mind and performance. In conclusion, the setting plays an important role in how the cyclist is affected.
1213	7193	3	2	Steep mountains, rolling roads, and jagged rocks are factors that affect the setting for the cyclist. The cyclist needs to be aware of the current situation and what might happen. For example, the warning “Rough Rough: Do not exceed posted speed limit” indicates the nature of the setting. This setting leads to numerous changes. Clearly, the setting reveals a great deal and also describes how the cyclist might react to it. Throughout the story, the settings do have an impact on the cyclist.
1214	7194	3	2	I believe that the features of the setting affect the cyclist. In the story, the old guys remember things as they used to be, but as the book states, the world is a fluid place where things change constantly. For the cyclist to find his way, he had to piece together the information given by the old guys. This shows that the setting, through the perspectives of these old - timers, influences the cyclist's journey.
1215	7195	3	2	The features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist. For instance, it wouldn't make sense to have a setting where it's raining, as the cyclist wouldn't be likely to ride the bike in such conditions. Also, it wouldn't be appropriate to set the scene in a city when the area is surrounded only by trees and rivers. These examples illustrate how the setting must be suitable for the cyclist's activity. In conclusion, the features of the setting are crucial in determining the cyclist's experience.
1216	7196	3	2	The features of the setting significantly impact the cyclist as he encounters numerous challenges on his journey. For instance, the flat roads are replaced by short, rolling hills, which pose difficulties. Additionally, a posted sign restricts him from riding in a certain way and forces him to follow a different route, leaving him disappointed. Moreover, a large snake blocks most of the pavement in front of him. As a result, he becomes dehydrated and starts to feel sad and hopeless. However, he still retains some energy to persevere.
1217	7197	3	2	The setting in which the cyclist is biking has several features that have a substantial impact on him. The desert he is traversing in June is extremely hot, and this heat can easily lead to dehydration, especially when a person is exercising for an extended period and running out of water. In addition to the heat, the changing terrain and road surface also affect the cyclist. Traveling on a flat road requires less effort compared to climbing hills, and if the road is rough, the biker has to exert even more energy to push the bike up the hill and also maintain balance on the uneven surface. Furthermore, the lack of buildings in sight adds to the cyclist's distress. When dehydrated and without water, the cyclist becomes desperate to find a water source. But with no visible landmarks or buildings nearby, the cyclist starts to lose hope, which in turn reduces their motivation and strength. Despite all these negative factors, it is remarkable that the cyclist managed to push through and reach a water source.
1218	7198	3	2	In the short story “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting troubles the cyclist. The description “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the tamest mule greeted me” makes the cyclist feel that he is in the middle of nowhere. Also, the quote “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” shows that the cyclist is troubled by having to navigate over the hills. Clearly, the setting has a significant influence on the cyclist.
1219	7199	3	2	In the essays, the features of the setting give the cyclist hope. The cyclist takes directions from a few old men on a porch. Initially, the directions seem incorrect, and the remains of a Grape Juice factory make it appear as though he will never find civilization. Despite these initial set - backs, the setting still holds the potential to offer hope to the cyclist as he continues his journey.
1220	7200	3	2	The features of the cyclist's surrounding setting have affected him to the point of exhaustion and dehydration. As the setting changes from flat to having many ups and downs, the cyclist, who is tired and thirsty, begins to feel the strain. The cyclist described this change by stating, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His idea here is that he faces new challenges when riding on the hills of this Californian desert roller - coaster. The heat causes his water supply to dwindle, and the hills tire him unreasonably. All the cyclist can hope for now is to get a water refill and the relief of the shade from a puffy cloud.
1221	7201	3	2	The setting had a severe impact on the cyclist. Biking in the desert with outdated directions almost cost him his life. Along the way, he encountered several dilapidated factories and towns, which added to his distress. Fortunately, he came across a last stop that saved him.
1222	7202	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the cyclist is influenced by his surroundings. The man starts his journey at a reservoir campground, full of confidence and eager to continue his adventure. As the day progresses, all he can find are abandoned buildings. With his water supply running low, he stumbles upon “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps” and no signs of life. He realizes that his trip will be arduous. The environment and the risk of death give him the determination to press on. Despite the fear of dying from dehydration, he knows that traveling through the high deserts of California in June leaves him with only one chance of survival: to keep going. It is his awareness of the surroundings that drives him to keep biking until he reaches the fish camp. Had he not been so observant, he might have given up, as failing to reach “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite” would be too devastating.
1223	7203	3	2	The setting impacts the rider in multiple ways. The intense heat makes him extremely thirsty. The long stretch of the road affects his mental state. And the sight of [unclear object in original] influences his morale. All these factors combined make the ride a challenging experience for the rider.
1224	7204	3	2	The features of the setting significantly influence the cyclist's mood towards the ride. In the essay “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, it is stated that “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon”. The cyclist had to do this because they were struggling to ride due to thirst and the monotony of the journey. This made the ride seem longer and more difficult. Additionally, the description “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps” affected the cyclist. After seeing this and realizing he couldn't drink the water, his thirst increased as his water supply was running out. However, when the cyclist spots the Welch's grape juice factory, he becomes determined to reach it. In conclusion, in Joe Kurmaskie's “Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist's mood towards the ride is strongly affected by the setting's features.
1225	7205	3	2	The setting affected the cyclist in numerous ways. Pedaling uphill was a strenuous task for him. The sweltering summer day took a toll on his body, and he started to get dehydrated as he had very little water left. He struggled to maintain his balance in his dehydrated state and felt like giving up. But despite these difficulties, the cyclist persevered, driven by the hope of reaching his destination.
1226	7206	3	2	The setting features had a significant impact on the cyclist, presenting several conflicts. The intense heat was a major issue. As the cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June, and considering that California is known as “the sunshine state,” it can be inferred that it was extremely hot. With a limited supply of water, the heat-induced thirst became a pressing problem. Moreover, when the cyclist thought he could obtain water, it turned out to be hot and tasted like battery acid, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM2. Additionally, the cyclist being lost added to the difficulties. He needed to reach a certain destination but was unable to get more water due to his disorientation. In conclusion, these features of the setting, namely the heat and the state of being lost, had a profound and adverse effect on the cyclist.
1227	7207	3	2	The features of the setting presented conflicts for the cyclist. The high temperature was a significant problem. Since he had a limited amount of water and was lost, he couldn't replenish his supply. The heat made him thirsty, but his restricted water access made it difficult to quench his thirst. Another conflict was his being lost. He had a place to be, but his disorientation hindered his progress. In summary, the heat and the state of being lost due to the setting features created challenging conflicts for the cyclist.
1228	7208	3	2	The setting features had a notable impact on the cyclist. He cycled through the sweltering desert of California, covering over @NUM1 miles on his bike to reach Yosemite. During the journey, he nearly ran out of water. However, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite served as an incentive that kept him going. In conclusion, the challenging setting on the way to Yosemite, along with the appealing destination, influenced the cyclist's experience and motivation.
1229	7209	3	2	Throughout the essay, the setting affects the cyclist in multiple ways. When he first takes the “shortcut” suggested by the old men, he is confident. Upon reaching the first town, which resembles a ghost - town, he doesn't lose his nerve and continues his journey with assurance. As he reaches the second stop, his water shortage starts to take a toll. The description “I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water with all my strength” shows his determination and desperate need for water. When passing another water - less place, he puts stones in his mouth, having heard it helps distract from thirst. After almost losing hope in the hot @CAPS1 desert without water, he finds a new drive when he spots a store with water. Despite the harsh and hot setting, it inspired him to persevere through tough times and survive. In conclusion, the setting, though challenging, played a role in building the cyclist's resilience.
1230	7210	3	2	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist was significantly affected by the setting. The area was devoid of buildings and people, meaning there was no possibility of getting help. In such a situation, the cyclist could die without anyone being aware. The setting also seemed dry, with desert - like conditions. Without water, the cyclist was at risk of dehydration and heatstroke. The high temperature not only caused physical dehydration but also made the cyclist mentally consider the threat of a heatstroke. In conclusion, the desolate, dry, and hot setting had a detrimental impact on the cyclist's well - being and safety.
1231	7211	3	2	The setting's features significantly influenced the cyclist. Throughout his journey, the heat, animals, and terrain all contributed to slowing him down. The heat had this effect as the cyclist lacked sufficient water to maintain normal bodily function. Additionally, he had to be cautious around animals to avoid being bitten, which also caused delays. The hills were another challenge; climbing them required a great deal of energy, and the cyclist reported that he couldn't see much in the distance. In conclusion, these aspects of the setting had a notable impact on the cyclist's progress.
1232	7212	3	2	In the story “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the arid, bare, and rough desert terrain affected the cyclist during his journey to Yosemite. His expedition faced numerous obstacles. The dry climate was a major issue. As Kurmaskie stated, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” highlighting the hot and arid conditions that reduced his intended travel rate. With few towns in the desert and those he encountered being abandoned, like the one described with “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule,” he had no proper rest - stops. Moreover, the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. After cycling for hours in the hot desert with limited water, the rough terrain further exhausted him and reduced his travel rate. In conclusion, the dry, bland, and hilly desert terrain negatively affected the cyclist's journey to Yosemite.
1233	7213	3	2	I firmly believe that the setting of an area can have a profound impact on the mind in certain situations. In the reading, the man is cycling, nearly out of water, and sees no houses or people for as far as he can see. This situation is terrifying and evokes a sense of helplessness. However, if he were in @LOCATION1, where he'd pass cars, people on the street, and could get water at buildings along his ride, and the temperature was cold so he'd drink less and go further, his mood would be calmer. Clearly, the setting plays a crucial role in influencing one's mental state.
1234	7214	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limits” by @PERSON1, the setting has a significant impact. When you can't see anything for miles and are running out of water, it has a psychological effect. Just like the protagonist, who panicked when he stopped at an old house and only battery acid came out of the pump. Not knowing exactly where you are also adds to the confusion, as you're unsure whether to go forward, turn back, or what to do. If I were in that person's shoes, the surrounding features would greatly affect me. In conclusion, the setting in this story creates a sense of distress and uncertainty for the character.
1235	7215	3	2	The setting's features affected the cyclist in multiple ways. At the start of the essay, the cyclist was happy about taking a shortcut, thinking it would save hours on the ride to Yosemite National Park, as she said, “I followed their device and launched out at first light along a ‘shortcut’ that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.” She seemed confident, checking her water supply and moving on. However, when she entered the first town, the sight was troubling. Struggling to get water from a rusted pump, she began to worry as she was running out of water and the next town was “only eighteen miles down the road.” With only a few sips of water left in her bottles, she reached a desperate state. Seeing a closed building made her more upset, and she started to expect the worst. Then, she came across “Gary and Wilbers fish camp,” where she drank cool water and decided to use her own map instead of relying on the old guys'. In conclusion, the setting transformed the cyclist's mood from optimism to despair and then to a more self - reliant state.
1236	7216	3	2	The setting's features had numerous impacts on the cyclist. One significant factor was the scarcity of water. This led to the cyclist becoming dehydrated, impairing their cognitive function and reducing their energy levels. As an example, the cyclist stated, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” Another crucial feature was the heat. The high temperatures made the cyclist both thirsty and sweaty. For instance, the cyclist mentioned, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage…” Additionally, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Overall, the features of the setting had a substantial and multi - faceted impact on the cyclist.
1237	7217	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the setting's features significantly affected the cyclist. The desert terrain, with its intense heat and lack of shade - providing trees, made the cyclist extremely hot and thirsty. As a result, the cyclist drank more water than normal. However, this increased water consumption led to a shortage of water, forcing the cyclist to conserve it and eventually causing dehydration. The fact that all the towns passed through were ghost towns without fresh running water further disappointed the cyclist and exacerbated their dehydration. Just when hope was dwindling, the cyclist found a small bait shop. There, they took shelter in the shade and finally got water to drink. This discovery gave the cyclist the strength and mental boost needed to continue their journey to Yosemite National Park.
1238	7218	3	2	The features of the setting made the cyclist's journey more arduous and time - consuming. The remote location was a hindrance as the local people were likely as old as the cyclist's grandparents, and the directions were poor. There were no new shops or resting areas. The water pump the cyclist found was old and unhygienic, and the only building in sight was abandoned. The rough terrain also took a toll. The cyclist was already fatigued due to lack of water and tiredness, and the long, bumpy terrain made the situation worse. Moreover, cycling in California on a hot summer day, especially on a bike without certain amenities (which is common for most bikes), did not help. These factors combined to have a significant impact on the cyclist's journey.
1239	7219	3	2	The features of the setting have a direct impact on the cyclist. As the terrain becomes rougher, the cyclist has to exert more effort. For example, when the terrain changes to hills, the cyclist struggles to climb them, expending more energy. In contrast, a flat and smooth terrain presents fewer challenges during the long journey. When the cyclist faces less strain, they are less tired and consume less water. In summary, the features of the setting, particularly the terrain, have a notable influence on the cyclist's experience during the journey.
1240	7220	3	2	While riding, he has no idea what he will face on the road. Something bad could happen to his bike, like an issue with one of the wheels. He might even fall off the bike. He could become so exhausted that he is unable to continue and may decide to give up. In conclusion, the uncertainties and potential difficulties on the road pose a real threat to his ability to complete the ride.
1241	7221	3	2	The setting significantly impacts the cyclist. When there is no surrounding infrastructure or people, the cyclist can enjoy a comfortable ride in an ideal state. The pleasant and cool environment, without cars, allows the cyclist to ride along with just the beautiful sky. In contrast, when there is infrastructure, the cyclist has to be vigilant about people, cars, and follow street - signs. Thus, the features of the setting clearly affect the cyclist.
1242	7222	3	2	"In the cyclist's adventures, the setting not only shapes the character but also influences his perseverance. Even when feeling helpless, the setting drives him not to give up. For example, the cyclist stated, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June."" This harsh setting causes physical problems as his body requires water, yet he has limited supplies and doesn't use it efficiently. These issues lead to dehydration. Mentally, the fear of dying without water can make him panic and lose self - control. In conclusion, the setting has a profound impact on the cyclist both physically and mentally."
1243	7223	3	2	The features of the setting had an impact on the cyclist. The specific features of the setting likely presented various challenges or opportunities for the cyclist. For instance, the terrain, weather, or presence of other elements could have influenced the cyclist's journey, speed, and overall experience. In conclusion, the setting's features played a role in how the cyclist's ride unfolded.
1244	7224	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed Limit"", the features of the setting often disappoint the narrator. Evidence of this disappointment is seen when the narrator arrives in towns and cannot obtain water. As the text describes, ""I got down on my hands & knees working the handle of the rusty water pump a for like substance oozed out followed by @NUM1 degree brackish water that tasted like battery acid."" The narrator is also disappointed when observing the terrain to be crossed, as indicated by the statement ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridicuously large snake."" Moreover, the narrator regrets following the elder's directions instead of using the map. Overall, Kurmaskie effectively portrays the narrator's disappointment with the setting."
1245	7225	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The route the cyclist is taking has a rough road, which poses challenges. The cyclist also receives bad advice from some old men who haven't left their porches for decades. As the long journey progresses, the cyclist realizes that the advice is bad. The cyclist is headed to Yosemite, and the poor advice might have led him astray. In conclusion, the features of the setting, along with the bad advice, have a negative impact on the cyclist's journey.
1246	7226	3	2	At the beginning of the cyclist's journey, he was in good condition, with an ample supply of water. As he continued, he somewhat veered off course and entered the desert region. The heat took its toll on him, and his water supply started to dwindle, leading to dehydration. Moreover, the sight of tumbleweeds and the lack of vegetation likely worsened his mental state, as he might have thought he would never escape. However, when he spotted the fish bait shop, he was probably relieved, knowing that he was going to be saved.
1247	7227	3	2	A cyclist can be affected in multiple ways, and one of them is the setting. The setting has an impact because a short and smooth setting makes the ride effortless. Conversely, long, bumpy, and rough roads make it more difficult to control the bike, thus making the cyclist's task more challenging. This is how the setting affects a cyclist.
1248	7228	3	2	On his way to @ORGANIZATION1 park, the cyclist encountered difficult settings. First, he came across a ghost town. Then, as he passed by tumbleweeds and a large snake, he started to run out of water. With no more water and rough roads ahead, he stumbled upon a juice factory, but it was deserted. Not knowing how long it would be until he reached another town, it's clear that the features of the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist.
1249	7229	3	2	"In my view, the features of the setting had a severely negative impact on the cyclist. The old men advised that he would pass through several towns on the route they recommended. However, every town he reached was deserted. As described, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" Due to the deserted towns, his water supply diminished as there were no places to replenish it. He became dehydrated but still pushed on to find fresh water, saying, ""Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" He even considered sucking on pebbles to slow down dehydration but feared choking. The desolate and hot desert setting also filled him with negative thoughts like, ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" If he hadn't run out of water, the impact of the setting wouldn't have been as severe. But the lack of water exacerbated the negative effects."
1250	7230	3	2	I believe the features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist. Firstly, he ran out of water, which put him at risk of dehydration. Searching for water also slowed him down. Secondly, the man gave him the wrong directions, causing him to get lost and confused. These are the ways in which the setting affected the cyclist.
1251	7231	3	2	"It is often stated that ""experience can serve as a worthy substitute for instinct."" This implies that an individual who knows how to navigate their environment can survive even without the innate animal instincts associated with it. Nevertheless, even the most experienced person can be overpowered by the extreme weather conditions of their surroundings. In Joe Kurmaskie's essay ""Rough Road Ahead,"" an experienced cyclist decides to embark on a long, arduous, and perilous journey. His ride will take him along the long desert paths of California with a limited water supply, which is a crucial element in the story. Due to his decision to follow the advice of some old men, he went without water for most of his trip. With continuous exercise, extreme heat, and lack of water, he quickly suffered from dehydration. As the cyclist was aware, a common side - effect of dehydration is hallucination. The essay mentions, ""I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage,"" which demonstrates his knowledge and experience in such situations and shows that he had adapted to his environment through experience. A similar story is Jack London's ""To Build a Fire,"" where a man is also pitted against the extremes of nature, and the elements ultimately overcome him. Both stories depict man's pursuit of adventure and the constant struggle for survival that people face."
1252	7232	3	2	The features of a setting can significantly impact a cyclist's energy. When the setting includes hilly terrain, it can exhaust the cyclist. In such a situation, the cyclist has to exert more effort to pedal uphill, which drains their energy reserves. As a result, the cyclist may find it difficult to maintain a consistent speed or power output. In conclusion, the hilly nature of the setting can have a detrimental effect on the cyclist's energy levels and performance.
1253	7233	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist, primarily by pushing him into a dehydrated state. This dehydration makes it impossible for the cyclist to operate at peak efficiency. The setting effectively deprives the cyclist of the limited energy he initially had. The harsh conditions, such as heat and lack of water, contribute to the rapid depletion of his energy. In conclusion, the setting's features play a crucial role in sapping the cyclist's energy and hindering his performance.
1254	7234	3	2	"The setting has a powerful influence on the cyclist. The combination of the desert environment, intense heat, and lack of water leads to the cyclist becoming dehydrated. The rolling hills and rough terrain further tire him out. In the story, it is stated that ""and growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June."" This statement clearly shows that the heat and difficult terrain could cause the cyclist to overheat and potentially suffer from heat stroke. In conclusion, the setting creates a challenging situation for the cyclist, putting his health and well - being at risk."
1255	7235	3	2	"The temperature of the area through which the cyclist was riding had a significant impact on him. The high temperature made the cyclist sweat profusely. As a result, he became increasingly thirsty and eventually ran out of water. For instance, in the text, he remarks that ""the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips,"" and later, it is said that ""I could drop from a heat stroke."" This indicates that the cyclist was acutely aware of the negative effects of the temperature on his body. In conclusion, the high temperature had a detrimental impact on the cyclist, potentially endangering his health."
1256	7236	3	2	"The setting's features, namely the harsh and hot climate along with the terrain, significantly affected the cyclist. The author vividly described how ""the sun was beating down on him"" and how he nearly perished from dehydration. These environmental factors clearly had a substantial impact on the cyclist's experience."
1257	7237	3	2	The features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist. When the road is rough, one must have a suitable bike. In case of a flat tire, it is essential to be vigilant for dangerous and poisonous things. In the event of a serious accident, cyclists should be prepared in case they are not found in time. They also need to understand the nature of the nights. For example, if it gets extremely cold at night, they must keep themselves warm. Overall, being aware of and prepared for the setting's features is crucial for cyclists.
1258	7238	3	2	"The desert and hills had a profound effect on the cyclist. In June, the desert was likely extremely hot, and ascending those hills would have been arduous. The road was very rough, as indicated by the sign ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" The cyclist mentioned traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Due to the hot weather, the cyclist was extremely thirsty. Clearly, the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist's journey."
1259	7239	3	2	"The cyclist's condition was severely influenced by the setting as he was lost in the high deserts of California in June. The intense heat either incapacitated him or led him on a search for Yosemite. He got lost and ran out of water, worsening his situation. Being lost in the middle of nowhere in the scorching heat, he became exhausted, dehydrated, and feared heat - stroke and loss of consciousness. This is evident from the statements in the essay such as ""the growing realization that could drop from heatstroke"" and ""It looked like i was going to lose concisness for the last time."" The setting clearly took a heavy toll on the cyclist."
1260	7240	3	2	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting posed a life - threatening danger to the cyclist. On a hot day, the cyclist was on his way to Yosemite National Park. He cycled for miles, passing by deserted towns described as ""This place might have been a thriving little spot...a ghost town."" The terrain was challenging; after about twenty - two miles, he had to conquer ""short rolling hills,"" which consumed more energy and increased his thirst. With no water and the hot weather, his situation was dire. After a grueling journey, he summoned all his strength to reach a local bait shop and drank from the sink. The combination of lack of water and the difficult terrain in the story's setting was life - threatening and almost cost the cyclist his life."
1261	7241	3	2	The elements of the setting have a teasing impact on the cyclist. Initially, the rippling streams mocked his thirst. Subsequently, the old faucet appeared, and finally, the Welch's grape factory came into view. The streams at the start merely incited his thirst. Then, the faucet made him aware of his dehydration. Ultimately, the abandoned Welch's grape - juice factory nearly made him lose hope. The setting was clearly influencing his mood, and it was evident that these environmental factors were taking a toll on his mental state.
1262	7242	3	2	In the story, the setting's features significantly affect the cyclist. The text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. I could drop from a heatstroke.” This indicates that water was scarce in the area where the cyclist was riding. He expressed his fear of dying without water. Additionally, the area was deserted, with no buildings in sight, and was filled with hills and roads. The story mentions, “the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This shows that the cyclist was mostly alone and had no one to turn to. Overall, the setting created a challenging and isolating situation for the cyclist.
1263	7243	3	2	In this story, the setting's features have a profound impact on the cyclist. Some aspects suggest that the “journey” to Yosemite National Park was both dreadful and enjoyable. The statement “I would come to along this breeze jaunt” with the word “breezy” implies that the cyclist could relish the bike - ride due to the breeze. Another characteristic of the setting is its dilapidation and dirtiness. The water the cyclist drank made his mouth drier. The description “A tar - like substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling” reveals the water's uncleanliness. Moreover, the setting shows that the cyclist had to exert all his efforts to survive, as seen in “working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength.” These features highlight the cyclist's sacrifice and bravery.
1264	7244	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting has a major influence on the cyclist. The dry conditions around the cyclist made her consume a large amount of water. The line “I was traveling the high deserts of California in June” suggests that she was likely hot, sweaty, and far from a water source. The rough terrain made her rely on her own strength to navigate hills and deal with plants and animals. The story's setting led to her becoming dehydrated and weak. She had to continue with a low water supply and avoid numerous hazards in an area with no sign of living people. The quote “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time say, before the last world was” implies a ghost town. With no one around to help, the setting caused a decline in her health. Her physical health was at risk due to dehydration and lack of energy, and her mental state was also deteriorating, as she had to shake her head to confirm what she was seeing at one point. In conclusion, the setting had a severely negative impact on the cyclist's well - being.
1265	7245	3	2	The setting's features have an impact on the cyclist. The man had limited water and was traveling through the California deserts in June. Also, the flat road transformed into rolling hills, and there was a sign that read “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” with a speed limit of @NUM1. Moreover, it's advisable not to heed the advice of an old gentleman who hasn't left his porch in decades. These factors all contribute to how the setting affects the cyclist, creating a challenging and potentially dangerous situation for him.
1266	7246	3	2	The setting's features have an impact on the cyclist as they influence her physical condition. She requires water to stay alive, yet the next town is a considerable distance away. Without a break and in the sweltering heat, she might faint. As Kurmaskie stated, “When I tried a draper I was, it had the flavor of battery acid.” If she fails to find water soon, her condition will deteriorate. Additionally, the setting affects her determination. Once she realizes the need to reach a town, she exerts more effort. She said, “I would conserve my water go inward for an hour or so at least or my inner spirit.” She will do her utmost to make wise decisions and reach a town as quickly as possible. Knowing that her life is at risk without water, she works harder. However, the situation could become even more challenging.
1267	7247	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's “Rough Road Ahead,” during the cyclist's journey, the setting undergoes changes. Initially, the road is flat, as the cyclist remarks, “Flat road was replaced,” indicating that the road was smooth and even. As the cyclist continues riding, the land transforms, and “Flat road was replaced by, short rolling hills.” This change in terrain implies that the cyclist will face greater difficulties. In conclusion, the land changes significantly during the cyclist's journey, presenting new challenges.
1268	7248	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. The extreme heat makes the situation difficult for him. Seeking shortcuts, he takes advice from some old men. However, these so - called shortcuts turn out to be ineffective, leaving him angry. Moreover, he is running out of water and becoming dehydrated. He spots an abandoned place with water, but he has to pump it. After pumping for about @NUM1 to cool the water, it remains hot and tastes like battery acid. As he continues riding, he encounters a snake but manages to escape. Feeling on the verge of death, he regrets listening to the old men who haven't left their porch since @PERSON1 was president. What angers him more is their apparent certainty. Eventually, he sees a juice factory, which has now become a fishing store, and he drinks a large amount of water there. He firmly decides never to listen to old men again and will always rely on the map.
1269	7249	3	2	As the author embarks on her bike trip, the surrounding landscape becomes increasingly inhospitable. The first thing she comes across is a rusty pump and an old shed. When she attempts to get water from the pump, she finds the water extremely hot and it doesn't cool down. As she continues her journey, tumbleweeds that resemble “diamond - head snakes” cross her path. For a long time, she doesn't encounter any buildings. When she finally does, it is an abandoned building, suggesting that people left due to the harsh landscape. During her journey, she meets another elderly man but decides not to take his advice, having had a bad experience following the advice of the previous group of elderly men. In conclusion, the unwelcoming landscape and unhelpful advice from the elderly men make her bike trip a challenging one.
1270	7250	3	2	The features of the surrounding setting significantly affect the cyclist's performance. In the essay “Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the terrain is characterized by numerous hills that twist, rise, and descend. These features oppose the cyclist's energy. Additionally, the scarcity of people in towns makes it difficult for the cyclist to find a water supply, increasing the risk of dehydration. Moreover, the weather has a major influence. In the hot desert of California, the cyclist must stay well - hydrated to continue the bike ride. In conclusion, the terrain, lack of water sources, and hot weather all combine to pose challenges to the cyclist's performance.
1271	7251	3	2	The setting's features significantly impact the cyclist in multiple ways, namely heat, water scarcity, and hills. During his journey, he nearly succumbs to dehydration due to an inadequate water supply, and he remarks that the water tastes “like battery acid.” He then has to cycle another @NUM1 miles along the road to finally replenish himself.
1272	7253	3	2	In the story, the cyclist's ability to continue his journey is hampered by the features of the setting. He encounters numerous setbacks. First, he takes advice from an old man with outdated directions. Then, he attempts to keep going with a very limited water supply, which leads to dehydration and anger. He spots an old building, raising his hopes, only to find it closed and in a state of disrepair. Finally, he locates a store, rehydrates, and resumes his journey.
1273	7254	3	2	I believe that the features of the environment have an impact on the cyclist. When cycling, various factors come into play. These features can influence the cyclist's experience, such as the terrain, weather, and availability of resources. In conclusion, it is evident that these features play a significant role in how the cyclist navigates their journey.
1274	7255	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's story “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist embarks on a long - arduous journey affected by numerous factors and problems. At the start, the cyclist is self - confident, but after a short while, he feels miserable and learns a valuable lesson. The quote “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” shows that moving without water is extremely difficult for him. This indicates that he is not just thirsty but severely dehydrated, which is dangerous for a human. The cyclist also endures great hardship, resorting to tasting stones to alleviate his thirst. In the end, his difficult journey highlights the challenges he faced due to the adverse conditions.
1275	7256	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a cyclist on his journey to Yosemite faces a troublesome setting. He is led astray from the main road after taking misleading advice from a group of old individuals. The setting in the essay has a crucial impact on the cyclist. The author describes the day as “traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The intense heat causes the cyclist to become weary and dehydrated. Additionally, the flat road turns into short, rolling hills, making his journey even more difficult. This setting poses a major setback, forcing the cyclist to persevere. In my own life, I've faced similar obstacles, like when I was camping and a sudden storm changed the setting. Just like the cyclist, I and the other campers made the best of the situation. In both the essay and my experience, the setting had a great impact, and perseverance led to a sense of satisfaction at the end of the journey.
1276	7257	3	2	The setting's features impact the cyclist. The bumpy roads, the water on them, and the numerous curved roads all have an effect. The bumpy roads make the ride uncomfortable, the water on the roads can be a hazard, and the curved roads constantly slow down the cyclist's speed. In conclusion, these aspects of the setting significantly influence the cyclist's journey.
1277	7258	3	2	In the story, the features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist. The described rough terrain makes traveling difficult for the cyclist. Additionally, the hot weather and the absence of buildings and people around pose challenges. The cyclist runs out of water due to the heat and the lack of resources. Throughout the story, the cyclist perseveres and ultimately survives. In conclusion, the harsh setting tested the cyclist's endurance but he managed to overcome the difficulties.
1278	7259	3	2	The features of the setting have a negative impact on the cyclist. The surrounding environment is perceived negatively, which makes the cyclist feel that the task is more difficult and challenging than it actually is. For instance, with only sand and high temperatures around and no one in sight, everything seems harder. The cyclist also feels weak and unable to continue due to the lack of living beings. In contrast, if the cyclist were in a park with the sun shining and people around, their attitude would change and the task would seem easier. In conclusion, the setting greatly affects the cyclist's perception and ability to complete the task.
1279	7260	3	2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in multiple ways. The rough road made it difficult for him to control his bike. The hot weather made him thirsty and caused him to run out of water. Moreover, there were no buildings in sight where he could get something to drink. Additionally, he didn't know where he was going. These factors combined to have a significant impact on the cyclist. In conclusion, the challenging setting posed numerous obstacles for the cyclist.
1280	7261	3	2	The setting affects the cyclist in numerous grueling and harsh ways. Firstly, the lack of civilization creates an uneasy feeling and prevents the cyclist from refilling their water bottle. Secondly, the heat and uphill climbs take a toll on the cyclist's physical and mental strength. Thirdly, the cyclist's water bottle empties rapidly due to their thirst and the relentless heat. In paragraph four, the cyclist reaches the first “town”. This place might have been a bustling spot, but on that morning, it fit the traditional definition of a “ghost town”. When the cyclist came to a house with a rusty water pump, the brackish, near - boiling water that came out did not support the cyclist physically or mentally. In conclusion, the harsh setting continuously challenged the cyclist at every turn.
1281	7262	3	2	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the setting's features impact the cyclist in several ways. The desert's harsh conditions make the cyclist require a large amount of water resources. The heat and physical exertion from cycling lead to dehydration. This is clear from the story, as after the cyclist drinks all his water, he is so desperate that he attempts to drink from an old pump containing black sludge. Evidently, the setting's features have a significant effect on the cyclist."
1282	7263	3	2	"While attempting to reach Yosemite via a shortcut, the cyclist encountered numerous challenges and experienced a range of emotions. At the start of the journey, the cyclist was in high spirits, imagining the cool pines of Yosemite. He noted, ""The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it."" As he continued, his spirits and water supply dwindled. He encouraged himself, thinking, ""telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine."" Passing many abandoned factories, he tried various ways to ease his thirst, like sucking on stones, all the while slowly climbing in elevation and losing hope. When he found a deserted building, his hope further diminished. However, when he came across an open store with modern bathrooms, he felt ""an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1, kiss them, and buy some bait."" In the end, the cyclist promised himself to always rely on his map."
1283	7264	3	2	"In Kurmaskie's essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the cyclist endured difficult times while trying to reach Yosemite National Park. A cyclist is an individual who typically uses a bike to travel. Initially, the cyclist asked some old men for directions to Yosemite National Park. He knew it might be a mistake from the start, but he hoped they knew what they were talking about. During his journey, he came across a ""Ghost town"" where there was nothing in sight except a bike snake. The cyclist became dehydrated and was running out of water. Ultimately, the challenging journey highlighted the difficulties he faced in reaching his destination."
1284	7265	3	2	"The story's setting negatively impacts the cyclist. He trusted the directions given by the men he asked. With those directions in mind, he set off towards his destination. Along the way, he encountered deserted towns, abandoned factories, and hills. This was all part of the ""high deserts of California in June"". These conditions left the cyclist exhausted and dehydrated. He mentioned, ""I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst"", indicating his intense thirst. After finally finding a place to get a drink, he said, ""I had an overwhelming urge to seek out someone, kiss them, and buy some bait"", showing his great relief and gratitude at finding water."
1285	7266	3	2	The features of the setting in the story have an impact on the cyclist. The setting leads the cyclist to face certain challenges. He should not blindly accept travel advice. The lack of reliable advice and the nature of the setting contribute to the difficulties the cyclist experiences. Overall, the setting plays a crucial role in influencing the cyclist's journey.
1286	7267	3	2	Some features may vary in quantity, and cyclists may have more of certain features than others. The author also encountered numerous problems during the journey, such as a shortage of water, the presence of poisonous snakes, and poor road conditions. These factors significantly affected both the author and the cyclist throughout their trip.
1287	7268	3	2	In the passage “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” multiple elements of the setting influenced the cyclist. One such factor was the snake the cyclist encountered on the way. As the text states, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake,” and “I cased post, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This indicates that the snake affected the cyclist, compelling him to remain calm despite being dehydrated and facing its associated effects.
1288	7269	3	2	Several factors could have enhanced the enjoyment of his bicycle ride. Firstly, if he were not in a desolate area and knew his location, the experience would have been better. As described, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” Moreover, he had scarcely any water to sustain him throughout the day, as “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Additionally, his lack of knowledge about his destination made the journey more difficult. In conclusion, these elements contributed to the hardship of his trip.
1289	7270	3	2	The features of the setting impact the cyclist, causing him to become delusional and dehydrated. He had the illusion that a juice factory was operational when it was actually abandoned. The sight of rusty pipes further exacerbated his dehydration as he knew they could not yield water. These aspects of the setting had a detrimental effect on the cyclist's physical and mental state during his journey.
1290	7271	3	2	In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the story's settings have a profound impact on the cyclist. They lead him to believe he will die and make him constantly worried. The cyclist follows the advice of two old men on the best route to Yosemite Mountain and ends up in the middle of nowhere. He finds himself in the California desert without water, which preys on his mind. As stated on the last page of the story, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Taking an unfamiliar route and being in the water - less desert makes him extremely nervous. He would not have been as anxious if he were in a forest with accessible streams. The desert environment and the heat convince him of his impending death. Encountering ghost towns makes him feel that he will never see another person again. In conclusion, the setting tricks him into believing he is going to die.
1291	7272	3	2	"The characteristics of the setting, encompassing environmental conditions, weather, and water availability, can potentially determine the fate of a cyclist. Terrain features such as hills and rocky roads can significantly impact a cyclist's journey. For instance, if a cyclist loses balance on a rocky road, they may tumble down a hill, resulting in injury or even death. In a short - story, it describes ""over one long crippling hill, a building came into view,"" which illustrates the challenging conditions the cyclist had to face. Additionally, weather and water supply also play crucial roles. The text mentions, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke."" This shows that severe dehydration could cause a cyclist to pass out, especially in a deserted area like a desert, where there is no one to offer assistance. The heat exacerbates the situation, increasing the risk of death without anyone's knowledge. Therefore, cyclists must ensure they have an adequate water supply and that the environmental conditions and weather are favorable to avoid life - threatening situations."
1292	7273	3	2	When the cyclist reaches his lowest point, he finds himself in an abandoned ghost town, desperately searching for water that tastes like battery acid. In this desolate town, the cyclist experiences a profound sense of hopelessness. Upon first reaching the water pump and the abandoned juice building, a glimmer of hope emerges. However, this hope is quickly dashed as the building has no juice, and the water from the pump is too hot and unpalatable. Throughout the story, the setting serves as the primary factor influencing the cyclist's mood. The desolation and lack of resources in the abandoned town gradually erode his hope, highlighting the powerful impact of the setting on his emotional state.
1293	7274	3	2	I will write a response elucidating how the features of the setting influence the cyclist. In this response, I will incorporate examples from the essay to support my conclusion. I believe that the features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist because elements such as snow or rocks can alter the way a person rides. For example, snow can make the road slippery, reducing traction and increasing the risk of falls, while rocks can pose obstacles that require careful navigation. By analyzing these examples from the essay, we can comprehensively understand how the setting affects the cyclist's journey.
1294	7275	3	2	"At the start of the story, a young cyclist embarks on a long journey to Yosemite National Park. During his ride, he encounters some elderly yet confident men. They suggest a new route that, according to them, would ""slice away hours"" from his journey. The weather on that day, @DATE1, was extremely hot. Along the way, he was supposed to come across several thriving towns. However, the first town he reached was a ""barren ghost town."" The next place had water with a taste like ""battery acid."" Then, he arrived at an abandoned Welch's grape juice factory. The cyclist persevered through this arduous setting until he finally reached a bait shop. The author advises readers to stay true to their plans and not let the advice of older people sway their decisions. In this journey, the young cyclist learned the importance of self - determination in the face of external suggestions."
1295	7276	3	2	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist undergoes numerous changes due to the surrounding setting. The cyclist becomes lost in the desert, which has a profound impact on him. The desert's extreme heat puts him at risk of death from dehydration or exhaustion. Moreover, during his journey, he encounters a poisonous snake, a clear indication of the potential dangers that desert animals can pose. Fortunately, he remains cautious around the snake; otherwise, he might have been bitten, and with no one around to help, the consequences could have been dire. The deserted nature of the desert also means there is no one to provide directions. The worst - case scenario occurs when he runs out of water. Without an adequate water supply, he becomes weak and dehydrated, and death becomes a real possibility. Clearly, the setting where the cyclist finds himself has a far - reaching and detrimental impact on his journey."
1296	7277	3	2	The setting's features impact the cyclist, causing him to become thirsty and leading him to believe he is lost and will perish. The cyclist obtained information from an elderly man who had not left his porch for years. Just as the cyclist thought he was lost, he spotted a sign that read “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp - if you want bait for the big ones, we're your best bet!” He entered the camp, got water, and the old man offered to tell him where to go, but this time the cyclist declined.
1297	7278	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's short story “Do not exceed the speed limit,” the setting significantly affects the cyclist. At the story's start, the cyclist describes the scenery as “@CAPS1.” Continuing to follow the outdated advice of the old men, he traverses more barren lands. When he reaches the first “town,” he deems it a ghost - town. The second place he arrives at is described as “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule.” He then moves on to the next town, which is @NUM1 away. He comes across what he thinks is a Welch's Grape juice factory and bottling plant. This takes a toll on his confidence as he states “I hung my head.” Eventually, he arrives at an abandoned building called “@PERSON2 and Wilber’s fish camp,” where he drinks water and becomes replenished. The setting has a profound effect on the cyclist, as in the hot deserts of California, his survival depends on the location.
1298	7279	3	2	One of the primary factors influencing the cyclist is the heat. Due to the high temperature, the cyclist consumes all of his water. Another aspect of the setting that impacts the cyclist is the rough road. Since the cyclist is fatigued, he struggles to ride on the hills and under other difficult road conditions. In summary, the heat and rough road conditions together pose significant challenges to the cyclist.
1299	7280	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” written by the @CAPS1, the setting mirrors the cyclist's emotions. For instance, “Flat roads were replaced by short, rising hills” (@CAPS2). As the terrain changes, so does his attitude. At the beginning of the journey, he is happy and care - free, and the land is flat with no hills. However, once he realizes that things are not as the old men described, he becomes a bit angry and upset, just as the land seems to reflect this change. Soon, he finds himself on a bumpy and unpleasant road. The setting also presents more obstacles for the cyclist during his adventure, such as tumbleweeds crossing his path and a ridiculously large snake blocking most of the way ahead. As he realizes that listening to the old men was a mistake, the land appears to be harassing and tormenting him.
1300	7281	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting take a toll on the cyclist by draining his energy. He sweats profusely, constantly drinks water from his bottles, and gradually finishes it while still having a long ride ahead. As Kurmaskie writes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Given the high temperature, the cyclist is extremely thirsty and consumes all his water. It is a warm day, and he must stay hydrated to continue his journey. The setting clearly has a detrimental impact on the cyclist's physical state.
1301	7282	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's book “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the story is set in Codi, California. The author embarks on a journey.
1302	7283	3	2	During the rider's long journey, the setting had a significant impact on him. For instance, the hot weather made him consume most of his water supply, leading to dehydration and fatigue. Had the weather been cool, he would have been able to endure the journey for a much longer time.
1303	7284	3	2	In this story, the cyclist was affected both physically and emotionally in numerous ways, one of which was the surrounding setting. When he entered the first town, he gained a boost of confidence as he thought he was on the right path to Yosemite. However, upon coming across an old shed and rusty water - pumps, he started to worry because he was running out of water and the old - timers hadn't mentioned the shed. When he encountered rolling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes, he likely felt dismayed as he was lost. This can be inferred from his statement “I was going to die and the birds would pick me dead,” which shows his hopelessness. When he reached “Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp,” he was relieved and thankful as the threat of death in the form of the scorching sun, empty landscapes, and an empty water bottle was gone. Clearly, the features and setting had a profound impact on him.
1304	7285	3	2	A cyclist was riding through beastly mountains and hot, burning deserts with no water. As he passed through a town, he asked two old men for directions, but they gave him the wrong ones, sending him on a harrowing journey that only a determined person could survive. First, he had to travel miles without water, which made him lose faith, become dehydrated, and almost abandon his plans. The terrain was so harsh that it could have killed him without water. Fortunately, his faith and determination helped him persevere. He learned an important lesson: maps are meant to be used, and one should trust them. At the end, he said, “And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future,” indicating that he had learned this valuable lesson.
1305	7286	3	2	In the short story “Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit,” many factors affected the cyclist. The rocky road and the lack of water were major issues. As the author described, “when I tried a drop or two, It had the flavor of battery acid,” which shows that the cyclist was losing hope and seemed a bit scared. Additionally, the abandoned towns did nothing to improve his situation.
1306	7287	3	2	The environmental features through which the cyclist is riding have a significant impact on him. In June, he is cycling through the desert, where the high temperature means he requires a large amount of water for his long - distance bike ride. The rough terrain also causes him to expend more energy. As the sun beats down on him, his journey to the town becomes sweltering, which later leads to his struggle for water. Overall, the hot desert setting dehydrates the cyclist and makes him desperately in need of water. As stated in the story, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips”, and he could collapse from heatstroke on that beautiful June day. This clearly shows that the hot environment made him consume a large quantity of water, and now with his water supply running low, he is at risk of heatstroke.
1307	7288	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist, depleting his water supply and nearly causing heat exhaustion. In the text, the cyclist remarks, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Due to the heat, he has very little water left for survival, and if the situation persists, he will eventually run out of water. This clearly demonstrates how the setting can endanger the cyclist's well - being.
1308	7289	3	2	The features of the setting have a substantial influence on the cyclist. Initially, the road was flat, and the cyclist was content, wearing a smile on his face. However, large rolling hills appeared, presenting a challenge that required the cyclist to gather sufficient energy to continue. Subsequently, the rough terrain made cycling even more arduous, demanding greater effort from the cyclist. To make matters worse, a snake blocked most of the pavement, and significant elevations added to the difficulty. As the terrain became more challenging, cycling became increasingly difficult for the cyclist. In conclusion, the various features of the setting continuously tested the cyclist's physical and mental capabilities.
1309	7290	3	2	The features of the setting have a considerable impact on cyclists as the required skill level depends on the nature of the setting. When cycling downhill, cyclists mainly need to know how to control the bike. On the other hand, when ascending a bumpy mountain, they must possess a certain level of skill. Regarding clothing, cyclists usually wear cool - keeping clothes when riding in a shady area, while they opt for light - colored clothes when exposed to the sun. All in all, the setting has a significant influence on cyclists in terms of both skill requirements and clothing choices.
1310	7291	3	2	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, the setting affects the cyclist in multiple ways. The old men informed the cyclist that the path he was taking had flat roads, but when he arrived, there were hills instead. The cyclist journeyed through the desert to reach his destination. The intense heat and humidity made him start to run out of water, leading to dehydration and difficulty in maintaining balance. Moreover, he had to pass a “ridiculously large” snake that blocked most of the pavement, as described by Kurmaskie. The snake was so big that the dehydrated cyclist, wobbling on his bike, had to do his best to get past it. In conclusion, the various elements of the setting in this story presented numerous challenges to the cyclist, affecting his journey in many aspects.
1311	7292	3	2	"In the story, the setting's features have a significant impact on the cyclist. For instance, he is cycling on a windy road in a desert - like hot area. The intense heat affects him during his journey; he mentioned, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" Additionally, following the old man's directions led him to rocky roads and windy paths in the desert. Another situation was when he was in the desert and saw a large snake, seemingly a diamond - back, emerge from the tumbleweeds. These are three examples demonstrating how the story's setting affected the cyclist."
1312	7293	3	2	"The features in the setting, such as hills, cause the cyclist to expend more energy. As he uses more energy, his desire for water increases. This becomes a problem because he remarks that ""The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips."" Consequently, the cyclist finds himself in a difficult situation."
1313	7294	3	2	In the story, the setting's features impact the cyclist in multiple ways. He is in the desert where it is extremely hot, and he is running out of water. This puts him at risk of dehydration. When he spots a building, he initially thinks it is a mirage due to his near - dehydrated state. Moreover, the rough terrain makes pedaling arduous, and his weakness from the lack of water exacerbates the situation. Overall, all these elements of the desert setting have an adverse effect on the cyclist.
1314	7295	3	2	"The setting's features influence the cyclist's mood throughout the journey. Initially, he is confident in the old men's knowledge of the land and excited about what lies ahead. However, as the journey progresses, his excitement turns to dismay and a bit of doubt. The hot weather and lack of water make him adopt an uncaring attitude. The statement ""Iíd read once that sucking on stones helpsÖwith any luck Iíd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat"" shows a verbal irony that conveys a negative feeling. It is evident at this point that the cyclist no longer cares about what happens to him. When he finally reaches a sign of civilization, he regains his normal self and decides that his own knowledge is the best."
1315	7296	3	2	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", author Joe Kurmaskie goes on a bike ride. The area where he is riding has up - and - down hills and a very rough road. He is in the desert and running out of water. He stopped at a rusted water pump, but a tar - like substance oozed out. Once he got off his bike, he was less worried about the poisonous snakes in the desert. He found an abandoned Welch's grape juice factory. Eventually, he located a bait shop and was able to get water."
1316	7297	3	2	In the short - story “Do not @CAPS1 the Posted Speed Limit” penned by Joe Kurmaskie, the story's setting exerts multiple influences on the cyclist. Throughout the story, the cyclist endures numerous fluctuations in temperature and climate. Additionally, alterations in the land structure occur, making it arduously difficult for him to pedal and reach his intended destination. Based on this analysis, it is evident that the setting @MONTH1 impacts the cyclist.
1317	7298	3	2	The hot sun and the desert elements of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist, potentially preventing him from reaching his destination. The sun beats down on him, impeding his progress towards his goal. As described, “The sun was beginning to beat down... wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.” Overcome by the heat and exhaustion from the sun, the cyclist fears dying from dehydration, a situation that would almost certainly halt his journey to Yosemite. Compounding the problem is his limited water supply; he can only go @NUM1 and is “water depleting @NUM2.” In conclusion, these factors severely hamper his ability to reach his destination.
1318	7299	3	2	The setting features do indeed affect the cyclist. When the outside temperature is high, the cyclist requires more water than usual. In the event of rain, he has to ride more cautiously. These examples illustrate how various aspects of the setting can have an impact on the cyclist's journey. In summary, the setting plays a crucial role in influencing the cyclist's experience.
1319	7300	3	2	The environment in specific situations can have diverse effects on people. For example, when one is hot, a tree can provide shade; when thirsty, a nearby river can quench one's thirst. However, if a person is both hungry and hot with no resources nearby, it can exacerbate the discomfort. In the case of the cyclist, the environment affected him in multiple ways. There were bumpy roads, “ghost towns,” and trees. He mentioned, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed,” which was due to the “cool pines” around him as he elaborated in the next paragraph. The text also indicates that the terrain changed, and he even encountered a snake, increasing his thirst and making it more challenging for him to continue. From the text, it is clear that environmental features can have a profound impact on an individual.
1320	7301	3	2	The features of the setting have a substantial influence on the cyclist's journey to Yosemite. The land's characteristics, such as its hilly nature, being a desert, and the fact that the story is set in the middle of June, all play a role. The dry and hilly land is a major obstacle for the main character. The hilly terrain requires him to exert twice as much effort. The dryness makes him thirsty with no readily available source of water. Moreover, since it is a desert, there are no places to seek help or obtain food, water, or access civilization. The cyclist believes he may not make it to his destination. As the text states in a paragraph, “the growing realization that I could drop from heat - stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” In conclusion, the hot, dry, and deserted setting has a significant impact on the main character and his journey.
1321	7302	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist is discouraged and dehydrated due to the setting. Near the start, upon seeing the first stop with a few dilapidated buildings and some rusted pumps, he remarks, “This sight was troubling.” When he reaches the pumps, he finds that “a tar - like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water,” which exacerbates his dehydration. While pedaling, he also notices a sign indicating a speed limit of 55 miles per hour. Overall, the desolate and uninviting setting takes a toll on the cyclist's physical and mental state.
1322	7303	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's short passage, the conditions of the road and its surrounding area influence his actions and emotions. As Kurmaskie states, “The sun was beginning to beat down.” Traveling through the high deserts of California in June, the increasing heat and sunlight make him tired and less confident. The barren and open landscape, with no one around to offer help or water, compounds his fatigue. Evidently, the temperature and weather around the cyclist significantly impact his experience and behavior.
1323	7304	3	2	The features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist. In the essay, there is support for the conclusion that the setting affects the cyclist. The features of the setting cause certain reactions in the cyclist, and including this support helps to solidify the conclusion that the setting plays a crucial role in the cyclist's experience.
1324	7305	3	2	The scenery brings great happiness to the cyclist. He is extremely happy, almost overjoyed. The beauty of the scenery has a profound positive effect on his mood, and this joy is clearly evident. In conclusion, the scenery's positive influence on the cyclist is undeniable.
1325	7306	3	2	In this story, the setting significantly affects the cyclist's trip and well - being. The temperature is hot, exceeding @NUM1 degrees, and the road has many turns while going downhill. The cyclist gets so hot that his water is no longer cold. The harsh desert environment is taking a severe toll on him, almost causing a heart - stroke. Clearly, all aspects of the desert setting have a substantial impact on the cyclist's journey.
1326	7307	3	2	"The setting of a situation can have both mental and physical impacts on an individual. This is demonstrated in @PERSON1's ""Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" Initially, the cyclist enjoys the setting and has an easy ride, as indicated by his confidence. For example, he remarks, ""The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" However, after following the directions of ""a collection of old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,"" he encounters terrain unsuitable for biking. As the cycling becomes more challenging, his confidence starts to decline. After hitting rolling hills and seeing a sign warning of a rough road and not to exceed the speed limit, he says, ""Sometimes life can feel so cruel."" He becomes disappointed and wants to give up as he can't even reach the speed limit. Nevertheless, he is determined and pushes on to reach a shop, which gives him a sense of satisfaction and confidence. In conclusion, the setting can significantly influence mood and motivation."
1327	7308	3	2	The features of the setting play a crucial role in affecting the cyclist. For instance, when he rides through the ghost town, the setting impacts his experience. Throughout the story, the setting is a prominent element, whether it's about the cyclist getting water or the tumbleweeds crossing the road. He is constantly thirsty and rides long distances. The overall setting contributes to the challenges he faces during his journey. In conclusion, the setting has a substantial influence on the cyclist's experience.
1328	7309	3	2	The cyclist's mood is closely tied to the changes in the setting. At the start, he has strong legs and a smile on his face. When he reaches the first town, a ghost town, he laughs, and his spirits aren't dampened. He still has confidence in the directions given by the old men. As the setting changes, so does his confidence. When it starts getting hotter, his mood doesn't change much. But after riding @NUM1 miles and reaching a fork in the road with rusty water pumps and a rundown car, his confidence in the water level decreases. Realizing the next town is far away, he loses more confidence and becomes more worried about water. The transition from a flat road to a rough one further lowers his mood. Finally, when he reaches a fishing store and gets water, his spirits soar. This shows how the setting has a direct impact on his mood.
1329	7310	3	2	The features and setting in the story present significant challenges for the cyclist on his journey to Yosemite. The story describes the intense heat, stating that it was so hot that the cyclist could potentially drop dead from heatstroke. His limited water supply made him extremely tired as he pedaled. The sun beating down not only exhausted him due to the lack of water but also caused him to lose water and energy through sweating. All these factors combined made his journey to Yosemite arduous. In conclusion, the features and setting were major obstacles for the cyclist's journey.
1330	7311	3	2	"In the short story ""Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist faces difficult times during his journey. At the start, he has very little water. The hot and dry conditions cause his water to run out quickly, leaving him with insufficient water for the rest of the trip. Additionally, the rough roads make him tired, further complicating his journey. In conclusion, the limited water supply and rough roads due to the setting made the cyclist's journey challenging."
1331	7312	3	2	The setting's features have a significant impact on the cyclist. The cool pines and rushing rivers keep the cyclist cool and energized through the scenery and temperature. The old, shut - down juice factory implies a sense of isolation, suggesting that the cyclist might die alone. The completely deserted ghost town indicates a barren and uninhabitable place. These are among the features that influence the biker.
1332	7313	3	2	The cyclist is highly discouraged by the dry and hot surroundings. A feature is a specific aspect of something. In “Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist follows the somewhat outdated advice of a few old men, which leads him astray as he runs out of water and energy. The cyclist remarks, “Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The heat greatly affects him, and he is so tired that he wants to confirm the building is real. Additionally, the changing terrain impacts his water consumption and the effort needed to climb the long hill. The dry climate and tough terrain have a substantial effect on the cyclist.
1333	7314	3	2	Heat, desert, and humidity all impact the cyclist during his journey. The heat makes him thirsty as he is running out of water; for instance, the narrator describes that “water bottles only had a few tantalizing sips,” indicating a hot day and a shortage of water. The desert setting leaves the narrator alone, as deserts are typically deserted, as he exclaims, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind,” suggesting he could be in a desolate place. Humidity makes the sky drier and the heat feel more intense. In conclusion, heat, desert, and humidity significantly affect the cyclist on his journey.
1334	7315	3	2	The setting's features have a profound impact on the cyclist. Initially, he is in good spirits while taking the old - timers' “shortcut,” stating, “things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” However, this marks the start of a rough day. He reaches a ghost town first, not overly worried at that point. Around sixty miles into his journey, he encounters a ramshackle shed, rusty pumps, and a broken - down corral. He has drunk a lot of his water and is in need of more. When he tries the pumps, “a far - like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” A couple of miles later, he sees a highway sign warning of a rough road. He continues, desperate for water, even coming across a snake and fearing a heat stroke. At an abandoned grape juice factory, he hangs his head. Almost completely dehydrated from the long, tiring ride, he is certain he'll die from dehydration or a heat stroke. Finally, he reaches a shop and drinks from the sink. In summary, the setting makes this ride torturous for the cyclist.
1335	7316	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist both positively and negatively. At the start, two old men give the cyclist out - of - date information, negatively affecting him as it leads to him getting lost. When he reaches the first town, the water pump is also a negative factor. He is running out of water, and the water from the pump tastes like battery acid and is about @NUM1°. The small, rolling hills further exacerbate his dehydration as he expends a lot of energy to go over them. However, he finally finds Gary and Wilber's fish camp where he can get water. This overall experience, despite being negative at the time, has a positive side as the cyclist learns not to take advice from very old people who “haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” In conclusion, the setting's features have both positive and negative impacts on the cyclist.
1336	7317	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” a cyclist embarks on a journey to Yosemite National Park. Along the way, he stops to seek advice on a quicker route from a group of old men. The cyclist remarks that one should “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” After following their advice, he encounters abandoned ghost towns that the old men claimed were thriving areas. The cyclist endures the rolling hills, mirages, and the intense heat of a June day in the California deserts. Eventually, he spots a bait and tack shop. Upon seeing that the men who own the place are even older than the previous group, he simply stares at them. Based on his earlier statement, it can be inferred that the cyclist will disregard their claim of having the best map.
1337	7318	3	2	The setting significantly impacts cyclists in multiple ways. One major constraint is the limited amount of equipment they can carry. For instance, cyclists can only bring a certain quantity of water. Once they run out, and there are no buildings in the vicinity, they are in a difficult situation. Similarly, the amount of food they can take is restricted. Moreover, when it comes to sleeping, cyclists can't just stop anywhere. They have to keep riding until they find a hotel or reach home. Given these challenges, it's understandable that some might not be able to manage cycling in such settings. These are some of the key reasons why the setting affects cyclists.
1338	7319	3	2	The features of the setting in the story have a profound impact on the cyclist, causing dehydration, trouble, and relief. The intense heat leads to the cyclist's dehydration. He states, “the growing realization that I would drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This indicates that the heat poses a serious threat, potentially causing dehydration and heatstroke. The scarce surroundings trouble the cyclist. He describes “a corral that couldn't hold the lamest mule,” which shows his worry as there are few people around and his directions seem incorrect. However, the cyclist experiences relief when he finds water from the sink. He has an “overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them,” demonstrating his extreme relief at finally finding water and his gratitude towards the bait - shop owners for providing it.
1339	7320	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting have various effects on the cyclist. The downhill land format is beneficial as it allows the cyclist to conserve energy and pedal less strenuously, especially when his water supply is low. When he comes across a pump, it is rusty, with tar oozing out and followed by hot, brackish water that tastes like battery acid. The dryness of the desert has a negative impact on the cyclist as he is unable to access the water in Yosemite until the end of his journey. On the other hand, the breeze has a positive effect, helping to cool him down. Overall, the features of the setting in this story significantly affect the cyclist.
1340	7321	3	2	In the story “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist traveling to Yosemite National Park is greatly affected by the setting. As described, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day… ” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The conditions of the day have a severe impact on the cyclist, making it extremely difficult for him to continue. He is exhausted and nearly ill due to the heat. The setting of this place is clearly detrimental to the cyclist, and he likely wishes to go home and escape the heat. Evidently, the setting has a substantial effect on the cyclist.
1341	7322	3	2	The features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist. Specifically, since it is summer, cycling becomes more challenging for the cyclist as the heat can cause fatigue and dehydration. In conclusion, the summer setting is a significant factor that makes the cyclist's journey more difficult.
1342	7323	3	2	The features of the setting can affect the cyclist in various ways. If the setting is a place with abundant water, the cyclist doesn't have to worry about dehydration. Additionally, if the old men were not outside initially, certain events might not have occurred. In summary, the setting's features, such as the presence of water and the presence of old men, can have notable effects on the cyclist's experience.
1343	7324	3	2	The features of the setting have a physical impact on the cyclist. The heat of the California desert causes the cyclist to become tired and dehydrated. For instance, the text states, “I cased past, trying to keep my balance dehydrated star.” The setting is the primary factor leading to the cyclist's dehydration. In conclusion, the specific features of the California desert setting play a crucial role in the cyclist's physical state.
1344	7325	3	2	The sun, a part of the setting, is mercilessly overheating the biker. Moreover, the terrain, consisting of numerous small hills, is wearing the biker out. Additionally, there are no trees for shade and no clouds or wind to cool the biker off. In conclusion, the combination of the sun, the hilly terrain, and the lack of cooling elements in the setting makes the biker's situation quite challenging.
1345	7326	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist as the rougher the terrain gets, the more difficult things become for the cyclist. In one paragraph, it says, “It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” In the next paragraph, the cyclist remarks, “sometimes life can feel so cruel.” This is because the rough road ahead makes the cyclist feel that life is cruel. All the features like the snake, lack of water, and rolling hills are obstacles in life that people have to face. Although we may not like these obstacles, the reward at the end is wonderful. In conclusion, the setting's features create challenges for the cyclist, but the end - result can be rewarding.
1346	7327	3	2	The conditions of the road and the weather, as features of the setting, significantly impact the cyclist. The cyclist encountered dirty and unpleasant water. Additionally, he attempted to cycle through a desert after exhausting all his bottled water, leaving him severely dehydrated. He was forced to drink Nestle water. Despite the extreme dehydration, he had to persevere. At one point, a large snake nearly blocked the entire road, and he had to carefully maneuver past it. The riding conditions were so dire that he felt he might die and even joked that the birds would eat him. The scorching weather made it extremely difficult to continue. Eventually, he found a bathroom, drank water from the sink, and asked a man for directions.
1347	7328	3	2	The setting features have a notable impact on the cyclist. In the story, when the setting is described as “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” it serves as a foreshadowing, hinting that something bad may occur due to the cyclist's solitude. Another description, “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” clearly indicates danger ahead, suggesting that an unfavorable event is likely to happen. Overall, these setting descriptions effectively convey the potential risks the cyclist may face.
1348	7329	3	2	The setting affects the cyclist in multiple ways. Since there was no posted speed - limit in that area, the cyclist rode through at a speed higher than what was appropriate. This lack of a speed - limit sign in the setting influenced the cyclist's behavior, potentially leading to a less safe riding situation.
1349	7330	3	2	Poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, and dry dead tumbleweed are among the setting features that have the most significant impact on the cyclist. These elements illustrate the treacherous path he traversed and the obstacles he had to overcome to succeed. The inclusion of features such as poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, the absence of signs of life, and the lack of water showcases the harsh conditions. If these details were omitted, the audience might assume the cyclist was simply traveling on an ordinary trail, perhaps along a windy river through well - developed towns. Thus, the setting features help set the mood and reveal the essence of the story.
1350	7331	3	2	When one engages in an activity frequently, they tend to get accustomed to it. I believe the same principle applies to how sitting affects the cyclist's physical features. Prolonged sitting on a bicycle may cause a cyclist's buttocks to flatten or their back to take on a different shape. By “different shape,” I don't mean that they become deformed. Every person is unique, and a cyclist's back might take on a shape like “@CAPS1,” “I,” or “D.” In conclusion, the act of sitting during cycling can have distinct effects on a cyclist's physical form.
1351	7332	3	2	The setting's features impact the cyclist in several ways. The cyclist endured extreme heat, with wide rings of dried sweat encircling his shirt. He was acutely aware that he could succumb to a heart - stroke on that beautiful June day. The towns he passed through, which were expected to be populated, were deserted. As a result, his cycling journey became even more arduous. In conclusion, the characteristics of the setting significantly affected the cyclist's experience.
1352	7333	3	2	The setting features have a notable impact on cyclists. The terrain change, as described by “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills” (kurmaskie @NUM1), requires cyclists to expend more time and energy to ascend hills and reach the other side. Additionally, the setting in “high deserts of California in June” (kurmaskie @NUM1) brings intense heat. Heat impairs most people's concentration and can cause overheating when exerting a large amount of force. These two factors combined create challenging conditions for cyclists.
1353	7334	3	2	The various settings influenced the cyclist's feelings during his bike ride. At the start, he was excited and happy about the ride, especially when he rode fast through the shortcut. When he came across a long and difficult hill, he still managed to ride at high speed. Unfortunately, riding non - stop was tiring. But he felt a sense of relief after completing the whole road. He felt free when going over tall hills. He believed he could find his way in the end, always looking towards the future. Although he once thought he might die, he realized that asking for a little help was all he needed. Different settings indeed affected the cyclist, yet they also contributed to his bright future.
1354	7335	3	2	One of the significant challenges the author faced in his essay was the setting in Yosemite. The story's backdrop presented multiple obstacles, including the park's vastness, the summer heat, and the prevalence of abandoned areas. The summer heat was the most pressing issue for the cyclist. He had to cycle long distances with a limited water supply. As his water ran low, his determination to reach the next town before collapsing grew. This determination propelled him from one ghost town to another, driving the story forward. The vastness of Yosemite National Park was another major problem. Wrong turns, which he took due to the directions he received, could lead to him getting lost for a long time. His confusion about the location of the next town made his cycling difficult but also created an interesting narrative. For instance, his quote “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving spot at one time - say, before the last world war - but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town” shows the park's vastness and his struggle to find signs of civilization. In conclusion, the setting's challenges were crucial in shaping the story.
1355	7336	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's “Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” the author vividly portrays the setting and its impact on the cyclist's condition. For example, describing the hill as “crippling” in “Over one long, crippling hill, a building come into view. I wiped the sweat from my eye” reveals the significant energy the cyclist expends. Another quote, “that smoky blues tune 'Summer time' rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain,” indicates the cyclist's severe dehydration due to the summer heat. The author effectively uses descriptive details to support the cyclist's condition. This description of the setting enhances the reader's understanding of the cyclist's journey, making it more immersive and engaging.
1356	7337	3	2	The cyclist's situation is dire as he is nearly out of water. The terrain he encounters, with its numerous hills, takes a toll on him, leaving him exhausted and even more parched. Moreover, when he spots the juice factory, his excitement leads him to expend a great deal of energy to reach it, further intensifying his thirst. Consequently, if he had depleted all his energy after these challenges, he would not have been able to make it to the bait shop.
1357	7338	3	2	The setting's features have a significant impact on the cyclist. He finds himself in an unfamiliar and desolate location, lacking knowledge of the area's direction and the local inhabitants. Additionally, he has neither food nor drink. Without proper nourishment, he cannot obtain the energy required to continue cycling. In summary, the unfavorable setting severely restricts the cyclist's ability to proceed on his journey.
1358	7339	3	2	"The story's setting features have multiple effects on the cyclist. The text mentions, ""At some point, tumbleweed crossed my path,"" indicating that the cyclist is in a desert or a very hot region, as tumbleweeds are typically found in such areas. Being in the desert exacerbates the cyclist's situation as he is already low on water, and the extreme heat causes him to become even more dehydrated. Another influential setting feature is the hills the cyclist must climb. Already dehydrated, the physical exertion of climbing hills makes him work harder, resulting in more sweating and increased dehydration. These examples clearly demonstrate how the story's setting features affect the cyclist."
1359	7340	3	2	The setting in this story poses significant challenges for the cyclist. The primary issue is the scarcity of water. Depriving the body of water can cause major organs to be severely affected under the hot sun. Another problem is the terrain's condition. Cycling on bumpy, dry land is extremely difficult. These are just a few of the obstacles the cyclist faced, highlighting the harshness of the setting.
1360	7341	3	2	The setting's features greatly affect the cyclist. It is a sweltering summer day, and he is running out of water. The intense heat puts him at risk of having a heat - stroke. Additionally, the presence of hills is a problem. He has limited energy, and the sun's heat is gradually sapping what little he has left. In conclusion, the combination of the hot weather and the hilly terrain makes the cyclist's journey extremely difficult.
1361	7342	3	2	The characteristics of the setting have an impact on the cycles. The high temperature and the rough terrain of the train environment are the factors that influence these cycles. In conclusion, the specific features of the setting play a significant role in affecting the cycles.
1362	7343	3	2	The features of the setting impact the cyclist. As the cyclist approaches the nearest town, the ground becomes more difficult to ride on. For instance, when the cyclist sees a sign indicating a limit, it is a sign that the ground ahead will be rough. Overall, the setting's features clearly affect the cyclist's journey.
1363	7344	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead,” the features of the setting have a negative impact on the cyclist. In the California desert, water is of utmost importance. With a limited water supply at the start, the cyclist, traveling through the high deserts in June, regularly consumed water. While passing through deserted towns, he searched for usable water sources but found none, as some water had an acidic smell. The intense heat also took a toll on his mind and body, and he worried about heat - stroke and water needs throughout the trip. Additionally, wildlife posed a threat, like a large snake blocking the path. Evidently, the setting features in “Rough Road Ahead” negatively affected the cyclist.
1364	7345	3	2	The feature of the setting influenced the cyclist. When there is a rough road ahead, one must be able to handle the ups and downs and bumps. The author was filled with fear, worried that he might die and that birds would pick his bones clean. In summary, the setting's feature had a significant psychological and physical impact on the cyclist.
1365	7346	3	2	In the story, the cyclist encounters numerous issues that could prevent him from completing his journey. His water supply might lead to dehydration and fainting. The hot June weather could cause a heat - stroke and endanger his life. The rough terrain could result in a popped bike tire, forcing him to walk. Despite these many problems that could end his trip or even his life, the cyclist perseveres and survives. In conclusion, the cyclist's determination helps him overcome the challenges presented by the setting.
1366	7347	3	2	The setting's features impact the cyclist in multiple ways. Firstly, the cool pine trees shield the cyclist from the direct sunlight, preventing heatstroke. Secondly, the towns the cyclist visited either had poor - quality water or none at all, leading to dehydration. The intense heat from the sun made the cyclist feel strange, and he worried that he might be seeing mirages. In conclusion, the various elements of the setting significantly affected the cyclist's physical state and perception.
1367	7348	3	2	The cyclist does not really like the road's setting as it is causing significant problems. The unfavorable setting is disrupting his journey and creating difficulties for him. In conclusion, the unsuitable setting is having a negative impact on the cyclist's experience.
1368	7349	3	2	In June, the cyclist finds himself in a Californian desert. The extreme heat of this setting, combined with the fact that he only has a couple of drinks of water and no place to refill, severely affects him. As the cyclist remarks, “there is no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” Clearly, such a desolate and hot environment has a definite impact on the cyclist's well - being and journey.
1369	7350	3	2	Certain features of the setting have affected the cyclist. He is running out of water. When he tried to pump water, he exerted all his strength. Initially, a tar - like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water that tasted like battery acid. The terrain also changed from a flat road to short hills, and he even encountered a snake that resembled a diamondback. All these aspects of the setting have presented challenges to the cyclist during his journey.
1370	7351	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's essay “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting's features affect the cyclist. Riding a bike in the heat, he encounters bumpy roads and hills. For instance, he notes that after some miles, the flat land was replaced by short, rolling hills. Another example is the wide rings of dried sweat on his shirt and the growing fear of dying from heatstroke. These examples illustrate how difficult the journey was and how the setting's features affected the cyclist. In conclusion, this story serves as a caution that one should be careful when taking directions, especially from an old person, when cycling in hot conditions.
1371	7352	3	2	"The setting's features have multiple impacts on the cyclist. Initially, the road terrain changed from flat to bumpy, making the cyclist's journey more arduous. As stated in the story, ""Rough Road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit."" Due to the need to expend more energy on these roads and having a limited water supply, the cyclist became extremely thirsty. When he finally spotted an old - looking town ahead, he stopped. The town seemed abandoned. He tried to pump water from a water pump, but no matter how long he pumped, the water resembled battery acid. The story quotes, ""when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid."" These are some of the setting features that influenced the cyclist during his journey."
1372	7353	3	2	"In this story, the setting's features significantly affect the cyclist. The cyclist is cycling in a desert; as the text states, ""I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June."" It is hot, with the sun beating down on the cyclist, as described by ""the sun was beginning to beat down..."". The area is remote, with no one available to offer help, as it ""fit the traditional definition of ghost town."" There are no natural water sources for the cyclist to refill his water bottles, putting him at risk of dehydration. For instance, ""I got down on my hands and knees and worked the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, but only a tarlike substance oozed out."" There was also a poisonous snake on the road that could have bitten the cyclist. Additionally, there were hills that required more energy to climb, making the cyclist more tired and thirsty. Overall, the harsh setting presented numerous challenges to the cyclist's journey."
1373	7354	3	2	"The setting's features influence the cyclist's attitude towards the old men. After following the old men's directions, the cyclist was angry with himself. The previous attempt at following those directions nearly led to his distress. The combination of the beating sun and the high deserts of California in mid - June left the cyclist dehydrated and tired. When he reached a rusted water pump and ""black tar oozed out,"" one can imagine the cyclist being furious, anxious, and, of course, thirsty. The rough terrain and tumbleweeds made the cyclist skeptical of his decision to follow the old men's directions. Thus, the setting played a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's view of the old men's advice."
1374	7355	3	2	"In ""Rough Road; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist starts his journey in the ""serenity of an early summer evening,"" taking road advice from old - timers. At first, even with the sun beating down, he remained determined, driven by thoughts of Yosemite. However, as he realized that the ""short cut"" was not as short as expected, his determination waned. The ""high deserts of California in June"" and the changing terrain exacerbated his dehydration and his need to find water. With ""no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,"" he focused on the horizon, telling himself that reaching it would mean he'd be okay. Eventually, a building came into view, giving him hope and the strength to continue. Ironically, it was an abandoned ""Welchís Grape Juice factory and bottling plant."" After this, he lost hope and hung his head, believing he was going to die. But as he drove away from the factory, he saw a fish camp, regained hope, and went there to regain his strength. Through this experience, he learned never to take road advice from others."
1375	7356	3	2	The setting in the reading had a notable impact on the cyclist. It was hot, dry, and desolate. The heat forced the cyclist to consume water frequently. The dryness meant there was no place for him to stop and cool off. Moreover, when the going got tough, all around him were ghost towns and abandoned buildings. These aspects of the setting combined to make the cyclist's journey extremely difficult, clearly demonstrating how the setting affected him.
1376	7357	3	2	The story's setting features presented challenges for the cyclist. During a California summer, the lack of water made traversing the deserts extremely uncomfortable. In a desperate attempt to moisten his mouth, the cyclist tried sucking on pebbles but accidentally swallowed one. This incident further compounded the difficulties he faced on his journey.
1377	7358	3	2	The setting features have an impact on the cyclist as his body struggles to adapt to the life - threatening situation. The arid desert environment is causing him to lose water rapidly, yet he must continue pedaling. Moreover, since the terrain has no available water sources, he has no means to replenish his fluids. This hostile setting severely hampers the cyclist's ability to complete his journey.
1378	7359	3	2	In my opinion, if we enforce strict punishments on speeding drivers, there will be a reduction in car crashes. Additionally, drivers with road rage should be required to attend anger management programs. By taking these measures, we can make our roads safer for everyone.
1379	7360	3	2	The cyclist's journey was affected by numerous features. The first ghost town he encountered fit the traditional definition of a ghost town that morning. This realization made him aware that the people who suggested the shortcut hadn't been there in a long time. The lack of water in a California desert in June also posed a significant problem, as he knew it would be a while before he could get more. The hills added to his difficulties, as he had to exert great effort to reach the next town with limited water. The abandoned Welch's building, with no available drinks, was yet another setback. In conclusion, the cyclist had to overcome many obstacles on his way to the National Park.
1380	7361	3	2	The cyclist's journey was affected by a series of events that made it increasingly difficult. One of his initial mistakes was taking advice from people who were clueless about their location. He later regretted letting them look at his map. The high temperature in the California desert also influenced him. The cyclist experienced a mix of emotions; at times, he thought he was going to die, and at other times, he believed he would be okay. When he stumbled into a modern bathroom and drank from the sink, he felt an overwhelming urge to seek Gary. Overall, these events and emotions made his journey a challenging one.
1381	7362	3	2	The features of the start had an impact on the cyclist. While starting, he seemed to be in a state where he was not following a proper path. He ended up in the middle, similar to how start - sites are arranged on a search. He then had an internal realization, but the details of what he reached himself about were unclear. Later, he encountered a sight that he did not like. He felt as if his walking was not right, fell, and got dust on himself. He should always look at the map to avoid such situations, as he did not want these things to happen again.
1382	7363	3	2	In the story, a man struggles to reach water. He faces numerous obstacles. For instance, he has traveled approximately @NUM1 miles without water. Additionally, there are many hills and turns in the story, which slow his progress. Due to these multiple obstacles, he is having a difficult time getting to the water. In conclusion, the man's journey to find water is severely hampered by the various challenges he encounters in the story.
1383	7364	3	2	In the story, a cyclist embarks on a bike ride to @LOCATION1. Equipped with a new map, he is doing well initially. However, he asks a group of old men for the fastest way to reach his destination. He follows their directions and feels confident about it. But soon, his situation changes. He encounters new terrain, including steep hills, speed - limit restrictions that he cannot exceed, a dry and hot climate, and he has no water. All these factors combine to make his journey much harder. As he experiences these difficulties, he feels like he is going to die and wants to give up. Eventually, he finds someone but does not ask for directions. The lesson is that one should not take directions from strangers unless they are prepared to face the unexpected.
1384	7365	3	2	"The rough roads affected the cyclist as they significantly slowed him down. In the story, it was stated, ""Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted speed Limit"", which clearly indicates that he needed to slow down to avoid an accident. Another factor was the hot weather. The heat caused the cyclist to lose water; either the water in his bottles evaporated, or he had to drink it to stay hydrated. The text mentioned, ""The water bottles contained water a few tantalizing sips"", suggesting that there was very little water left. In conclusion, the rough roads and hot weather both had a negative impact on the cyclist's journey."
1385	7366	3	2	"The settings on the cyclist's way to Yosemite affect him in multiple ways. When he took the shortcut, it was June, and he was in the desert, which made the journey difficult. He passed through a couple of deserted towns, so there was no way to replenish his water. As the story states, ""I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldnít cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid."" Another aspect of the setting that changed was the presence of hills. When he reached a bait - shop, an old man asked him if he knew the best way to get to Yosemite, and he replied, ""yes - sir: I own a very good map."" Through this, he realized that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he is familiar with, as he will know what to expect. This shows how the setting influenced the cyclist's journey and his understanding of travel."
1386	7367	3	2	The setting's features have a multitude of effects on the cyclist. One such effect is that the description of the setting makes it appear hotter than it actually is. The cyclist states, “neighborhood of two hundred degrees,” indicating that it is extremely hot. The setting's features influenced the cyclist as the description made it seem hotter, and he took this perception to an extreme. In conclusion, the inaccurate portrayal of heat in the setting description had a significant impact on the cyclist's experience.
1387	7368	3	2	In the essay, the setting's features influenced the cyclist. The cyclist used terms like “flat road” and “short, rolling hills” to describe the setting, with additional examples as well. The cyclist's description of the setting provided the reader with a vivid mental image. It is evident that the cyclist was affected by the setting. In summary, the cyclist's descriptions not only gave the reader a visual sense of the setting but also indicated the impact it had on the cyclist.
1388	7369	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting mirrors the main character's emotions. When he arrived in and then left the next town, he felt well as nothing was amiss, and the setting was extremely tranquil. The narrator remarks, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them” (Kurmaskie). This setting was as happy and pleasant as the narrator's mood. In conclusion, the story effectively demonstrates how the setting can reflect the character's emotional state.
1389	7370	3	2	The cyclist faced several challenges during his journey. The terrain changed from a flat road to short, rolling hills and then to a rough road. Another obstacle was the tar - like substance that emerged from the rusted water pump, followed by brackish water that felt around @NUM1 hundred degrees. Every time he pumped, the water did not cool down and tasted like battery acid. Since he regularly drank from his water bottle, he needed fresh water. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California, and the sun was beating down, leaving him dehydrated. Additionally, a snake that looked like a diamondback blocked the pavement in front of him. In conclusion, the cyclist encountered a series of difficult situations during his travels in the high deserts of California.
1390	7371	3	2	In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting's features have a profound impact on the cyclist. The story begins at “a reservoir campground outside of @CAPS1, California” in early summer. In southern California during early summer, the temperatures are high. The main character, a cyclist engaged in a lot of physical activity, sweats profusely. The high temperature and excessive sweating lead the cyclist to drink a large amount of water. When the water runs out, the conflict arises. The setting also guides the main character towards resolving the conflict. Since the area is near a reservoir, fishing is a popular activity, and a bait and tackle shop would be a common business. The cyclist can enter the bait and tackle shop to quench his thirst. In conclusion, the setting of the story significantly influences both the conflict and its solution.
1391	7372	3	2	On a sweltering summer day in California, a cyclist decided to embark on a ride to Yosemite National Park. Initially, he intended to rely on an up - to - date and perfectly serviceable map. However, he engaged in a conversation with some elderly men who shared a shortcut they had taken in the past. The cyclist chose to follow this shortcut through the desert, armed with only one messy bottle of water. The outside temperature was extremely high, and the scorching sun beat down on his back as he pedaled. This made him hotter than he had anticipated, and there was neither shade nor a place to stop and replenish his water. As a result, he became preoccupied with finding water rather than focusing on his ride. The circumstances of this journey affected the cyclist in numerous ways. He was ill - prepared for the route, which was not biker - friendly. Had he stuck to the route on the map, he would have known his location, and his ride would not have been disrupted by thoughts of conserving water or searching for it.
1392	7373	3	2	"The cyclist endured a difficult time as the elements were against him. The environment was dry and hot, and he had little water. The text states, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,"" indicating that he had scarcely any water, and what little he had only increased his thirst. Additionally, the quote ""@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake"" paints a picture of a desolate landscape, perhaps a desert or a place like Colorado. There was no sign of other people, buildings, cars, or any structures. The cyclist was conserving both his energy and water, and he began to show signs of mental distress. The hills were extremely challenging for him, as described in the text, ""over one long, crippling hill."" This demonstrates the harsh conditions, especially considering he identified as a cyclist at the start. Clearly, the setting had a significant impact on the biker's experience."
1393	7374	3	2	Weather conditions can significantly influence a cyclist's course of action. In cold weather, a cyclist will typically bring warmer clothing. Conversely, when it is hotter outside, they are more likely to wear lighter clothes. The distance of the ride also matters. For a longer ride, a cyclist will bring more supplies such as water and food. For a short ride, they will carry fewer items. In essence, the weather dictates how a cyclist prepares for a ride.
1394	7375	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed limit,"" various aspects of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. At the beginning of his journey, the cyclist hardly notices the intense heat, stating, ""the sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it."" However, his mood changes rapidly. Soon, he drinks most of his water and grows increasingly tired. When he finds a water pump, he is irritated to discover that the water tastes like ""battery acid."" As he continues, he spots a snake that he believes to be a diamondback and cautiously pedals past it. Spotting a factory, he uses his last bit of energy to reach it, only to be disappointed when he finds it abandoned. His spirits finally lift when he comes across a store and is able to drink a substantial amount of water."
1395	7376	3	2	"Multiple elements of the setting affected the cyclist. When he reached a town with a water pump, the poor quality of the water became evident. As Kurmaskie writes, ""when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid"" (@NUM1), which shows the impact of this part of the terrain. The cyclist also suffered from severe dehydration, as described in the text ""in my dehydrated state"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Another significant factor was when he arrived at the juice factory, only to find it closed. This development depressed him, further highlighting how different parts of the setting influenced the cyclist's experience."
1396	7377	3	2	In the short story, the cyclist was significantly influenced by the setting. He was cycling in a sweltering desert with scarce signs of civilization to offer assistance. The road he was on was far from smooth, causing him difficulties. The wildlife also had an impact on him. Once, he encountered a large snake and had to carefully ride around it. Moreover, he feared for his life, thinking that the birds would prey on him. The desert itself was the most challenging factor. With a lack of water, which he desperately needed, and no inhabited town in sight, the setting in which the main character was riding had a profound effect on him.
1397	7378	3	2	The cyclist grew exhausted as he pedaled uphill. The story's setting had a substantial impact on him. California provides an ideal environment for cycling, with warm and pleasant weather. As he rode, he came across a dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't even hold the tamest mule. After traveling twenty miles, the terrain changed. The flat road gave way to short rolling hills. After cresting the first few of these hills, a large highway sign suddenly appeared. On the rough road, he had to be extremely cautious and not exceed the speed limit. In conclusion, the setting played a crucial role in influencing the cyclist's experience.
1398	7379	3	2	The setting of the essay had a profound impact on the cyclist. Despite his efforts to maintain hope, these settings were discouraging. The sight of the dry desert, where the hills gradually rose and no man - made structures were visible, subconsciously affected the cyclist and increased his thirst. Eventually, his original objective became invalid due to intense thirst pangs and exhaustion. In conclusion, the setting had a detrimental effect on the cyclist's journey and state of mind.
1399	7380	3	2	Being a cyclist is far more challenging than it seems. While riding a bike may appear easy, being a cyclist involves overcoming numerous obstacles. One such obstacle is rough terrain. Cyclists are accustomed to smooth, paved roads, so going off - road or riding on dirt roads can be a challenge. In Joe Kurmaskie's short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” another significant obstacle is running out of water. The cyclist stated, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” He further described the difficulty of maintaining balance due to dehydration, which is crucial when riding a bike. In conclusion, when it comes to cycling, one must be cautious of the potential challenges ahead.
1400	7381	3	2	The setting impacts the cyclist in multiple ways. It evokes a range of emotions in him, including hope, determination, loneliness, and utter exhaustion. The desert - like terrain leaves him fatigued and parched. The bumpy road makes pedaling arduous, and the seemingly endless expanse of land makes him feel that the next town is an eternity away. During his journey, the cyclist recalled, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” Tumbleweeds symbolize the desolation of the dry desert, reminding him of his isolation in a vast expanse of sand and rocks. If the snake were to poison him, he would be left under the scorching sun until another unlucky cyclist found him. However, when he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, hope was restored. He regained his determination as he knew that the water he needed to survive was somewhere nearby. In the end, the setting enabled him to rediscover the hope deep within himself.
1401	7382	3	2	The setting's features have various impacts on the cyclist. For instance, within the first two miles of a ride segment, the terrain shifted from flat roads to short, rolling hills. This change forced the cyclist to pedal more vigorously when ascending the hills, leading to shortness of breath. Additionally, tumbleweeds crossed the cyclist's path, and a remarkably large snake, resembling a diamondback, blocked most of the pavement ahead. As a result, the cyclist had to wait for the snake to move to avoid getting bitten. Finally, upon reaching a relatively modern bathroom and drinking deeply from the sink, the cyclist felt an intense urge to find @PERSON1 and Wilber. Having access to water and reaching the destination brought the cyclist a sense of happiness. In conclusion, the different elements of the setting significantly influenced the cyclist's physical state, actions, and emotions during the ride.
1402	7383	3	2	The features of the setting had an impact on the cyclist. The cyclist encountered short, rolling hills, tumbleweeds, and a ridiculously large snake. These elements of the setting made the cyclist feel as though he was making no progress. In summary, the various aspects of the setting affected the cyclist's perception of his journey.
1403	7384	3	2	As the author journeyed through different areas, his feelings and experiences were transformed. Initially, the surroundings instilled courage in him. When passing through the first abandoned and empty town, the lush green trees and cool rivers around him, despite the scorching sun above, gave him the confidence to continue. These natural elements were the main factors that motivated his onward journey. However, as he trekked through the desolate desert, the bleak environment filled him with hopelessness and despair. Even in small details like the ghost - town and the useless pump, this change was evident. The ghost - town introduced the first hint of despair, and the non - functioning pump only exacerbated it. Throughout the story, the scenario and scenery continuously reflected and altered the author's mood. In conclusion, the changing settings played a crucial role in shaping the author's emotional state during his journey.
1404	7385	3	2	The rider was influenced by two men who provided incorrect directions. Instead of taking the correct route, the rider followed their advice and ended up taking a much longer way. As a result, the rider became extremely thirsty. Along the way, the rider also came across a snake. Eventually, the rider managed to find the nearest town and received help. In conclusion, the wrong directions given by the two men led to a series of difficulties for the rider, but they were ultimately able to find assistance.
1405	7386	3	2	Certain features of the setting affect the cyclist, namely the hills and the heat. The heat causes the cyclist to sweat profusely, resulting in fluid loss and the onset of dehydration. Meanwhile, the hills require the cyclist to exert more effort, causing the cyclist to become more fatigued. In conclusion, the hills and the heat in the setting have a detrimental impact on the cyclist's physical condition during the ride.
1406	7387	3	2	The setting's features had a multifaceted impact on the cyclist, influencing his confidence, energy, and determination. At the essay's start, the cyclist exuded confidence, stating, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite have my name written all over them,” indicating his belief in reaching Yosemite. However, when he ran out of water due to the heat, his confidence waned, and he feared for his life. The heat also depleted his energy, as evidenced by his statement, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Despite the loss of water and confidence, his determination to reach Yosemite intensified. This is in line with human nature, as the body enters survival mode and becomes resolute in the face of adversity. In conclusion, the setting's features significantly affected the cyclist in various ways.
1407	7388	3	2	Several elements in the story impact the author. The old men who offer advice tell him about a shortcut that turns out to be his most challenging ride. Additionally, factors like the heat, location, time of day, and time of the year pose difficulties. In California's desert on @DATE1, the intense heat requires a large supply of water, which becomes a major problem as the author runs out. He also encounters an abandoned Welch's grape - juice building with a picture of a boy enjoying grape juice, adding to his discomfort. Despite these challenges, he eventually finds a bait and tackle shop, which saves him. In the end, these combined obstacles made the journey arduous for the author, but he managed to overcome them.
1408	7389	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist is affected by the setting's features. The statement “The sun was beginning to beat down” indicates increasing heat, making cycling more difficult. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” shows that the cyclist has to contend not only with the heat but also with the physical exertion of riding up and down hills. Even small, rolling hills demand a significant amount of energy. The cyclist's desperation for water is evident in the quote “I got down on my hands and knees, walking the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar - like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” When he finally gets water, it comes out in an unappealing form and is extremely hot. In conclusion, these instances demonstrate how the setting's features affected the cyclist.
1409	7390	3	2	I firmly believe that the setting's features had a notable impact on the cyclist. The sharp turns and the sense of loneliness are key factors. As stated in the text, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first town.” This shows that the long stretch without reaching a town, combined with the sharp turns, would have made the cyclist's journey difficult and isolating. In conclusion, the sharp turns and loneliness of the setting clearly affected the cyclist.
1410	7391	3	2	The setting's features have a profound impact on the cyclist. The tough terrain and intense heat are major challenges. The cyclist struggles to find any signs of civilization, such as buildings or people, until reaching a single town. In the story “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist mentions encountering “tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake.” Being in the middle of the desert on a bike, with no clear direction and worsening conditions, offers little hope. Running almost out of water exacerbates the situation. The sun's heat and the cyclist's mind playing tricks on him further complicate his journey. In conclusion, the setting played a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's arduous journey.
1411	7392	3	2	"During the cyclist's ride, the features he experienced had an impact on both his body and mind. Initially, when on flat ground, he drank plenty of water and felt no fear. However, upon reaching the second town, he ran out of water. This situation troubled him, yet he remained optimistic, telling himself that the next town was only eighteen miles away. After that, the road turned into short, rolling hills, which started to pose problems. Dehydration began to set in, and each hill became a challenge. Once he had no more water, he sucked on pebbles, hoping it would ""take your mind off of thirst."" When he finally arrived at his destination, he was greatly relieved. Everything, from the physical effects of dehydration to the loss of hope, affected the cyclist during his ride."
1412	7393	3	2	The conditions in the California desert were extremely unfavorable for cyclists. The temperature was extremely high, and the air was very dry. The roads were full of hills, and for a cyclist, expending energy to go up and down these hills in the heat was extremely difficult. Moreover, there were no places along the way to refill water. The combination of the heat, lack of water, and high - energy expenditure led to severe dehydration. These conditions during the trip were not suitable for cyclists and could be very dangerous. In conclusion, cyclists need to be well - prepared when facing such harsh desert conditions.
1413	7394	3	2	The setting of the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed posted speed limit” had a significant impact on the cyclist. In June, he was riding through a desert, where the temperature was extremely high. The narrator even remarked, “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” Another feature of the setting that affected him was the presence of hills. The combination of the high - temperature desert environment and the challenging hills made the cyclist's journey arduous.
1414	7395	3	2	The features of the setting had a profound impact on the cyclist as he realized he was in the wrong area. He understood that he should not have taken the advice from those old men. He was upset and knew he should have followed his own judgment. He had a feeling that taking that route was a mistake and regretted letting the old men look at his map. Clearly, the features of the setting really affected him, causing him to second - guess his decisions.
1415	7396	3	2	In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, the main character encountered numerous difficulties. First, he was given wrong directions. Even worse, he had to cycle many miles in extreme temperatures, going up and down hills and pedaling strenuously. He also lacked cool water. As the character put it, “...followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees (Kurmaskie @NUM1).” This hot water did not quench his thirst; he said it tasted like battery acid. Eventually, he gathered his confidence and continued pedaling until he found a fish camp with a bathroom and a sink with cool water. After that, he headed to Yosemite and decided not to take anyone else's advice. In the end, his perseverance helped him overcome the challenges during the journey.
1416	7397	3	2	The setting's features had an impact on the cyclist. The setting was a California desert, resulting in extremely high outside temperatures. The hills were arduous to climb, and there were perils everywhere, such as venomous snakes. Not only was the terrain difficult to navigate, but the path was also overgrown. Weeds obstructed the cyclist's way, along with an absurdly large snake. These factors made it more challenging for the cyclist to reach their destination.
1417	7398	3	2	"All the towns the cyclist reached were ghost towns. As the author stated in the text, ""it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" This situation affected the cyclist because, with the towns being deserted, the cyclist was unable to refill their water supply."
1418	7399	3	2	"The cyclist was driven to complete the journey. When they were told it was only ""eighteen miles down the road,"" the cyclist thought it would take an eternity. However, they managed to reach the destination because they ""conserved their water"" and persevered. Even when the road turned into a rocky gravel road, making it more strenuous on their legs and water supply, they still kept going."
1419	7400	3	2	The cyclist's situation demands extensive preparation. The cyclist was in a hot desert region with winding roads and hills. To reach their destination, the cyclist needed an ample supply of water. As the story reveals, the conditions nearly endangered the cyclist's health.
1420	7401	3	2	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting significantly influences how the story unfolds. The setting includes deserted areas, the desert, and roadways. In the desert, the lack of water causes the cyclist to become dehydrated, and without it, the cyclist feared for their life. On the roadways, the speed limit was extremely high at fifty - five miles per hour, which was unfavorable considering the cyclist was engaged in a ""water - depleting activity."" When the cyclist found abandoned areas with water pumps, the liquid that came out, though it might be water, tasted like ""battery acid."" Clearly, the setting has a substantial impact on the story. Without this particular setting, the story would be vastly different from what it is."
1421	7402	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist encountered several problems during his journey. There was a limited supply of water, the roads were tough, and there were no cars on the road. These factors made the cyclist's journey extremely difficult. As stated on page @NUM1, paragraph one, the first sentence “It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean” shows the cyclist's despair. The harsh conditions were so overwhelming that the cyclist was on the verge of giving up hope. Fortunately, in the end, the cyclist found a place to stop, get water, and obtain directions, which provided a glimmer of hope in this arduous journey.
1422	7403	3	2	The setting's features have a significant impact on the cyclist. He attempts to get water, but when he tries the pump, “a tarlike substance oozes out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”. Since the cyclist has no water, continuing his journey becomes extremely difficult, and he is at risk of heat exhaustion. As he reaches the next town, he discovers that “the building - abandoned years earlier, had been a Welch's Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant”. Despite these challenges, he still has his sights set on reaching the next town to find something to drink. In conclusion, the features of the setting play a crucial role in influencing the cyclist's situation and actions.
1423	7404	3	2	In the story, numerous features of the setting affect the cyclist. The most impactful ones are the dry and hot climate and the rough terrain in the desert. The dry and hot conditions make his ride arduous. For instance, the heat leads to dehydration during his journey and causes the initial signs of heatstroke. The rough terrain poses an even greater challenge. As described in the story, riding through this difficult terrain makes him tired and exacerbates his dehydration. In summary, these setting features significantly impede the cyclist's progress.
1424	7405	3	2	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. Firstly, the emptiness creates a feeling of isolation. There are no cars, people, or buildings in sight. If something were to happen, there would be no way to inform others, and it would take a long time for anyone to find him. Paradoxically, this situation seems to give him an unexpected boost of energy. Secondly, the desert environment is extremely harsh. The sun beats down relentlessly as if he were the only person on the planet. There is a lack of water and food, and it hasn't rained in decades. The never - ending @CAPS1 road has numerous ups and downs, and there are various animals waiting for him. If he stops, a snake could easily bite him, which would be fatal. These extreme conditions and the harsh environment described in the text have a great deal of influence on the cyclist, shaping his experience and actions throughout the journey.
1425	7406	3	2	The setting of this short story has a detrimental effect on the cyclist. It causes him to become dehydrated and ultimately leads to his death. In this setting, he stumbles upon an abandoned factory, which fills him with a sense of hopelessness. Had the setting been different, his experience would have been altered. He wouldn't have faced the same desolation, and without the encounter with the reserve's people, he might have found himself on better roads instead of the old, difficult ones. In conclusion, the specific setting of the story plays a decisive role in the cyclist's tragic fate.
1426	7407	3	2	"The deserts and hills of the setting had the most significant impact on the cyclist. The author first recounts the depletion of the cyclist's water supply as he traversed the high deserts of California in June. The hills also had a major effect on him due to the intense heat typical of deserts, his limited water supply, and the fact that it was June. It is evident that the cyclist was far from happy during this arduous journey. Another misfortune the author mentions is the change in the road. The previous road was replaced by a series of rolling hills. Based on personal experience, these rolling hills are among the worst. Tall, steep hills are difficult to climb, but at least there is a chance of some cooling on the descent. However, with the so - called ""short, rolling hills"" in the cyclist's mind, each climb becomes more miserable, and the coast down the other side barely cools the skin, leaving the cyclist in a state of extreme pain. It is certain that after just a few of these deadly hills, the cyclist's spirit was completely burned out."
1427	7408	3	2	"In the story ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"", the features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist. At the start, the cyclist was happy as he was on his way to Yosemite National Park and had received advice on a shortcut that would shorten his trip. He rode strongly into the morning. When he reached the first stop, it was a place that once seemed a bustling town but was now a ghost town. With plenty of water, he continued, thinking he could make it to the next stop. The next stop was an old, abandoned gas station where the only water was @NUM1. The hot sun beat down on him as he regularly drank water. As the terrain changed, he thought he might die and be picked clean by vultures because he followed the advice of old - timers. Then he reached what seemed to be an old Welch's grape juice factory. He was on the verge of dying of thirst but kept going with little water under the hot sun. Next, the hills came, and he paced himself. Finally, he arrived at a modern - looking place with cool running water. An old man there gave him directions, which he gladly took. After constantly assuring himself that he would die, he was relieved to see the old man. From then on, he would always listen to the advice of such people because he had made it through the ordeal."
1428	7409	3	2	"The features of the setting have a crucial impact on the cyclist. Traveling a long distance in California during June is bound to be hot. If the cyclist does not have an adequate water supply, especially in case of getting lost, the setting features become extremely important. Insufficient water can lead to dehydration, which indeed happens to the cyclist in the essay. The statement ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" clearly shows that the cyclist was in a poor condition, especially when the sun was blazing down. Moreover, when dehydrated and tired, one may start to see things that are not real but are desired. The cyclist's statement ""I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get too excited"" indicates that he made a wise decision not to get his hopes up about a potentially non - existent building. Overall, the features of a setting for a cyclist can lead to various unforeseen circumstances, so cyclists need to be cautious."
1429	7410	3	2	"The features of the setting have an extremely negative impact on the cyclist's performance on the ride to the meeting town. It was already bad that the cyclist ran out of water, but on top of that, he faced rolling hills and poor road conditions. All these elements of the setting played a huge role in affecting the cyclist's performance. The author mentions ""it noted the terrain changing. That way was replaced by those rolling hills."" The cyclist also describes seeing ""tumbleweed around my matt and an incredibly large snake; it really did look like bad luck blocked the majority of the movement in front of me."" These setting features made it difficult for the cyclist to progress. The hills, snakes, and tumbleweed disrupted the cyclist's ability to move forward. Running out of water made it hard for him to gather the energy, and the sight of a deadly snake added to his fear and further complicated his performance. In conclusion, the adverse setting features severely hampered the cyclist's progress on the ride."
1430	7411	3	2	Saying that the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a way that implies an older person knows nothing is inaccurate. In fact, it means that as one gets older, the information they have may not always be correct. For example, in the essay, when the cyclist was on his way to the town, he learned to rely on his map rather than the opinion of a man because the man's advice was wrong. This shows that the features of the setting can force the cyclist to make better - informed decisions and not blindly trust others. In conclusion, the setting features can be a learning experience for the cyclist, teaching him to be more discerning in using information.
1431	7412	3	2	The cyclist first arrived at a town that resembled a ghost town, as there was not a single person there. The next town, located @NUM1 miles down the road, was no better. During the journey, the cyclist encountered several problems, including snakes, running out of water, the presence of a hill, and the poor condition of the road. These challenges made the cyclist's journey quite difficult.
1432	7413	3	2	In the story “DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT,” the features of the setting have a negative impact on the cyclist. The terrain transitions from being relatively mild to rough and rolling. Since the author is unfamiliar with the layout of this terrain, they start to struggle. The author becomes uncertain about the route and begins to face obstacles such as tumbleweeds, snakes, and a shortage of water. Running out of water makes continuing the journey extremely stressful. The author fears dying of dehydration before reaching Yosemite National Park. Finally, with great strength and determination, the author reaches a fish camp. There, they are able to refill their water supply and regain their strength before continuing the journey.
1433	7414	3	2	The features of the setting take a toll on the cyclist. The cyclist finds themselves in a hot and dry area without any water. Pedaling up hills further exhausts the cyclist. It is likely that the cyclist is dehydrated, and their condition continues to deteriorate. As the situation worsens, the cyclist's ability to continue the journey becomes increasingly difficult.
1434	7415	3	2	In the passage “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. Cyclists generally have good physical fitness and can cycle for long periods. However, weather conditions can impact them, as was the case in this passage. The cyclist was determined and confident about completing the journey, stating, “I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so - a test of my inner spirit.” Despite this confidence, the setting had an effect. For instance, “Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake…” and “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” The cyclist became tired and exhausted, worn down by the weather and terrain. Just as one's ability to play basketball outdoors can be affected by hot and humid weather, the features of a setting can clearly impact people.
1435	7416	3	2	During the biker's adventure, heat and lack of water pose significant challenges. In the short story, when the cyclist feels lost, they mention, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” indicating that they faced the extreme heat of the desert during the ride. The cyclist also states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,” showing that they not only endured the heat but also suffered from a lack of water. These facts and quotes clearly illustrate the threats the biker encountered on the long bike - ride.
1436	7417	3	2	The desert setting significantly impacts the cyclist in multiple ways. Firstly, the cyclist is running out of water, which leads to dehydration. As a result, the cyclist may die and start to see mirages. The text indicates that the cyclist staggered into the store, demonstrating their unease due to the lack of water. Secondly, the cyclist is unsure of the path they are on, causing them to panic. This panic is unhelpful, especially considering the water shortage and dehydration. The desert setting is extremely hot, with little to no shade and a rough landscape mainly composed of hot sand. The cyclist requires a large amount of water, but they are running low. In conclusion, the desert setting clearly has a substantial effect on the cyclist.
1437	7418	3	2	"The desert setting in the summer has a notable impact on the cyclist. For example, the cyclist's speed was significantly reduced; the text states, ""The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water - depleting 12 mph."" This reduction in speed affected the cyclist's ability to find water. Additionally, the extreme heat made it difficult for the cyclist to obtain the necessary water. As described, ""I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn't cool down."" This shows that the setting was taking a toll on the cyclist, who was in desperate need of water. The desert setting also affected the cyclist's mind. The cyclist believed they were seeing mirages and was afraid of swallowing a stone due to possible bumps. In summary, the desert setting has a profound impact on the cyclist's physical and mental state, hampering their ability to function effectively."
1438	7419	3	2	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead"", the features of the desert setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. The setting makes the cyclist's journey difficult. For instance, the cyclist couldn't go fast, which affected their ability to find water. The extreme heat also made it hard for the cyclist to get cool water. When the cyclist pumped the handle for water, it didn't cool down. This shows how the setting was making it challenging for the cyclist to obtain the water needed to continue. The setting also affects the cyclist's mind. The cyclist thought they were seeing mirages and was worried about hitting a bump. Different parts of the setting have different effects on the cyclist. Sometimes it made the cyclist feel depressed, and at other times, seeing a bait - shop made them feel happy. In conclusion, the desert setting in the story has a complex and far - reaching impact on the cyclist."
1439	7420	3	2	"The setting has a significant impact on the cyclist as the terrain and weather conditions play crucial roles. The change in terrain from a flat road to short, rolling hills, as described in the text, ""flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"", made the ride more difficult. This added to the cyclist's frustration and contributed to their dehydration due to the increased effort without an adequate water supply. The heat also had a substantial effect. Even when the cyclist didn't seem to notice it, as in the statement, ""The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it"", the heat was sapping the cyclist's energy. This led to increased water consumption, which in turn affected the cyclist's ability to carry enough water to complete the ride. In conclusion, the combination of challenging terrain and persistent heat in the setting had a detrimental impact on the cyclist's performance and ability to finish the ride."
1440	7421	3	2	"The cyclist was riding in a hot desert environment. This setting made the cyclist extremely thirsty and less active. As the story states, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt."" The heat of the desert sapped the cyclist's energy and depleted their water supply. The limited amount of water in the bottles and the visible signs of sweating indicate the harsh conditions the cyclist was facing. In conclusion, the hot desert setting had a negative impact on the cyclist, causing thirst and reduced activity."
1441	7422	3	2	In my view, recycling is essential for cyclists. People often discard trash cans containing soda. Nowadays, cyclists sometimes face challenges related to this. The rule needs to be changed. In conclusion, people should save materials to create new items, thereby contributing to a better - quality world for cycling - related things.
1442	7423	3	2	A cyclist listens to the advice of the old - timers. As time passes, he begins to feel tired. After the scenery changes to a desert, he becomes angry. He blames himself for taking advice from those old - timers who have never left the area. Despite his self - criticism, he realizes that he must continue his journey, learning from this experience that not all advice may be suitable for every situation.
1443	7424	3	2	The setting significantly impacts the cyclist in multiple ways. At the start, the cyclist keeps his head up, determined to reach his destination. When he reaches what he calls the “fork of sorts,” he encounters his first problem. In need of water, he finds the pumps rusty. All he can get from them is a tarlike substance followed by blackish water. He tests it, hoping for the best, but it tastes like battery acid. Thirsty as he is, he has to move on in search of another water supply. As he becomes increasingly dehydrated and unsteady on his bike, a huge snake lies across the road. With great difficulty, he maneuvers around it and continues. Later, when he finally has a chance for a drink, he discovers an old, abandoned Welch's grape juice factory. Despite the disappointment, he presses on. Eventually, he reaches a fishing supply store, where he can take a break and have a refreshing drink. Despite the tough, teasing, and ironic setting, the cyclist's determination helps him reach his destination with a smile.
1444	7425	3	2	The features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist due to his endurance. This includes how long he can ride without stopping, how long he can pedal uphill, how many bumps he can ride over, and how long he can go without a drink of water. The setting tests his physical and mental limits, and his ability to endure these factors determines his progress during the ride.
1445	7426	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist through the changes that occur during his bike ride. At the beginning, the cyclist starts with a smiling face. However, the condition of the road, the hot weather, and the lack of directional signals all take a toll on him. Moreover, he has to replace a flat tire on his bike. Despite these difficulties, his initial determination helps him persevere, and he continues his journey, adapting to the challenging setting.
1446	7427	3	2	The features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist. In June, he was cycling through a desert. The intense heat made the journey extremely arduous, and the bumpy roads required him to pedal with greater force. The long roads demanded more effort from him, yet he maintained the spirit and determination to reach Yosemite. During his journey, he encountered a snake, which indicated that he was venturing deeper into the desert. Despite these challenges, his resolve remained unshaken as he continued his pursuit.
1447	7428	3	2	"The setting of the cyclist's journey clearly has an impact on his mood. Throughout the journey, the external environment mirrors the turmoil in his mind. This is evident from the initial reservoir, the empty desert, the hills, the Welch factory, and finally the fish camp. The reservoir is a haven, a safe place that provides everything the cyclist needs. He is optimistic and eager to follow the advice of the old men. When he reaches a ghost - town, it foreshadows a dangerous future, but he remains calm. Then, at a water pump, he gets battery acid instead of water, which marks a shift in mood. He starts to describe his surroundings as ""the high deserts of California"" with the sun blazing and water running low, and his hopes begin to decline. The transition from a flat road to rolling hills reflects the turmoil in his head, as the terrain becomes more difficult and his chances of survival diminish. Crossing a snake adds to his despair. The situation reaches a climax at the Welch factory, an abandoned juice factory, symbolizing lost hope. Finally, when he arrives at the fish camp, he is relieved to be alive and his spirits are lifted. It is clear that the setting has played a crucial role in influencing the cyclist's emotional state."
1448	7429	3	2	"The features of the setting have numerous effects on the cyclist. As he rides along the road, he faces a dilemma. Weeds cross his path, and a ridiculously large snake blocks the pavement in front of him. He has to stop because of the snake, which slows him down and scares him. He was already struggling with thirst, and the encounter with the snake, which ""really did look like a diamondback,"" only adds to his distress. Then, he spots a building ahead and discovers it's a walrus Grape Juice factory. He hopes it might have water, but it's abandoned. To deal with his thirst, he grabs some pebbles, as he read that sucking on stones can help take the mind off thirst by circulating the remaining spit. Eventually, he comes across a fishing camp, where he gets instructions on how to proceed. This is a relief as he reaches a secure place, gets proper directions, and can learn from the mistake of listening to the older men at the start. In conclusion, the setting has had a profound and varied impact on the cyclist's journey."
1449	7430	3	2	The features of the setting influence the cyclist by instilling in him the hope that the finishing line is near. However, the surrounding environment is desolate, with no cars, buildings, or any structures in sight. This emptiness, while perhaps initially giving the cyclist hope, also presents a sense of isolation and uncertainty. Nevertheless, this setting continues to play a role in the cyclist's state of mind, as he presses on towards his destination.
1450	7431	3	2	The conclusion of the journey affected the author in multiple ways. He was exhausted due to the scorching heat, had limited water supply, and got lost. As he traveled further, the situation seemed to deteriorate. A man gave him wrong directions, and as the author noted, the man probably hadn't left his porch in decades. With water becoming scarce and the journey becoming more difficult, the author faced increasing challenges. In the end, these difficulties during the journey had a significant impact on the author's experience.
1451	7432	3	2	In the story, the cyclist describes how the road conditions deteriorate. There is a warning sign stating, “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit.” Additionally, the road is dry. This description helps to convey the challenges the cyclist faces on the journey.
1452	7433	3	2	In the story, numerous elements influenced the cyclist during his journey. The first aspect of the setting that affected him was an old, non - functioning water pump. When it did work, the water had a terrible taste. Next, he encountered rough terrain; he described it as “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” When he found a building, it turned out to be abandoned. Eventually, he reached a town, rested after his long journey, and learned not to take advice from strangers. This experience taught him a valuable lesson about relying on the counsel of unfamiliar people.
1453	7434	3	2	The terrain had rough, desert - like features. For a cyclist, this type of terrain presents significant difficulties. For instance, there is a lack of water, and the available water has a battery - acid flavor. These factors had a major impact on the cyclist, making the journey extremely challenging.
1454	7435	3	2	Not two miles into the next part of the ride, the cyclist (Kurmaskie) noticed the terrain changing from flat to short, rolling hills. As the terrain became more difficult, the cyclist grew more ignorant and hopeless. He had wide rings of dried sweat on his shirt and found it laughable that he could potentially drop from heatstroke on a beautiful June day just because he listened to some old men who rarely left their porches. Although he wasn't going to die, he made a big deal out of his struggles. Fortunately, he survived and learned a lesson. He decided to tell others not to accept travel advice from old men who haven't left their porches in a long time, like those from the Carter era. He was on a long, hot road and started criticizing the old men. However, he wasn't forced to take their advice. His selfish attempt to shorten the trip led to him facing rough terrain, heat, and dehydration, which made him feel hopeless, angry, and self - pitying.
1455	7436	3	2	The features of the setting have multiple impacts on the cyclist. The cyclist is traveling through the high deserts of California in June. In the story, it is mentioned that when he reached a town, the water pump was rusted. He exerted all his strength to work the handle, but what came out was a tar - like substance followed by brackish water that he couldn't drink. Moreover, the cyclist had been regularly consuming water from his bottles. Also, the old - timers misinformed him; they said the towns were close, but in reality, they were far apart. These challenges made the cyclist's journey arduous and taught him to be more cautious about relying on others' information.
1456	7437	3	2	"A cyclist's journey can be influenced by numerous factors. This particular cyclist seemed to have bad luck. He initially mentioned his plan to travel to Yosemite, and some men he met gave him a tip. Being quite confident in their advice, he followed their suggestions but ended up getting lost. The cyclist was traveling in the high deserts of California in June, which means he was journeying during the summer with dry air. When he reached the first ""town"" he saw, he couldn't obtain the water he needed to rehydrate. While traveling through the desert, he also encountered a snake, which slowed him down. Due to the heat and his fatigue, he began to see mirages that affected him. All these factors combined made his journey through the desert long and tiring. They also taught him the lesson that he shouldn't take advice from old men who haven't left their porch, as their information might be out - of - date."
1457	7438	3	2	A little boy was riding his bike when he met an old man. The old man told him about a shortcut, so the boy took that road. Unfortunately, something went wrong during his journey. This incident shows that one should be cautious when following advice from strangers, as the suggested shortcut might not always lead to a smooth path.
1458	7439	3	2	"In ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting features have a significant impact on the main character, the cyclist. After leaving the house where he met the old men, the cyclist rode across extensive flat desert terrain. Under the intense sun, he became dehydrated. Subsequently, the terrain changed; the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. This change further tested his endurance as he had to navigate down the hills while being dehydrated and on the verge of exhaustion due to fatigue. Overall, the changing setting in the story presented continuous challenges to the cyclist's journey."
1459	7440	3	2	"Heat, desolation, and the presence of a snake are the features of the setting that affect the cyclist. Firstly, the hot days with limited water supply lead to his dehydration. Moreover, in the desolate area, there is no one around to assist him if he gets lost. As Joe Kurmaskie described, ""there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" Finally, a large snake appeared on the road, forcing the cyclist to maneuver around it. These setting features combined create a difficult and challenging journey for the cyclist."
1460	7441	3	2	The setting is one of the most crucial factors for a cyclist. If the terrain or weather conditions are unfavorable, especially when it is extremely hot, it poses significant challenges for the cyclist. For example, high temperatures can lead to dehydration and fatigue, while difficult terrain can make the ride physically demanding. In conclusion, a cyclist needs to carefully consider the setting before embarking on a journey to ensure a safe and successful ride.
1461	7442	3	2	The features of the setting impact the cyclist, who faces a challenging problem. For instance, I noticed the terrain changing. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. After passing the first few landmarks, there was a large highway. This shows that when he arrived, the road conditions were poor, and the large highway presented a significant obstacle. In conclusion, the setting's features clearly pose difficulties for the cyclist.
1462	7443	3	2	The setting's features affect the cyclist in multiple ways. The extreme heat outside is so intense that he could have passed out and died. He also encounters a snake that scares him greatly, yet he manages to pass it. He spots a building that might have been helpful, but it turns out to be an abandoned Welch factory. As he continues, he comes across a fish place and goes to the bathroom to get water. Then, someone asks him where he is going and tries to mislead him, but he decides to use his map instead of relying on others' advice. In conclusion, the challenging setting and various encounters test the cyclist's resilience and decision - making.
1463	7444	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead,” a cyclist obtains outdated information from a couple of old men. As he follows their directions, he realizes they are inaccurate and, at times, dangerous. The setting further hinders him as he is in a desert filled with ghost towns and sweltering heat, which makes him doubt his ability to survive. For example, when he reaches a fork in the road, he finds “several rusty pumps” and “one ramshackle shed.” With little water left and the intense heat, this does not help his confidence. Also, the description “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” shows that after cycling for a while, with no water and extreme exhaustion, his hopes are diminished. In conclusion, the desolate and hot setting in “Rough Road Ahead” undermines the cyclist's hope and confidence of getting out alive.
1464	7445	3	2	The cyclist is in a desert and out of water, so it's likely he's not happy. The so - called “ghost towns” do nothing to boost his confidence. The rugged hills make him angry. However, the heat has the most significant impact on him. In conclusion, the harsh desert environment, with its ghost towns, rugged hills, and intense heat, takes a toll on the cyclist's mental and physical state.
1465	7447	3	2	The features of the land have numerous effects on the cyclist. For example, the first two buildings he reaches are abandoned, preventing him from obtaining food or water. He also observes that the terrain is changing from flat to rolling hills, which places more strain on his legs. Moreover, the hot and dry land causes him to become dehydrated. In conclusion, the characteristics of the land, including the abandoned buildings, changing terrain, and arid conditions, all negatively impact the cyclist.
1466	7448	3	2	In this story, the setting has numerous impacts on the cyclist. He attempts to obtain directions, yet the individuals he asks lack accurate knowledge, highlighting the need for caution when seeking guidance. Subsequently, he desires a drink, but the water tastes like battery acid, resulting in an unsatisfactory outcome. As the cyclist resumes his journey, he encounters difficulties on the road. The poor road condition forces him to travel below the speed limit, and at one point, he feels as if he is on the verge of death. Fortunately, he discovers a bathroom and drinks from the sink, which provides some relief.
1467	7449	3	2	The features of the setting influence the cyclist in several ways. At the beginning of the account, the cyclist expresses his enjoyment of the tranquility of an early - summer evening and engaging conversations with the elderly locals. He was relishing the atmosphere. However, the mood rapidly shifts to doubt when he disregards the advice of the long - time residents and his dwindling water supply becomes a pressing concern. Doubt is then replaced by a sense of relief when he spots the sign for Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp and can get a drink from the bathroom faucets. This relief is followed by satisfaction as he resolves to always rely on the good map in the future.
1468	7450	3	2	The setting negatively impacts the author in multiple ways. Firstly, the heat of the setting leads to the author becoming dehydrated. Dehydration occurs when the body starts to shut down due to a lack of water. Additionally, the setting undermines the author's confidence and compels him to search for water. The statement “I hung my head” indicates that he was depressed. This demonstrates that regardless of one's choices or the path one follows, there is always a risk of death under certain circumstances. In conclusion, this is how the setting affected the author during his bike ride.
1469	7451	3	2	I believe that the settings made it a bit more challenging to avoid giving up. Moreover, it shows that one can perform better in life when faced with challenges. In difficult settings, the struggle to persevere builds resilience and character. By not succumbing to the hardships presented by the settings, a person can grow and achieve more than they might in an easier environment.
1470	7452	3	2	The setting affects the cyclist significantly. The warm and dry climate causes him to sweat excessively, necessitating a greater intake of water. When there are no people around, it becomes more arduous for him to continue, especially when he is unsure if he is on the right path and has no one to confirm. With only abandoned buildings in the area, water is scarce, making the journey more exhausting and physically demanding. If the setting were different, the cyclist would not have endured such a traumatic experience.
1471	7453	3	2	The setting presents numerous features that impact the cyclist. One such feature is the sun intensifying its heat, which renders the cyclist hot and thirsty. This thirst compels the cyclist to consume his limited water supply. Thus, the sun affects the cyclist in multiple ways. Another feature causing problems for the cyclist is the presence of dilapidated “ghost towns” composed of “ram - shackle sheds” and “several rusty pumps”. These features instill a sense of hopelessness in the cyclist. Moreover, as the cyclist becomes dehydrated, these places offer no water source. Obstacles like “tumbleweeds” and “pavement - blocking snakes” also influence the cyclist as he travels on the “@NUM1 Road” at a speed of only “12 MPH”. The final obstacle is the terrain he rides on, specifically a “long cropping hill”. This hill exhausts the cyclist as he expends a great deal of energy to climb it. In conclusion, the various features of the setting significantly impede the cyclist's journey.
1472	7454	3	2	The features of the setting can have an impact on a cyclist. Some of the major issues a cyclist may face include rough roads, bike inspections, wearing necessary equipment, and adhering to the posted speed limit. One might think that with a cyclist focusing on these aspects, the setting features would not have much of an effect. However, maintaining a speed of @NUM1 or dealing with a water - depleting @NUM2 can make life seem harsh. Tumbleweeds can be a result of high speeds, but if cyclists use the proper equipment, they can avoid serious injury. Instead of the old adage about not taking candy from strangers, a better piece of advice for solo cyclists would be to be cautious about certain situations. In conclusion, the setting features and the cyclist's actions are all factors that need to be considered during a cycling journey.
1473	7455	3	2	In my opinion, the features of the setting had a profound impact on the cyclist. The author described rough terrain and isolation, writing about “flat roads being replaced by short, rolling hills, tumbleweeds crossing the path, and a ridiculously large snake”. From this description, I inferred that the author was alone in the desert under terrible conditions. A tone of resentment was also evident. It seemed that the author regretted taking the “shortcut” that led to the desert. The hot weather was another significant factor. The author struggled to keep balance in a dehydrated state, which shows a lack of planning regarding the ride's duration and water conservation. Overall, the rough terrain, desolation, and hot temperatures all took a toll on the cyclist. In conclusion, the setting features were major obstacles for the cyclist's journey.
1474	7456	3	2	The water pump, the Welch’s Factory, and the fish camp were the setting features that most affected the cyclist. The cyclist was desperately thirsty when he came across the pump. Initially, he was excited, thinking he could get water, and he pumped “with all my strength”. However, the water “had the flavor of battery acid”, so he had to continue his ride thirsty, which is extremely risky while cycling. The Welch’s Factory then further dampened his spirits. Already suffering from lack of water, seeing the “sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice” was an ironic and demoralizing sight, reflecting his own desperate situation. I can relate to this as I'm allergic to peanuts. Once on a long car trip, I slept through lunch and was starving. After two hours on a deserted highway, seeing a sign for a “@CAPS2’s peanut shade” was heart - wrenching. The fish camp, on the other hand, saved the cyclist's life. He “drank deeply from the sinle” and was so grateful that he wanted to kiss the camp owners. This is similar to my car - trip experience when we finally found a sushi bar after hours of hunger. In conclusion, these setting features had a significant and diverse impact on the cyclist's journey.
1475	7457	3	2	I'm not entirely sure about the story I'm going to talk about, but the name of it sounds pretty good. If I were in the story, I don't think I'd do well because it seems really crazy. However, it could also be a great starting point for writing. Maybe the wildness of the story could inspire unique ideas. In conclusion, despite my uncertainty, the story has the potential to be an interesting subject for exploration.
1476	7458	3	2	The cyclist is in Lodi, California, which is part of the desert. The desert has a significant impact on the cyclist. Firstly, the extreme heat is unbearable. Secondly, the heat makes him extremely thirsty, and he is running out of water. Moreover, since he is far from any towns, he cannot replenish his water supply. Clearly, the setting has a detrimental effect on the cyclist.
1477	7459	3	2	The cyclist is predominantly affected by the heat. He is expending all his energy and willpower to reach Yosemite. The scorching sun and the shortage of water make him extremely fatigued and cause him to use his energy inefficiently. At one point, he has to verify whether the building he sees is a mirage because the intense heat could be playing tricks on his mind. In conclusion, the heat is severely hampering the cyclist's progress.
1478	7460	3	2	The conditions the cyclist was in were extremely harsh. As he continued his ride, he got hotter and hotter. After finishing his last bit of water, he hoped to find more. Taking advice from an old man was his final decision. In the end, the difficult conditions and this decision will likely shape the outcome of his journey.
1479	7461	3	2	The features of the setting have a negative impact on the cyclist, causing him to lose both courage and optimism. For instance, the thought “and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat - stroke on a gorgeous day” shows his loss of courage. Although he wanted to be brave and strong, the hot day and excessive sweating made him feel weak. The statement “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear” exemplifies his loss of optimism. Instead of thinking he would make it, the rough setting made him believe he was going to die. With bumps on the ride and the sun intensifying his thirst, he became less courageous and optimistic. Overall, the setting severely undermined the cyclist's mental state.
1480	7462	3	2	The features of his journey are extremely cruel. The “rolling hills” force him to work harder to overcome them. As he exerts more effort, he sweats more and thus requires more fluids. The lack of water only exacerbates the situation. Poisonous elements don't bother him as long as he leaves them alone. The poor condition of the roads, combined with the hills, adds to his difficulties. Rough roads make it arduous for him to pass through and climb over the hills. In conclusion, this cyclist is facing a very tough journey.
1481	7463	3	2	The rough terrain and hills in the setting had an impact on the cyclist. As stated in the reading, “a flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This kind of terrain would exhaust a person without an adequate water supply, and the cyclist might also be unsure of the direction he was traveling. Additionally, the hot June weather in California was another factor affecting him. In conclusion, these elements of the setting made the cyclist's journey more challenging.
1482	7464	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting's features significantly affected the cyclist. The cyclist was traveling through a dry, hot, and dangerous area in the deserts of California in June. There was a scarcity of water, and the terrain was rough and bumpy. The speaker mentioned, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake...” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist encountered land blockages and dangerous animals, which caused him to slow down. The high temperatures took a toll on the cyclist, as described by the speaker, “@CAPS1 rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on gorgeous day in June...” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). In summary, the intense features of the setting presented numerous difficulties for the cyclist.
1483	7465	3	2	The features of the setting impact the cyclist in multiple ways. He becomes delusional, as evidenced by his statement that if he were lucky, one of the stones would lodge in his throat. Moreover, he is dehydrated because he has used up all his water and has to exert great effort to reach the next town. In conclusion, the setting's features have a detrimental effect on the cyclist's physical and mental state.
1484	7466	3	2	Initially, the features of the setting were favorable for the cyclist. He was on a flat road with cool lines that kept him from getting too hot. However, the situation worsened. There was a lack of water, the road was no longer flat, and snakes appeared. The cool pines were also gone. In conclusion, the change in the setting's features made the cyclist's journey more arduous.
1485	7467	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,” the setting's features had a profound impact on the cyclist. While riding, he passed through a desert in June, a sweltering month. Deserts are characterized by a lack of water, and in the scorching June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been in a forest or rolling grasslands, he could have found water from a river or creek if necessary. Another aspect that affected the cyclist was the psychological impact of the desert. Deserts are often depicted as dry, desolate wastelands in movies, which can be intimidating. As he rode through the desert with low water supplies, thoughts of death, like “going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean,” raced through his terrified mind. In a city or rolling farmland, he might not have been as terrified as there are people and safe places. In conclusion, the setting played a crucial role in influencing the cyclist's experience and emotions, highlighting the importance of considering setting when reading a story.
1486	7468	3	2	The setting's features significantly impacted the cyclist. In a desert - like environment, he ran out of water and was mostly alone. As described in the story, the cyclist said, “I got down on my hands and knees, working the water handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar - like substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” Before reaching this point, he had been consuming a large amount of water, and as he neared depletion, he desperately needed to refill. However, the lack of a water source in the setting was a major hindrance. This is a prime example of how the setting's features affected the cyclist.
1487	7469	3	2	The setting's features had a profound impact on the cyclist, causing dehydration, fatigue, and disorientation. After cycling for some time, the cyclist had almost depleted his water supply, yet he still had a long way to go to reach his destination. He attempted to find a place to refill his water but found nothing in the vicinity. The intense sun, minimal water, and lack of a clear direction made him tired. Moreover, he was lost, as there were no cars, buildings, or people around. In the event of an injury or illness, no one would have been able to assist him. In conclusion, dehydration, tiredness, and getting lost were the key ways in which the setting's features affected the cyclist.
1488	7470	3	2	The features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist. He runs out of water while trying to traverse the terrain. The cyclist is biking through a desert in California, as evidenced by the statement “I was travelling through the high deserts of California”. The term “high” implies the presence of hills, which further complicates the journey. Later in the story, the cyclist mentions that “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills”, indicating a change in terrain. Another feature is the tumbleweeds he encounters. As he says, “tumbleweeds crossed in path”. These tumbleweeds, associated with the desert, make him think about death and being picked apart by birds, highlighting the psychological effect of the setting on the cyclist.
1489	7471	3	2	When the setting aligns with the theme, the story becomes more coherent. For instance, in a sad story, an ugly, rainy day creates a perfect match. This alignment enhances the story, as the setting and theme complement each other, making the overall narrative more impactful and engaging.
1490	7472	3	2	When it is hot outside, dehydration can occur rapidly. Additionally, cycling on long, hilly terrains consumes a great deal of energy. Such conditions can be tough on equipment, the body, and the mind. To prepare, one should dress appropriately and carry an ample supply of water. Ensure that your tires are inflated and all equipment is in proper working condition. Plan a well - thought - out route with stops where you can rest and rehydrate. Also, maintaining a good diet is crucial as food provides the necessary energy for the journey.
1491	7473	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the challenging setting significantly influenced the cyclist. The difficult terrain made the cyclist even more resolved to complete the journey. For instance, the author described, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path, and a ridiculously large snake—it really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This shows that regardless of the severe obstacles, the cyclist persevered. The terrain’s impact on the cyclist, by maintaining his determination, is a phenomenon also seen in other sports. In football, players often use problems as motivation to push harder and finish the game. Overall, the setting in the essay had a profound and positive effect on the cyclist's determination.
1492	7474	3	2	In the story, the cyclist was affected by the directions given by an old - man. The old - man provided these directions as a shortcut to help the cyclist. However, I believe the cyclist thinks the directions are out - of - date. The story states, “never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” Additionally, the rough terrain in the setting also affected the cyclist as he had to ride up and down what he considered difficult paths. In conclusion, both the outdated - seeming directions and the rough terrain were the main factors that affected the cyclist's journey.
1493	7475	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting have a substantial impact on the cyclist. The terrain and the heat are the primary factors. The terrain, with its numerous hills, affects the cyclist greatly. As the text mentions, “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.” Since going down a hill implies having gone up one first, the energy required to pedal up the hills takes a toll on the cyclist. The heat also affects the cyclist. The text states, “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke,” indicating extremely hot conditions. Heat hampers the cyclist's ability to function at their best by quickly draining energy. In summary, the hills in the terrain and the draining effect of the heat are how the setting features impact the cyclist in the story.
1494	7476	3	2	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed posted speed limit,” the setting features affect the cyclist in multiple ways. Firstly, the old and deserted towns pose a problem. The cyclist remarks, “This place might have been a thriving little spot… but now it was a ghost town.” As a result, he couldn't obtain water or directions. Secondly, the bumpy roads and numerous hills are challenging. The text says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The cyclist had to exert all his strength to navigate over these hills. Thirdly, the weather and the desert environment take a toll. The cyclist reveals, “I was traveling through the deserts of California in June.” He was hot, sweaty, thirsty, tired, and desperate to find non - deserted towns with water. In conclusion, the roads, deserted towns, and lack of water in the setting all combined to affect the cyclist's journey.
1495	7477	3	2	In the story “Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limits,” the setting is a long, desolate road with “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The rough road that the cyclist has to ride on can have a significant impact on him. The uneven surface may cause the cyclist to lose balance, waste more energy, and potentially damage the bicycle. In conclusion, the desolate and rough nature of the road in the setting is likely to pose various challenges for the cyclist during his journey.
1496	7478	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's essay, he recounts his desert bike - riding experience. Throughout the piece, the setting significantly impacts the cyclist. Initially, Kurmaskie is confident as he listens to a group of elderly men giving him advice. The setting is tranquil and pleasant; he notes that he ""enjoyed the serenity of an early - summer evening"". The term ""serenity"" evokes a sense of calm and peace.  However, as his journey progresses, the setting changes. In a desert ghost town, he encounters a ""ramshackle shed, several rutsy pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold the lamest mule"", which troubles him. Later, the terrain alters, and he spots a ""Rough Road Ahead"" sign. With his water supply dwindling, his confidence turns into deeper doubt and worry.  Finally, Kurmaskie sees a sign for a fish camp. There, he finds a ""rather modern bathroom"" where he can get a drink, and his hope is restored. As the setting varies, Kurmaskie's state of mind shifts from confidence to determination and finally to relief."
1497	7479	3	2	The setting's features have a negative impact on the cyclist. He is in a desert - like area during a time when water is scarce, and he can easily get exhausted. I believe he made a wrong choice by asking old people for directions. He should have asked someone in charge of a store since they are often asked such questions. Moreover, he could have died if a snake had bitten him or if he suffered from heatstroke, as he mentioned. In conclusion, the unsuitable setting and his poor decision - making regarding seeking advice put the cyclist in a very precarious situation.
1498	7480	3	2	"The story commences when the author, a cyclist, takes directions from several elderly men to reach his biking destination, Yosemite National Park. He starts with a fair amount of confidence and arrives at the first town described by the men. It is a ghost town, which amuses the author. Still believing he is in good shape, he sets off again and reaches a place with ""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule"". At this point, with his water supply running low, he begins to worry.  He continues past rolling hills, snakes, tumbleweeds, and various landmarks. Each one chips away at his confidence and excitement. The juice factory is particularly demoralizing as he is severely dehydrated and losing all hope.  Finally, he reaches the water he has been seeking at ""Gary Wilber's fish camp"". He refreshes himself and his fading hope. Every time he passes a landmark, his confidence takes a hit. Even though he is in poor physical condition, the lack of hope for his anticipated sunny and breezy vacation drains him from within. In the end, this journey shows how external elements and the loss of hope can greatly affect a person's experience."
1499	7481	3	2	"The features of the setting had a negative impact on the cyclist. He was in the desert during summer with little water and no available places to get a drink. For instance, he states, ""There was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind"". This clearly shows how the setting affected him, as he had nowhere to go to quench his thirst. In conclusion, the cyclist's setting was unfavorable due to the lack of resources and the desolate environment."
1500	7482	3	2	"The setting's features had detrimental effects on the cyclist. The rocky roads and steep hills forced him to pedal harder. The advice from the old people led him onto the rough path. The desert heat made him extremely thirsty, causing his water supply to deplete rapidly. He remarks, ""When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid"", indicating the poor quality of his remaining water. The heat was a constant threat; he mentions, ""Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from the heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June"".  This man's bike ride to Yosemite was extremely dangerous. The combination of difficult terrain, heat, and lack of proper resources put his life at risk. In conclusion, the adverse setting made this journey a perilous one for the cyclist."
1501	7483	3	2	"The setting can significantly impact the cyclist. The location can alter the events and their progression. For instance, if the story had occurred in Alaska, the cyclist would not have experienced ""Wide rings of sweat circling my shirt."" Instead, they would have been combating hypothermia. The setting is crucial as it influences all the details in the writing."
1502	7484	3	2	Initially, the terrain was in good condition and he was confident. However, when he reached the first town, it resembled one of those ghost towns seen in movies. The next town did not appear when he was told it would. The terrain resembled a desert, with no water for miles. Nevertheless, he remained determined. Eventually, he managed to find some water.
1503	7485	3	2	"In ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the setting had an impact on the cyclist. For example, he came across a ""ramshackle shed"" and attempted to find water. This affected him, as described in the text: ""I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" This quote indicates that he was determined to find water, perhaps any kind of liquid."
1504	7486	3	2	"The setting affected the cyclist by depriving him of hydration and weakening his physical state. The large hills and rough roads gradually sapped all his strength and wore him down. As the narration states, ""Over one long, crippling hill"" (kurmaskie @NUM1). These word choices reflect the writer's perception of the adventure. Words like ""long"" and ""crippling"" suggest that the trip was a dreadful experience."
1505	7487	3	2	"Pride, determination, and relief were all emotions the cyclist felt during his long bike ride. At the start, the cyclist began the ride with fresh legs and reliable directions. But as he continued on the road, he started to doubt the old men. As the text says, ""a diary with my last entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and their sense of direction, I made a mental move to change it."" After realizing the journey might be difficult, he rode out of pride to reach his destination. Next, the rider showed great determination to get to his destination and took various actions. For example, ""I gathered a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth to take my mind off of thirst."" This quote shows that he would do almost anything to keep going. Finally, when the cyclist arrived at the @CAPS1 shop, he was fatigued. He then knew the old men were right and that he would reach his destination. As the quote ""As I stumbled into rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink"" shows, he was not only getting water but also acknowledging the old men's correctness."
1506	7488	3	2	The setting's features significantly impact the cyclist when he experiences thirst. A visual of a young boy pouring a glass of revitalizing juice into his mouth can be observed. This indicates the rider's thirst, as the preceding paragraph mentions his final burst of energy while descending a hill. He was also perspiring profusely and wiping sweat from his eyes. In conclusion, the setting's details effectively convey the cyclist's state of thirst.
1507	7489	3	2	I find that I perform better when I can immerse myself in the environment. The same holds true for cycling in the mountains. The fresh air and a worry - free mind can transform cycling into an enjoyable activity. The pleasant climate, the fresh air, the beautiful trees, and the overall environment make the cyclist feel better. Clearly, for cyclists, the environment plays a crucial role. In conclusion, a conducive environment can greatly enhance the cycling experience.
1508	7490	3	2	The features of the setting have a substantial influence on the cyclist. They directly affect the cyclist's performance. For example, the high temperature causes the cyclist's pedaling to become slow and laborious. The setting also instills fear in the cyclist; when the cyclist encounters a snake, he is filled with terror. Moreover, the setting can be enticing. The sight of a river tempts the cyclist to halt his ride and have a drink of water. In conclusion, the setting has a major impact on the cyclist's actions and emotions during the ride.
1509	7491	3	2	The features of the setting impact the cyclist in multiple ways. Many aspects of the setting discourage the cyclist. The description “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time - say, before the last world war - but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town” shows that as soon as the cyclist enters this “town,” he doubts the advice of the old men. The dry desert has the most severe effect on the cyclist. The hot climate makes the cyclist extremely thirsty, hot, and sweaty, as evidenced by “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke...”. The cyclist's sarcastic tone still reveals concern for his health due to the heat and lack of water. Additionally, the absence of any living things around the cyclist since he spoke to the old men for directions also discourages him. This lack of signs of life makes him lose the will to continue his journey. In conclusion, the features of the setting have diverse and significant effects on the cyclist.
1510	7492	3	2	The cyclist journeyed through a desolate land in an attempt to reach a region of rivers and valleys. As he passed through the first town in the California desert, he saw a dilapidated shed, rusty pumps, and a corral. The cyclist was furious that the old men had directed him to this barren town, but he retained hope and moved on to the next town. There, he discovered an abandoned fruit - juice factory and bottling plant, which made him so discouraged that he began to lose hope. “I was going to die,” he claimed, having lost all hope. He felt that the old men were to blame for his plight. Finally, he came across a bait shop on his own, which brought him great relief. The surrounding environment affects his attitude; in a desolate place, one is likely to lose hope, as the cyclist did. This shows that our surroundings, whether in education, friendship, or survival, can have a profound impact on us. In conclusion, the environment around us can shape our experiences and emotions.
1511	7493	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist experiences both emotional and physical impacts due to the characteristics of the setting. Initially, upon encountering a deserted shed with rusty pumps, the cyclist starts to feel disheartened. As stated, “[The] sight was troubling” (page @NUM1). Later in the essay, the terrain transitions from flat land to short, rolling hills, and tumbleweeds begin to pass by. This change in terrain clearly affects the cyclist. He becomes exhausted yet persists in pedaling and continues his journey. Before the end of his ride, the cyclist reaches an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The setting now includes a large picture of a young boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice, which seems to have an effect on the author. “I hung my head” (page @NUM2), he admitted. Finally, when he spots an old fisherman's store in the distance, he is relieved. The sight of the store excites the author as he can finally get a drink. In conclusion, the features of the setting significantly influence the author's mood and physical state.
1512	7494	3	2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, as the day progresses, the cyclist grows tired and worn - out from his long bike ride through rough terrain as he attempts to find his way home. When he sees some buildings down a hill, he states, “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). After reaching home, the rider says he will undertake such a ride again. This shows that despite the difficulties, the cyclist is still drawn to this kind of adventure.
1513	7495	3	2	In June, a cyclist is riding his bike in California. The primary issue he faces is the lack of water. Given the time of year and the location, it is extremely hot, and he requires a substantial amount of water to stay hydrated. When he spots the Welch’s Grape Juice factory, it only intensifies his awareness of his thirst. Moreover, the terrain he is cycling on is far from easy. He begins on flat ground but then has to navigate hills and uneven surfaces, which exacerbates his dehydration. Therefore, it is crucial to always carry an ample supply of water when cycling during the summer.
1514	7496	3	2	The setting has two main effects on the cyclist: the intense heat and the poor condition of the roads. The rider mentions that it is June, a hot summer month. The roads are not smooth; they are old and in a dilapidated state. These factors combined make the cyclist's journey more challenging. In conclusion, the heat and the rough roads in the setting pose significant obstacles to the cyclist.
1515	7497	3	2	In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a cyclist is confronted with multiple challenges. He has to battle against the heat, a shortage of water, and rough hills while trying to navigate his way. These difficulties make his bike - riding experience arduous, but they also add an element of adventure to his journey. In conclusion, the cyclist's struggle against these elements forms the core of the story.
1516	7498	3	2	The features of the setting significantly impact the cyclist. Biking up and down hills is extremely tiring. The hot air can lead to dehydration, potentially causing the cyclist to pass out. The dry air is accompanied by dry land, offering no place to stop for water or take a break. The rough terrain makes biking more difficult as it requires more energy than cycling on a smooth path. Additionally, a snake in the middle of the road makes it hard for the cyclist to maneuver around. If bitten by the snake, the cyclist could die from the poison. In conclusion, the various features of the setting pose substantial challenges to the cyclist's journey.
1517	7499	3	2	"In the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the setting was extremely hot and dry, with very little shade or moisture, and at some points, perhaps none at all. This weather affected the author as he had no water, and thus, he became increasingly dehydrated as he continued his journey. In conclusion, the harsh environmental conditions in the setting severely impacted the author's well - being during his travels."
1518	7500	3	2	The features of the setting influenced the cyclist in a significant way. One aspect is the advice - taking situation. It is unwise to take advice from old people who rarely leave their homes. In the story, it states, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” This advice affected the setting because if the cyclist hadn't let them look at his map, he could have avoided a great deal of trouble. In conclusion, taking improper advice can have a negative impact on one's journey.
1519	7501	3	2	"In ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the terrain's setting was hot and water - draining. The text mentions “Followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two - hundred degrees”, which indicates that the cyclist might be exaggerating the high temperature of the high deserts of California. The setting also drains water, as the cyclist had to stop in a desert town to refill his water bottle. The text states, “I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of a rusted water pump with all my strength.” This shows that the cyclist had to exert much effort to obtain water. In conclusion, it is essential to always prepare for the worst while hoping for the best when facing such challenging settings."
1520	7502	3	2	In the story, multiple features of the setting affect the cyclist. The steep, rolling hills exhaust the cyclist and make him even more desperate for water. For instance, the story says, “Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view.” The use of “crippling” shows that the hill was extremely difficult and strenuous to climb. Another setting feature is the absence of civilization on the cycling path. While riding, the cyclist realizes there is no one around to assist him if he encounters trouble or needs water. This makes him feel stressed and worried about his journey. The story states, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” and “I was going to die and the bird would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry on the parse of old men.” These quotes illustrate his awareness of the lack of help and his fear of dying alone. In conclusion, the challenging setting features, such as the hills and the absence of people, have a profound negative impact on the cyclist's experience.
1521	7503	3	2	The features of the setting typically have a significant impact on the cyclist. The setting's characteristics are related to and depict the harsh and ultimately relieving conditions the cyclist endures. The setting is relevant to the cyclist and serves a role that the cyclist can perceive. One way the setting's features affect the cyclist is by revealing the various problems the cyclist encounters. For instance, there are cool pines, no one is in sight, and the cyclist is alone. This conveys a clear message that the cyclist needs assistance to get home and, as they travel, requires water to quench their thirst. Moreover, the features show the cyclist's weakness. For example, the cyclist believes it is their last burst of energy as they continuously maneuver down the hill. The features and settings affect the cyclist by showing how they face their troubles, such as thirst and fear, which are all left behind in the end. These features and settings provide the cyclist with a clear understanding of what to expect.
1522	7504	3	2	"A cyclist set out on a ride with the goal of reaching Yosemite National Park. At the start, he was confident as he trusted the directions given by the ""old timers"" he met. Despite the intense sun beating down, he was determined not to give up, just as he mentioned, ""The sun was beginning to beat down, but I hardly noticed."" As he rode, he came across worn - down and deserted places, realizing he was alone in case of any trouble. The desert heat made him consume water regularly, and when he tried to find more, he had a bad experience; as described, ""I got on my hands and knees. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid."" He was so thirsty that he would have even drunk hot water. Thinking he only had @NUM2 miles to go, he persevered. As he pedaled on the changing terrain, he was weakening, trying to keep his balance in a dehydrated state. With his last bit of energy, he passed an abandoned Well be Grape Juice factory, which likely tested his patience and sanity. He resorted to putting pebbles in his mouth to distract himself from thirst. Just when he was losing hope, he found ""Gary and Wilber’s fish camp best bet"" and was relieved to get cool water. By the end, he learned his lesson and decided to stick to his map."
1523	7505	3	2	"The author recalled a long and tiring bike ride where he faced numerous struggles. One morning, he asked some old men on a porch for directions to @CAPS1. They claimed to know the way and a shortcut, so he followed their advice but later regretted it. When he reached the towns they mentioned, he found only ghost towns. He realized, ""Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office."" Eventually, he reached a town with signs of life. There, he asked another old man about the way to Yosemite, and the man said he had a good map. Throughout the ride, the sun and lack of water plagued him. The sun made him hot and thirsty, causing him to drink a large amount of his water. When he had only a few sips left, he resisted drinking it and began to lose consciousness, as he said, ""I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."" In the end, this experience taught him to be more cautious about taking advice."
1524	7506	3	2	A cyclist's speed depends on how fast or slow they pedal. On a humid and sunny day, the cyclist can't go too fast because of their lung capacity. When it's a warm but windy day, they need to watch their speed to avoid getting hurt. Generally, the cyclist will go fast only if the weather is nice and safe. Safety is the top priority, so the cyclist's speed mostly depends on the weather, but also the time of day. At night, when it's dark, reflectors must be put on the bike to prevent accidents. In conclusion, a cyclist's speed and safety are closely related to environmental factors such as weather and time.
1525	7507	3	2	"The features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist due to the heat and the terrain. In the story, it details how the cyclist has to go up and down numerous hills while the blistering heat beats down on them. The heat makes it difficult for the cyclist as it increases their need for water. Throughout the story, the cyclist is constantly in search of water, and when they do find some, it is described as being ""about two hundred degrees and tasted like battery acid."" Without an adequate supply of water, it becomes extremely challenging to cycle long distances in such hot conditions. In summary, the heat and terrain in the setting significantly affect the cyclist's journey."
1526	7508	3	2	The cyclist is influenced by numerous features of the setting. For instance, there is a long hill, a snake, and a dirt road. Additionally, the desert heat and the dwindling water supply all have an impact on the cyclist. In conclusion, these various elements of the setting play a significant role in affecting the cyclist's journey.
1527	7509	3	2	"In the story, the cyclist is affected by multiple features of the setting. On one page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2, there is a sign indicating a rough road ahead. On the same page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM4, it mentions ""over the long on - piling hill"". The temperature aspect is introduced on page @NUM5 and at the top of page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM7, where it states ""I was traveling in the high desert of California in June"". All these conditions of the setting have an effect on the cyclist. In summary, the features of the setting significantly influence the cyclist's experience."
1528	7510	3	2	"In this story, the features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist. The quote ""…and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke…"" (@NUM1) shows that the extreme heat is affecting his riding. The narrator also says, ""I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2), indicating that his dehydration is causing him trouble in maintaining balance on the rough terrain. In conclusion, the setting clearly affects the cyclist in this story."
1529	7511	3	2	The setting impacts the cyclist by motivating him to ride longer and see what lies ahead. However, riding a bike in the heat can lead to heatstroke and death from dehydration. This is why it is essential to carry an ample supply of water while cycling. In conclusion, the setting both spurs the cyclist on and poses serious risks that need to be mitigated.
1530	7512	3	2	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead"", the cyclist's settings hinder him. He is in the desert during summer with hardly any water. He is trying to reach Yosemite but gets lost because some old men gave him incorrect directions. Meanwhile, he rides his bicycle for miles in the summer heat, and his thirst distracts him from continuing his journey to Yosemite. I believe that if the cyclist were in a cooler environment, things would have been different as the current settings act as a distraction. In conclusion, the unfavorable settings greatly impede the cyclist's progress towards his destination."
1531	7513	3	2	The cyclist grew extremely fatigued, and the environment he found himself in only exacerbated the situation. In June, he was cycling through the desert, where the sweltering heat made every pedal stroke a struggle. Each town he reached was deserted, offering no water source. Moreover, the hilly terrain added to the difficulty of his journey. In such harsh conditions, the cyclist's endurance was truly put to the test.
1532	7514	3	2	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead, Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the features of the setting significantly impact the cyclist as they determine the ease or difficulty of his ride. For instance, the hot climate poses a serious threat of heatstroke and death without an adequate water supply. The dryness of the land means there are no places to refill his water, and the barrenness implies that even if he avoids heatstroke, he may not be found and could perish. Another example is when the road becomes rough and the cyclist sees the speed - limit sign. He realizes he is traveling at a water - depleting 12 mph. This indicates that the land's contour and the road's roughness make his journey arduous. The features of the setting can be the most significant hindrance to a cyclist, dictating whether they have a long, strenuous journey or a leisurely ride."
1533	7515	3	2	"The cyclist in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" was clearly affected by the setting. He was cycling in California, a naturally hot state, in June. As he approached a hot desert, the heat became even more unbearable. Engaging in a physical activity like cycling in such heat is extremely challenging. The cyclist brought only one bottle of water and initially drank it regularly. However, as the temperature rose, he ran out of water. This affected him physically, making him tired, and mentally, causing him to doubt himself. He then came across an abandoned juice - making building, which he noted had been a Welch's grape juice factory and bottling plant. Dying of thirst, he found this place. His surroundings affected him both mentally, as he thought ""I'm going to die"", and physically, leading to dehydration. Overall, the setting had a profound and detrimental impact on the cyclist."
1534	7516	3	2	"The cyclist was traversing a rough, dry, and deserted terrain that nearly cost him his life. He described his location as ""the high deserts of California in June"". The area was dry, lifeless, and sweltering. The sun beat down on him, and he needed to drink water frequently, but his supply was dwindling. He hoped to find fresh water in the empty towns, but they were all abandoned. This made his journey extremely perilous. At any moment, he could have suffered a heatstroke and fallen off his bike, potentially dying on the spot. His sweat evaporated quickly in the heat, and there was no way to cool off in the desolate desert. He had to endure these harsh and ironic conditions for miles just to find water. Such a journey is what one would expect in a desert but is far from what a cyclist should have to go through."
1535	7517	3	2	The features of the setting have multiple effects on the cyclist. The hills are overly long, making the ascent and descent difficult. Every town he passes through seems deserted, and the roads are rough, adding to the physical strain. The heat also takes a toll on him, affecting his health. Overall, the combination of these factors makes the cyclist's journey a challenging and potentially harmful experience.
1536	7518	3	2	"When engaging in any sport or activity that causes sweating, the setting is of utmost importance. If one is sweating in an unfavorable setting, they can easily fall ill. In the story ""Rough road ahead,"" the cyclist was in a very hot setting and had no water. This is why the cyclist became tired and sick, as sweating without access to water took a toll on their body. Thus, the setting significantly affected the cyclist."
1537	7519	3	2	"The setting's features, such as old abandoned towns, hot temperatures, and abandoned buildings, have a profound impact on the cyclist. These elements make the cyclist feel that all hope is lost. As described in the essay, ""Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view [...] I hung my head that smoky blues tune 'Summertime' rattle around."" However, there is an ironic twist. The building turned out to be a Welch's grape juice factory and bottling plant. The text then shows a shift to a happy mood when it states, ""As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them."" In conclusion, the setting's features can drastically change the cyclist's emotional state."
1538	7520	3	2	With no one in the vicinity, a rough road ahead, and the added issue of dehydration, the cyclist began to feel as though death was imminent. This led to self - doubt. Yet, every time the cyclist spotted something in the distance, they summoned the will to press on towards it. In this challenging situation, the cyclist's determination, despite the despair, kept them going.
1539	7521	3	2	"The features of the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist. In June, the cyclist was biking through the high deserts of California. The intense heat made the cyclist overheated and sweaty, causing them to drink from their water bottles frequently. Unfortunately, with ""no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,"" there were no places to refill the bottles, leading to dehydration. To compound the problem, the terrain changed from flat roads to ""short, rolling hills."" Usually, this would not pose a major challenge, but due to dehydration and overheating, each hill seemed ""crippling."" In my opinion, if the setting had been cooler and perhaps in a different time period like that of the old men, the cyclist would have had a much more pleasant experience."
1540	7522	3	2	"Due to the setting, the cyclist experienced a range of emotions including excitement, desperation, and self - pity. The cyclist was extremely excited about reaching Yosemite Park because of its peaceful environment. They said, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite are calling my name."" The intense heat made the cyclist eager to get there. As the cyclist ran out of water, they became desperate. They even tried drinking from a hot water hole, but as they put it, ""I tried a drop or two, tasted like battery acid."" With water running out, the desperation grew. The long journey ahead also led the cyclist to feel self - pity, saying, ""sometimes life can be so cruel."" In conclusion, the setting was the root cause of these diverse emotions the cyclist felt."
1541	7523	3	2	"The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist's mood. As the story states, ""About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first town."" After pedaling for forty miles, the cyclist is likely fatigued. Discovering that the town is deserted leaves him somewhat frustrated. The subsequent stops are also deserted, and he is nearly out of water, causing him to become desperate. The road turns bumpy, and a large snake blocks the way, instilling terror in him. Finally, reaching a bait - shop with cool water brings him relief. Evidently, the setting of the story elicits a wide range of moods in the cyclist."
1542	7524	3	2	The setting's features affected the cyclist in a significant way. It was June, and he found himself in the middle of the desert. Additionally, he had received incorrect information. This combination of being in a harsh desert environment during a hot month and having wrong guidance put the cyclist in a challenging situation, highlighting how the setting can greatly influence a character's experience.
1543	7525	3	2	"The cyclist was influenced by the climate, the people, and the surroundings. The climate was that of a desert in June, extremely hot with scarce water. This led to his dehydration and a state of misery. Some old men who claimed to ""help"" him seemed to misjudge the cyclist's predicament. Moreover, there were no inhabited shops or buildings in the vicinity. As a result, he had no place to obtain water or nourishment. In conclusion, these elements of the setting severely affected the cyclist's well - being and journey."
1544	7526	3	2	"The features of the setting have notable effects on the cyclist. When the story mentions, ""Twenty miles up the road. I came to a fork of sorts,"" the cyclist was left indecisive about which path to take. Another instance is when the text says, ""I got on my hand and knees, Working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength."" This indicates that the cyclist was in a desperate need for water and had doubts about water coming out. The last feature is the warning ""Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit."" The cyclist, already tired, was going well below the speed limit, yet this warning still influenced his journey, suggesting that he might have to carefully navigate the rough road. Overall, the setting features presented in the story play a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience."
1545	7527	3	2	The cyclist is in a dry and deserted area that is fraught with many hazards. This desolate environment poses numerous challenges to the cyclist, such as lack of resources and difficult terrain. These factors can greatly impede the cyclist's progress and put his safety at risk. In summary, the nature of this setting has a substantial negative impact on the cyclist's journey.
1546	7528	3	2	While cycling to Yosemite Park through a desert, the author experienced dehydration, which significantly altered his mood. As he traversed the arid expanse, he ran out of water and was forced to stop. Some of the towns he had been informed about were deserted, and his inability to find water there led to rapid dehydration. This was the evident impact of the setting on him. Another consequence was that he began to doubt the advice of the elderly, and his initial confidence transformed into desperation. As he cycled through the desert, clinging desperately to the hope of finding water, he realized that the elderly have a better understanding of the past than the future since they are less exposed to the ever - changing world. Initially, he had placed trust in the directions and wisdom of the old men. The setting ultimately imparted a certain level of wisdom to him.
1547	7529	3	2	The cyclist's journey through a dry desert setting makes him appear increasingly determined. He is going against all odds, seemingly pushing himself to the limit. Facing the scorching heat, the long road, and the lack of water, it seems as though all hope is lost for the cyclist. However, in the end, he gathers his strength, overcomes the challenges, and triumphs over adversity. His ability to persevere in such a harsh environment showcases his indomitable spirit.
1548	7530	3	2	After reading the story, I firmly believe that the desert setting of the cyclist's journey had a profound impact on him. It negatively affected his attitude. At the start, he was highly motivated, determined, and well - hydrated. As time passed and he covered more miles, the scenery changed, which is extremely challenging, especially in a hot and dry environment where one needs to stay as hydrated as possible during physical activity. As he continued, his water supply dwindled, and all he could think about was his increasing thirst and whether the journey was worth it. The monotonous sandy desert over an extended period likely contributed to this change in attitude. I can relate to this as I've experienced a similar shift in attitude during long - term exercise. It's difficult to stay focused when there's nothing interesting to look at. My attitude often goes from being determined to feeling bored and questioning the purpose. Nevertheless, I think it's truly great that he never gave up even when things got tough. It opened my eyes to the significance of achieving one's own goals.
1549	7531	3	2	"The features of the setting, specifically the desert, affected the cyclist by causing dehydration. The cyclist recounted, ""I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake."" Being in the desert, with each mile he rode, he became more and more dehydrated as the desert sun sapped the moisture from his body. He also mentioned that with each passing landmark, he ""eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This shows that as he continued his journey, the desert's influence on him and his level of dehydration increased. In such a harsh setting, the cyclist's struggle with dehydration was a constant and growing challenge."
1550	7532	3	2	The features of the setting had multiple impacts on the cyclist. Firstly, instead of adhering to his map, the cyclist sought directions from a couple of old people. These elderly individuals not only provided directions but also suggested a shortcut. This led to the second effect, where the cyclist deviated from the main road and started using the shortcut. In conclusion, these aspects of the setting influenced the cyclist's route - taking decisions, potentially altering the course of his journey.
1551	7533	3	2	The road conditions and the presence of hills in the setting had an impact on the cyclist. In the initial part of his journey, for about two miles, the cyclist had an enjoyable ride. However, the situation started to change. As the author, Kurmaskie, stated, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.” Despite a promising start, the circumstances soon turned against the cyclist. Even though the hills and changing road conditions presented challenges, the cyclist managed to overcome his problems with relative ease. In the end, despite the difficulties in the setting, the cyclist completed his journey.
1552	7534	3	2	The setting features presented two significant problems to the cyclist: doubt and dehydration. From the essay, it can be inferred that the cyclist began to doubt his ability to reach Yosemite. Throughout the essay, various elements eroded his hope and confidence. For instance, near the essay's conclusion, the exhausted and hopeless cyclist spotted a building over a hill. He rushed towards it, only to discover that it was an abandoned and dilapidated @ORGANIZATION1 factory. This dashed his hopes and instilled more doubt in his mind. Besides the loss of confidence, the setting also caused a severe physical problem: dehydration. The hot weather forced the cyclist to traverse hills and rough roads. His water supply was running low, and at the one town he stopped at, the water from the pump was undrinkable. These setting features not only caused problems but also put his health at risk.
1553	7535	3	2	The setting features have multiple impacts on the cyclist. Road conditions, heat, snakes, the absence of nearby towns, and lack of information all pose challenges. It's uncertain whether the cyclist made it safely or got hurt during the ride. Maybe he was bitten by a snake. Regardless of the outcome, it's clear that the setting had a profound and diverse effect on the cyclist.
1554	7536	3	2	In the essay, the setting was described as dry, hot, expansive, and deserted. Such a description clearly evokes a sense of loneliness. Despite being alone and having no clear destination, the man persevered. He kept thinking about “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” This thought gave him the strength to keep going, enabling him to continue his journey.
1555	7537	3	2	Several land features influenced the cyclist and his trip. Firstly, being in a desert was a major obstacle as deserts lack water. There was also a snake, which posed a life - threatening danger. The poorly paved roads, which had clearly been abandoned for years, made cycling arduous. The juice factory and the well added to his distress. The factory reminded him of his need for water, and the well pumped out hot, unpalatable water instead of cold water. These land features significantly hampered the cyclist's trip and made it extremely challenging.
1556	7538	3	2	At the beginning of his cycling journey, the cyclist was full of self - assurance, perceiving the world as described by the old men. As he continued, he noticed that everything around was abandoned and empty. He exclaimed, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or any kind of structure.” His self - confidence started to waver. As evidence, he said, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage and tried not to get excited.” He was highly doubtful about reaching his destination. Eventually, he was greatly relieved when he found a fishing spot with a bathroom and fresh water.
1557	7539	3	2	The setting in this story had a significant impact on the cyclist. Unreliable directions, insufficient water for the journey, poor road conditions, and other hazards such as heat and animals made the cyclist's trip extremely difficult. At the start, the cyclist received inaccurate information about the route to his destination, leading him on a long and arduous journey with limited water. He mentioned in the story, “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water - depleting @NUM2.” This indicates that he was consuming water at a rate that was too fast relative to the distance he was covering. Additionally, the road conditions deteriorated as he traveled, and he encountered short rolling hills instead of a flat road, which made cycling slower and more challenging. These aspects of the setting were potentially dangerous and had a profound influence on the cyclist throughout the story.
1558	7540	3	2	The setting in the story affected the cyclist as the changing surroundings made him lose hope of reaching Yosemite National Park. When he cycled through the first town and it appeared abandoned, he began to doubt whether he should continue. Moreover, when he saw no people or buildings, he grew worried and was on the verge of giving up. However, the appearance of a second road sign brought him relief, which helped him regain some hope on his journey.
1559	7541	3	2	The setting in this short story made the cyclist doubt his ability to survive. The primary issue was the lack of water. With no water at his disposal, the cyclist believed it was only a matter of time before he perished. Another major problem was the rough terrain, which was difficult for him to navigate. Additionally, there were no buildings, people, or cars in sight to assist him. Had something happened to him before he found the bait shop, there would have been no one to offer help. The challenging setting thus posed a serious threat to the cyclist's survival.
1560	7542	3	2	The setting features in “Do not exceed posted speed limit” have a negative impact on the cyclist. For instance, when the road changes from being smooth and easy to ride on to being full of rolling hills, it becomes more strenuous for the cyclist to bike as he has to expend more energy to get over the hills. Another example is when tumbleweeds cross his path and a large snake blocks most of the pavement, which intensifies his sense of desolation. Seeing a tumbleweed is often associated with being deserted and alone. Finally, he spots the deserted Welch's Grape Juice Factory, which only makes his thirst worse. The sight of the factory is also ironic because he is severely dehydrated while the factory stands abandoned. All these elements of the setting have a detrimental effect on the cyclist.
1561	7543	3	2	The setting's features influence the cyclist in several ways. Firstly, the intense heat takes a toll. The cyclist is in a desert and running low on water. As the water supply dwindles, the cyclist starts conserving it, leading to dehydration and weakness. The cyclist states, “I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so - a test of my inner spirit.” Secondly, the rough terrain poses a challenge. Riding on rough ground makes it difficult to continue, and the cyclist was already short on water. The cyclist remarks, “A large highway sign jumped out at me. I read: rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. Sometimes life can be so cruel.” Finally, the structures in the area also have an impact. There was a ghost town with water that tasted like “battery acid,” and a Welch's grape juice factory and bottling plant, both of which were likely dilapidated. The cyclist mentions, “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head.” Evidently, the setting's features significantly affected the cyclist.
1562	7544	3	2	The author does not find the desolate and harsh settings discouraging. Instead, they are a source of amusement, fun, and quest - like tests. Upon arriving at the first ghost - town, the author chuckles, entertained by the “old codgers” and their crazy ideas. When reaching the second place and realizing it is no longer established, the author is slightly disappointed but views it as “a test of [his] inner spirit.” At the abandoned factory, the third building, the author appreciates the irony of the situation. While cycling across the desert, the author refuses to be disheartened by the empty horizon. Instead, it is used as a reference for progress and a means to push oneself. Despite facing empty and disappointing views, the author keeps a positive spirit and continues to move forward.
1563	7545	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: do not exceed speed limit,” as the cyclist travels, the scenery and terrain become rougher and lonelier. The cyclist's outlook turns grim, expecting only the worst. The rough road begins after the cyclist finds a water pump with piping - hot, brackish water that tastes like battery acid. In this story, water is a metaphor for the cyclist's life and the source of survival. Initially, the cyclist drinks water regularly, but when the water from the pump is bad, it mirrors the story taking a turn for the worse. The cyclist is very aware of their body's condition and acknowledges the dehydration. The cyclist says, “and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke simply because I had listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porches in a decade.” Later, the lack of humans and technology breaks the cyclist down, causing sad and hopeless laughter.
1564	7546	3	2	The desert is the most cruel of nature's environments. Its water scarcity, dry air, and punishing heat can even kill the hardiest creatures. When traveling through a desert, one must maintain a constant water supply and respect nature's power. In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” cycler Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the desert's heat and water shortage to survive. As the author notes, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, I could drop from heatstroke.” An overheated human body becomes sick and unable to function properly. In the desert, one must stay cool or perish. Kurmaskie realizes the danger of running out of water, stating, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” As the water runs out, Joe suffers from dehydration, despair, and loss of balance. Water is essential in the desert; without it, as Joe observes, “the birds would pick (you) clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear.”
1565	7547	3	2	The features in the setting of the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed the Posted Speed limit” affect the cyclist cruelly. The old men claim the towns will be there, but they are non - functioning. The setting places the cyclist in a sweltering California day in June and throws in unexpected twists, making the cyclist feel hopeless. A cruel detail in the essay is “The Speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water - depleting 12 mph,” which lowers the cyclist's confidence and makes them more worried. Another cruel addition is the abandoned Welch's Grape Juice factory with “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” causing the cyclist to lose all hope. Clearly, these setting features are cruel.
1566	7548	3	2	The setting features, including the ghost - town desert and the Juice factory, instilled a sense of hopelessness in the cyclist. As he reached the ghost town, he was running out of water. He initially thought it was @CAPS1 since the next town was just a short distance away. However, when he arrived at the so - called “next town” and tried to use the water pump, instead of water, a hot and foul - smelling liquid came out. When he reached the abandoned Welch’s factory, he started to lose all hope, proclaiming, “the birds will pick me clean.” Then, he was “saved” by a bait shop. These setting features gradually eroded his hope until he found the bait shop, after which his hope, though not his faith in old men, was restored.
1567	7549	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist. The difficult terrain made him even more determined to complete the journey. For instance, the author described, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path, and a ridiculously large snake— it really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This shows that despite the numerous obstacles, the cyclist persevered. The challenging terrain kept the cyclist determined, and this is a common phenomenon in sports. In football, for example, players use problems as motivation to push harder and finish the game. The setting in the essay effectively influenced the cyclist's determination, similar to how sports challenges impact athletes.
1568	7550	3	2	The essay is set in a barren desert landscape. The extreme heat in this setting causes the protagonist to dehydrate more rapidly. Additionally, phone signals are scarce. As mentioned in the essay, “the next town was only @NUM1 down the road.” The desolate environment also makes the protagonist question the reality of what he sees, suspecting that it might be a mirage. Overall, the harsh desert setting with its heat and isolation significantly affects the protagonist's physical state and perception.
1569	7551	3	2	The various features of the setting had diverse effects on the cyclist. The beautiful natural scenery around him made him laugh. As stated in the essay, “on a gorgeous day in June caused him to laugh.” This indicates that despite the difficulties, the pleasant outdoor environment gave him an optimistic outlook. On the other hand, the intense sun had a different impact. It made him sweat profusely and brought him close to dying of dehydration. The quote “growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” shows his acute awareness of the danger posed by the sun. In conclusion, the different elements of the setting affected the cyclist in distinct ways, with nature bringing joy and the sun presenting a life - threatening risk.
1570	7552	3	2	The conditions in the setting were extremely harsh. The author endured searing heat, dehydration, and received incorrect directions. These hardships led to feelings of depression and brought him close to death. He also had an encounter with a large snake. Eventually, he reached his destination. This experience taught him two important lessons: to always bring a map and to avoid taking directions from old people. Through these trials, the author learned valuable lessons that will likely influence his future travels.
1571	7553	3	2	"The setting had a significant impact on the cyclist in Joe Kurmaskie's ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", making his ride more arduous. The extremely hot weather, for instance, with the sun beating down, took a toll on him. Although he claimed it didn't affect him, his thirst and dehydration indicated the internal impact. Additionally, the presence of weeds and snakes, such as tumbleweeds crossing his path and a large snake blocking the way, was unsettling and did not make his journey easier. Moreover, the challenging terrain, including long and crippling hills, demonstrated the intensity of his ride. Overall, the setting had a notable influence on the cyclist's experience."
1572	7554	3	2	The nearby setting negatively affects the cyclist in several ways. The heat is a major issue; he mentions traveling through the high deserts of California in June, a hot month, especially in desert regions. The cyclist also suffers from a lack of water, repeatedly expressing his thirst throughout the story. He eventually finds water at the end. Another problem is the scarcity of buildings when he needs water. He pedals long distances to find towns, but they are often either ghost towns or unhelpful. Finally, the cyclist encounters obstacles like tumbleweeds and a large snake on his path, which impede his progress towards his destination. In conclusion, the features of the nearby setting have a traumatic impact on the cyclist due to heat, water shortage, lack of buildings, and these obstacles.
1573	7555	3	2	The setting impacts the cyclist as the weather in California can be extremely hot at times. On a long - distance trip, this heat can cause the cyclist to dehydrate, potentially leading to fainting and injury. Additionally, the numerous hills in the area pose a significant challenge to the cyclist. In summary, the combination of high temperatures and hilly terrain makes the cyclist's journey difficult.
1574	7556	3	2	In the essay, the author includes various features related to the cyclist's journey. The dwindling water supply indicates the intense heat and the cyclist's high water consumption. The presence of a rusty old pipe with undrinkable water suggests that the town has been abandoned for years and the water supply is unfit for consumption. Overall, the essay portrays the hardships of cycling in hot weather with limited supplies and a lack of direction.
1575	7557	3	2	"The cyclist in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" endured a difficult time in the California desert. The desert in June is extremely hot, which, combined with his nearly depleted water supply, made the journey tough. Initially, his ride was easy on flat ground, but when he encountered rolling terrain, he had to expend more energy. In conclusion, the hot climate, scarce water, and changing terrain all contributed to the cyclist's challenging experience."
1576	7558	3	2	The setting's features significantly impacted the cyclist. Being extremely thirsty, the cyclist was further affected by the dry air and the absence of nearby towns. Additionally, the bumpy roads and hills not only caused fatigue but also increased the cyclist's thirst. Moreover, the sight of a factory made the cyclist think about juice, intensifying the feeling of thirst. In conclusion, the various elements of the setting combined to have a notable and negative effect on the cyclist's experience.
1577	7559	3	2	"The features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist. It seems that old people's changing the definition of ""adonít talk to strangers"" somehow relates to the situation of the main - character cyclist. This change in the concept might influence the cyclist's interactions and decisions during their journey. Overall, the setting's features, through this aspect of social norms, play a role in shaping the cyclist's experience."
1578	7560	3	2	The setting's features influence the cyclist in multiple ways. Experienced cyclists are well - aware of the appropriate speed for a bike, so there is no need for others to inform them. If a cyclist requires directions, they are more likely to visit a gas station rather than an elderly person's residence. A true cyclist can continue riding for an extended period until fatigue sets in. They have the ability to perform bike tricks without the need for repeated practice. Also, a real cyclist doesn't necessarily need extensive training to enter a tournament and win; rather, they need to practice effectively. In summary, the nature of the setting and the cyclist's inherent abilities and behaviors are intertwined.
1579	7561	3	2	"The setting in the story exerts a substantial influence on the cyclist. The hot and desolate surroundings lead the cyclist to feel tired and discouraged. For instance, the cyclist remarks, ""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lames mule greeted me. This sight was trouble."" This statement reveals that the dilapidated environment caused concern. Additionally, the author notes, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" This description makes the cyclist aware of their isolation, which, in turn, heightens their determination to reach the destination. Anyone who has been lost can understand the discouragement when there are no signs of life. The cyclist, like anyone in such a situation, just wants to keep going in the hope of finding their way. In conclusion, the setting around the cyclist has a profound impact on their journey, both negatively and by spurring them on."
1580	7562	3	2	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in numerous ways. Firstly, the daylight and the sun's glare bother the cyclist, making the journey more arduous. Secondly, the vast emptiness around the cyclist leads to frustration. As the cyclist observes, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" Had there been something in the vicinity, the cyclist would have felt less frustrated and would have had more hope of finding what they needed. In conclusion, the combination of the sunlight and the desolate surroundings significantly impacts the cyclist's state of mind and journey."
1581	7563	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's narrative ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the cyclist was severely and fatally impacted by the setting. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The heat was so intense that the author was aware he could ""drop from heatstroke"" at any moment. This unbearable heat, combined with the ""crippling"" hilly terrain, led the cyclist to a state of severe dehydration, clearly having a negative effect. The sweltering heat and merciless hills would not have been as bad if there were places to stop, rest, and replenish the dwindling water supply. However, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, or a structure of any kind."" The cyclist was completely isolated for over @NUM1 miles of arid desert, with the scorching sun beating down on him as he struggled up steep, unyielding hills. Evidently, the setting was having a horribly negative impact on the cyclist."
1582	7564	3	2	Riding a bike for a long time without water is bad, and it becomes even worse when the surroundings are unfavorable. For instance, when a cyclist has no water and there is nothing around to offer help, the situation is dire. Without water, the cyclist could pass out and become dehydrated. When the cyclist finds no one to assist and nothing in the vicinity, they resort to sucking on a pebble to keep their mouth moist. Therefore, one should always check their destination before embarking on a bike ride.
1583	7565	3	2	It is extremely challenging to be outdoors in hot weather, especially when considering the advice from elders and riding a bike. If the outside temperature feels like @NUM1, it is unwise to be outside. Regardless of the duration of time spent outdoors, heatstroke can strike anyone faster than they can count to @NUM2. In conclusion, it is crucial to exercise caution and avoid unnecessary exposure to extreme heat.
1584	7566	3	2	While on the way to @CAPS1, the cyclist was riding through dry and hot weather over rough terrain. This made him tired and dehydrated. Half - way through his journey, he could see nothing for miles, which must have been discouraging. Throughout the journey, he suffered from dehydration, and when he finally found water, it was @NUM1 degrees @CAPS2 due to the heat. This experience highlights the difficulties cyclists can face in harsh environmental conditions.
1585	7567	3	2	Hot and bumpy roads with no shade are factors that affect the cyclist during his journey. He was riding, and then the sun started to beat down on him. He described it as feeling like the desert because of the intense heat. Initially, the road was in good condition, but as he continued, it became rough and difficult to ride on. Having no shade was unpleasant as the sun was constantly shining on him. These are all reasons why the cyclist should not have followed the given directions in the first place.
1586	7568	3	2	"The setting described in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the Speed Limit"" has multiple impacts on the cyclist. The mention of ""high deserts of California in June"" in the story indicates extremely hot and dry conditions. The cyclist becomes extremely fatigued, and in the desert, there are no large ponds from which to obtain water. Thus, without water, the cyclist is in a dire situation. Moreover, the cyclist endures the pain and difficulty of navigating rough terrain, going up and down slopes. In the story, there was a sign stating ""Rough Road Ahead."" There were also obstacles like tumbleweeds and snakes that the cyclist had to avoid. The dry, rough, and dangerous setting put the cyclist's life at risk, yet through dedication, the cyclist managed to overcome these challenges."
1587	7569	3	2	"The setting features in ""Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit"" had a significant impact on the cyclist. As the text notes, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The initially easy - to - bike flat road transformed into numerous hills, making the cyclist's task much more arduous. This change in the setting negatively affected the biker, contributing to difficult times and causing the loss of hope."
1588	7570	3	2	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead,"" the cyclist is affected by the setting features in various ways. One major effect is when the cyclist has to traverse hills and plains. Pedaling uphill on the hills is extremely strenuous. Another challenge is when the cyclist is nearly out of water. Since water is essential for survival, especially during a long bike ride, this shortage poses a serious problem. Additionally, the cyclist must endure the heat, which makes it difficult to stay focused on completing the long journey. Overall, these setting features significantly impede the cyclist's progress."
1589	7571	3	2	The features of the setting have a major influence on the story. At the start of the cyclist's ride, there are people around, and the cyclist encounters no problems. After chatting with some old men and starting the journey to the @NUM1 town, the cyclist finds themselves in an area with no one around. There are no buildings in sight and no water source. With no one around, the cyclist's confidence in completing the trip begins to wane. Upon reaching the first town, the cyclist realizes it is an abandoned old town, which makes the cyclist angry and causes a significant drop in confidence. When reaching the next building, the cyclist again finds it empty and starts to think they will never make it and might die. Finally, when reaching the last place, the setting is more populated with people around. The cyclist then feels relieved as they can get water. Clearly, the desolate settings make the cyclist lose a great deal of confidence.
1590	7572	3	2	"The features of a setting, including terrain and weather, have a substantial impact on cyclists. These features can either facilitate or complicate a cyclist's journey. Weather conditions can affect the rate at which cyclists consume water; for example, certain weather may cause them to use water faster, and rain along with poor road conditions can force a cyclist to slow down. In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist experiences a slow - down and increased fatigue due to the setting features. The scarcity of water and settlements, rough roads, hills, and animals on the road all contributed to the cyclist's slower progress. Setting features can either assist or hinder a cyclist, and in the case of the cyclist in this essay, the features severely hampered the bike ride."
1591	7573	3	2	The setting's conditions have various impacts on the cyclist. A straight road allows for a smooth ride, while a bumpy one causes the cyclist to jolt up and down slightly. Riding in the woods offers a cool and somewhat dim environment, whereas cycling in the desert means experiencing intense heat and bright light. In conclusion, the nature of the setting significantly shapes the cyclist's riding experience.
1592	7574	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the setting's features have a profound impact on the cyclist. The heat in the California desert in mid - June not only makes the cyclist thirstier but also drains their energy rapidly. The vast, empty land along the way likely dampens the cyclist's attitude as they tire from lack of water. Spotting a building might initially excite the cyclist, but the disappointment is great when it turns out to be abandoned. However, reaching the bait store brings relief, as it saves the cyclist from a potential heat - stroke. In essence, the setting throughout the journey tests the cyclist's physical and mental endurance.
1593	7575	3	2	As the cyclist followed the old man's directions and passed through the old towns, the setting made his situation increasingly difficult. In the first abandoned town, the water source was dry. The text describes that pumping the handle for minutes yielded water that was warm and tasted like battery acid. The second potential drink source was at an abandoned @PERSON1's Juice factory, depicted as a sand - blasted picture of a boy enjoying a glass of juice. These experiences made it mentally tougher for the cyclist, as he was repeatedly close to getting what he needed but had it snatched away. Ultimately, the unforgiving setting took a toll on his resolve.
1594	7576	3	2	The cyclist is influenced by multiple factors, including the change from flat to hilly terrain, the directions given by the elderly men, and most crucially, his thirst. He conserves his limited water supply for when it's truly necessary. He searches for a place to cool down and obtain water, which he eventually finds. Additionally, he is somewhat angry and disappointed with the old men's directions, as he has traveled far more miles than expected. He begins to doubt the old men's reliability. In summary, these elements combine to make the cyclist's journey a challenging one.
1595	7577	3	2	Several features influence the cycling experience, including the weather, road conditions, and the cyclist's state of mind. Rainy weather or poor road conditions can lead to a flat tire. The cyclist's mindset also plays a crucial role; if they are motivated, they will try hard, while a more laid - back attitude may result in less effort. In conclusion, these various factors collectively determine how the cycling journey unfolds.
1596	7578	3	2	"In the essay, the setting significantly impacts the cyclist. When cycling in the middle of a hot desert in June without water, the cyclist's thirst intensifies with each passing moment. As an illustration, the author mentions, ""I had been hitting my bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June."" Subsequently, the terrain transitions from flat land to short, rolling hills. This forces the cyclist to exert extra effort to reach the next town for water. For example, the cyclist states, ""Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view."" The cyclist then uses what they believe to be their last burst of energy to reach the building, only to find it abandoned, leading to a sense of disappointment. Eventually, a bait store appears in the setting, and the cyclist experiences relief as they can now obtain water. These instances demonstrate how the changing setting during the cyclist's trip affects them."
1597	7579	3	2	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" a cyclist aimed to reach Yosemite National Park. Instead of taking the longer route, the cyclist followed a ""shortcut"" suggested by some old men. However, these old men were misinformed. As a result, the cyclist encountered more obstacles on the chosen path. When the cyclist needed more water, they came across ""several rusty pumps."" Since no water came out of these pumps, the cyclist had no alternative but to continue the journey in search of water. As the cyclist traveled further, flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills. With no water in sight and limited strength, facing the hills was a challenge, yet there was no choice. The cyclist rode for miles without seeing anyone or anything, as described: ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" Finally, the cyclist's troubles ended after getting directions from another man at a fish camp."
1598	7580	3	2	"The setting creates a sense of urgency. The cyclist is in the middle of the desert and running out of water. If the cyclist were in the forest or the suburbs, the situation would not be as severe. The cyclist contemplates passing out and dying, exclaiming, ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds were going to pick me clean."" This shows how the desert setting, with its lack of water and isolation, heightens the cyclist's sense of desperation and the gravity of the situation."
1599	7581	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist was influenced by the road ahead. The cyclist followed advice that they thought was correct but turned out to be wrong. This led the cyclist off - track from their intended destination. In conclusion, taking incorrect advice can have a negative impact on one's journey, as was the case with this cyclist."
1600	7582	3	2	The settings have a cruel impact on the cyclist. Initially, the cyclist took directions from someone who hadn't left their porch in decades. After accepting and following these directions, several problems arose. One major issue was the cyclist's lack of a water supply. Additionally, the cyclist had encounters with snakes. Moreover, the directions were inaccurate, meaning the cyclist had to travel a longer distance than anticipated. When the cyclist finally reached their destination, they found a deserted town. In conclusion, it is clear that relying on such unreliable directions was a mistake, and the cyclist will likely use their own judgment for directions from now on.
1601	7583	3	2	In the story, as the setting changes, so does the cyclist - narrator's mood. Initially, he is happy and confident. When thinking about Yosemite, he is care - free and worry - free. He states, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” Even when he reaches his first “ghost town,” he simply “chuckled, checked his water supply, and moved on.” However, after this point, his care - free attitude fades. He comes across “One ramshackle shed, several thirsty pumps, and men.” He remarks that this situation is “troubling” as it is very hot and he has been drinking water frequently. He claims that “He failed on.” Realizing he could “drop from a heatstroke,” he starts to get scared. He fears that because he believed the old men, he might die. Finally, when he reaches the bait shop and gets a drink, he becomes happy again. From then on, he sticks to his map. Throughout the story, his attitude undergoes a significant change.
1602	7584	3	2	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist is significantly affected by his surroundings. He is leaving the old water pump en route to Yosemite. As he progresses, “Not two miles flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water - depleting @NUM1.” This demonstrates that as the terrain becomes rougher and more challenging, it becomes increasingly difficult for the cyclist to continue. Moreover, since he is already approaching a state of dehydration, it is even more arduous for the tired cyclist to go further, let alone reach Yosemite. In conclusion, the terrain has a substantial impact on the cyclist's journey.
1603	7585	3	2	The setting had an impact on the cyclist by making him extremely hot. He mentioned that he started sucking on stones because he heard it could alleviate thirst. He also worried that he might hit a bump and swallow one of the rocks, and even expressed a strange desire to swallow them. This was due to the intense heat. Additionally, he was so disoriented that he didn't even know where he was going. In summary, the hot setting affected the cyclist both physically and mentally, causing him to take unusual measures and lose his sense of direction.
1604	7586	3	2	The features of the setting did not assist the cyclist during his trip. Firstly, he was cycling in the desert, which accelerated his dehydration. Secondly, the “towns” along the way had been abandoned, leaving him with no place to replenish his water supply or ask for directions. Lastly, there were no other people around. So, if the cyclist encountered trouble, he would be unable to find help. In conclusion, the unfavorable features of the setting posed significant challenges to the cyclist's journey.
1605	7587	3	2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for multiple reasons. Dehydration is a major concern. Due to the lack of water in the desert and the intense heat, the cyclist can easily become dehydrated. Another issue is the road conditions. The road he is riding on may cause the bike's tires to pop, which could stop the bike from working. In conclusion, the setting features, including the lack of water and poor road conditions, have a negative impact on the cyclist's journey.
1606	7588	3	2	A cyclist, eager to reach Yosemite Park, heeded the advice of some old - timers who hadn't left their porches since Carter was in office. He followed the route they suggested. He descended a hill into an empty town, then onto a rough road with snakes in his path. After that, he climbed a hill and then went down again, where he spotted an abandoned “Welch’s Grape Juice Factory”. Next, he saw a sign for “Gary And Wilber’s FISH CAMP - IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE YOUR BEST BET!”. By this time, he was thirsty and tired. Before reaching the sign, when he saw the abandoned building, he thought he was seeing a mirage as he spotted a young boy drinking juice. He put a few pebbles in his mouth, as sucking on stones is said to help take one's mind off thirst by circulating the remaining saliva. But then, a stone went down his throat. However, when he saw the sign, his troubles, thirst, and fear were left behind.
1607	7589	3	2	The setting's features have a significant impact on the cyclist. One prominent feature is the heat. The heat causes the cyclist to become dehydrated. As the text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips I could drop from a heat - stroke”. This indicates that the heat was taking a toll on him, making his situation difficult during the journey.
1608	7590	3	2	The author portrays the setting as long, unbearable, filled with undesirable heat and a lack of readily available water. The description of the road is replete with challenges. After traveling a certain number of miles to a town and then a few more miles beyond, the cyclist encounters a desolate place. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn't hold in the tamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling.” The cyclist is traveling through the high deserts of California in June, facing the intense heat and the arduousness of the journey. He is moving at a water - depleting 12 mph, feeling that life can be cruel. He wipes the sweat from his eyes, fearing he might be seeing a mirage. As he reaches an abandoned building, his journey seems hopeless and endless. The initial wave of problems is getting stronger, making his journey harder and filled with little hope as his strength wanes to achieve his goals.
1609	7591	3	2	In the story “Do not exceed postal speed limit”, multiple features of the setting impact the cyclist. Firstly, the local people have an effect on him. The quote “Never accept travel advice from a group of old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porch since Carter was in office” reveals the cyclist's attitude towards the old men. By following their directions, he passed through ghost towns and suffered from dehydration. Secondly, the lack of people and civilization poses a problem. There is no one around for him to ask for help. When he tries to stop for water in a town described as a ghost town, he gets none. Finally, the scarcity of water has a huge impact. The description “That smoky blues tune ‘Summer time’ rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain” shows his severe dehydration, as if his brain is drying up. Despite these hardships, his need for water makes him more determined to continue until he reaches another town or his goal of Yosemite National Park.
1610	7592	3	2	The setting's features affect the man in various ways. When the man notices the terrain starting to change, he becomes increasingly distressed. Upon seeing the sign that reads “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed pasted speed limit”, it seems as if he believes the sign is mocking him. Additionally, when the rider says “In an @CAPS1 twist that should please all sadists…”, he conveys to the reader that the situation is highly ironic and that he had no expectations. Overall, the changing terrain and the sign contribute to his negative state of mind during the journey.
1611	7593	3	2	"In the story I read, the setting significantly impacts the cyclist. For instance, the cyclist notices a sign stating, ""Rough road ahead! Do not exceed posted speed limit."" As a result, the cyclist must exercise caution. This shows that the setting can directly influence the cyclist's actions."
1612	7594	3	2	The cyclist found themselves in a terrible environment for cycling. The real set - back was running out of water. There were no houses nearby to refill the water bottle, and no one around to provide updated directions. The intense heat made the cyclist drink more water and also made breathing difficult. Had it not been for these issues, the cyclist would have been fine. In such a situation, these factors combined to create a challenging experience for the cyclist.
1613	7595	3	2	I firmly believe that the features of the setting had multiple effects on the cyclist. As he was riding, he had to endure several hardships. He was parched because he had no water. There was a huge snake occupying half of the road, and there were no buildings in sight. The setting filled him with doubt, but he maintained the confidence to reach his destination. When he finally arrived, it was a moment of relief. Clearly, the setting had a profound impact on his journey.
1614	7596	3	2	In my opinion, the setting in the story had both physical and mental impacts on the cyclist. Physically, the rough terrain and the heat in the desert and mountains took a toll on him. Moreover, since he deviated from the map's plan, he was completely lost, and the resulting anxiety affected his physical well - being. Mentally, every deserted town and building he passed stressed him out. He even thought he was going to die, which is extremely detrimental. I truly think he should trust his judgment and stop listening to unreliable advice. Maps are reliable, and he has clearly learned his lesson.
1615	7597	3	2	Some features of the setting, such as the change in landscape, affected the cyclist. Transitioning from flat land to small hills and then to highways is quite difficult to handle, especially when considering that he was dehydrated and had no water. This combination of factors made the cyclist's journey a challenging one.
1616	7598	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting's features presented challenges like dehydration, dangerous animals, and rough terrain to the speaker, aiming to teach him a lesson about following old men's travel advice. At the start, he confidently embarked on his journey after following “their advice,” thinking the men seemed senseless when pointing out landmarks and talking about towns. The setting transformed from cool to dry and barren, with mentions of tumbleweeds, and then became dangerous when a diamondback snake blocked his path. Eventually, it returned to a comfortable state. Through the hardships of the setting, he learned his lesson and decided to follow his own map from then on.
1617	7599	3	2	The environmental setting, including its features, which provide background information about a subject or event, is significantly affecting a cyclist. In Lodi, California, the hot temperature makes the cyclist hotter than usual as he heads in the wrong direction towards the blazing desert. He is running out of water, becoming increasingly exhausted from the heat, and starting to lose consciousness and get dehydrated. This is a major problem as it causes him to lose his sense of direction and become more panicked as his water supply dwindles. For example, Joe Kurmaskie wrote, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweet circled my skirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heart - stroke on a gorgeous in June.” Another instance is “This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” The heat also increased the cyclist's self - confidence as he tried to break the ride into distances, saying “I began breaking the ride down into distances. I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it this far, I’d be fine.” In conclusion, the hot setting in California exhausted the cyclist's water supply, making him exhausted, dehydrated, and causing him to lose his logical decision - making ability. However, his loss of direction also gave him more self - confidence as he strived to reach a town about twenty miles away to get water and survive.
1618	7600	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's essay “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting affects the cyclist in multiple ways. The heat causes the cyclist to run out of water. He remarks that he could “die of heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June” because he followed the advice of some gentlemen who hadn't left their porch in decades. Also, when he entered a bait shop and cooled down, it was an important change in his situation. Rehydrating himself was crucial. Overall, the setting played a major role in the cyclist's journey on his way to Yosemite National Park, influencing his physical state and actions.
1619	7601	3	2	The cyclist decided to ride through extremely harsh terrain, including deserts and deserted towns. In the morning, while riding past cool trees and rushing water, he wasn't tired or thirsty. But once he reached the desert with no water source, he got thirsty and started drinking his water, which depleted quickly. The dry environment itself can make one thirsty, and after riding for a while, the situation worsened. The setting was the main factor that led to the cyclist running out of water and fearing he would die from heatstroke. Thus, the setting had a profound impact on the cyclist.
1620	7602	3	2	In the story, the setting had a notable impact on the cyclist's mood. Riding through rough terrain and rolling hills made him feel that his journey was hopeless. When he reached the abandoned Grape Factory, he experienced a twist of fate. He was extremely thirsty, and there used to be an organization building there. At a fork in the road, he hoped to get water, but his hopes were dashed. This failure made him even less determined, and he felt as if the world was against him. In conclusion, the setting's challenges and disappointments had a negative impact on the cyclist's mood and determination.
1621	7603	3	2	The concept setting setting setting had a significant influence of the setting on settings had a profound impact on the cyclist. Wherever he went, it seemed as if the journey would never end. For instance when the cyclist followed the advice of the old men and rode along the suggested route, he passed through a ghost town as predicted. After that, he continued onwards, but the journey seemed never - ending. As the summer heat set in, it began to take its toll on him. As he started to dehydrate, he passed an old juice factory and started imagining that he was drinking juice. This was a sign that the extreme conditions were taking a toll on his mind, causing him to see things that weren't there. The setting had a significant impact on the cyclist, pushing the to the brink of physical and mental exhaustion.
1622	7604	3	2	In the poem, as the author cycles through a shortcut, the is in a perilous situation. In June, the author is cycling through the high deserts of California. The desert environment in this region at this time of year is extremely hot, and the cyclist has to endure the unrelenting sun, sand, and a lack of shelter. The high temperatures increase the risk of dehydration and heatstroke. The author mentions that the water bottle contained only a few sips, highlighting the precarious situation. The long distances the author has to cover, as indicated by phrases like “About [@NUM1] miles” and “Twenty miles up the road,” add to the physical and mental strain. All these factors combined pose a serious threat of heatstroke and even death to the cyclist. In conclusion, the difficult conditions of the journey, including the heat, long distances, and limited water supply, significantly endanger the cyclist's well - being.
1623	7605	3	2	The features of the setting, such as the desert, the sun, and the abandoned towns, have a substantial impact on the cyclist. The dry desert gives the cyclist a sense of endlessness, making him feel as if the journey will never end and leaving him to wonder if he'll ever reach a town. The sun exacerbates the cyclist's discomfort by making him hotter, causing him to sweat more and feel thirstier. The abandoned towns further demoralize the cyclist, as they make him lose hope of finding water and reaching his destination, Yosemite. The mood of the story changes from contentment upon reaching the first town to sadness as more towns are abandoned and water runs out, and then to happiness when he finds a bait - shop and water. In conclusion, the setting's features have a powerful and dynamic influence on the cyclist's experience and emotions.
1624	7606	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting has a substantial negative impact on the cyclist. The story unfolds in June in California, a time when the desert heat is at its peak in this region. The high temperatures accelerate the cyclist's dehydration, and it impairs the cyclist's ability to think clearly. The desolate, uninhabited landscape, as described by the author with the statement “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” emphasizes the lack of resources and support. The rough terrain, with its many rolling and crippling hills, makes the journey even more difficult for the cyclist, especially when in a state of despair. In conclusion, the setting of the story significantly affects the cyclist, making his journey extremely challenging.
1625	7607	3	2	The cyclist faced numerous challenges during the journey, with multiple factors affecting his ability to complete the ride. The heat in the desert environment, where the cyclist is located, can cause heatstroke, as the narrator states, “and the growing realization that I could die drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The rough roads, as noted by the warning “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT,” made the journey bumpy and difficult, with many hills to climb. Additionally, the lack of water led to a depletion of energy. Despite these hardships, the cyclist was able to survive and was finally able to drink a lot of water at the end. Overall, the challenging conditions were overcome, but not without significant effort and perseverance.
1626	7608	3	2	The setting's features have a severely detrimental impact on the cyclist. The sweltering temperature and scorching sun made the author feel hot and rapidly depleted his energy. The desolate nature of the setting can cause a person to lose hope of encountering any signs of civilization. As the narrator stated, “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you...” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). However, the most significant harm comes from the dry desert air. It intensifies the cyclist's thirst as he lacks an adequate water supply, leading to faster dehydration. The narrator mentioned, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The lonely and menacing aspects of the setting, combined with the cyclist's lack of water, made the situation even more dire. In conclusion, the adverse setting conditions posed a serious threat to the cyclist's well - being.
1627	7609	3	2	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a cyclist follows poor advice, which results in a difficult journey through the desert with limited water. The setting significantly affects the cyclist, causing dehydration, which is the central conflict of the story. As the author states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” when his fresh water supply starts to dwindle. Another factor presented by the setting is the extreme heat of the California desert. This exacerbates the cyclist's thirst and dehydration. The reader can sense the unpleasant heat from descriptions like “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt…, that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…” Additionally, the rough roads and challenging terrain pose a challenge to the cyclist, slowing his progress towards Yosemite. In conclusion, the various elements of the setting create a formidable obstacle for the cyclist during his journey.
1628	7610	3	2	A cyclist is influenced by the features of the setting. He pedals his bike in the direction the old men advised him to reach Yosemite. Soon, he runs out of water and becomes extremely fatigued, believing he will soon die. However, he then discovers a fish camp. He enters the bathroom to rejuvenate himself. When he emerges, a man is sitting on the porch. The author gets directions from him and is relieved to know he is back on the right track. In conclusion, despite the initial hardships caused by the setting, the cyclist finds a way to get back on course.
1629	7611	3	2	The setting in this essay has both positive and negative effects. The setting is an empty mountain road, devoid of houses, cars, and people. Let's explore these effects. One positive aspect is that being alone allows you to relax and enjoy the energy while exercising. However, a negative aspect is that if you have a flat tire or need assistance, you're in trouble as there's no one around. Another positive is that since there are no cars, you don't have to worry about getting hit and can simply relax and enjoy the ride. But a drawback is the lack of water, so you should bring plenty with you. In conclusion, when deciding to be in such a setting, one should be cautious and think things through.
1630	7612	3	2	The setting or environment in which the cyclist found himself made him feel isolated from the rest of the world. Once he embarked on his adventure, he knew there was no turning back. With no one to offer help, the environment made him aware of the numerous risks associated with this journey. The realization that there was no external assistance served as his motivation to persevere on his long - distance journey. In conclusion, the isolation and awareness of risks in the setting ultimately drove the cyclist to continue his adventure.
1631	7613	3	2	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting's features impact the cyclist as he traverses various landmarks. Initially, he sought information from the elderly. When he showed them the map, they were only familiar with old shortcuts, not new ones. Subsequently, he ran out of water. As he climbed hills, he became exhausted. Moreover, when he attempted to get water from a source, only hot water came out. Finally, when he reached a store, an old man had his own map. When the cyclist asked about his destination, the old man's response made him realize he was in trouble. In conclusion, these aspects of the setting significantly affected the cyclist.
1632	7614	3	2	The setting's features had a substantial impact on the cyclist. The environment was extremely hot, and there were numerous hills. The cyclist spent the entire day cycling up and down these hills, which consumed a great deal of his energy. When he spotted a building he hoped could offer assistance, he stated, “…last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.” This statement indicates that the hilly terrain of the setting depleted his energy. In summary, the setting's features had a notable effect on the cyclist.
1633	7615	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's short story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,” the setting's features influence the cyclist. At an old person's house, he is confident because they inform him of a shortcut to Yosemite. As he leaves, his confidence remains. However, as the setting changes, so does his mood. After cycling about @NUM1 miles, he reaches the first town. It is a ghost - town, causing him despair. Despite still having some confidence, the lack of water compels him to continue. A few miles later, he comes to a small fork with a pump. Thinking it would provide cool water, he pumps it only to find that the water is @NUM2∞@CAPS1 and tastes like “battery acid”. Now desperate, dehydrated, and with no towns in sight, he pedals on in the hope of finding a town. When he does find a town with water, the setting becomes more relieving for him. In the end, the setting causes the cyclist to shift from confidence to desperation as water runs out and then to relief when water is found.
1634	7616	3	2	Embarking on this risk is inherently difficult, and the cyclist is taking it in the desert. As is well - known, the desert can reach extremely high temperatures, making a bike ride far from enjoyable. Additionally, when the only things visible for miles are the road, sand, and an empty factory, one's morale can quickly decline. The desert setting, overall, is a place where one can easily feel lost. In conclusion, the desert setting presents significant challenges and a demoralizing environment for the cyclist.
1635	7617	3	2	The features of the setting make the cyclist feel hopeless after realizing he isn't on a shortcut. As he rides, he has an increasing fear of dropping from heatstroke. The only building he sees for miles is the @NUM1 Welch's Grape Juice Factory, which drives him deeper into despair and makes him feel all hope is lost. As he continues riding, the song “'@ORGANIZATION2'” plays in his deteriorating mind. At this point, he believes his death is inevitable. When talking about the pebbles in his mouth, he says, “with any luck I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” Finally, he reaches a small bait shop and regains hope as he drinks deeply from the sink. The desert setting, lacking water, shelter, and people, caused his concern and later panic about his life. The cyclist's hopelessness is similar to that of those in the @ORGANIZATION1. Trapped in a blizzard far from civilization, they resorted to extreme measures like eating their dead to survive. Just as the setting of the @ORGANIZATION1 made them feel hopeless, the desert setting had the same effect on the cyclist.
1636	7618	3	2	Cycling under extreme heat can be incredibly challenging and perilous. On a beautiful June day, a cyclist could face overwhelming heat. Water fails to cool them down, and even a sip in the mouth might taste like battery acid. In such conditions, the cyclist or anyone else could easily succumb to heatstroke. The intense heat can make one hallucinate, and even the thought of a refreshing glass of juice in a hot town might not bring relief. Clearly, the sweltering conditions pose a significant threat to cyclists.
1637	7619	3	2	The features of the setting had a profound impact on the cyclist. At the start, he was in a confident state of mind. However, upon reaching a deserted town, his confidence began to waver, though it still remained relatively high. Twenty miles further down the road, he encountered a fork with a ramshackle shed, rusty and unclean pumps, and a small corral. The scorching desert heat and his dwindling water supply led to rapid dehydration. As stated in Paragraph @NUM1, “This sight was troubling… I had been hitting my water bottles regularly, and was traveling through the high deserts in California.” With limited water and energy, he quickly grew tired and dehydrated. The terrain then transformed into rolling hills, further exhausting him. His mood shifted from confidence to hopelessness, and he even contemplated changing a diary entry in case of a heat - stroke. Evidently, the setting features significantly influenced the cyclist's mood, and it serves as a reminder that taking the so - called “easy way out” can sometimes lead to disappointment.
1638	7620	3	2	Throughout the story, the setting had a continuous impact on the cyclist until he reached Body and Wilbers Fish Camp. Initially, as the cyclist rode his bike, he was in a certain state. But when he entered the first town, it appeared to be a ghost town. As he continued pedaling, “The sun was beginning to beat down but I barely noticed it.” At this time, the weather was taking a toll on him, yet he kept the image of Yosemite's cool pines and rushing rivers in his mind. Moreover, while climbing a big hill, he only had a few tantalizing sips of water left in his bottle. In conclusion, the setting's various elements clearly affected the cyclist's journey and well - being.
1639	7621	3	2	The purpose of this essay's setting is to guide cyclists on their route to prevent them from getting lost. Additionally, it advises cyclists not to take advice from old people. This setting is crafted to offer practical guidance and a cautionary note to cyclists, ensuring they can have a more successful and informed journey.
1640	7622	3	2	The features of the setting have a substantial impact on the cyclist. The environment is characterized by hot weather and rough terrain, leaving the cyclist tired and thirsty. The cyclist mentioned, “Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view,” indicating his desperate need for water due to the arduous climb. He also stated, “Summertime ‘rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain’.” It being summer, he hummed the song “Summertime” to distract himself from the thirst, showing his determination to resist the heat's effects on his body. Furthermore, he said, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” This highlights the dangerous nature of the terrain. Despite all these challenges, the cyclist aimed to prove that he could overcome any obstacle. In conclusion, the setting clearly had a great influence on the cyclist.
1641	7623	3	2	A cyclist's experience can be influenced by numerous factors. In this particular story, three main aspects of the setting had the most significant impact on the cyclist. While cycling, the weather was extremely hot. Evidence of this can be found in the text, which states, “That I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The heat likely made the cyclist thirsty. Another notable feature of the setting was the abundance of hills. As the text mentions, “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” Navigating these hills would have led to exhaustion. The third aspect of the setting was nature, which can affect individuals in various ways, including through weather, terrain, and in this case, animals. The cyclist encountered a large snake, which made the situation dangerous. The setting has the power to shape any experience. Had the cyclist been on this journey during @DATE1 in the summer instead of June, the story would have been completely different.
1642	7624	3	2	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1,” the setting serves two crucial functions: altering the cyclist's mood and reflecting his situation. For instance, the statement “the cool pines and rushing river of Yosemite had my name written all over them” depicts the cyclist's circumstances. The imagery of lush, cool water and vegetation offers the @CAPS4 hope during his increasingly arduous journey. The beauty of this setting also foreshadows the comfort that would come from reaching Yosemite, suggesting that a favorable setting is associated with a positive outcome. Later, the cyclist encounters “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mare.” This dismal setting symbolizes a complete loss of hope, and at this point, the cyclist becomes troubled by his situation. While pedaling through the desert, the appearance of tumbleweeds, a common symbol of a deserted area, further exacerbates his distress. The use of setting to influence and mirror mood is a well - established literary technique. In the story “The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @PERSON1,” a desolate land filled with wild beasts symbolizes and causes @PERSON2 to undergo a personality change as he is surrounded by uncivilized people, leading him to tear his clothes and hunt like a dog. The desert setting in the uncultured part of the colony both causes and reflects this transformation. Thus, the setting in the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” plays an essential role in character development.
1643	7625	3	2	The features of the essay illustrate how the characteristics of the setting affect the cyclist for multiple reasons. When the author writes “tumbleweeds crossed my path,” it indicates that the cyclist is likely in a remote location. This is because tumbleweeds are commonly used in movies and TV shows as a sign of a deserted place. Additionally, statements such as “the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” and “a ridiculously large snake” highlight the increasing danger the cyclist is facing. Snakes pose a constant threat, and the cyclist could collapse from dehydration and die. Lastly, the name of the store is significant. It is a fish bait store, and the cyclist is thirsty. Since fish live in water, seeing the sign provides him with complete relief. In conclusion, the features of this essay effectively explain how the features of the setting impact the cyclist.
1644	7626	3	2	On his journey to Yosemite, the cyclist confronts numerous challenges, one of which is traversing the California deserts. Deserts are hot and dry environments, and since the cyclist was cycling, he became even more thirsty and hot. He also came across a large snake, seemingly a diamondback, which almost covered the road. Fortunately, he managed to avoid it. Moreover, when riding through the hills, the cyclist had to deal with rough terrain. Despite these challenges, the cyclist showed bravery and continued to progress on his journey.
1645	7627	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Speed limit,” different settings took a toll on the cyclist. At the beginning, he enjoyed a smooth ride, but the heat was intense. Subsequently, he encountered short rolling hills, which tired his legs. Then, he entered a rough area where he had to be more cautious. The roughness of the terrain, with all its bumps and bounces, likely exhausted him. The cyclist endured a great deal during this bike trip, and it's uncertain whether he would have made it back to his accommodation.
1646	7628	3	2	The features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist, making it more difficult for the cyclist to pedal and complete the ride. For instance, the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. This increases the difficulty of the trip as the cyclist can no longer pedal at a consistent rate throughout but has to alternate between harder and easier pedaling, expending more energy. Another factor is that the journey took place through the high deserts of California in June. The scorching summer heat makes the cyclist's task arduous. Additionally, at the first three stops, there were no facilities to fill water bottles, take a drink, or cool off, leading to dehydration during the entire trip. These setting features collectively make the cyclist's journey more challenging.
1647	7629	3	2	One of the factors affecting the cyclist was the presence of rolling hills. As the text states, “two miles into the section... I noticed the terrain changing…”. This change in terrain presented an obstacle for the cyclist, altering the ease of the ride. In conclusion, the rolling hills had a notable impact on the cyclist's experience.
1648	7630	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the setting significantly influences the story for multiple reasons. The story is set in summer, resulting in extremely hot weather. Moreover, it takes place in the western desert, which already has a warm climate. Additionally, there is no civilization along the “shortcut” the author follows, leaving the author with no means to replenish their body with water. These features of the setting collectively affect the cyclist in the story.
1649	7631	3	2	The setting has a substantial impact on the cyclist. If it is windy, it becomes difficult for the cyclist to control the bike. When there are many buildings and people outside, there is heavy traffic, and the cyclist may not be allowed to proceed and has to turn back. On the other hand, if the road is clear with no buildings or houses, the cyclist can have an easy ride. Evidently, the setting affects the cyclist in numerous ways.
1650	7632	3	2	The cyclist was significantly affected by several unfavorable aspects of the setting. At the beginning, when the weather was not as hot and the cyclist had an ample supply of water, everything was fine. However, as the day progressed, the heat became oppressive, and the cyclist drank all the water, feeling desperate. The cyclist's mood changed in tandem with the setting and turned extremely happy upon reaching Gary and @ORGANIZATION1. Also, when in trouble, the cyclist blamed the old men for giving bad directions but later thanked them upon realizing they were right. In conclusion, the setting had a profound and multi - faceted impact on the cyclist's journey and emotions.
1651	7633	3	2	On a good day, cyclists are inclined to ride. Conversely, on a bad day, they may not be eager to ride but will likely do so anyway.
1652	7634	3	2	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting features impact the cyclist. There are elderly individuals who have been in the area for a long time, and one cannot seek advice from them as they are too old to provide useful information and may not know what they are talking about. As the essay states, “A better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be, ‘Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.’” These are the setting features and examples from the essay.
1653	7635	3	2	I thought the story “Rough Road Ahead” would be about scenery, but it turned out the cyclist wasn't well - prepared. He took directions from some old men who hadn't left their homes since Carter was in office. He was pedaling his bike through the California desert, carrying only what he could on his bike. He ran out of water and could have suffered from heatstroke or collapsed in the middle of nowhere with no one around to help. The heat made him extremely thirsty and could drive him crazy. The cyclist's situation was harsh, and I don't think he was ready. One should always trust their instincts.
1654	7636	3	2	In the story, the cyclist faced a negative situation. There were no people around, no buildings, he had no water, and he was lost. This made him doubt himself throughout. However, he persevered and managed to get through this tough situation.
1655	7637	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting and its features influence the cyclist. For instance, the cyclist says, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate.” This indicates that the conditions are harsh, as he wouldn't be so desperately thirsty unless it was very hot. The story is set in California on a hot day. Another quote, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage,” shows the heat as he is sweating. Also, the mention of a mirage suggests a hot desert environment, as mirages are commonly seen in such places.
1656	7638	3	2	In Joe Kurmaskie's essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting's features impact the cyclist in multiple ways. Initially, as the cyclist rode those first miles, the emptiness in sight diminished his determination to reach his goal. However, in a certain paragraph, spotting a building rejuvenated his strength. Throughout the ride, his determination waned, but the sight of that building eventually provided relief and boosted his self - confidence. The setting's features thus significantly influenced the cyclist's mental state and progress.
1657	7639	3	2	The setting's features cause the cyclist to face dehydration and a depletion of time and energy. The quote “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” confirms the rider's dehydration. The statement “The glowing realization that I could die from a heat stroke” indicates that the rider is running out of time and energy. These ideas and quotes clearly illustrate how the setting's features affect the cyclist, highlighting the challenges he endures due to the environment.
1658	7640	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead,” the author embarks on a trail he'd previously heard of. When the ride fails to meet his expectations, the true nature of the setting becomes apparent. The arid climate forces the author to struggle against himself and the surrounding conditions. Moreover, his initial lack of water is compounded by the scorching sun, leading to a dangerous state of dehydration. In conclusion, the setting's harsh elements severely impede the author's journey.
1659	7641	3	2	The cyclist encounters numerous tough challenges. The actual characteristics of the setting have a significant impact on him. For instance, he gets directions from some old men who seem unsure of what they're saying. Then, he runs out of water, has to navigate bumpy roads, and spots snakes. With no buildings or cars around, he has no means of seeking help. He comes across an old, abandoned factory that was thought to be the Welch's Grape juice factory. Towards the end, he finds a fish camp where he finally gets water and is around people. These various obstacles affect his mood and determination, clearly demonstrating the strong influence of the setting on his journey.
1660	7642	3	2	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” the setting greatly affects the main character. At the start of the story, he passes the first “town” and continues cycling based on directions from some old folks. The thought of “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it” boosts his already - confident mood, with words like “rushing” being encouraging. As he rides on, noticing the changing terrain makes him doubt the accuracy of the directions. Tired as he is, the rolling hills only add to his uncertainty. The sight of an empty landscape with “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” deepens his despair, as he fears dying in Yosemite. When he finally sees a building after a “long crippling hill,” the use of “crippling” shows his extreme exhaustion. Overall, the setting throughout the journey has a profound and ever - changing impact on the character's state of mind.
1661	7643	3	2	The setting's features significantly impact the cyclist. As he pedals through a desolate and dilapidated town, an eerie feeling washes over him. Subsequently, he enters the desert, where a massive snake crosses his path, further heightening his fear. Upon reaching the abandoned juice factory, he is nearly exhausted and can barely continue his journey. Finally, he arrives at the bait shop. In conclusion, most elements of the setting unnerve the cyclist, and all of them have an effect on him.
1662	7644	3	2	As the cyclist continued his ride with no building in sight, he began to feel that death was approaching. This situation made him hysterical, and he still had the energy to pity himself. When he finally spotted a building, he initially thought it was a mirage. In summary, the lack of visible structures and the long - distance ride took a toll on his mental state.
1663	7645	3	2	"The location of a cyclist's ride has a notable impact on their attitude and physical strength. For instance, a hilly road requires more effort to maintain speed. Kurmaskie's statement, ""It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself,"" demonstrates how hills can sap a cyclist's energy. Additionally, being in a desert can weaken a cyclist due to thirst, as seen when the cyclist in the reading was desperate enough to attempt pumping brackish - looking water. In conclusion, the setting can indeed undermine a cyclist's performance and well - being."
1664	7646	3	2	The setting in the passage is unfavorable for the cyclist. He is running low on water and is on the verge of dehydration. The weather in his location is extremely hot, and he cannot see a town for miles. This combination of factors makes his journey extremely challenging. In conclusion, the harsh setting poses a significant obstacle to the cyclist's progress.
1665	7647	3	2	"The setting's features affect the cyclist in multiple ways. The high temperature made him feel dehydrated, and he had very little water with a long distance to cover. He also had to traverse numerous hills and deserts to reach his destination. Taking a ""shortcut"" turned out to be a bad decision as it took longer and exacerbated his dehydration. In conclusion, the heat, lack of water, terrain, and the ill - fated shortcut all had a detrimental impact on the cyclist."
1666	7648	3	2	The setting's features have a positive impact on the cyclist. Cycling, being a sport, helps the cyclist stay in good physical condition. Additionally, by winning cycling contests, the cyclist can accumulate wealth. In conclusion, the setting contributes to the cyclist's well - being and financial gain.
1667	7649	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's essay, different settings give rise to numerous obstacles for the character. The high temperature led to the character's dehydration, as he recalled, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This dehydration caused a loss of determination, ultimately resulting in a loss of consciousness. The hills the character had to cycle on also took a toll. They made him tired and weak, further eroding his determination, which could also lead to a loss of consciousness, as he said, ""if it looked like I was going to lose consciousness for the last time."" In summary, the various settings in the essay presented significant challenges to the character."
1668	7650	3	2	The story's setting had a notable impact on the cyclist. If the setting were in the suburbs, the cyclist could have stopped anywhere to get water. However, the plot placed the cyclist in the middle of a desert. All he could do was keep cycling, hoping to find water. For instance, he had to travel @NUM1 miles to reach the next town for water. In a non - desert area without hills, he could have covered that distance quickly. In conclusion, the desert setting with its lack of resources and difficult terrain made the cyclist's journey much more arduous.
1669	7651	3	2	The cyclist was influenced by multiple aspects of the setting. Initially, the flat road transformed into bumpy hills. Cycling on these hills was made more difficult due to the lack of water. Moreover, the intense desert sun, along with the scarcity of towns and people, added to the difficulty of the journey. In conclusion, the setting presented a series of challenges that affected the cyclist's progress.
1670	7652	3	2	"The setting's features affected the cyclist mainly because of the extreme heat. The heat was so intense that his water tasted like battery acid. On top of that, he had to deal with difficult trails and old - timers who gave him outdated directions, as he mentioned, ""old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office."" The non - stop cycling also made the heat seem even more unbearable. However, when he was riding, he thought about ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,"" which helped him forget about the heat. In conclusion, the combination of heat, difficult trails, and unhelpful directions from old - timers, along with the long - distance cycling, all contributed to the setting's impact on the cyclist."
1671	7653	3	2	The features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. The extreme heat, as it was summertime in the California desert, poses a challenge. The rough road, indicated by a sign stating “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @NUM1”, is also a hindrance for a cyclist. Additionally, the lack of people around means there is no one to provide directions or offer a drink of water. These are some of the reasons why the setting affects the cyclist.
1672	7654	3	2	The story is set outdoors. Yosemite is riding her bike in an area with hills, poor - quality water, and sweltering heat. We know she is near hills because she says, “I maneuvered down the hill.” The water is bad as she describes it as having “the flavor of battery acid” when she tried a couple of drops. The heat is extreme, with the text mentioning “in the … of two hundred degrees.” Yosemite starts off facing difficulties but ultimately learns to persevere and never give up. Her major problem is the lack of good water due to the hot weather and the poor - tasting water she had.
1673	7655	3	2	There are several factors that can affect the cyclist. For instance, when the cyclist mentioned “tumbleweeds crossed my path, and there was a ridiculously large snake,” it shows how the natural elements can pose challenges. Another example is when they said “Not two miles into this next section of the ride I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These are how the features of the setting impact the cyclist.
1674	7656	3	2	In the story of the cyclist, the features of the setting have an impact. The cyclist had to endure a lot, like a speed limit of @NUM1 and a water - depleting @NUM2. Sometimes, life can seem harsh. Despite this, the cyclist loves riding their bike and enjoys the tranquility of an early - summer evening while cycling.
1675	7657	3	2	The features of the setting have a notable effect on the cyclist. The thought of the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite, as described by “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,” motivated the cyclist to keep going. However, the road conditions became more difficult. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, and a sign on another road warned of a rough road ahead, making the cyclist work harder to reach Yosemite National Park. Moreover, the cyclist's water supply was dwindling, with only a few sips left in the water bottles. With no knowledge of where to find more water and encountering abandoned “ghost towns,” the cyclist had no place to seek help. Clearly, this cyclist faced numerous problems during the bike ride to Yosemite National Park.
1676	7658	3	2	The directions provided by the older men were extremely poor. Undoubtedly, nature was not on his side. Due to the intense heat, he ran out of water. A snake then blocked his path, and he didn't dare to provoke it. Moreover, he became so overheated that there was a risk of suffering a heat - stroke in the desolate area. He also kept going to abandoned buildings. Things got so bad that the stone he used to alleviate his thirst got stuck in his throat. Eventually, he was led to a bait - shop in the middle of nowhere, with no means of getting home. In the end, his situation was truly dire, and he was in a difficult predicament without obvious solutions.
1677	7659	3	2	The setting's features had a significant impact on the cyclist. The dry desert environment caused dehydration as there was no water available. The intense heat put the cyclist at risk of a heat - stroke. The presence of animals, specifically a snake, posed a life - threatening danger, and with no one in the vicinity for miles, the cyclist would have been in great peril if the snake had attacked. As the story states, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” If the cyclist had needed help, it was highly likely that he would have died. Personally, if I were the cyclist, I probably would have given up by then. However, I'm glad the cyclist persevered. Clearly, the setting's features affected the cyclist in numerous and potentially life - altering ways.
1678	7660	3	2	The heat, a prominent feature of the setting, affected the cyclist as he got lost and his water supply gradually depleted. The cyclist remarked, “That you should never accept travel advice from old timers that haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office.” This indicates that following their advice led him to get lost in the desert and run low on water. So thirsty was he that he put stones in his mouth to distract himself from the need for water. In the end, the cyclist learned an important lesson: to trust maps and signs rather than relying on the advice of elderly people who haven't left their homes in years. This new - found wisdom will likely guide his future travels.
1679	7661	3	2	The desert setting is an extremely challenging environment, lacking both water and help. Had the author been in a populated area with water fountains and shade, the situation would have been manageable. However, in the desert, he was surrounded by heat, dryness, and solitude, with no water or shade in sight. The description “tumbleweeds crossed my path” reflects his profound loneliness, as there was no one to assist him. Without the fish camp, the harsh setting could have cost him his life. Clearly, the setting had a huge and potentially life - altering impact on the author.
1680	7662	3	2	The features in the short story significantly affected the cyclist. With no towns nearby, water was scarce. As the story states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,” indicating that the cyclist urgently needed to find a town for water. Cycling in the desert and over hills made the journey more difficult and increased the heat. The high temperature could lead to dehydration or a heat - stroke, as the text mentions “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” The buildings the cyclist encountered were of no help as they had no water. Eventually, he reached a fishing camp and found water in the bathroom sink. The story describes, “I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” This marked a change in the setting, as the cyclist finally found the much - needed cool water, relieving his desperate situation.
1681	7663	3	2	In the account “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author encounters numerous obstacles during his journey to Yosemite National Park due to varying terrain changes. After taking advice from a group of old men, he set off towards his first stop. The old men had mentioned that he would come across a town, yet what he found was a dilapidated “ghost” town. Subsequently, he reached a fork in the road and was running low on water. He had been cycling on a flat road when the terrain suddenly transformed. It became hilly and inconsistent. This abrupt change in terrain made him more fatigued, thirsty, and hot. Then, he faced a huge hill and, using his last reserves of energy, rode down it, completely exhausted. The various terrain changes not only affected the cyclist's physical state but also his mood and determination.
1682	7664	3	2	The setting had a profound impact on the cyclist in multiple ways. The description “The journey nass make an snake” made it seem as though he was in the middle of nowhere, with no clear destination in sight, especially since the man on the porch had claimed it wouldn't be far. The first town he encountered was empty. Initially, he was excited upon seeing it, but as he got closer, he realized it had been abandoned all along. This forced him to continue his journey, and the desolate town left him feeling almost hopeless. In his efforts to reach the next town, the setting significantly influenced the cyclist in this manner.
1683	7665	3	2	The road's setting affected the cyclist in numerous ways. The absence of towns on the road made it extremely difficult for him to find water, leading to a state of dehydration. As the old guys had assured him that the next town was only eighteen miles down the road, he decided to conserve his water and ride for about an hour. The rolling hills of the road made him expend more energy. With no buildings in sight for miles, he divided the ride into short distances. Overall, the setting of the road presented substantial challenges to the cyclist's journey.
1684	7666	3	2	The features of the setting had a far - reaching impact on the cyclist. The most significant issue he faced was the lack of water. A group of old men gave him directions, but they were of little help. These men provided directions based on their memories from their younger days. The cyclist was initially skeptical about taking directions from them, but their confidence made him follow their advice. At the start, the cyclist was determined to reach his destination. However, as he got hotter and thirstier, he started to consider giving up. Just when he was on the verge of quitting, his troubles, thirst, and fear were alleviated as he unexpectedly found water. This shows how the setting's features tested the cyclist's resolve but also provided a glimmer of hope.
1685	7667	3	2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in several distinct ways. One major issue was his limited supply of water; as Kurmaskie noted, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Additionally, the cyclist got lost because of the directions given by the old men, which were outdated and led him nowhere. Kurmaskie also stated, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven’t left the confine of their porches since carter was in office.” He was understandably unhappy with the bad directions. In conclusion, the cyclist endured some tough times due to the adverse effects of the setting.
1686	7668	3	2	The various features of the story's desert setting have a negative impact on the cyclist. The barren desert land leaves him with only a small supply of water. During his journey, he runs out of water, causing him to lose touch with reality. The extreme desert heat makes him hallucinate; he begins to see a grape - juice factory, which disrupts his trip. Unfortunately, it turns out to be just a mirage. Additionally, the long and rough road wears the cyclist down. In conclusion, the desert setting's features significantly impede the cyclist's journey.
1687	7669	3	2	The cyclist decides to take a shortcut to his next destination after spending a pleasant afternoon at a nice campground. He believes it will be a more relaxing option than the original, longer route to Yosemite. However, the trip changes his mind significantly. The narrator in the essay mentions what the old guys told him, saying, “The old guys had sworn the next town only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. I would conserve my water…” He conserves his water, but the town is old and has no water for him. The narrator goes without water until he reaches a factory, gets water, and new directions. The trip is far different from what he expected and is quite depressing. In summary, the setting and circumstances of the trip turn out to be a far cry from the cyclist's initial expectations.
1688	7670	3	2	In analyzing how the features of the setting affected the cyclist, it can be noted that the nature of the setting's features is based on certain factors. The differences between stories play a role in this. The unique characteristics of the setting influence the cyclist's experience. For example, elements such as the environment, resources available, and distances can all have an impact. In conclusion, the features of the setting, with their story - specific differences, are key in determining how they affect the cyclist.
1689	7671	3	2	You can always choose your features, but your ideas may change over time. As time progresses, new information, experiences, and perspectives can cause you to re - evaluate your initial choices. What seems like a good option at one point may no longer be suitable later. In conclusion, flexibility in decision - making regarding features is important due to the potential for changing ideas.
1690	7672	3	2	The features of the setting have both positive and negative mental and physical impacts on the cyclist. For example, when the cyclist sees a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a glass of juice at @CAPS1's Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant, it affects him mentally by making him realize his lack of water. Physically, as moments pass, he becomes dehydrated. This shows a negative impact of the setting. Another instance is when the cyclist encounters “One ramshacked shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule.” Mentally, it makes him think he'll never see civilization again. Physically, the water that tastes like “battery acid” worsens his dehydration. Overall, the setting features generally have a negative influence on the cyclist. Just as an environment shapes a person, the setting features determine the cyclist's experience. In conclusion, the setting features play a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's mental and physical state during the journey.
1691	7673	3	2	He is embarking on a bike journey. During this journey, he has to descend hills and confront the issue of having no water. This essentially encapsulates the setting of his journey.
1692	7674	3	2	When cycling, the surrounding features can impact the cyclist. Weather and scenery are two factors that can have such an influence. In cold and rainy weather, cyclists are disinclined to ride as poor weather conditions pose risks, making them hesitant about whether to continue. In extremely hot weather, cyclists are more prone to dehydration and exhaustion. Scenery also plays a role. If a cyclist only sees a desert during the ride, they may have doubts about their destination. Abandoned buildings can frighten cyclists or make them lose hope, as seen in the story “Do not exceed the speed limit” when the cyclist, after going over a hill, doubts reaching Yosemite. Evidently, numerous factors can affect cyclists.
1693	7675	3	2	The setting's features have an impact on the cyclist. In June, at the start of summer, the weather contributes to water depletion. When the cyclist “arrived at the first ‘town’,” it was deserted, and the water was unpalatable. The author employs verbal irony by referring to it as a “town” when it no longer fits the description. A large snake introduced an element of danger, and an abandoned Grape Juice Factory added to the sense of hopelessness and being lost. These aspects of the setting collectively affect the cyclist's experience.
1694	7676	3	2	Multiple elements of the setting influence the cyclist. The heat is a primary factor. It creates the conflict in the story where the cyclist needs water. Without the heat, the cyclist would not have such a pressing need for water and could continue the ride without fear of dehydration. Rolling hills are another aspect of the setting that impacts the cyclist. They exhaust the cyclist and increase the need for water. Without the hills, the cyclist would tire less quickly, making the journey easier. Clearly, the setting in this story significantly affects the cyclist.
1695	7677	3	2	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting impact the cyclist in various ways. After following the old men's advice, the cyclist begins his journey. Once the first town appears, the sun beats down intensely, which affects the cyclist. The text states, “The sun was beginning to heat beat down, but I barely noticed it.” Initially, the cyclist may not be aware of the heat, but later, on the long, winding road of the new flat terrain, he runs out of water, which is extremely dangerous in such hot weather. The text mentions, “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water - depleting @NUM2,” indicating that the cyclist is out of water. In this setting, dangerous creatures can be encountered. The story says, “I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamondback - blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me,” showing that snakes are present. Undoubtedly, the features of the setting in “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” have a significant impact on the cyclist.
1696	7678	3	2	The terrain setting impacts the cyclist in numerous ways. Being in a desert made him extremely thirsty, yet there were no towns or any signs of water to relieve his thirst. Additionally, the hills in the terrain made his cycling more arduous, causing him to become even more fatigued. These are the effects the setting had on the cyclist.
1697	7679	3	2	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed” by @PERSON1, the cyclist encounters problems due to the setting. While riding, the intense heat caused the biker to become dehydrated and tired, and he was running out of water. Because of the high temperature, the biker needed to drink more water to replenish the sweat lost during cycling. The hills in the terrain made the journey harder, as he had to expend more energy and liquid to keep going. If the weather had been cool and breezy, and the surrounding area had been populated instead of having abandoned towns, the cyclist would not have faced these difficulties.
1698	7680	3	2	Everyone experiences physical and emotional pain, but few would have survived what the cyclist in this story endured. The man began a bike ride in Yosemite National Park. When some elderly men told him about a shortcut, his challenging adventure began. Every “town” and “building” the men said he would reach turned out to be completely deserted. Initially, this was not a major concern for the cyclist. In the fourth paragraph, when he reached his first deserted town, he “chuckled, checked [his] water supply, and moved on.” However, as his journey continued, his water supply decreased, and he became desperate to find a town. Moreover, as described in the story, “the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” which made his biking more difficult and led to dehydration. He finally found a town with water, and learned not to take advice from strangers and old men.
1699	7681	3	2	The features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist. A man took the advice of old men and attempted a “shortcut” to Yosemite Park, but it only led him to thirst and no park. The narration mentions, “A sand - blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen (Kurmaskie @NUM1).” This feature could have discouraged the cyclist. When he reached the first “town,” he found no water and a picture that made him even thirstier. It could also have made him angry at the old men for leading him on this pointless journey. Another feature that affected the cyclist was the lack of trees or shade. He could only feel the sun beating down on his back, as described by “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt (Kurmaskie @NUM1).” This made the cyclist believe that old men do not know what they are talking about.
1700	7682	3	2	In “Do not exceed the posted speed limit,” several features of the setting affected the cyclist. The time of year, mid - June, had an impact. Since the region was Arizona, mid - June there is extremely hot and dry. If the cyclist had been in a more northern state during the same time, the heat struggles would not have been as severe. Also, when the terrain changed from flat to hilly, it became harder for the cyclist to ride. These are the features of the setting that influenced the cyclist in the story.
1701	7683	3	2	In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting's features significantly impacted the cyclist. In June, while in the California desert, his water supply was exhausted, and he encountered a ghost - town. This dire situation led to a dwindling of his hope. He found a water pump, but it produced a tar - like substance. The harsh desert conditions and lack of water made him wish he were dead. As a result, he decided to stop taking advice from strangers and rely solely on his map. Clearly, the setting's features had a profound and detrimental effect on the cyclist.
1702	7684	3	2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the setting's features affected the cyclist both physically and emotionally. Traveling in a dry area, he couldn't refill his water and gradually became dehydrated. Biking in the heat, he continuously sweated, further depleting his body's water and playing tricks on his mind. The hills demanded more energy from him, exacerbating his dehydration. Moreover, the hills dampened his spirits, forcing him to summon a great deal of inner strength and determination to continue. Overall, the setting had a notable physical and emotional impact on the cyclist.
1703	7685	3	2	The cyclist, alone, initially traveled on flat land, following the directions given by some old men to reach Yosemite National Park in @LOCATION1. In June's scorching heat, cycling over hills and through deserts with the sun beating down, he became dehydrated. He realized that without water, he could have a heart - stroke. His journey was desolate and lonely. When he finally spotted what seemed to be buildings, which turned out to be ghost towns, he regained some determination and sped up. Fortunately, he found a campsite, which saved him from passing out in the desert. After resting and getting water, he continued his journey using his own map. This experience shows how the cyclist overcame the challenges of the journey with a bit of luck.
1704	7686	3	2	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed Limit”, the cyclist sought to reach Yosemite using directions from some eccentric old men. He described the old men as if they “haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office”. He followed their advice but got lost about @NUM1 along his journey. While looking forward to the “Cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite”, he found himself in a barren desert. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” Such a setting could easily dampen his mood as he thought about Yosemite, potentially making him lose hope of ever reaching it. A pleasant setting can make a trip more rewarding and the destination even more appealing.
1705	7687	3	2	The setting had a notable impact on the cyclist's performance and mood. The rolling hills he had to cross likely made him more tired and thirsty as he exerted more effort. As he said, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view.” The large, long hills increased his thirst but probably also gave him a greater sense of satisfaction upon completion. Ironically, the building was an abandoned and rusty grape - juice factory, yet the sign of a boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice was still visible, which brought his hopes down. However, he continued moving forward. In my own life, I've never faced a situation where I had to constantly push myself towards a goal while distractions mounted as I got closer. But this cyclist's experience shows the challenges one can face in achieving a goal.
1706	7688	3	2	"The short story ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"" follows a man cycling through Yosemite. He asks some elderly men for directions, and they direct him onto an ""old"" shortcut. This shortcut leads him through difficult terrain and areas of extreme desolation. Throughout the story, the setting significantly impacts the cyclist. For instance, when he reaches a deserted area, he remarks that ""there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" By this point, he is malnourished and desperately in need of water. His extreme thirst is further exacerbated when he passes an abandoned Welch's grape juice factory with an advertisement showing a young boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth. He elaborates on the building, and at this time, he is tired and worn - out, and the advertisement only makes his situation worse. The author's mood changes with the setting, deteriorating before eventually improving."
1707	7689	3	2	"A young cyclist started his day full of confidence, looking forward to riding across California. However, as he realizes he has been misdirected, his mood shifts, and he begins to feel hopeless. At the start, he is carefree and ready for anything. He writes, ""I checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was starting to heat up, but I barely noticed it."" The surroundings initially have little impact on him. Later, he notices his water supply dwindling and starts to feel tired. His mood then changes to exhaustion and defeat. He says, ""I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuffed them in my mouth. With any luck, I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat."" He becomes sarcastic and saddened by the hopelessness of his journey. Eventually, the relief of cold water restores his spirits and sense of humor."
1708	7690	3	2	In the essay, the setting's features had a notable impact on the cyclist. At the beginning, when the cyclist was at the old man's place, he was happy and confident. As he reached the ghost town and ran out of water, he became upset and frustrated. Upon seeing a building, he felt relieved, but his relief turned to sadness when he discovered it was abandoned. Finally, when he reached the store, he was excited and relieved. In conclusion, the setting significantly influenced the cyclist's emotions during his trip.
1709	7691	3	2	Weather, locations, and the determination to continue are all factors that explain how the setting's features affected the cyclist. Firstly, weather has an impact on the cyclist. In hot weather, one loses a significant amount of water through sweating, which makes pedaling difficult. The sunny and hot weather can also undermine his motivation to ride. After all, few people want to cycle when it is extremely hot outside. Secondly, the places the cyclist traversed, such as towns and rough roads, presented challenges. In summary, these elements of the setting combined to affect the cyclist's experience.
1710	7692	3	2	"The story ""Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit"" recounts a disastrous biking trip. The setting plays a crucial role; the story would not be as terrifying if it had occurred elsewhere. It begins on a present - day summer evening. As the man bikes, he arrives at a ghost town devoid of life. A sense of unease sets in when he reaches ""one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold the lames mule."" Panic starts to grip him as the terrain becomes hilly, and tumbleweeds and snakes cross his path, resembling a cold western landscape. All hope is lost when he reaches the grape juice factory and sees ""a sand - blasted picture of a young boy."" The setting is a powerful tool that strongly influences the cyclist's experience throughout the story."
1711	7693	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the setting's features significantly influenced the cyclist's physical and mental abilities. The hot and rough climate and dangerous environment, as the cyclist was in the California deserts in June, posed challenges to his physical capabilities. For instance, tumbleweeds crossed his path, and a large snake blocked the pavement, and he had to maintain his balance in a dehydrated state. At the same time, the setting also gave him determination. Each horizon he saw offered hope because he knew he was getting closer to Yosemite National Park. As he said, thinking about the distances on the horizon and telling himself he could move that far gave him the will to continue. Overall, the features of the setting had a dual impact on the cyclist's physical and mental states."
1712	7694	3	2	"The setting's features have a profound impact on the cyclist. In the story, there came a point when he ran out of water. He recalled that some old guys had claimed the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. Despite being tired and dehydrated, he believed he could make it. So, he set off. However, two miles later, the terrain changed from a flat road to short, rolling hills, and his outlook on the journey also shifted. Before the change, he was positive and confident, thinking ""I could make that!"" But after the change, he lost hope and almost gave up, even thinking ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" Clearly, tough terrain has a significant negative effect on the cyclist."
1713	7695	3	2	The setting features affect the cyclist in multiple ways. Initially, the roads were smooth, but then they turned into hilly terrain. It was a hot June day, and he had a limited water supply as he pedaled through the deserts of California. Moreover, there were few places to stop for water. All these factors combined to make his cycling journey more difficult. In conclusion, the road conditions, the weather, and the scarcity of water stops in the setting all had an impact on the cyclist.
1714	7696	3	2	"In Joe Kurmaskie's essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" a cyclist is on his way to Yosemite National Park. He runs into trouble when he takes directions from a couple of older men. The cyclist learns the hard - lesson of not trusting shortcuts given by old men who are out - of - date and haven't left their porch since Carter was in office. He ends up lost and nearly dies of thirst. The setting is in the deserts of California or deserted ghost towns. The cyclist mentions traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The extremely dry heat dehydrates him. Additionally, he encounters hills during his journey, which tire him out and make him feel there is no hope of getting out alive. Overall, features like the desert and hills in the setting have a detrimental effect on the cyclist."
1715	7697	3	2	"The features of the setting have an impact on the cyclist. It appears that the more desperate the situation becomes, the more determined he gets. As seen on page @NUM1, where he thought ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" Right after this thought, he climbed away from the abandoned factory. On page @NUM1, he said that troubles, thirst, and strain were all behind him, indicating that after a difficult situation, he felt relieved of earthly obligations. The setting not only affects the cyclist but also the entire story around him. In conclusion, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experiences and the overall narrative."
1716	7698	3	2	The story is set in an area that is both dry and humid, with a landscape that includes flat stretches and hilly regions. The author observed the changing terrain, noting that “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Joe Kurmaskie). Being in the middle of a desert - like environment in June, surrounded by nothing, is a terrifying prospect. The heat and lack of water take a toll on the person, potentially causing mirages or fainting due to the high temperature and fluid loss. Moreover, the hills only exacerbate the situation.
1717	7699	3	2	The setting's features have a significant impact on the cyclist. He is cycling through the desert in the middle of June with very little water. This makes him extremely thirsty as he is in a hot desert environment but has limited water to drink. In the story, he reaches Welch’s Grape Juice Factory. On the side of the building, he sees a picture of “a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth”. This sight intensifies his thirst, yet he perseveres and continues on his journey to find water at a bait shop.
1718	7700	3	2	The cyclist in this essay is on a journey to Yosemite National Park. Initially, he is confident about reaching his destination, unaware of the challenges ahead. First, he encounters windy roads. As he progresses, his confidence gradually fades. The desert hits him like a boulder; he is running low on water and needs to rest. The extreme heat only worsens his situation. As stated, “Not a mile into this heat - section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This indicates that the cyclist did not anticipate such terrain and is overwhelmed by it. However, he never gives up. Just before he might have considered quitting, he finds a place to get water and relax. “Then, as easily as running about, my troubles, thirst, and weariness were all behind me.” This shows his strength and determination to survive. His experience emphasizes that everyone in life should be determined.
1719	7701	3	2	It was a difficult experience for him, but through it, he learned a great deal. He realized that life is not always easy. While individual problems may not seem significant on their own, sometimes small issues can snowball into larger ones. Life is like riding a bike; there are ups and downs, problems, and moments of feeling lost. This is simply the nature of life, and we must accept and persevere through these challenges.
1720	7702	3	2	I firmly believe that the features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. He had to endure tough conditions during his ride, which left him extremely exhausted. In my opinion, the most challenging aspect of the setting was the heat. As he mentioned, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This led him to sip from his water more frequently than usual. Another difficult feature was the hills. He stated, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” Riding over these hills in the scorching heat of a California desert in June was undoubtedly a daunting task for the cyclist. Clearly, the terrain had a substantial influence on him.
1721	7703	3	2	The setting features in this story present challenges for the cyclist. The cyclist traverses the high deserts of California, as stated in (kurmaskie @NUM1). The high - altitude environment makes breathing arduous. Additionally, the flat road gives way to short rolling hills. The cyclist describes one as a “long, crippling hill” (Kurmaskie @NUM1), indicating that these hills add to the difficulty of the journey. Evidently, the increasingly difficult terrain has a negative impact on the cyclist.
1722	7704	3	2	In the story, the setting exerts multiple effects on the cyclist. The road condition deteriorates from flat to short, rolling stretches. Tumbleweeds cross the cyclist's path. He suffers from a lack of water, and the available water has a taste like battery acid. As the story mentions, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” Overall, the adverse conditions of the setting significantly impede the cyclist's journey.
1723	7705	3	2	The features of the setting pose challenges for the cyclist. Having to go uphill or along long, bumpy roads makes the ride tougher. The essay states “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit: @CAPS1,” highlighting that such road conditions are more difficult than average. Compounding the problem is the lack of water, which further exacerbates the cyclist's situation. Clearly, the setting has a negative impact on the cyclist's ride.
1724	7706	3	2	A cyclist attempting to reach Yosemite National Park is significantly affected by the setting. The cyclist reveals that he is in Lodi, California, on a “gorgeous day in June.” June in California is extremely hot, putting the biker at risk of heatstroke. Moreover, he is in the middle of the desert, where tumbleweeds cross his path and there is a large, possibly poisonous snake. These elements increase his despair as he could be injured by a wild animal or run out of water with no nearby water source. In conclusion, the setting mostly has a negative impact on the cyclist.
1725	7707	3	2	The setting features have a notable impact on the cyclist. The author indicates that the cyclist is in the California desert, which necessitates water conservation to stay hydrated during the trip. There are numerous hills; as the author writes, “over one crippling hills…”. Climbing these hills consumes more energy and can lead to rapid dehydration if the cyclist is not cautious. Also, there are many abandoned towns spaced several miles apart. The cyclist may drink water expecting to find more in the next town, but often arrives to find none, forcing him to pedal several more miles with very little water. Clearly, the setting strongly influences the cyclist's actions, especially in relation to water usage.
1726	7708	3	2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the characteristics of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. His determination fluctuates according to the new terrains or landmarks he encounters. For instance, when a building came into his view up ahead, he became excited and exerted all his energy to descend the hill towards it. Later, when he reached the next building and discovered a functioning bathroom, he drank from the sink as his hope of survival was restored. Throughout his long journey in the story, the cyclist experienced numerous emotional changes that were closely tied to the setting. In conclusion, the setting in this story played a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's emotional state and determination during his arduous trek.
