1	8863	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way because gardens cannot thrive when the ground is covered with snow. Thus, she reasons that once all the snow has melted, she will attempt to grow another garden. In my opinion, she seems insufficiently enthusiastic about growing a new garden. I believe she should be more eager and less disappointed.
2	8864	4	2	The narrator includes that in the paragraph because it all makes sense and flows together. The narrator states that when the geese appear and the hibiscus begins to bud, it indicates that spring has arrived once again.
3	8865	4	2	The author concludes the story with that passage to emphasize the significance of the inspiration Saeng derives from the hibiscus plant. Throughout the story, Saeng finds comfort in the hibiscus plant as it evokes memories of her homeland. The plant during winter metaphorically reflects Saeng's attitude towards her new country and her driving test. Just as the hibiscus is less beautiful in the harsh cold but adapts, survives, and regains its beauty in spring, Saeng is initially bitter about her new circumstances but is adapting. She will be inspired by the plant's resurgence in spring to retake her driving test. In conclusion, the author's choice of ending highlights the important relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus plant.
4	8866	4	2	The author ended the story with this paragraph as it symbolizes change. The melting snow represents the transition from cold to warm.

5	8867	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph from “Winter Hibiscus” as it revisits events from the narrative. Saeng previously failed the test. In spring, the hibiscus will bloom again. Saeng realizes that many things she once found strange now seem almost familiar, like the calls of the snow geese.

7	8869	4	2	"The story concludes with the author's statement, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author ends the story this way because Saeng is disappointed after spending @NUM1 on a plant she thought was different from the one at home. She declares that she won't take the test of buying another plant until the geese return and the hibiscus buds."
8	8870	4	2	I am of the opinion that the author concludes the story with this paragraph as it effectively brings the narrative to a close. In this paragraph, the character essentially states that when the geese return and her flower is budding, she will be adequately prepared to take the test. She will be ready because, similar to the plant and the geese, she will have adapted and gained sufficient experience. She is drawing a comparison between her life and the lives of the geese and her flower.

10	8872	4	2	"Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with a satisfying ending. In the story, the girl purchases a hibiscus that reminds her of home. She returns home and tells her mother that she failed her test but bought the plant. While planting it, she spots geese, which further reminds her of home. America starts to feel like home, and she becomes happier. As the text states, ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now."" She is willing to retake the test and is confident of passing it. America is gradually beginning to feel more like home to her."
11	8873	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as the narrative begins with Saeng failing a test. After the failure, she went out and purchased a plant to console herself and then confessed the test result to her mother. The plant was associated with memories of her homeland. When she failed the test, she was extremely depressed and sad, expressing her pain through tears and buying the plant to lift her spirits. When she told her mother, the pain resurfaced, but her mother made her favorite food and assisted her in planting the plant. Although she knew it was not the same as the old plant, the thought and memories it carried made her realize she couldn't simply give up. So, when the right time came, she intended to retake the test. This conclusion helps readers better understand the story and shows that Saeng was not one to quit easily. Her mother was understanding, and when Saeng retakes the test, she will be better prepared. This is how the conclusion relates back to the story.
12	8874	4	2	"I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph because there are certain events in the story and the report. When the geese leave, they will return and leave again. This, I think, is what ""take the test again"" means. In essence, it implies a cycle of events and the idea of facing challenges repeatedly."
13	8875	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that when everything starts to return to normal, the character will take the test. This conclusion ties in with the overall theme of waiting for the right moment and having the courage to face challenges. By ending the story in this way, the author gives a sense of hope and anticipation for the character's future attempt at the test.
14	8876	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the determination that Saeng exhibits. When Saeng returns and shows her mother the hibiscus plant, she is visibly upset, with tears welling in her eyes. Initially, her mother is disappointed in her for buying the plant. However, upon realizing that Saeng is distraught, she becomes understanding. The mother then offers to help Saeng plant the hibiscus, which provides some comfort to Saeng and helps her regain the determination needed to recover. The story states, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This quote indicates that Saeng is beginning to recognize that aspects of her new country can be similar to those at home. The author uses the term ""familiar"" to suggest that Saeng is starting to accept that although some things may be different, she will eventually adapt, leading to a more positive outlook on life."
15	8877	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it contains a significant amount of content that forms the core of the story. For instance, it mentions all the names, discusses the seasons, and makes comparisons and contrasts between them. It also talks about different stages of plant growth, such as the mids, nuggets, and headies. Since the hibiscus represents a new and appealing form, this paragraph effectively summarizes the key elements of the story, making it a fitting conclusion.
16	8878	4	2	He presents this as the conclusion since it demonstrates the faith she has in the flower and how it will bring her good fortune for her upcoming test. She perceives the familiar flower as being out of place, just as she is, and they can find common ground in certain aspects.
17	8879	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story with Saeng because it showcases the moments when she is reminded of home. I'm of the opinion that she believed she could pass the test when the flower bloomed and brought back memories of home. For instance, when Saeng mumbled, “Not like the kind we had before,” it strongly suggests to me that she was likely homesick. Then, when spring arrives and the flower blooms, it can endow her with the strength to pass the test. This is precisely why I believe the author ended the story with this paragraph.
18	8880	4	2	The author employs this approach because Saeng regained her confidence from planting the hibiscus and all the experiences throughout that year. Now, she is well - prepared, and this is what the author intended for the reader to understand.
19	8881	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner due to three main reasons. Firstly, Saeng failed the test, as she openly admitted, saying “I - I failed the test.” She is clearly upset about it and expresses her desire to “take that test again.” Secondly, the hibiscus provides her with comfort. When describing the hibiscus, Saeng remarks, “And that rich sweet scent - that was familiar, too.” The familiarity of this plant soothes her and gives her the courage to attempt the test once more. Finally, Saeng feels a kinship with the geese. She thinks to herself, “the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese.” This similarity leads her to decide to take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” By concluding the story in this way, the author effectively portrays Saeng's test failure, the comfort she finds in the hibiscus, and her connection with the geese.
20	8882	4	2	I firmly believe that the author ends the story with this paragraph because it triggers her memories of her homeland and the longing to return home. The returning geese symbolize the journey back home, and Saeng shares the same yearning. Moreover, the hibiscus budding in the wild, just as it did back home, further intensifies her sense of nostalgia. This combination of elements is why I think the author chose to end the story in this way.
21	8883	4	2	In the story, the author concludes with this paragraph to impart lessons to Saeng. After failing the test, Saeng tells her mother that she will retake it in spring when the snow has melted. Her mother was quite upset upon learning of her initial test failure. Through this, the author teaches Saeng to be confident and make a silent vow, aiming to instill more life - lessons.
22	8884	4	2	They likely ended the story in that way to build suspense or leave the reader with a positive impression. At @MONTH1, one might think that things will improve for them. Saeng could get her license at @MONTH1, and they could earn more money. This ending allows the reader to hold onto the hope of a better future for the characters.
23	8885	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"", the main character, Saeng, faces numerous obstacles as she attempts to adapt to her new country, which contrasts starkly with her homeland. The author ends the story with the line, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" By ending in this manner, the author assures the reader that Saeng has found new hope, symbolized by the hibiscus flower. Besides representing budding hope, the flower also holds sentimental value related to her home. Sometimes, like Saeng in the greenhouse, embracing obstacles is the best way to overcome them, paving the way for a fresh start."
24	8886	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that one should not give up after a single failure. From the paragraph, it is implied that Saeng will grow stronger by spring and be capable of passing the test. This ending serves as an inspiration, highlighting the importance of perseverance in the face of setbacks.
25	8887	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because all living things have routines necessary for survival. Geese fly @CAPS1 during the warm months to avoid death from the cold, and the flower withers in winter only to be revived in spring. This cycle pertains to Saeng, as she will take the test of fitting into her new country when the geese return and the flower blooms again. This is the reason the author chose this ending, emphasizing the natural cycle of life and renewal.
26	8888	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with the paragraph “When they came back…then I will take that test again.” This ending leaves numerous unanswered questions for the reader, such as those related to “I failed the test,” “her gentle grandmother,” “Mrs. Lambert,” and “home.” By doing so, it piques the reader's interest, potentially leading them to read the author's next work. Additionally, this ending has an impact on the reader, leaving them to assume and imagine future events like whether she will pass the test, go home, etc. Most likely, the author employed this ending for a dramatic effect on the reader. This is the reason why the author of “Winter Hibiscus” chose to end the story with this particular paragraph.
27	8889	4	2	I believe she ended the story in this way because it indicates that she is becoming accustomed to all the seasons. The statement “In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” shows that she will wait until it is no longer cold, which will be spring when the geese come back, and then take the test. I think she is also suggesting that when the snow melts and the geese return, she will have taken the test and passed it. I believe she ended the story like this because these elements hold significance for her. In conclusion, the way she ended the story effectively conveys her connection to nature's cycles and her determination to succeed.
28	8890	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it demonstrates how everything is in a state of change and adapting to it. Saeng decides that in the face of this change, she can adapt to her new life by retaking and passing the driver's test. The hibiscus serves as a symbol, representing something from her homeland that has been brought to America and must now survive. When the hibiscus begins to bud, it signifies that Saeng will start adapting to America by passing her driver's test. This is all about the process of becoming accustomed to changes. When Saeng feels disappointed about failing the test, something from her past provides her with comfort. Overall, the author's choice of ending effectively conveys the theme of adaptation and the significance of symbols in the story.
29	8891	4	2	By concluding the story with the concept of retaking a test in the spring, the author creates a sense of starting anew and persevering. For instance, when the author states “when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding,” it illustrates the idea of commencing a fresh life in spring. The geese return to their home, and the hibiscus starts anew by budding again. This is why Saeng wants to start afresh and retake the test in spring. The paragraph also portrays Saeng as persevering, similar to the hibiscus. The hibiscus endures the winter and blooms again, while Saeng perseveres by retaking the test. The author ends with this paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up. In summary, the ending effectively conveys the themes of renewal and perseverance.
30	8892	4	2	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph because Saeng feels most at ease taking the test again when the conditions she described occur. Saeng misses her homeland greatly. She made a promise to herself to retake the test when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. Her statement makes one wonder why she won't take the test earlier. These natural phenomena make her feel extremely comfortable. In conclusion, the author's choice of ending reflects Saeng's emotional connection to nature and her need for a specific environment to face the test again.
31	8893	4	2	The concluding paragraph of the story reveals her next objective. She attempted a test but was unsuccessful. She spent over nineteen dollars on a plant, which brought back memories of her former home. Since the plant has adapted well to its new environment, she believes that come spring, she too will acclimate to her new home with greater confidence.
32	8894	4	2	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with this paragraph for several important reasons. By ending the story in this manner, it showcases Saeng's growth and her increased determination to strive and do her best. When she declares her intention to retake the test, it demonstrates her new - found confidence and her growing sense of comfort in a place that is not her home country. She is now working hard towards success and making the most of her situation. The author aims to add depth and meaning to the story in this way. Saeng has evolved from being nervous and worried when admitting, “I - I failed the test,” to setting a goal to retake it when the bud blooms next year. Essentially, by ending the story like this, the author has completed a full circle, moving from the mention of the test, to sharing the flower experience with her mother, and finally stating her plan to retake the test next year.
33	8895	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that despite Saeng's sorrow and discomfort, she remains hopeful. In the story, Saeng spots a hibiscus, which makes her extremely homesick for her native Vietnam. The reader also learns that she failed a test and feels out of place. However, the hibiscus symbolizes hope and comfort. The author chooses to end with this paragraph to illustrate that despite Saeng's hardships, the hibiscus helps her realize she can overcome obstacles and look forward to the future with hope.
34	8896	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as when Saeng and her mother return to their previous home, they find the flowers there more beautiful than those where they currently live. Saeng wishes to plant flowers that will remind her of home. In the story, Saeng's mother remarks that although the flowers aren't as pretty, they are strong enough to survive the cold winter months. Through the winter hibiscus, her mother wants Saeng to understand that the most important thing is that the plant can endure the winter.
35	8897	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Saeng will take the test in spring and give her best. Saeng admitted, “I - I failed the test.” But failing a test doesn't mean it's the end of everything. She will be more confident when she takes the test next time.
36	8898	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that although Saeng failed the test, it does not mean she is giving up. She states that when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, she will retake the test. This implies that while she has currently failed, with time, she can study and learn more to prepare for the retake. By the time she is ready to take the test again, the snow will have melted, the weather will be warm, the birds will have returned, and the flower will be thriving. The way the author ends the story not only indicates that she will take the test but also suggests that she will pass it.
37	8899	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way because the hibiscus has started budding, and the character is now happy. She expresses that after the geese return and the snow melts, she will start afresh. This ending implies that despite any previous setbacks, there is hope and a new beginning on the horizon.
38	8900	4	2	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” ends it as she does to convey the message that we should never give up. The protagonist fails her driving test on the first attempt. As someone who will take the driving test within a year, I firmly believe that no matter how many times I fail, I will persevere. In life, we must persevere through every problem. If we give up easily, we will achieve nothing. The protagonist vows to retake the test in spring when the hibiscus is budding. I hope to pass my driving test on the first try, just as I did with the learner's permit test. Moreover, we should not give up on anything, even small things like work. If we stop working, we will lose our jobs. In conclusion, we should always maintain a never - give - up attitude.
39	8901	4	2	The author included that sentence in the story to illustrate Saeng's deep affection for snow and plants. She claims that she prefers gardening to schoolwork. Her love for planting new things is evident, which shows that nature holds a special place in her heart. This connection to nature is an important aspect of her character within the story.
40	8902	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng is beginning to adjust to her new environment. Throughout the story, she feels out of place, much like the “winter hibiscus.” Later in the story, she remarks that many things she once considered strange have become almost familiar through the repetition of seasons. This quote indicates that she is gradually getting used to her surroundings, which means she is adapting. The last paragraph states that when everything returns to spring, the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding, she will retake the test. Thus, the author includes this conclusion to show that just like the hibiscus, Saeng will adapt to her new circumstances.
41	8903	4	2	The writer concludes the text with this paragraph, leaving the reader with a sense of hope for the future. The narrator, after failing her driving test and longing for home, buys a plant. Despite her sadness, the plant serves as a symbol of hope. She believes that when the flower blooms, her hope will also blossom, and she will attempt the driving test again, perhaps with success. Currently, she may feel sad and scared, yet she is aware that things will improve and she will be alright. She is gradually adjusting to her new life, stating that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.” This indicates that although she misses her homeland deeply, she is slowly getting accustomed to her new home and life. Maybe by spring, she will be happy and comfortable enough to retake the driving test. The hibiscus represents both the longing for the past and the hope for the future.
42	8904	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it demonstrates that Saeng is most at ease when surrounded by items from her homeland. She believes she will be prepared to take the test when she sees the ducks again and when the hibiscus starts to bud. The narrator mentions “A saebya ledges tall and high, had surrounded their garden…” This is evidence that Saeng had hibiscus in Vietnam, and the story of the well reminds her of it. The narrator also states, “Overhead, a flock of [CAPS1] geese, their faint looks clear and -yes - familiar to Saeng now.” This proves that the geese symbolize [CAPS3] home as well. In conclusion, the author uses these elements to show Saeng's connection to her homeland and her readiness for new challenges.
43	8905	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story with that quote for several reasons. Firstly, it shows that the character is not going to give up; her failure is not the end. This reflects the morale of perseverance. The character seems to associate herself with the hibiscus. When she says “The hibiscus will be budding,” it implies that she will grow and learn more. By spring, she will have gained sufficient knowledge and experience to retake the test. The hibiscus also evokes memories of her home. Looking at it gives her the courage to face challenges like the test. The ending quote effectively wraps up the story, highlighting the character's determination to keep trying.
44	8906	4	2	The author employs the concluding paragraph to unify the entire story. It touches on three key subjects from the narrative: the driving test, the geese, and the hibiscus plant. When the author says “when the snow melts and the geese return,” it refers to the geese described as “She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky.” The character, like the geese that undergo a seasonal change every winter, has also experienced a transformation. She realizes that “many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become... familiar to her now.” Everyone goes through changes, and Saeng's change was more significant. This concluding paragraph effectively ties together the various elements of the story and emphasizes the theme of change.
45	8907	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the content in the paragraph is similar to what was previously written in the story, but with additional details, problems, and elements. By including these extra aspects, the author enriches the narrative and provides a more comprehensive conclusion. This approach helps to bring the story to a satisfying end, tying up loose ends and leaving the reader with a more complete understanding of the events and themes.
46	8908	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's respect and her longing for her homeland. For instance, when Saeng ""vowed silently to herself,"" it demonstrates her respect and nostalgia for her homeland. It also implies her desire to rectify past failures. Another example is her determination to overcome past setbacks, as indicated by the last line of the paragraph, ""then I will take that test again,"" which shows her aspiration for a new chance in life. These examples explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph."
47	8909	4	2	"In my opinion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph to create an impression that the characters have started anew, leaving the past behind. After Saeng takes the plate to her mom, she seems to experience a sense of relief. By the end of the paragraph, she sounds confident and certain, as if she wants to start afresh. When she says, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" it makes her seem like a new person who has let go of the past. Overall, this ending effectively conveys a message of hope and a fresh start."
48	8910	4	2	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the plant catches the character's attention when she returns home after failing the driving test. She decides that she will retake the test when the circumstances are right. The driving test is not of utmost importance to her, and she realizes she may not pass it currently. So, she plans to take it again when the plant she bought is in full bloom, at its prime. This ending ties the character's emotional state and future plans to the natural cycle of the plant.
49	8911	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it showcases Saeng's growth and determination through the experience. This final paragraph provides a sudden happy ending to an otherwise sad story, giving the reader a sense of hope as the mom character is confident to try again. The story is filled with the sadness of Saeng's family having to relocate to a new country and start over. Gardening serves as an escape for them. In Vietnam, they had a lovely garden and cherished it. Now in @LOCATION2, their garden and the plants remind them of their homeland and past life. Despite failing the driving test, Saeng finds a plant that brings her joy and rejuvenates her hope of passing the test. The final paragraph solidifies her new - found confidence, as the happy memories she recalls give her self - assurance.
50	8912	4	2	The author includes the last paragraph because the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng. It indicates that she will be prepared when spring arrives. When the plant is on the verge of budding, she will gain the faith needed to take the test. Before taking the test, she is likely to take good care of the plant. Once the plant buds, she won't have to tend to it as intensively. This connection between Saeng and the hibiscus enriches the story's meaning and shows her journey towards readiness.
51	8913	4	2	"I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng, having failed the test, states that when the good times return, she will attempt the test again. For instance, on page @NUM1, at the top, she says, ""I - I failed the test."" This is significant because passing the test during the favorable season of spring was important to Saeng. Thus, this is why I think the author concludes the story in this way."
52	8914	4	2	"Winter Hibiscus"" tells the story of a girl named Saeng who moved from Vietnam to the @ORGANIZATION1. After failing her driver's test, she walks home and discovers a hibiscus. ""She closed her eyes and breathed in deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair…"" She then goes to a flower shop to check if she can buy the plant. Due to its rarity and value, she pays a substantial amount of money for it. The hibiscus is special to her as she used to have such plants in Vietnam. She brings the plant home and tells her mom that it reminds her of Vietnam, and her mom agrees. However, the mom is unhappy about the high price Saeng paid. Saeng plants the hibiscus in her garden. ""When the hibiscus was lowered in the ground, a flock of geese flew by."" When spring arrives and the hibiscus returns, along with all the flowers budding and blooming, everything becomes new again. Saeng will then have a fresh opportunity to pass her driver's test."
53	8915	4	2	"I believe the author included that part because the character is comparing herself to a flower. She implies that just like a flower grows anew, she will prove herself by passing the test. She is conveying the message that there is always a second chance. She wants to tell everyone that it's okay to have misses or make mistakes. For example, ""they said there were many of things that she had thought of strangely, season up season."" In essence, she uses this comparison to inspire a sense of hope and the possibility of redemption."
54	8916	4	2	"The author concludes the story in this manner to convey her deep - seated feelings about the hibiscus. She regarded the hibiscus as a wonderful plant, describing it as ""smooth and cool"" towards the end of the first page. Initially, when she saw the hibiscus in Vietnam, she thought it grew wild. But when she saw it potted in the United States, she was surprised. She also described the smell of the hibiscus as a ""sweet scent."" @CAPS1, it is these strong emotions and impressions about the plant that led the author to conclude the story in this way."
55	8917	4	2	The author concludes the story with that statement as it showcases Saeng's passion for gardening. Her willingness to take the test is linked to her eagerness to see if her plants can grow. When spring arrives and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will make an attempt to grow it. This clearly demonstrates Saeng's anxiety and enthusiasm for gardening and her desire to get the hibiscus to thrive during the spring season. Overall, this conclusion effectively emphasizes Saeng's love for gardening.
56	8918	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way to convey that Saeng will take the test when everything returns to normal and is beautiful. This is done to illustrate that Saeng is a person who thrives in spring, enjoys working in the garden during this season, and believes she performs better in school in spring.
57	8919	4	2	"Change and disappointment can be overwhelming, and some people have an intense fear of change. In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the main character, Saeng, experiences change through a move to @LOCATION1. Everything around her is unfamiliar and new. Combined with the disappointment of failing her driver's exam, she feels helpless. After purchasing a winter hibiscus plant, she vows to retake the test when it blooms in spring. The resilience of the winter flower and the memories it evokes inspire Saeng to try again."
58	8920	4	2	I believe the author aimed to convey Saeng's state of mind when she made a vow and to express her emotions. When this statement was presented, I think it was also intended to pique readers' interest and, more importantly, help them understand the story better.
59	8921	4	2	"I think shadowing, future reference, and continuous behavior are the reasons for the last paragraph. It involves shadowing because it tells us what Saeng plans to do in the future. By referring to her future plans, she is continuing her previous behavior as she says she will do something again next year. As she vowed, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" These three aspects - shadowing, future reference, and continuous behavior - are good reasons to support the significance of what she said and what she intends to do next year."
60	8922	4	2	"I'm of the opinion that the author concludes the story in this manner to demonstrate a sense of life's continuation. In the story, Saeng takes a ""test"" and fails. She then buys a hibiscus plant at a price much higher than it should be. Her test is to overcome the memories of her true ""home,"" which now makes her cry when she thinks about it. For Saeng, the plant symbolizes the memories and the life she once had but no longer possesses, yet she desires to regain it. Her vow to herself is that when the geese fly back over her, she will return to the greenhouse that reminds her so much of home and attempt once more to say ""home"" without breaking down and without spending a fortune."
61	8923	4	2	"In @CAPS1 Ho's 'Winter hibiscus', the narrator does not explicitly state which test Saeng has failed. Nevertheless, through the story's subject matter and word - choice, it becomes evident that this test holds significance not only for Saeng and her mother but also for her new life in @LOCATION1. Throughout the narrative, Saeng's yearning for her homeland is overwhelming. When she buys the hibiscus, a flood of painful memories rushes back, and these memories are an integral part of her daily life. Saeng is making great efforts to preserve her memories of Vietnam while understanding that she must adapt to @CAPS2 customs and lifestyle. There are aspects she does not need to change, such as passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits high and as motivation. This is why the last sentence of the story is so empowering: ""when this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"", showing her ability to combine memory and change."
62	8924	4	2	"The author concluded the story with that particular paragraph to illustrate that the girl, Saeng, had adapted to her new country. Saeng deeply missed her homeland; it was difficult for her to refer to her new country as home without getting emotional, as seen in her statement ""It’s not like the wind we had at - at -."" She also spent @MONEY1 on a plant because it reminded her of home. One can infer that she had adapted as she was familiar with the season change, and the story states that when the geese return, she will take the test again, indicating her growing sense of belonging and readiness to face challenges in her new environment."
63	8925	4	2	"I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph as it helps Saeng feel more at home. For instance, the text says, ""the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" All the elements in this sentence are reminiscent of her home. The plant and the geese are things she was familiar with back home. So, when winter ends, she will feel more at ease and will be ready to take the test, which shows the author's intention to use these familiar symbols to give Saeng a sense of comfort and motivation."
64	8926	4	2	The author ended the story with Saeng's vow because she is highly committed. She failed the test the first time, but now she is determined to pass it. She is waiting for the snow to melt, the @CAPS1 geese to return, and the hibiscus to bud (@CAPS2). Once these natural signs of renewal occur, she will come back to take the test again, demonstrating her perseverance and dedication.
65	8927	4	2	I think the author concluded the story in this way because throughout the entire story, the plot was set in winter. Perhaps the author thought that having Saeng attempt the test in a different season might lead to better results. By changing the setting to a time of renewal and growth, it could provide a more favorable environment for her to succeed. This is the reason I believe the author chose to conclude the story like this, aiming to give Saeng a new chance under more promising circumstances.
66	8928	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story with this paragraph for specific reasons. Saeng genuinely intends to take the test in spring. This is evident as she mentions “when the snow melts and geese return,” indicating that next spring she will retake the test. Her confidence is palpable as she begins to add more details, such as “hibiscus is budding.” Based on what she says, it's clear that Saeng is determined to pass the test. This explains why this was the last paragraph and what she meant by it.
67	8929	4	2	The author concludes the story with the statement “in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again” because it implies a new year. For instance, since she failed the test the first time, she will wait until she can try again. Another example is that she is willing to keep trying until she obtains her driving license. This shows her perseverance and hope for a better outcome in the future.
68	8930	4	2	In this story, Saeng demonstrates her passion for planting to her mother. The author includes this paragraph to illustrate how Saeng feels about her planting activities. One indication of her passion for planting is her statement “I will try this test again.” This suggests that when she engages in something she enjoys, she will repeatedly attempt it until she is completely satisfied. This showcases her dedication and enthusiasm for the world of plants.
69	8931	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it reveals a great deal of confidence in the character. For example, when she says, “then I will take that test again,” it exudes a strong sense of self - assurance. This implies that she is willing to try again even if she fails the first time. Such confidence is a key aspect of the character's personality and is effectively conveyed through this conclusion.
70	8932	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that the character has not abandoned her dreams. This conclusion serves as a powerful message, highlighting the character's resilience and determination. It shows that despite any setbacks or challenges, she remains steadfast in her pursuit of her goals, leaving the readers with a sense of hope and inspiration.
71	8933	4	2	"Hope, a fresh start, and adaptation are the reasons the speaker concludes by stating, ""When they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The hibiscus flower offers hope to the girl as it reminds her of her grandmother and her home, where things were wonderful. As the flower blooms, she realizes that life can also improve in her new environment. In the spring, she will have a new beginning. By then, she should have adjusted to her surroundings, made new friends, engaged in activities, and created new memories. Looking back, the past flaws won't seem as bad. The flower will bring her hope and comfort during the adjustment process."
72	8934	4	2	The author indicates that she will do nothing until the weather outside is pleasant. She desires a temperature that is neither too cold nor too hot so that she can go out and play with her children. Additionally, she mentions that she will retake the test when the weather is nice for her.
73	8935	4	2	"The author concludes the story in this way to demonstrate that Saeng is extremely enthusiastic about bridging her life in the United States with her life in Vietnam and integrating the two somehow. In the story, Saeng expresses her longing for home and her ongoing struggle to adapt to her new life away from the familiar environment. When Saeng says she has failed the test and wants to retake it, she intends to prove that she can thrive in the United States without disappointing her mother. When Saeng spent $1 on a plant, her mother was incredulous because Saeng is aware of the challenges of survival. The statement ""I will take the test again"" shows that Saeng is willing to strive to succeed in the United States after coming from Vietnam, demonstrating that she can build a better life for herself and her family through hard work while still preserving the traditions of Vietnam. Saeng simply wanted to make her new home feel like Vietnam by purchasing a plant she knew her mother would like."
74	8936	4	2	The author might have ended the story this way because it represents a downfall. This implies that the character is currently at the bottom and must work their way to the top. They are going to start anew and retake the test, but this time, they are determined not to fail.
75	8937	4	2	"The author concluded the paragraph in this manner to evoke emotion. The last paragraph conveys the sadness of not being able to garden during winter, when all of her plants die for the season. The author is suggesting that Saeng will return. After the snow, frost, and cold weather have passed, Saeng will come back in the next season to resume her gardening, working with plants and soil. As Saeng says, ""I will take the test again,"" it means that she will return and face the test of effort in her gardening and her relationship with her mother when the plants start to grow again in the next season."
76	8938	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it depicts the girl's activities for the upcoming year. She will remain with her mother, assisting in the garden. She will have no friends and only focus on her mother.
77	8939	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate how Saeng has learned from the hibiscus plant. Similar to the plant, Saeng will overcome an obstacle. She will retake the driving test, and the plant will endure the harsh, brutal winter months. The plant will bloom in spring, demonstrating its resilience during adversity. Saeng will also overcome the adversity she faced when she failed her driving test and realized how much she missed her homeland. In a sense, Saeng too will bloom in spring. The winter, symbolizing her despondency and homesickness, will not prevent her from living happily and retaking the test. The hibiscus reminds her of this. The story ends with this paragraph to show how the “Winter Hibiscus” has taught her about overcoming obstacles.
78	8940	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it shows that Saeng will accept her new home, recognize the similarities to her old home, and cherish memories to help her overcome life's obstacles. The quote “I've seen this kind blooming along the lake. It's flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters.” draws parallels between their old and new homes. It indicates that while things change, there are also constants. This leads to the conclusion as it is where Saeng realizes she will always have memories of her old home and will use them to overcome her current troubles.
79	8941	4	2	The author ends the story in this way to demonstrate the similarity between Saeng and the hibiscus plant and how Saeng will overcome her obstacle when the plant overcomes its own. Saeng's obstacle is adjusting to her new life, and the first step is passing her driver's test. The reader knows she must pass as Saeng tells her mother, “I - I failed the [test].” The hibiscus must survive the winter and adapt to new surroundings, just like Saeng. The mother tells Saeng, “... but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters.” If the hibiscus's task is to survive the winter, it will achieve this in spring. The author ends the story with Saeng telling herself, “... in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” If Saeng's obstacle is passing the driver's test and she passes in spring, just as the hibiscus passes its “test,” the symbolism between them, showing a determined spirit to adapt, will deepen as they will both adapt and overcome their obstacles simultaneously.
80	8942	4	2	I think the story circles back to this point because it begins with Saeng taking a test and failing. When the weather improves, she will have a better chance of passing the test. This is why I believe she decides to retake the test.
81	8943	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to leave the reader in suspense, yearning for more. This is evident as the story never explicitly reveals what the test is. The author intends for the reader to attempt to guess the nature of the test. When Saeng approached her mother, she informed her that she had failed the test.
82	8944	4	2	I believe the author ends the story with that paragraph to offer a glimpse into the next installment. There are clues that support my theory that another story will follow. For instance, at the beginning of the paragraph when they return, and at the end when it states “then I will take the test again.” The story doesn't end with a typical “happily ever after,” but rather alludes to personal changes. Therefore, I think the author will write another story so that we can find out if Saeng will pass her test.
83	8945	4	2	I think the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because it serves as an illustration of how everything gets a fresh start in spring. For example, geese return home after winter to start new families, and hibiscus leaves that die in winter come back to life in spring. This paragraph acts as a metaphor, suggesting that just as nature experiences renewal, Saeng will also get a new opportunity to take her driving test. It's a fitting conclusion as it ties together the themes of new beginnings in both nature and Saeng's life.
84	8946	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as the return of the geese symbolizes Saeng's determination and hope needed to pass the driving test. She will bide her time until winter passes to attempt the test again. Spring's arrival represents renewal and new beginnings. Saeng will have another chance to pass the driving test, armed with renewed faith and encouragement. This is an excellent way to end the story as it is profound and prompts the reader to contemplate the significance of the scene and how the geese, hibiscus plant, and the arrival of spring influence the story's conclusion.
85	8947	4	2	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to convey that something will come to fruition in spring when the snow melts and the geese return. I also believe the author appreciates the spring setting, with its sunny skies and geese floating. I, too, find this setting appealing as it sparks ideas and creates a lovely atmosphere. That's why I think the author chose this paragraph to conclude the story.
86	8948	4	2	"The short - story ""Winter Hibiscus"" revolves around a girl who relocates to @LOCATION1 with her mother. The narrative details the girl's adaptation to a different culture. Throughout the story, the author alludes to the daughter having to take a test. At the story's conclusion, the author writes, ""In the spring…then I will take that test again."" When referring to the winter hibiscus plant she purchased, the girl says, ""it's - it's not a real one."" This implies that the girl has memories of her home, yet they are not the same as the real experience. Additionally, the quote ""… much preferred it to the Big Mac"" indicates that she misses her native culture and struggles to adapt to the @CAPS1 culture she now inhabits. In conclusion, the girl's test might be her ability to cope with change and recall memories of her homeland with joy rather than sorrow."
87	8949	4	2	"The author ends the story in this way to convey to the reader that ""if you just try, you might like it."" This is why the girl states that she will return next spring when the snow melts to take the test again. By using this ending, the author encourages the idea that perseverance can lead to a more positive experience."
88	8950	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it effectively ties all elements together. Firstly, it links the events at the beginning of the story to the reason why the character, Saeng, bought the flower initially. Moreover, it connects Saeng's past memories from Vietnam to her new life in the United States. The story describes, ""Carefully Saeng dug it up and smiled. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs."" This shows that the flower she found in the flower - shop evokes memories of Vietnam. Hence, the author chooses this paragraph to conclude the story."
89	8951	4	2	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng will attempt to pass the test in the spring. Obtaining the hibiscus plant reminded her of her homeland and brought back memories. It also instilled self - belief in her, making her eager to try again and filled her with hope. The author uses the description ""when snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" to indicate that spring will be the time when she attempts the test once more. Overall, this ending emphasizes Saeng's determination and the hope for a better outcome."
90	8952	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because, after all that has transpired, such as the girl failing the test, the author wants the ending to be a memorable and positive one. The author also aims to show that despite a setback, the girl will persevere and try again. By doing so, the author portrays the girl as someone who does not give up and pursues what she desires. This is why the author selects this paragraph as the final one of the story.
91	8953	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way to indicate that the girl will not abandon her efforts to pass the test. She will adapt to her new home and transform it into what her home in Vietnam was to her. The girl is nostalgic for her past life and desires to return to the life she had in her home country.
92	8954	4	2	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Ho, chose to conclude the story with this paragraph as it resolves the entire preceding narrative. In the story, Saeng, the girl, was stressed due to failing the @CAPS1 test. She was also saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant in her native Vietnam. At the story's end, the statement “when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again” has symbolic meaning. The snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adaptation. Saeng must change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and feel better. This is why Ho used a strong, symbol - laden, and resolutive ending for her story.
93	8955	4	2	After Saeng fails her driver's test, she loses hope for the future. However, the sight of the hibiscus plant reminds her to never give up, regardless of how difficult the situation is. In the story, Saeng's mother says, “Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters.” This quote shows that even though the hibiscus is not a thing of beauty, it has the ability to survive. Saeng realizes that she is like the hibiscus, with the strength to survive in a new environment. Despite being new to this country, Saeng has proven that no matter how challenging the situation, one can overcome it by believing in oneself and one's family.
94	8956	4	2	The author likely used this as the last paragraph to convey that the girl will take the test again at this time next year. The author writes this paragraph to show that she failed the test when the geese were migrating for winter and the hibiscus was in bloom.
95	8957	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner because it reveals the true significance of the plant. Saeng will wait until the flower blooms as it holds great meaning for her. The flower symbolizes both her and her driving test. When the hibiscus is ready to bloom, she will be ready to drive. The plant gives her hope for a new tomorrow and a new chance. The last paragraph helps the reader understand how important the plant is to the girl. It makes her feel more at home. After the misery of failing the driving test, it brings her joy and happiness, even though being in her new home also makes her feel like an outsider at times.
96	8958	4	2	She concludes the story with this paragraph as she hopes @DATE1 will return. She mentions “when the snow melts,” expressing her desire to revisit the events and handle them properly.
97	8959	4	2	In the short - story, Saeng decides to retake the test in spring. After moving from her old home to a new place, she was extremely upset as she missed her family, old lifestyle, and the familiar surroundings. This emotional turmoil hindered her focus on the test. However, when she noticed the beautiful flowers in her new home, she started to accept the changes. The presence of familiar geese symbolizes her adjustment to the new lifestyle. Another reason for her vow could be to avoid disappointing her mother again. After witnessing her mother's disappointment and kindness, Saeng is determined to pass the test. When spring arrives and she takes the test, she will be well - prepared as she has adapted to and embraced her new life.
98	8960	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the beginning of the story, Saeng's family moved from Vietnam to the United States. Saeng was walking home after failing her driver's test. She saw a familiar plant. Later, she went to a florist shop to check if she could buy the plant. She got the plant seeds and planted them. When the plants start to bloom, she will retake the driving test she failed. I believe she uses the plant for good luck, which is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
99	8961	4	2	The author concluded the story with the paragraph as it demonstrates that Saeng can overcome obstacles. The next time she encounters similar reminders, she is likely to succeed. When she says “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before had become... almost familiar to her now,” it indicates that she is getting accustomed to the changes in her new life. Thus, the end paragraph reflects these concepts.
100	8962	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with the paragraph for several reasons. Firstly, the character is attempting to overcome change and improve the situation, and taking the test again is her way of doing so. Secondly, she is heartbroken because life isn't going as she wishes, and she feels the need to take action. By concluding the story with this paragraph, the author shows whether the character is determined and if she will persevere through difficulties.
101	8963	4	2	In my opinion, the author ended the story with that paragraph as she intends to see if she can adjust to the new country. This is an excellent way to conclude the story as it leaves the reader in suspense, not knowing whether she will succeed or not. Additionally, it provides the opportunity for the author to write a sequel and develop a series.
102	8964	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way because the snow is beautiful, and geese are animals that enhance its beauty. The author aims to make the reader perceive the outdoors as the most wonderful thing around.
103	8965	4	2	Author Minfong Ho concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to depict Saeng starting anew. The description “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding…” is connected to her life, indicating that she is beginning afresh. Although she misses her old life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine - toothed comb, she is making an effort, as shown by her determination to “take that test again”. By retaking the test, she demonstrates that she is not ready to succumb to “the pain of loss” and her grief.
104	8966	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he anticipates that all the events taking place will likely resurface. Just as he mentioned that geese return every year, he is suggesting that these events will come back. This is my view on the author's conclusion.
105	8967	4	2	I believe the author chose that as the concluding sentence because it implies that Saeng will retake the test when she is ready. I think she is comparing herself to the snow, the geese, and the hibiscus. This is because she states that she will take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. So, I think she is indicating that she is currently not ready for the test and will take it once she is prepared.
106	8968	4	2	The author's conclusion of the story reveals Saeng's interpretation of that day's experience. By setting the scene in spring, it depicts the rebirth of her self - confidence. The sight of the hibiscus bud in spring will endow her with new - found integrity to attempt the driving test once more.
107	8969	4	2	The author concludes the story with the last paragraph due to hope, positivity, and helpfulness. The paragraph gives readers the sense that Saeng has hope as she is willing to retake the test, which also shows her desire to help her mother. It also conveys a positive attitude; she bought a flower to replace the dead ones and plans to retake the test in spring. Moreover, Saeng is helpful to her mother. She dug the hole for the new flower so her mother could make dinner and understood her mother's disappointment when she failed the test, which is why she's retaking it. Like any new kid, Saeng was scared, but throughout, she maintained hope, a positive attitude, and helpfulness.
108	8970	4	2	For her, the hibiscus represented a test. Saeng believed she failed the test of letting go of the past and embracing the present. The hibiscus, which reminded her of home, led her to spend over @MONEY1 on it, despite knowing she and her mother needed the money. Essentially, she felt as if she had failed this test.
109	8971	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph to help readers understand Saeng's strength. Another reason is that she knows internally that when her plant is strong and free of snow, she will be strong too, and that's when she wants to take her driving test. For instance, when she said, “When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
110	8972	4	2	In Minfong Ho's “Winter Hibiscus,” the main character Saeng and her mother moved from their homeland to a new place where everything was different. Saeng struggled to adapt to this new environment and failed an important test. This failure discouraged her, and she tried to recall her home. She bought the winter hibiscus as a reminder of home. While planting it, she became determined to adapt and decided to take the test when the hibiscus would bud. The author concludes the story by showing that there is hope and determination for Saeng to adapt to her new home.
111	8973	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it conveys the uplifting message that Saeng can overcome the challenges of living in an unfamiliar country. Firstly, the geese symbolize a part of her new home as she ""reluctantly"" realizes they are now familiar to her, which demonstrates her ability to adapt to the new environment. Additionally, she associates spring with the budding of the hibiscus, and the hibiscus serves as a symbol of herself as both are attempting to thrive in a foreign country. Thus, the budding hibiscus represents her ability to live comfortably in the new location. Finally, she vows to retake her driver's test. Her initial failure to pass indicated her difficulty in integrating into the new place, but if she passes, she will have successfully adapted. Overall, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it encapsulates the theme of the passage through an uplifting message."
112	8974	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the ending incorporates the budding hibiscus and the retaking of the test to establish a connection between them. The geese are also included at the end to signify the new country she has adapted to, as she can recognize the geese's comings and goings. The budding of the hibiscus means more to her than just a flower; it represents the rejuvenation of new life within her, similar to how flowers typically bud in spring. This is also the reason she decides to take the test, as her ""budding"" will occur in spring, and she will gain new - found confidence for the upcoming test. Therefore, the geese, hibiscus, and the test are all included at the end of the story to illustrate the connection between her past home and her adaptation to a new lifestyle."
113	8975	4	2	After the return of the geese and flowers, she will attempt gardening once more. Her aspiration is to cultivate the finest garden in the area. By doing so, she aims to uphold the tradition.
114	8976	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng thought the winter hibiscus was no longer in the ground. When she returned, all her plants had been lost due to the snow. So, when she said she would take the test again, it implies that she will start anew with her plants and flowers, essentially going back to the initial steps of her gardening journey.
115	8977	4	2	"The author concludes with the statement, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This is because Saeng is not ready to give up. In the story, Saeng mumbled, ""I mean, not like the kind at - at - "" and found herself too shaken to speak the words at home, indicating her ongoing distress as she misses her home in Vietnam. When Saeng plants the hibiscus in the ground, she feels more alive and desires to feel at home in the United States. Saeng is determined not to abandon her driving efforts; instead, she will keep trying harder to pass the test."
116	8978	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it is related to what the author thinks. When Saeng's smile of welcome warmed the atmosphere and she cheerfully said, “Skip over, live to you're back! It's past time. What took you so long? Now, did it go? Did you?” She feels a sense of connection to this moment. The content is somewhat related to her emotions and the situation presented.
117	8979	4	2	The story “Winter Hibiscus” concludes with the paragraph “When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This ending marks a fresh start for Saeng. Spring will bring the return of geese to her current home, where the hibiscus serves as a reminder of her old home. The story also draws a comparison between Saeng and the hibiscus. Her mother in the story remarks, “I've seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it is strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters.” Saeng, like the winter hibiscus, is resilient enough to endure winter, and failing the test becomes insignificant as she plans to take and pass it in spring, symbolized by the blooming hibiscus. This ending also ties in Saeng's feelings about her new and old homes throughout the story and showcases her ability to overcome obstacles. She will put aside the memory of failing the driving test and strive to pass it in spring.
118	8980	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph because the hibiscus represents the ability to overcome obstacles. The character wants to retake the test to prove to her mother that she can pass it. The hibiscus also gives her strength and boosts her confidence to succeed in the test. In conclusion, the hibiscus plays a crucial role in shaping the character's determination and the overall message of the story.
119	8981	4	2	The author chose to end the story in this manner for multiple reasons. Firstly, the ending paragraph instills a sense of hope in the reader. It depicts the cyclical nature of life, with the snow melting, geese returning, and flowers blooming, suggesting that there is always another chance. This creates a positive note, leaving the reader with a feeling of optimism. Secondly, it conveys the important lesson that one always gets a second chance, regardless of past failures. This is a valuable message for the reader to learn. Finally, the ending emphasizes the significance of persistence in life. The natural phenomena described in the paragraph occur continuously, refusing to give up, which serves as an analogy for the importance of perseverance. In conclusion, the author's choice to end the story with this paragraph effectively conveys hope, the idea of a second chance, and the vital role of persistence.
120	8982	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that Saeng prefers to take on challenges in the spring. When she sees the flowers growing, she feels at home, which in turn boosts her confidence. This new - found confidence makes her more certain about passing the test. Ultimately, this ending reflects Saeng's emotional state and her readiness to face the test in a more favorable season.
121	8983	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with the quote “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This concluding thought emphasizes Saeng's determination to change. Despite failing the test, she is eager to retake it. The flower resembles her grandmother, so when it buds, it symbolizes her grandmother's return in a way. When her grandmother “comes back,” Saeng will feel as if her grandmother is providing the strength and encouragement needed to attempt the test once more.
122	8984	4	2	The author uses the concluding paragraph to illustrate that, similar to the budding hibiscus, Saeng will embark on a new beginning in spring and surmount obstacles.
123	8985	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story with the line “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This conclusion is likely intended to prompt readers to envision their own endings. Alternatively, the author could pen another story to continue the narrative. Many authors adopt this approach to empower readers to shape the story's conclusion.
124	8986	4	2	From my understanding of the story, I believe the author concludes with this paragraph to emphasize what is to come, spark readers' thinking, and build excitement. It also leaves questions and thoughts lingering in the readers' minds after they finish the passage. For me, this is a way to capture the readers' attention, making them wonder if the protagonist can survive and adapt to an unfamiliar lifestyle. It also tests her ability to endure different seasons and reminds us that no matter what we face in life, there are always more obstacles ahead.
125	8987	4	2	The author decides to end the story with that paragraph for its emotional significance. The last paragraph reveals that she will retake the test when the hibiscus blooms in spring. She believes that the blooming hibiscus will endow her with the strength to pass the test. The hibiscus serves as a reminder of her homeland, offering her comfort. Saeng hopes that the sight of the blooming hibiscus will evoke memories of home and give her the strength to succeed in the test.
126	8988	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner as the arrival and departure of the geese symbolize change for Saeng. The hibiscus is different from what she remembers of her homeland. The budding of the hibiscus reflects Saeng's sense of home and happiness. This passage indicates that the familiarity of the budding plant empowers Saeng with the courage and ability to overcome her challenges. The geese in this passage represent the passage of time; the plant will bud when the geese return in spring. If the author had not included this final paragraph, the full impact of Saeng's memories would not have been fully conveyed. This implies that initially, due to the novelty of the place, Saeng struggled to overcome her obstacle. However, when the buds evoke a sense of home, she will be able to conquer the hurdle of her driving test and gain more confidence.
127	8989	4	2	The author includes this element to show that she has not given up. Since she persists, she can have more attempts to achieve her goal.
128	8990	4	2	There are multiple reasons why the author chose to conclude the story with Saeng vowing to attempt the driver's test again. At the start, the story begins with a sad tone. The quote “as Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test” sets this tone, as she has failed an important test and is walking alone. Then, hope re - enters the story when “She sees a familiar plant”. When Saeng brings the plant she bought to her mother, their interaction is telling. Her mother asks “where did you get it?”, and Saeng replies “I bought it.” She paid @MONEY1 more than what her mother said all the seeds in the garden were worth. As time passes, it becomes clear to her mother that the plant symbolizes strength and hope for her daughter. The author draws a parallel here; just as the narrator once thought a work - candle cat was a waste of money but later saw their mother's delight, Saeng's mother realizes that the plant makes Saeng happy and gives her the courage to attempt the driver's test again. This is why the author chose this conclusion for the story.
129	8991	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it extends the story and provides a satisfying ending. However, I'm completely in the dark about what the paragraph actually means. I believe it's the author's responsibility to explain its meaning rather than leaving it up to the readers to decipher.
130	8992	4	2	I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because they were trying to let us know what happened after the main part of the story ended. They aimed to make the situation clear, and that's why I believe they came up with the idea to conclude with this particular paragraph.
131	8993	4	2	The author concludes the paragraph as Saeng intends to wait until winter ends to have a fresh start. She wishes to try again because she made a mistake by tilling the plants last time. Saeng aspires to become a gardener like her mother.
132	8994	4	2	The author concludes the essay with those sentences to convey that she will realize they are returning.
133	8995	4	2	The author ends the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow…” to illustrate that Saeng has grown stronger. She has become stronger as she has adapted to her new home and environment. Saeng is more self - confident and is willing to take the test again. She does not want to repeat the crying she did during her last test. Her increased confidence and better adjustment are the reasons for her new - found strength, and her new strength is why she wants to retake the test.
134	8996	4	2	Confidence, persistence, and memories are all qualities that Saeng possesses, which helps explain why the author concludes the story with the given paragraph. Since Saeng moved from her native country, she has been unhappy, constantly missing everyone and everything from Vietnam. Everything she sees reminds her of it. The last paragraph, “then I will take that test again,” shows her self - confidence and her determination to try harder next time. Her statement of wanting to try again demonstrates persistence, and hopefully, she won't give up. Saeng misses almost everything from Vietnam, including the food, her family, and their appearance and clothing. Her memories may have hindered her concentration during the driver's test. To feel better, she bought a flower as she wanted to do well. It is hoped that Saeng's life in the United States will improve, and she will learn to love this country.
135	8997	4	2	The blooming of the hibiscus plant brings new hope. In the story, the young girl views the hibiscus as a symbol of her old life. As the plant begins to bud, a new chapter commences in her life.
136	8998	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey a point. Saeng compares herself to the flower; the flower was initially a wild one and then was planted in a pot, while Saeng was a free - spirited and happy girl before she had to move to @LOCATION1. Both the flower and Saeng feel out of place. Since Saeng is similar to the flower in the story, at the end, I think Saeng believes that if the flower can survive the winter, she can survive @LOCATION1 and pass the test. This is why I think the author ended with that paragraph to get the message across.
137	8999	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way to demonstrate that Saeng is determined not to fail the driver's test. By ending on a positive note for Saeng, the author aims to prevent her from feeling sad. When Saeng retakes the test, she will be better - prepared and know what to expect, which will lead to a more favorable situation for her.
138	9000	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story as they did to impart a valuable lesson. Regardless of the obstacles that come your way or the factors that slow you down, you should never give up. Persistence is key. If you fail at something, keep trying repeatedly until you achieve success. This is the important message that the author wanted to convey through the story's ending.
139	9001	4	2	@CAPS2, memories, and hard @CAPS1 are all reasons for the author to conclude the story with “When They come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, Then I will take the test again.” First, @CAPS2 is involved because Saeng failed her test initially, and it takes courage and will - power to go back and attempt it again. Also, memories of her grandmother upset her, yet she still has the will to take the test a second time. Regarding memories, I @CAPS4 that she wants to take the test because of the good memories with her grandmother, and she doesn't want to forget them. This again ties back to the will - power needed to retake the test. Finally, all the Hard @CAPS1: She understands what her grandmother meant to her and wants to honor and appreciate all that her grandmother did for her, despite the difficulties. These are the reasons why @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the author chose that paragraph to end the story.
140	9002	4	2	The author includes the last paragraph to illustrate that Saeng still holds hope. It serves as the last sentence because @CAPS1 Fong Ho intends to show that even when everything seems hopeless and one reaches a dead - end, there is always hope for a better future. When spring arrives, it brings a new beginning, not only for Saeng's plant but also for her life in a foreign country.
141	9003	4	2	In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with a specific paragraph to reinforce the theme of adapting to new circumstances and making the most of each change, while also ending on a hopeful note. The statement “Saeng vowed silently to herself” indicates Saeng's effort to integrate into her new life and find its positive aspects. The hopeful tone shows her willingness to accept life's changes and overcome obstacles, as seen in her declaration “I will take that test again.” The test symbolizes the challenges she will surmount with effort. The hibiscus in the sentence “...when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding...” represents a new beginning. Comparing the budding hibiscus to Saeng highlights her fresh start and determination to adjust to a new lifestyle. By choosing this paragraph to conclude the story, the author emphasizes the theme and symbolizes a new start.
142	9004	4	2	I believe the author ends the story with that statement so the audience can compare Saeng to the hibiscus. After reading it, I noticed that Saeng and the hibiscus are similar as they'll both persevere and succeed (Saeng getting her license and the hibiscus blooming). The author might have used this ending to show Saeng's commitment to her goal and her refusal to give up, as shown when “Saeng vowed silently to herself, ‘I will take that test again’.” Finally, I think the ending gives the audience a sense of what will happen to Saeng while leaving some room for interpretation. For example, I'm confident Saeng will retake and pass the test, but another reader might think she'll fail again and have to retake it.
143	9005	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to enable the reader to draw parallels between the girl, the geese, and the hibiscus. The geese migrate in winter and return in spring, mirroring the girl's intention to retake the driver's test in spring. The hibiscus withers in winter and begins to bud again in spring, indicating that winter is its vulnerable period. Similarly, the girl overcomes her driving weakness by recalling her homeland. By placing this paragraph at the end, the author shows that the girl shares similarities with the geese and the hibiscus.
144	9006	4	2	I think the author ended the story with that phrase to demonstrate the main character's maturation. She admits she wasn't prepared for the challenges ahead. For instance, when she failed her test, instead of being distraught, she simply said she'd take it again next year. Throughout the story, she yearned for her homeland and coped by buying a winter hibiscus, which reminded her of both her homeland and her grandmother. Overall, the main character displayed depth and maturity in the story.
145	9007	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way to illustrate Saeng's willingness to adapt to her environment, much like the hibiscus. Saeng must adjust to her new home in @LOCATION1, and the hibiscus must adapt to the approaching winter. Saeng vows, “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding...” From this, it's evident that Saeng holds hope for both herself and the hibiscus. Initially, Saeng was hesitant to accept her new home, commenting that “it’s not like the kind we had before” about the hibiscus. However, she realized that the hibiscus could serve as a reminder of home and a prompt to adapt to her new surroundings. She understood that if the hibiscus could survive the winter, she could thrive in a new place.
146	9008	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in spring. Saeng struggles to adapt to her new home and refuses to quit after a single failure. Memories of her former home, though painful as she knows she can never return, help her cope. The hibiscus and other familiar flowers offer her comfort, reminding her of home. When spring arrives, with the return of the geese and the blooming of the hibiscus, Saeng will feel ready to take the test again. Spring symbolizes a chance for a new attempt and a fresh start.
147	9009	4	2	The author concludes the story with the last paragraph as it reveals Saeng will retake the test. Earlier, in a paragraph, Saeng told her mother she failed the test. By spring, when the hibiscus begins to bud and the geese that left due to snow return, Saeng will take the test again. She compares herself to the geese as she misses her home. Just as the geese return when the time is right, Saeng will try again, which is the conclusion the author reaches in the story's paragraph.
148	9010	4	2	I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph because the plant symbolizes determination to survive. Specifically, the hibiscus brings Saeng good luck for her next driving test after winter when it starts budding. Additionally, the author concludes with this sentence to reveal Saeng's future plans.
149	9011	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with this paragraph for several reasons. It shows that Saeng will not give up; she will wait for the next opportunity to take the test. It implies that she will be well - prepared and confident in passing. This gives the reader the impression that Saeng will persevere and complete the test. Her mother will be proud of her, and it demonstrates Saeng's unwavering spirit. For instance, when she said “let’s plant it, right now,” it shows that despite failing the test and disappointing her mother, she still has hope, just as her mother has hope for her.
150	9012	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it depicts Saeng silently vowing to herself. She is reflecting on events from long ago with her mother and the plants in her garden. Saeng contemplates how things will be when spring returns, when the snow melts, and the geese come back. She silently vows to take the test again. This is why I think the author includes this paragraph to conclude the story.
151	9013	4	2	The story features @PERSON1, a girl, and her mother. The girl was given money to buy plant seeds and spent @MONEY1 on them. Her mother got upset, but then things turned around, like they had egg omelets with bits of melon. The author concludes the story with this paragraph.
152	9014	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that after all the events, Saeng will move forward and strive hard. For instance, when Saeng said, “When they come back in the spring, When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Ending the story this way leaves the reader in suspense as they are unsure if the geese will return. The author seems to show that Saeng is starting to adapt to her new country and make it feel like her old one. When the mother said, “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.” This indicates their desire to make the new country more like the old one, and when that happens, Saeng will be happy. Thus, the author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate how Saeng will adapt to the environmental change.
153	9015	4	2	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because she can't wait for spring. In spring, her plant will bud, which will remind her of her homeland. She can't wait to take the test in spring as she hopes to pass it this time, having failed the first attempt. Maybe she concluded the story this way because she likes spring and eagerly anticipates its arrival.
154	9016	4	2	I firmly believe there's a significant reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think the author will feel more at ease and well - prepared to take the test. I reached this conclusion because by waiting for winter to end to retake the test, she's allowing herself time to prepare. Also, she's waiting for the hibiscus plant to bud. From her eagerness to wait for the hibiscus, I can infer a sense of comfort. The whole story centers around how Saeng comforted herself by recalling her past experiences in Vietnam. When she perceives that an important part of her life is returning, she can become comfortable and focused. I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the importance of this flower in Saeng's life.
155	9017	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that she has hope. She believes she can pass the test when everything returns to normal in the spring. In spring, the geese will come back, and the hibiscus will be budding. This makes her feel more at home as it was always this way before she moved. Moreover, she likes the geese and the hibiscus, and these things might make her feel more comfortable. That's why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, to show her hope.
156	9018	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to draw a comparison between Saeng's life and a plant. For instance, in the story, Saeng fails her driving test and then spots a plant that reminds her of her homeland. From the flower - shop to her house, she equates her homeland with the flower, demonstrating her connection to it. The concluding paragraph indicates that just as the hibiscus begins a new phase when it buds, Saeng will also embark on a new journey and pursue her driver's license.
157	9019	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination to adapt to life changes. In the story, Saeng fails her driver's test and struggles to adjust to her new life in @LOCATION1. However, upon seeing that the hibiscus and geese are familiar, she becomes determined to adapt as well. Saeng purchases a hibiscus as it reminds her of home. This not only comforts her but also intensifies her longing for her old home. The hibiscus can thrive in both @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION1, which helps Saeng realize that she too can adapt. The author includes the geese because they assist Saeng in recognizing that she is becoming more familiar with things in the United States, enabling her to continue adapting. Saeng mentions that she now recognizes the “V” shape of the geese. Realizing her increasing familiarity with @LOCATION1 and her ability to survive there gives her the determination to retake and pass her driving test. The author includes this to summarize the story's theme of adapting to change.
158	9020	4	2	In my opinion, the author included that sentence to establish a more personal connection with the character, allowing readers to relate to that person. This approach makes the character more relatable and the story more engaging for the audience.
159	9021	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the significance of new beginnings and to highlight the story's theme. The theme is that one must overcome hardships and pursue new beginnings. Springtime symbolizes a new start. Thus, the arrival of spring will enable her to start afresh on the driver's test. Additionally, the author uses the paragraph to showcase the symbolic qualities of everyday things. Just as the hibiscus evokes memories of home life, the geese will remind her of springtime, further reinforcing the theme of new beginnings.
160	9022	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” author Minfong Ho concludes the story with that paragraph as a way of suggesting that Saeng will put the past failure of her driving test behind her and strive for better results next time. It's as if the author is saying that Saeng will experience a rebirth, similar to the hibiscus in spring. Throughout the story, Saeng has had to adapt, just like the hibiscus. The hibiscus has inspired Saeng to do well in her current situation. After learning from the hibiscus, it marks a new beginning for Saeng.
161	9023	4	2	The hibiscus serves as a thematic element in the story. It inspires the protagonist, evoking memories of her home country and motivating her to explore new experiences. This significance underscores the importance of the hibiscus to Saeng, highlighting its role in shaping her character and driving the narrative forward.
162	9024	4	2	I believe the author chose to conclude the story in this manner to depict the girl reflecting on her past and finding tranquility in the presence of the flower. The writer aims to convey that regardless of one's accustomed circumstances, there is always something that can bring happiness and a sense of focus. This ending serves as a poignant reminder of the resilience of the human spirit and the ability to find peace even in the face of adversity.
163	9025	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that the character is determined to pass the test and will not abandon her efforts until she achieves success. This determination showcases the character's perseverance and resilience, highlighting the importance of having a strong will in the face of challenges. By ending the story in this way, the author emphasizes the significance of perseverance and the rewards that come with it.
164	9026	4	2	I feel the author ended the story with this paragraph to demonstrate how the character has matured and grown within her circumstances. It conveys the message that a single failure does not define one's future and that it is acceptable to feel out of place. Life presents opportunities for new beginnings, and the choice to seize them or remain stagnant lies with the individual. This ending encourages readers to embrace change and take risks, recognizing that growth and success often come from stepping outside of one's comfort zone.
165	9027	4	2	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the story concludes with Saeng silently vowing, “when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. ‘I - I failed the test’.” Like many children, Saeng failed her driving test and was deeply upset. Failing a test, especially when others have succeeded, can be a humiliating experience. The quotes in the introduction and question are symbolic. The return of the geese north symbolizes a fresh start or a new attempt, while the budding hibiscus represents the renewal of life. Saeng, observing these natural cycles of renewal, is empowered to persevere and try again. She realizes that failure is a part of life and that success requires perseverance. Minfong Ho concludes with this quote to convey that regardless of the obstacles, one must keep pressing forward and working hard. Success is the result of dedication and commitment, qualities that define a strong individual.
166	9028	4	2	The author concludes the paragraph with that sentence to convey to the reader that the situation is not over. The author intends for the reader to understand that @ORGANIZATION1 will not forget and that all these events will recur.
167	9029	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with the line “I will take that test again,” indicating that the challenges the protagonist, Saeng, is facing will repeat, but she will be better prepared next time. Saeng struggles to adapt when moving to another country. Her mother supports her through the difficult winter. The hibiscus she bought during her toughest time symbolizes more than itself. In the last paragraph, when she says, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” she is looking forward to the future. Saeng silently vows to herself in the spring, eagerly awaiting the end of winter and the arrival of spring.
168	9030	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to inform the readers about what she will do upon her return in spring. Specifically, she will take care of the plants. The author also implies that she hopes the snow will melt and normalcy will return when she gets back. This is the message the author conveys through the story.
169	9031	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph to reassure the reader that the character will return. Moreover, by ending the story in this way, the author shows that in life, no matter where one goes, there will always be someone or something to offer assurance. The author also aims to make the reader feel a sense of kinship with the character, suggesting that regardless of how out - of - place one may feel, there is always something relatable.
170	9032	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph either to entice the readers to purchase his upcoming book or to heighten their excitement for future works.
171	9033	4	2	In this story, the author decides to conclude with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This is because she wishes to take the test when everything is ideal. For instance, she desires elements she likes in her environment, such as the flowers, the geese, and the weather. Another reason the author ends the story with this paragraph is that she wants to be in an environment similar to that of her home - country. For example, there was no snow there, and it was like spring all year round. This is the rationale behind the author's choice to end the story with that paragraph.
172	9034	4	2	The author ends the story with a particular paragraph to convey that the character is consoled by the memories of her homeland and highly appreciates the beauty of tropical plants. The character believes that since it is winter and the hibiscus is not budding, she cannot pass the test until it does. The statement “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now” demonstrates her strong belief in the beauty of her homeland and tropical plants. She reflects on past times when things were strange in winter and better in spring and other seasons when the plants were budding. Thus, she believes she will pass the driver's test when she feels comfortable, that is, when the plants have budded.
173	9035	4	2	The migration of geese flying south for winter and the budding of hibiscus are familiar and normal occurrences for Saeng. The author concludes the story in this way to illustrate that Saeng finds comfort in familiar things. Saeng hopes to have the geese and hibiscus present to feel more at ease while taking her driving test. She still yearns for her home in Vietnam and doesn't fully feel like she belongs in the U.S. The hibiscus gives her a sense of comfort, as if she is back home. Her homesickness stems from her desire for things to be as they were. The plants in the greenhouse and the disappointment of failing her driving test contribute to her emotional state. In the second - last paragraph, the author describes Saeng's feeling of repetition when seeing the geese in a V - formation. Saeng feels that in winter, she won't have the same comfort as when she can see the hibiscus and geese overhead. When she arrived at the location, she had nothing familiar to her, but now she gets that feeling from the geese and plants. The author's conclusion that Saeng will take her driving test when winter ends is a fitting closure as it provides insight into her future actions.
174	9036	4	2	I believe the reason the author concludes with the sentence “When they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” is that it was winter and the school was closed. When the geese return, it will be spring, and that will be the time to go back to school. This, in my opinion, is the underlying reason for this conclusion.
175	9037	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author ends the story in an unusual way. The line “‘when they come back,’ Saeng vowed silently to herself, ‘in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding. then I will take that test again.’” Beyond its literal meaning, I think the author is showing how Saeng is adapting to the new country. Failing her driver's test implies that she has yet to fully adapt and accept the new country. However, by vowing to try again, she shows her willingness to give the country another chance. The statement “She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home” indicates that she still doesn't consider this country her home and is still attached to her past. Overall, the ending effectively portrays Saeng's complex journey of adaptation.
176	9038	4	2	In the paragraph, the author concludes the story to illustrate that Saeng will not cease her efforts merely because she failed once. It also demonstrates that she will not allow certain circumstances to discourage her.
177	9039	4	2	I firmly believe the last sentence of a story often holds the most significance. In this case, the author chose to end the story in a particular way for multiple reasons. Firstly, the author aimed to leave the reader with a powerful sense of determination. The story quotes, “I will take that test again.” The use of the word “will” clearly showcases the girl's unwavering resolve. She didn't say she would attempt it; she stated with absolute certainty that she will. Secondly, the author ended the story this way to emphasize the theme of new beginnings. The quote, “when they come back... in the spring... I will take that test again” indicates that in spring, the season of new life, she will take the test. All in all, these are the reasons why I believe the author ended the story as such.
178	9040	4	2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” made a prudent decision by concluding the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This passage subtly suggests to the reader that Saeng intends to integrate her old and new lives. The hibiscus represents her old life, as she is accustomed to the constants from her homeland. The geese symbolize her new life, having become “almost familiar to her now.” The driving test is the obstacle she must overcome. The author implies that in spring, when the old and new aspects of Saeng's life merge, she will be able to surmount her “obstacle,” and everything will fall into place. With the geese on the ground, Saeng's life will have come full circle.
179	9041	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it is crucial when Saeng says that when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, she will take the test again. This informs the reader of the time when she will retake the test, which is why it is included in the story.
180	9042	4	2	In Minfong Ho's “Winter Hibiscus,” I am of the opinion that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it emphasizes Saeng's willingness to retake the test when the appropriate time arrives. Additionally, the second - last paragraph in the story states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of the season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This sentence shows me that Saeng is gradually adapting to the new place. It also reveals how she is changing her perspective on the plant, understanding that even though it is different from what she's used to, it can still hold meaning. Consequently, I believe the author made an excellent choice in ending the story with this paragraph.
181	9043	4	2	"The final paragraph reads, ""In the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" It is believed that the author ended with this paragraph to convey that when her new home resembles her old one, she may feel more confident and at ease. This is in contrast to the cold winter, which is the opposite of her former living environment. The sense of her old home within her new one will make her more positive and comfortable. Consequently, she will take the test feeling at home and is likely to pass."
182	9044	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author portrays how the girl, Saeng, believes that with her memories and after adapting to the new culture, she will gain the courage to retake the test she failed. Saeng misses her home deeply and initially fails to recognize the similarities between her new and old homes. As the text states, ""She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" Although Saeng did not anticipate the move, she starts to create new memories while holding onto the old ones. At first, everything was extremely different, but now she is beginning to recall aspects of her new home, which brings her comfort. For instance, ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again."" The ending paragraph indicates that there is hope for Saeng to move forward in her new home. She is gradually gaining confidence and knows that when she does, she can take the test and succeed. The author demonstrates that positive change is possible if one is willing to adapt. Not everything may be as perfect as one expects, but courage can help create a happy home filled with both new and old memories, as Saeng realizes in the last paragraph."
183	9045	4	2	In this short story, the author simply states the obvious. The excerpt mainly implies that when spring arrives, the girl will return to the greenhouse or the area full of plants. Once there, she will attempt to transplant the wild - growing plant from her home country to her new home. This shows her connection to her homeland and her desire to bring a part of it to her new environment.
184	9046	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to depict Saeng as a person who never gives up and keeps growing, much like the hibiscus plant. Saeng realizes that many of the things she once considered strange have become familiar through the passing of seasons. She notices that there will always be the next season, when the plant has grown and the geese fly in a distinctive V again. This shows her resilience and the hope for a better future, suggesting that she will continue to adapt and thrive in her new environment.
185	9047	4	2	"Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph to convey Saeng's feelings. When Saeng says, ""I will take that test again,"" it implies that she is contemplating whether she can go through the same experiences. This ending makes the reader think about Saeng's determination and her ability to face challenges. It shows that despite the uncertainties, Saeng is willing to confront whatever lies ahead, and this is likely the author's intention in using this paragraph to conclude the story."
186	9048	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate that a happy ending is always possible. The return of the geese brought happiness to the girl. This outcome showcases the potential for positive resolutions within the narrative.
187	9049	4	2	The author concluded the story with that paragraph as the character is not willing to give up on certain things. She implies that she will take her driving test when all her beliefs about success are realized. Her mother remarks that the flower is resilient and can survive the winter, and the geese always return. Similarly, she won't give up on the test and will keep trying until she passes, demonstrating her determination and the message of perseverance in the story.
188	9050	4	2	Saeng feels more at ease in the spring as it evokes memories of her home. Having perhaps never experienced snow or winter before, the winter season fails to remind her of home. In spring, the return of the geese and the regrowth of hibiscus make everything feel like home again. The arrival of spring brings her a sense of comfort and confidence, making it a season that holds special meaning for her.
189	9051	4	2	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph as it encapsulates the strength and courage the hibiscus has provided to Saeng. Similar to the hibiscus, Saeng felt out of place in the new country, and the hibiscus helps her understand the significance of adapting for survival and living happily. She cannot constantly dwell on the past but must learn to appreciate her current living place. When the author writes, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it symbolizes Saeng opening her mind to new ways, such as learning to drive, highlighting the theme of growth and adaptation in the story.
190	9052	4	2	I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” chose that as the last paragraph because seeing the hibiscus will bring back memories of home, which will encourage her for the test. The geese symbolize Saeng's determination to pass the test and adapt to the new country. When Saeng says, “she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive [shape] was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading,” it creates a vivid image in my mind. This shows that Saeng will definitely take the test when she gets encouragement from both the geese and the hibiscus, emphasizing the powerful symbolism in the story.
191	9053	4	2	The author concludes the text with that paragraph as it subtly conveys the message that everything will turn out fine. Saeng plans to retake her driver's test, and life has reverted to her preferred state. This ending instills a sense of hope, suggesting that things will go well for her. It also implies that she will start making the most of life. This is the reason I believe the author chose to conclude with that paragraph.
192	9054	4	2	"The author uses this paragraph to conclude the story as it illustrates Saeng's desire to adapt to the country and her growing understanding and fondness for it. When the text states, ""and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" it serves as a metaphor for Saeng herself. Just as the hibiscus begins to bloom and thrive, Saeng too is starting to bloom and progress. This is the rationale behind the author ending the story with this passage."
193	9055	4	2	Saeng stated that she will retake the test when the tree she purchased starts budding. What she means is that without that plant, she lacks the motivation to take the test. This is because the plant has been with her throughout her life. She also believes that she cannot succeed without it. In my opinion, while Saeng thinks she needs the plant due to its long - standing presence in her life, she may not actually require it. I suppose it simply provides her with a sense of comfort.
194	9056	4	2	Initially, the author did not think Saeng was ready to take the test until she had more knowledge about it. Saeng was preoccupied with gardening as she had no friends at school and did not want to go there as she would have no one to talk to. It is a positive thing that Saeng made a vow to take the test because otherwise, she would never know if she would perform well or poorly. Eventually, the author came to the realization that Saeng will take the test and pass.
195	9057	4	2	The author concludes the text with this paragraph mainly to emphasize her memories of her homeland. By stating that she will take the driving test again next spring, she acknowledges that the arrival of spring will bring back a multitude of memories. During spring, animals emerge and trees blossom, creating a beautiful setting. This beauty, combined with the support of her memories of her country, makes it an ideal time for her to retake the test. This is why the author chose this ending.
196	9058	4	2	"After reading Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the story in a distinct manner that showcases a will to survive. For instance, in the text, the author describes how the ""dok faeng - noi"" plants have adapted to their cold environment, which differs from their native one. This exemplifies the concept of survival as these plants migrated to a seemingly warm place in the past. When the cold set in, they found ways to transform and adapt, all driven by the instinct to survive. Another example from the text is Saeng telling herself that she will retake the test in spring. This demonstrates her will to survive because after failing the test, she felt a sense of melancholy and failure. The fact that she has the courage to prepare for the test in spring shows that as a human being, she wants to live. To thrive in a new country, she must adapt by passing that test and becoming a survivor."
197	9059	4	2	The author concludes the story with a paragraph about snow on the roads. Through this, the author shows people the importance of watching where they are going. Ultimately, the paragraph indicates that the protagonist made it through the snowstorm, highlighting the successful navigation through the challenging situation.
198	9060	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng vows to herself that in spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, she will take the test again. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus brings Saeng comfort and confidence, making her feel at home. The quote ""Almost familiar to her now"" from the story shows that things are starting to fall into place for her. It makes her realize that her current living place can be similar to her former home. The hibiscus also brings back memories of the flowers they had in their previous residence. Both the mother and the daughter appreciate the flower they found as it resembles the one they had back home. For example, the mother says, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This demonstrates their appreciation for its similarity to the old hibiscus. In conclusion, the author ends the story with this paragraph to help readers understand the significance of the girl's memories of her former home."
199	9061	4	2	"The author chose this ending to show that Saeng hasn't given up on her new life. Even though she deeply loved her hometown and has many fond memories of it, taking the test and failing added a great deal of pressure to her new life. Although she hasn't fully adapted, she will do her best to overcome the challenges that come her way. Ending the story like this gives the reader hope, rather than leaving them with the impression that Saeng simply bought a flower after failing a test and moved on. For example, when she failed the test, she was clearly distressed and angry. The text describes, ""I - I failed the test,"" Saeng said. For a long moment, Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. It angered Saeng that she had to leave her happy past life for a different and challenging one. When faced with challenges, extreme emotional reactions occur. Saeng needed hope, and the author chose this ending to convey to the reader that there is a glimmer of hope."
200	9062	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho ends the story in a particular way for multiple reasons. These reasons likely contribute to the overall themes and messages the author wishes to convey, such as the characters' growth, adaptation, and the significance of certain symbols within the story. By ending the story as she does, Minfong Ho leaves a lasting impression on the reader and ties up the various plot threads in a meaningful manner."
201	9063	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it effectively wraps up the entire narrative and condenses it into a single, coherent statement. It indicates that she is eagerly anticipating the spring when the hibiscus blooms.
202	9064	4	2	The reason she ended the story with “when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the snows melt & the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the again” is that she is stating that just as the birds have a constant place to live and the plant can thrive in that environment, she too can adapt if she tries. She will wait until the birds return and the plant buds in her new home, believing that everything will be okay then. At that time, she will be able to take the test as she understands and believes she will feel safer and better.
203	9065	4	2	The story ends in this way for two main reasons. Firstly, the author ends the story to prompt readers to contemplate what might happen in a potential part two. Secondly, it leaves the possibility open for the creation of a second part. This is why the story concludes in such a manner.
204	9066	4	2	She made this vow because, just as the geese return to their place, she will also return. Just as the geese use the journey to learn and grow, she too will learn and grow. Moreover, having endured the tests of love, survival, and family tradition, she realizes that coming back was her destiny. For instance, the geese come to raise their young and face the journey ahead. They understand that they will always return because their lives began there and they need to escape the harsh winter and the threats from mankind. The winter months are extremely harsh, so they know they must leave to survive. Through this, she learns the lessons of family, freedom, life, and survival.
205	9067	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he had committed to himself to retake the test. He likely said this because there is always a next opportunity for everything. Primarily, he said it to remind himself that there is always another chance to try. Finally, it is important for most people to recognize that everyone gets a second chance.
206	9068	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way as the seasons are changing, completing their cycle and beginning a new one. In my opinion, this is an effective way to end the story as it sets a certain mood and atmosphere at the end.
207	9069	4	2	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with this paragraph because it conveys the story's theme of adapting to life's changes. Saeng has experienced numerous changes and has not fully adjusted to her new way of life. However, she learns that she must be determined to adapt and survive, just like the hibiscus. As the text states, “In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding.” The hibiscus teaches Saeng never to give up, as it endures the winter. Despite failing the test the first time, her memories have helped her, and she will try again. These ideas in the last paragraph summarize the concept of not giving up, even when one feels out of place. Saeng has gradually acclimated to her new surroundings and now recognizes the seasons as she has this final thought.
208	9070	4	2	The purpose of that little paragraph is to set a tone and describe the appearance. It can also serve as a starting point for another book or inspire the reader to study things. Moreover, it can draw a comparison between one's life and the life of geese, explaining the hardships one has endured. Overall, it has multiple functions in engaging the reader and provoking thought.
209	9071	4	2	I believe the author chooses to end the story in this manner for several reasons. Throughout the narrative, the author drops hints about Saeng's homesickness. The author links this to the flower's ability to withstand the winter months, suggesting that Saeng will also survive. Although the flower is different from the ones she had at home, change is inevitable, and at least she can hold onto that. Thus, I think the author ends the story this way to convey that, like the plant, Saeng will survive and attempt to adjust in the spring, similar to her approach to the driving test.
210	9072	4	2	The author concluded the story in that way because he was responsible for scoring the lines below the written content. By scoring to a certain level, it could potentially enhance the quality and coherence. He was surprised to find things separated in a particular way. The conclusion seems to bring all these elements together, and it appears that the author's ending is aimed at tying up all the loose ends and leaving the reader with a sense of completion.
211	9073	4	2	"I believe the author included this paragraph to demonstrate that the subject did not give up and continued to try after failing. Saeng told her mother, ""I failed the test."" The paragraph also makes the subject seem proud and happy to retake the test. I, too, have failed tests and said I would retake them but did not. Thus, the author included this to show the subject's determination."
212	9074	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to inform the reader that there is still hope for Saeng. She is not losing faith in herself or the test. Throughout the reading, it becomes evident that Saeng finds comfort in memories of her homeland, and the move to another country was undoubtedly challenging for her. The author describes, ""It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center - just as she had known it would feel."" The feeling and scent of the hibiscus flower provided her with solace. After failing the test, she bought the plant to lift her spirits. By ending the story with Saeng saying, ""Once this hibiscus plant is budding, then I will take that test again,"" the author emphasizes that the hibiscus plant has been the sole positive element in her life since the move. It serves as motivation for her to retake the driver's test and shows that Saeng is not giving up."
213	9075	4	2	"Minfong Ho concluded the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a powerful paragraph to showcase Saeng's passion and determination in her new home to pass the test. When the closing sentences state that Saeng ""vowed"" to pass the test, it reveals her resolve to persevere. This determination might stem from memories of her grandmother and the flowers that reminded her of her old home. Saeng's courage to confront her homesickness is the core of the story. By ending with such a bold statement, Minfong Ho transforms this seemingly sad tale into one of willpower and the drive to succeed in the test. ""Winter Hibiscus"" is a narrative of heartache, despair, and longing for a past life. By concluding with Saeng's uplifting promise, Minfong Ho gives a positive ending to what could have been a tragic story."
214	9076	4	2	The author concludes the story with this part because both the season and the story are coming to an end. This conclusion aligns the natural progression of the season's conclusion with the narrative's closure, providing a sense of finality to the story.
215	9077	4	2	"I think the author concludes the story with this type of paragraph because the author is aware that the situation is likely to repeat. In the paragraph, it states, ""In the spring... I will take this test again."" This shows that the character is preparing herself for the next year. Therefore, I believe this is the reason why this paragraph concludes the story."
216	9078	4	2	After dinner, Saeng reflected on the test. She was confident that she could perform significantly better than before. She made a firm vow to herself that once winter concluded and spring commenced, she would retake the test, and this time, she would pass it with excellent results.
217	9079	4	2	Saeng wishes to retake the test when the weather is pleasant and the hibiscus is in bud. The plant symbolizes the beautiful achievement of passing the test. Its strength, resilience, and perfect form will aid her in passing the test, as these qualities mirror both the girl and the flower. She had a great day and wants to take the test on a similar day. The plant's strength and toughness represent her situation when she failed the test. She informed her mother, who was very understanding. Both the plant and the geese symbolize beautiful things. Saeng wants to take the test at that time of day and believes she will succeed next time. After passing the test, she wants to return home to the beautiful surroundings to cherish that day. The author ended with this statement to emphasize the significance of the plant and the surroundings when she aims to pass the test.
218	9080	4	2	I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph to remind readers of Saeng's sincere connection to the hibiscus flower. Throughout the story, Saeng showed great compassion for the flower, and I think she felt a strong sense of kinship with it.
219	9081	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it symbolizes a new beginning. Saeng admits, ""I – I failed the test,"" and she is deeply saddened. However, she is making a commitment to start anew, much like the world in spring. The theme of the story is to adopt a new approach when life gets tough. Saeng intends to retake the driver's test."
220	9082	4	2	The author ends the story in this way to illustrate that Saeng will be prepared to take the test in due course. First, she must grow and adjust to her new environment, just as the hibiscus flower and the geese do. The hibiscus has to adapt to its new outdoor setting outside the store, and the geese adapt by flying south for the winter. Saeng needs to learn more and adapt before she can pass her driver's test. By ending the story with this paragraph, it shows that Saeng realizes what she needs to do. She must stop dwelling on her past and embrace her new life in a new country.
221	9083	4	2	"Minfong Ho concluded her story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with an optimistic sentence. This conclusion was crafted as the main character, Saeng, was on the verge of losing hope. When her hibiscus flower bloomed, Saeng decided to retake the driving test. The flower served as a powerful reminder of her past life in Vietnam with her grandmother. ""Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine - toothed buffalo - horn comb"". Saeng clearly preferred her life in Vietnam to her life in @LOCATION2. She resolved to wait until ""this hibiscus is budding"" so that she could feel more at ease and content. The author chose this ending to ensure Saeng's happiness."
222	9084	4	2	The author ended the story in this way as the main character was sad, and the author aimed to offer hope to readers, emphasizing that one should never give up and always keep trying. A good ending is crucial, and an ending like “I stayed up in my @CAPS1 crying” would be inappropriate. This particular ending not only gives hope but also encourages readers to practice. As spring ends, the lady will practice driving to avoid failing the test. Moreover, the girl becomes happier at the end, which in turn makes the reader happy. In conclusion, this ending is a great choice for multiple reasons, such as making the reader happy, giving them the courage to never give up, and teaching the importance of practicing after a failure. It also subtly suggests helping one's mother with planting or digging up plants.
223	9085	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph to develop the theme and project what the main character, Saeng, will do after planting the hibiscus. The theme of this story is adjusting to life's changes, and the author further builds on this theme in the final paragraph. In the ending paragraph, the author quotes Saeng as saying, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This shows how Saeng learns to adapt when faced with life's changes. After failing her driver's test, Saeng buys a hibiscus to remind her of her homeland. The hibiscus symbolizes a new start for her to retake the test once the geese return (though the text about “(THIS @CAPS1 IS @CAPS2)” seems incomplete). Overall, the ending effectively ties into the theme of adapting to change.
224	9086	4	2	She made sure not to forget to take the test again. This simple act shows her determination and commitment to achieving her goal. By not forgetting, she is taking a step forward towards success, ensuring that she does not let this opportunity pass her by.
225	9087	4	2	Saeng demonstrated remarkable self - perseverance. She declared that she would retake the test, believing she might pass it. It's a well - known fact that one doesn't always succeed on the first attempt; sometimes, it takes time. Saeng serves as an inspiration, encouraging others not to give up just because they fail the first time. Additionally, through this process, she builds confidence in herself. This is precisely why the author chose to conclude the story in this manner, highlighting the values of perseverance and self - confidence.
226	9088	4	2	The author concludes the story with a paragraph where Saeng vows to retake the test in spring to illustrate that the geese and the hibiscus plant symbolize a form of rebirth or revival for Saeng. The author aims to end the story on an optimistic note. Spring is a classic season, a time of birth and growth. After failing the first test, Saeng saw the hibiscus, which transported her back to memories of Vietnam, offering her comfort. She believes that when she witnesses the plant thriving and the geese returning, she will experience that revival once more.
227	9089	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story in this way because Saeng failed the test at the start. After interacting with the plants and gaining new insights, it's only natural for her to retake the test in spring. Saeng learned that she must adapt to life in @LOCATION1. When she saw the geese flying in a “V” formation, it reminded her of Vietnam, just like the plant did. She realized that to adapt to the changes in @LOCATION1, she needs to retake the driver's test. Ending the story with her taking the test in spring is perfect as the geese will return and the hibiscus will be budding. It marks a new beginning for both the natural world and Saeng.
228	9090	4	2	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is determined to try again to obtain a plant that will remind her of her grandmother and her old home, where she hopes to return one day in @MONTH1. This way, she can see the real flower she loves, not a substitute. Through this, the author portrays Saeng's longing for her past and her resolve to hold onto those precious memories.
229	9091	4	2	In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story as he does to demonstrate that Saeng refuses to give up. In spring, the sight of the plant will evoke memories of her home, alleviating her homesickness. The quote “Plants she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood work” indicates that familiar plants trigger her recollections of home. When the plant blooms in spring, it will make her feel more at ease and at home, empowering her to find the strength to pass the driving test. Just as the plant blossoms, so does her sense of comfort.
230	9092	4	2	I believe the author was referring to the snow. It had accumulated outside, and then it began to melt. This description might be setting a particular mood or foreshadowing a change in the story. As the snow melts, it could symbolize the thawing of a difficult situation or the start of a new phase.
231	9093	4	2	He ended the story with that sentence as it indicated that she had learned a life lesson. On her journey back to her hometown, she missed her friends, and I'm certain she also missed seeing her mother working in the garden during this cold season. It seems they are lacking in some aspects. In conclusion, he chose this sentence because it appears that she learned a lesson and is starting anew with a better understanding.
232	9094	4	2	Saeng utters this in the paragraph as she desires to make her mother proud. Hence, she intends to retake the test after winter. This shows her determination to achieve a better outcome and gain her mother's approval.
233	9095	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it showcases the character's will - power. The character loves the hibiscus, and comparing herself to it is a fitting way to end the story. When she says, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” she implies that just as the snow slows down the hibiscus, her recent failure is slowing her down. She plans to study and prepare. When spring arrives and the hibiscus buds, she too will “bud” by passing her test.
234	9096	4	2	In the article, the author concludes the story with Saeng promising herself, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” because the spring and the hibiscus evoke memories of her home. For instance, in the article, she becomes emotional when she can't say “home” due to intense longing. She finds solace in things like the dok faeng - noi plant, which, though not the real plant from her home, helps her recall her roots. In conclusion, Saeng finds comfort in this plant, and she cherishes spring as it reminds her of home. It makes one wonder what things remind us of our own homes.
235	9097	4	2	The author chose to end the story with this paragraph to convey to the reader that situations improve over time. Saeng failed the driver's test because she was not adequately prepared, similar to a flower blooming before it is ready. The author is emphasizing the importance of patience, suggesting that if one waits and prepares, good things will come.
236	9098	4	2	The author concludes the paragraph with the sentence “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This conclusion demonstrates the connection between the strength of the hibiscus and Saeng's own strength. In the story, after failing her driver's test, Saeng finds comfort in a hibiscus native to her country. When she arrives home, her mother remarks, “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” This indicates that Saeng is struggling in her new foreign country. The final quote encapsulates how Saeng draws strength from the flowers, almost thinking, “If the flower can survive in a land away from its home, why can't I?”
237	9099	4	2	The individual expresses that when she is fully prepared and the external environment is pleasant and beautiful, she will regain the confidence to retake the test. The author aims to convey the individual's feelings of having let her mother down. In essence, the author uses this to show the emotional state and the conditions under which the individual is willing to face the test again.
238	9100	4	2	The author concludes the story with this particular paragraph as it holds significance for the narrative and effectively closes the story. It reveals that the girl is beginning to adapt to the new area and is determined to make more efforts to integrate well. By stating that she will take the test again, it implies that she will approach it from a new perspective. The author places this at the end to bring coherence to the entire story and to illustrate the girl's transformation.
239	9101	4	2	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author believes that Saeng will be prepared to take the test at that specific time. This conclusion is based on the author's perception of Saeng's state of readiness within the context of the story.
240	9102	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it showcases that the protagonist still harbors hope. The hibiscus serves as a source of hope and strength for her. In the spring, she intends to retake her test with the hope of passing it. This is the reason why the author chooses to end the story with this paragraph, as it emphasizes the character's positive outlook and future aspirations.
241	9103	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with the statement, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This conclusion is significant as it showcases Saeng's determination to overcome the obstacle in her path. For Saeng, the hibiscus symbolizes comfort and the ability to persevere. Her strength is derived from her past experiences, and this determination is what drives her. The author's choice of ending with this quote effectively highlights Saeng's unwavering resolve."
242	9104	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the story in a particular paragraph to emphasize the significance of the winter hibiscus to Saeng. The text describes Saeng digging a hole in the garden and carefully planting the winter hibiscus, indicating its great meaning to her. The conclusion statement not only helps the reader understand Saeng's affection for her new country but also shows comfort during a time of disappointment. The description of the flower, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,"" further illustrates the connection between Saeng and the flower and how it supports her through various situations."
243	9105	4	2	I believe the author included this aspect because, like a plant, the girl needs time to grow before retaking the test. In school, we learn more than just academic knowledge; we also develop and learn to understand life. As a tenth - grader, I can attest that I understand life better than I did in first grade. Similarly, the girl still has a lot of mental growth to do regarding her past and present circumstances. This time for growth is essential for her to be better prepared to pass the test.
244	9106	4	2	"I am of the opinion that the author ended the story with the line ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"" to convey that hope remained for the girl. It is likely that the flower inspired her greatly. The specific time she chose to start over and try again aligns with the renewal of nature. When it mentions ""and this hibiscus is budding,"" it symbolizes a fresh start, just as the girl aims for a new beginning in her attempt to pass the crucial test. The hopeful and determined tone in her statement suggests that she is confident she will succeed the next time."
245	9107	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that although the specific events of the tale have ended, Saeng's life will continue. This paragraph offers closure to the reader. It also explains that Saeng will retake the test in the future, after she has had more time to adapt to the local culture. This conclusion effectively ties up the story while leaving room for the reader to envision Saeng's future progress.
246	9108	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as she hopes for the character to be successful and do good deeds.
247	9109	4	2	The response explaining why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is that the story was about a plant that regrew annually around the same time. The paragraph implies that when the plant returns in spring and the geese come back, it represents another test of growth and preventing the plant from dying.
248	9110	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with the paragraph of Saeng's silent vow to showcase her determination. The hibiscus, a plant she found that closely resembled the one from “home,” symbolizes her comfort and determination in life. The line “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now” suggests that Saeng is thinking about how she recognizes the geese, which boosts her confidence. The description “like the Geese she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive v was etched” indicates that there is still hope within her. This concluding paragraph ties together what Saeng is now hoping for and believing in.
249	9111	4	2	At the end of the story, Saeng vows to herself to show that she will adapt to the change, just as the hibiscus will bud. She is aware that it will be difficult and time - consuming, but she believes she will ultimately achieve approval and happiness. Her breakdown into tears and the way she talks to her mother already show the hardship she is facing. By planting the hibiscus, she symbolizes that things will improve if she doesn't dwell on the past.
250	9112	4	2	The author concludes the paragraph with a statement made by Saeng, which is quite impactful. The author ends with this to demonstrate that Saeng is motivated and determined. She shows her motivation by saying, “Here let me help you mother,” which indicates her eagerness to assist her mother in finishing what she started. Her determination is also evident when she says, “almost reluctantly she realizes that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through a quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar now,” showing that she is willing to embrace new things and no longer finds them odd. This is why the author concludes with this statement.
251	9113	4	2	"The author, who wrote the story, concludes it with Saeng's silent vow: ""When they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again!"" The story reveals that Saeng's family moved from Vietnam to the United @ORGANIZATION1. It's possible that the story is autobiographical. In the story, Saeng fails her driving test."
252	9114	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a specific paragraph to illustrate that the narrator has come to realize that despite being in a new country, some aspects of life remain constant. This realization spurs the narrator to be determined to pass the test. For instance, the narrator states, ""she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quick repetition of season upon season, familiar to her now."" This quote demonstrates the narrator's understanding that while life has changed in some ways, certain elements stay the same. It also implies that initially, the test seemed strange to the narrator, but with familiarity, she believes she can pass it. Another quote, ""Saeng did not dare look at her mother in her eyes,"" shows that the narrator is disappointed in herself for failing the test. This indicates that the test holds great importance for her, and with the pressure to pass in a new environment, she is now ready to take the test again, but this time better - prepared. The theme of the story could be that setbacks should not discourage one. The narrator has faced numerous challenges recently, yet with the passage of seasons, she perseveres."
253	9115	4	2	"In this story, the author shows a strong willingness to make a greater effort. The author states, ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I believe the author has recognized the need to adapt. By saying she will wait until spring, it's clear that she intends to try again and not give up. The hibiscus holds sentimental value for the author. Since she is waiting for the hibiscus to bud, I think she is associating the hibiscus with her home country. Having left her country, the hibiscus is the closest connection she has to it, so she is willing to wait with the flower as she prepares for another attempt at the test."
254	9116	4	2	The author concludes the story with a paragraph that shows Saeng now contemplates images related to memories in her new home, along with those from Vietnam. At the start of the story, while in the floral shop, she recalls her grandmother, a well, a hibiscus hedge, and other elements that evoke specific feelings and experiences. By the end of the story, she uses the hibiscus, which reminds her of her previous home, and the Canadian geese, which no longer seem unfamiliar, to symbolize the passage of time. Saeng now perceives her new home as having familiar elements tied to memories, just as her old home did.
255	9117	4	2	"The author concludes the story with a particular paragraph for several reasons. In the story, the protagonist expresses a desire for something, takes it home to show her mother, and the mother gives her a strange look. As the story states, ""You what? Her mother stared at her incredulously."" Then, the protagonist explains that she failed the driver's test but refuses to give up. At the end of the story, she declares that she will take the test again. In conclusion, this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph."
256	9118	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concludes with the line: ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This conclusion serves to demonstrate Saeng's determination to retry and pass her driving test the following year. The flowers also evoke memories of her home in Vietnam, as seen in the text: ""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into childhood world."" By the time the flowers bloom next year, Saeng will be more resolute and prepared to take the test once more. The blooming of the flowers symbolizes the start of a new life, and for Saeng, passing her driving test could mark a similar new beginning. This is why the author ends the story with this statement."
257	9119	4	2	I firmly believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it conveys an unwavering message of never giving up. The character is determined to overcome every obstacle. I think she's indicating that she'll keep taking the test until she achieves success. That's precisely why the author ends the story with this paragraph - it emphasizes the importance of perseverance and the idea that one should never abandon their goals.
258	9121	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concludes with the line “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author uses this paragraph to conclude the story because it shows that despite failing the driving test on her first attempt, Saeng is determined not to give up until she passes and gets her driver's license. Additionally, the paragraph suggests that Saeng is willing to wait until winter ends and she sees the hibiscus budding, symbolizing a new start and her readiness to retake the test."
259	9122	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author's conclusion is crafted to connect back to the initial conflict of the main character failing her driver's test. By using the line ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again"", the author not only brings the reader back to the core issue but also enables them to foreshadow future events. This sentence informs the reader that the plant, similar to those in her homeland, will assist her in moving forward. Just as the hibiscus makes a new start by budding in the spring, Saeng will do the same by retaking her driver's test. As a result, the author's conclusion prevents the reader from being left confused about the outcome of the driver's test and its significance in the story."
260	9123	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the overall meaning. For instance, when the character returned, she felt a sense of elation because she had come back to where she truly belonged. The line “vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding” implies that coming back was likely the best decision she could have made. This conclusion helps the reader understand the significance of her return and the emotional fulfillment it brought.
261	9124	4	2	It appears that the author chose this ending to incorporate sarcasm and emphasize the point that they would not take the test again. The statement implies that only force, such as someone having to kill them, would make them retake the test. This ending effectively conveys the author's strong stance against taking the test once more.
262	9125	4	2	I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph because the character, Saeng, intends to retake the test when the hibiscus returns. As evidence, in the last paragraph, Saeng silently vows, “when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This shows that the author used this paragraph to foreshadow Saeng's future attempt at the test.
263	9126	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner as it represents a cycle. By not ending at the conclusion of the cycle, the author leaves readers with a sense of curiosity, creating suspense. Overall, both the story and its conclusion are well - crafted, effectively engaging the audience through this strategic ending.
264	9127	4	2	In Minfong Ho's short story “Winter Hibiscus,” a teenage girl fails her driving test but resolves to take it again in the spring. The story ends this way to symbolize the girl's new beginning. For instance, Saeng silently vows, “When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (Ho). The hibiscus connects her to her homeland, and its budding represents a fresh start, which she believes she can also experience. This is the reason for the story's ending.
265	9128	4	2	There are several reasons why the author concluded the story in this way. Firstly, much of the story is written in a serious and straightforward tone. Ending with a quote or riddle makes the reader contemplate the conclusion. Instead of simply ending with a description of what happened, the author added something that encourages deeper thought. The author ended the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because it offers a unique and thought - provoking conclusion.
266	9129	4	2	She intends to practice driving to improve her skills. Once the flower blooms, she will retake the test. Moreover, she is determined to put in more effort next time.
267	9130	4	2	The author includes that particular paragraph to enable the reader to form a mental image rather than lacking a visual representation. If a reader can visualize the content, it indicates effective visualization skills.
268	9131	4	2	The author concludes the work in this way as the character means to attempt to go through an entire season without pining for home. Since she failed in winter, she will try again in spring. One can discern this from her mention of how the plant reminds her of life before moving to the city. For instance, when she smelled the plant, it transported her back to her childhood when the plants grew wild and were beautiful.
269	9132	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes with Saeng silently vowing, “When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This serves as a symbol of hope for the reader. It also provides closure, giving the reader something to anticipate. When the geese return and the hibiscus blooms, Saeng will feel more at ease as she has adapted to the new place and made new acquaintances. The blooming hibiscus will evoke fond memories of her homeland. This will assist Saeng in achieving her goal of passing the test. I believe the author ended the story this way to entice readers to reread it or recommend it to others. I dislike stories that end abruptly without revealing what happens next, but the author addressed this by letting us know that Saeng will try again to pass the test.
270	9133	4	2	The final paragraph of “Winter Hibiscus” states, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author ends the story with this to convey that Saeng has hope and will continue to adapt to her new life in @LOCATION2 @CAPS1. In the story, Saeng realizes she is not as far from her Vietnamese home as she thought. In the florist shops, plants she had forgotten about brought back childhood memories. The plants from her homeland also exist in @LOCATION2. She fails “the test” by buying a winter hibiscus after a bout of homesickness. By the story's end, she recognizes that she is getting used to her new life, like the sight of geese flying overhead. The statement in the last paragraph implies that by spring, she hopes to overcome homesickness and consider @LOCATION2, with its geese and winter hibiscuses, as her home.
271	9134	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate Saeng's newly - found determination. The entire story chronicles Saeng's journey during one afternoon to come to terms with her new home. Thus, it is appropriate to end with Saeng's resolve to pass her driving test and make a life in @LOCATION1. The story explores several elements that make Saeng feel at home, such as the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus. These elements lead Saeng to feel more at ease in her new environment, making it fitting to end with her acceptance of staying in @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 is also inspired by the hibiscus, which is “strong enough to make it through the cold months; that’s what matters.” This reflects Saeng's determination to adapt to her new life. Finally, when Saeng recognizes that life in @LOCATION1 is becoming “familiar” through the geese, it leads @PERSON1 to realize that this is her new home and she cannot go back. The story is replete with events like these that contribute to Saeng's determination, so concluding with her determination is a suitable ending.
272	9135	4	2	The author includes this paragraph at the end of the story because it symbolizes a new beginning. For instance, the family's move to a different country represents a fresh start. When the author mentions the arrival of spring, it symbolizes a new life, which is exactly what Saeng and her mother are embarking on. The snow acts as a blanket over the past and hard times. Additionally, when the hibiscus starts to bud, it also signifies a new beginning. When all these symbols are combined, they show that the hard times fade away as the snow melts, and a new beginning emerges with the arrival of spring and the budding of the flower. This is why the author included this paragraph, as the characters needed a fresh start.
273	9136	4	2	The author chose that sentence as the concluding one because Saeng believes she deserves another opportunity to take the garden test. She had previously failed the test, which disappointed her mother. At the end of the story, Saeng states that she will have more confidence when taking the garden test again. This conclusion reflects Saeng's growth and her determination to improve her situation.
274	9137	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story with the given paragraph because it marks the end of winter. The end of winter often symbolizes the end of a difficult period and the start of something new. This conclusion ties in with the overall theme of the story, perhaps suggesting that the characters are moving on from a challenging time and into a more hopeful phase.
275	9138	4	2	I believe the author ends the story in this way because it evokes a sense of hope and wonder. The story is fundamentally about overcoming challenges. For example, Saeng failed her driving test and was overwhelmed by the concept of “home.” Her concern about failing the test led her to a greenhouse, where she searched for a specific plant that reminded her of home. However, thinking about home and her grandmother made her upset. Saeng is engaged in an internal struggle, and by ending the story this way, the author gives the reader a glimmer of hope for Saeng's future and leaves them with a sense of wonder about what lies ahead for her.
276	9139	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it demonstrates that she will not easily give up after a single failure. Moreover, this paragraph reveals her attempt to develop affection for the country to the best of her ability. She anticipates the arrival of spring when the hibiscus blossoms, which will evoke memories of her homeland and also signify her new life in @LOCATION1.
277	9140	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was unable to obtain a particular plant as it had died. However, with winter over and spring here, she has an opportunity to get that flower. For instance, in the story, it is stated that Saeng broke down and wept, and it was already dusk when she reached home. It is not her fault, as the story mentions that the wind was blowing strongly, tearing off the last remnants of green and chicory weeds. The story concludes with the anticipation that the next time Saeng is seen, she will be holding a beautiful plant.
278	9141	4	2	"I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng wants to finish or retake the test when they return. Additionally, the author is encouraging people not to give up on what they are doing. When she says, ""When the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" she clearly indicates that she will not give up at all."
279	9142	4	2	The author ended the story with that sentence because in spring, Saeng will retake the test, and her hibiscus will finally be in bud. Saeng is going to retake the test because she failed it the first time she attempted it. This is the reason why the author included that sentence at the end of the story.
280	9143	4	2	I think the author wrote this paragraph at the end of the story to symbolize a fresh start. When spring arrives and the hibiscus begins to bud, it will remind her of her homeland, and she will embark on a new attempt at the test. This symbolizes a new beginning for her.
281	9144	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as Saeng has promised to retake the test in spring. When the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will be more confident. “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eye now swept over her.” Saeng feels lonely as she is from a different country and misses all she knew and loved. The hibiscus now serves as a reminder of her home.
282	9145	4	2	The author uses this paragraph to conclude the story, demonstrating that the character, Saeng, was in a process of learning and growth. Initially, Saeng was extremely uneasy and disappointed in herself, saying, “I - I failed the test.” Mrs. Pan Ouvong was silent for a long moment, indicating her initial disappointment. As they talked and started planting, the mood eased. Mrs. Pan Ouvong asked, “How would you like an omelet w/ slices of the bitter melon?” Saeng replied, “I’d love it.” Her mood lightened, and she made a calm, rational decision to try again. Making such a decision when in a good state of mind is more reasonable than when she was upset and distraught.
283	9146	4	2	The story “Winter Hibiscus” has an unusual ending. There are multiple reasons for the author's choice to conclude the story in this way. First, the girl failed the test and fell into silence. When she agreed to retake the test, it signaled her will to survive and her determination to pursue her goal until she achieved it. Finally, the ending could symbolize a new beginning, similar to when the snow melts and winter turns into spring. This is the meaning of the ending of “Winter Hibiscus” and the reason the author concluded it as such.
284	9147	4	2	The author concludes with this sentence to show that Saeng will attempt to adapt to her new home. It indicates that Saeng will no longer grieve and be sad but will adapt and continue with her life. The author includes the line “I mean, not like the kind we had at - at - ”. This occurs when Saeng has just returned home and talked to her mother, and she is very sad as she recalls old memories of her former home. However, the last statement of the story shows that Saeng has decided to move on and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept her new situation, which is why the author concludes the story in this manner.
285	9148	4	2	The author ended the story with that paragraph because the hibiscus represents a source of comfort for Saeng during a time of disappointment. She saw the plant right after she failed her driving test.
286	9149	4	2	Authors commonly employ conclusions to bring a story to a close or to prompt readers to engage in deeper thought. In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author presents the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This conclusion serves to illustrate Saeng's intention to adapt to the new culture. For instance, in the garden shop, Saeng breaks down in tears, as described by “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” It can be inferred that her tears stem from her failure to pass the test and her subsequent doubt about fitting in. Nevertheless, she motivates herself at the story's end to attempt the test once more. In summary, the author uses this paragraph to convey that Saeng will retake the test to integrate into the new world.
287	9150	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way to demonstrate that the protagonist will not give up. The author wants to show that she will retake the test, exert greater effort in the future to overcome her challenges, and persevere. By doing so, the author portrays her as a determined individual who does not quit easily, despite facing conflicts. In conclusion, the author's choice of conclusion effectively conveys the protagonist's resilience and determination.
288	9151	4	2	I wonder why the author ended the story with this particular paragraph. In my opinion, the author did so because it reveals the protagonist's future plans. For example, in the story, the protagonist tells her mom, “I failed…” Meanwhile, as she is planting a flower in a hole near the garden, a flock of geese flies south. This ending provides a glimpse into her current state and future actions. Overall, the author's conclusion effectively sets the stage for the protagonist's future endeavors.
289	9152	4	2	I firmly believe that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it showcases the protagonist's determination to try again. When she says, “Then I will take that test again,” it indicates that she recognizes she has another opportunity. This statement reflects her strong - willed nature and her refusal to give up easily. The message in the last paragraph is clear: if one fails the first time, they should keep trying. Additionally, the text mentions that “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season,” suggesting that she is already undergoing a transformation. I am confident that she will perform excellently in her next attempt.
290	9153	4	2	In my view, the author chose to end the story as such because it highlights the protagonist's determination to pass the test. The test appears to be related to making the garden grow, as evidenced by the statement “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This indicates that the test is associated with the spring season and the budding of flowers, implying that she is attempting to cultivate something. Throughout the story, there are mentions of her assisting her mother in the garden. It seems that when the plants did not grow, she was motivated to try again. Therefore, I believe the author ended the story with the statement about retaking the test in the spring to emphasize her determination and resilience.
291	9154	4	2	The author includes this paragraph as it evokes memories of when Saeng was handling the soil during the “winter hibiscus,” and a flock of Canada geese flew past her. When Saeng failed her test on the first attempt, she did not have the courage to look at her mother. She relied on the hibiscus, which influenced her decision to retake the test, but only after they rebudded. This shows the significance of the hibiscus in her emotional and decision - making process.
292	9155	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to summarize all the elements discussed within the narrative. In the story, there is a focus on springtime, and currently, Saeng and her mother are engaged in flower - planting activities. This ending ties together the story's themes and the characters' present actions.
293	9156	4	2	In my opinion, the author ends the story with this paragraph to convey that she won't give up as long as others don't. I hold this view because the reappearance of the birds and the hibiscus depends on their survival. This implies that just like them, she will remain strong in the meantime. She will adapt to her new surroundings and change to fit into the lifestyle of @CAPS1. This shows her resilience and determination in the face of change.
294	9157	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story in this way because it creates suspense, making readers eager to read the next story to find out if the test is passed. This ending technique effectively piques the readers' curiosity and encourages them to continue exploring the series.
295	9158	4	2	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph as it symbolizes Saeng's decision to persevere and overcome the obstacles in her path. Instead of having her directly say “I will try again next spring,” the author uses this paragraph to demonstrate diction and present her goal or decision in a unique way. For instance, the text states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar now.” Initially, the sight of geese flying in the sky was novel to her, but now she has grown accustomed to it. Perhaps the author is using the geese as a reference, suggesting that just as she got used to the geese, the driving test will become familiar, and she will pass it. Since her family moved from Vietnam to @LOCATION1, Saeng has been adapting to life changes and circumstances. She appears determined to survive and overcome these challenges. The paragraph essentially conveys that she will retake the test next spring, but the author included it to showcase diction by highlighting the geese, representing learning something new, and the hibiscus, symbolizing something familiar. This emphasizes the story's central message of not giving up and the will to survive.
296	9159	4	2	The author has a deep love for plants. After each winter, her endeavor to plant and cultivate beautiful plants commences. The spring @ORGANIZATION1 is the sole @ORGANIZATION1 where one can grow unique plants like she does. Her goal is to cultivate a garden filled with beautiful plants and vegetables. The author will exert great effort, just as her mother did, to bring the gardens to life, especially after winter.
297	9160	4	2	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph because in it, he talks about how beautiful nature is. He also believes that since Saeng loves nature so much, instead of being at home taking care of plants in the garden, she'll go back to school to finish the test. That's why I believe the author chose to conclude with that paragraph; it probably describes how much he likes nature.
298	9161	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concludes the story with a specific paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story revolves around Saeng's failure and shame after failing her driving test. Discovering a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new outlook on life. By purchasing the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home. Just as she was trying to thrive in a new, unfamiliar place, she gave the single hibiscus a similar opportunity. She formed a connection with the plant. Spring represents the start of a new year, and the budding hibiscus signifies the start of its new life. Thus, Saeng wishes to restart her life when the plant does and retake her driving test."
299	9162	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the symbolism within it indicates that ""when everything returns to normal, the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again."" This means she will be ready to move forward and attempt to adapt."
300	9163	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about retaking the test to illustrate that Saeng is becoming more accustomed to @LOCATION2, memories endure, and even the smallest things can hold significant memories. The paragraph shows Saeng's growing adaptation to @LOCATION2 as it reveals her determination not to abandon @LOCATION2 and her commitment to understanding local customs. The hibiscus, representing Vietnam and her home there, demonstrates that memories last forever. It also implies that she can start anew, just as the hibiscus does at her house. Moreover, the hibiscus, symbolizing her home in Vietnam, shows that even the smallest things can hold memories. It evokes many memories for Saeng and aids her in coping with @LOCATION2. This is how the last paragraph conveys Saeng's adaptation to @LOCATION2, the longevity of memories, and the power of small things to hold them.
301	9164	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” penned by Minfong Ho, a teenage girl named Saeng and her family have relocated from Vietnam to the United States. After failing her driver's test, Saeng is walking home. Along the way, she spots a familiar plant and then enters a florist shop to buy it. When she gets home, she tells her mother about the failed test. Naturally, her mother is disappointed, but she still makes dinner. The plant in question is the “winter hibiscus”. At the end of the story, Saeng thinks to herself, “when they come back, in spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. It seems that Saeng decides to retake the test in spring because she now feels confident and content. She has grown comfortable with the plant, and her mother isn't overly angry. She believes that everything will work out and that spring, a time of new beginnings, is the right moment to try again.
302	9165	4	2	The author concludes the story with this line as it demonstrates that the geese drew inspiration from the flower to return, persevere, and not give up. For instance, Saeng made a silent vow to herself: “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This quote indicates that the hibiscus was the source of her determination. Just like the geese and the hibiscus, she will come back. That is why the author chose to end the story with this line, aiming to show Saeng's inspiration and her refusal to quit.
303	9166	4	2	In my opinion, in the short - story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ends with that paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination to pass. Saeng silently vowed, “When they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.” This shows her determination because geese migrate annually and flowers bud every year. She will keep trying, just as the geese and the hibiscus follow their natural cycles. She is determined to pass the test and integrate into her new environment. If she lacked determination, she might never succeed in passing the test and fitting into the new society.
304	9167	4	2	I firmly believe that the author ends the story with this sentence to showcase how Saeng overcomes emotional obstacles and how the hibiscus plant symbolizes hope for the future. At the start of the story, Saeng is distraught over failing her driver's test, and seeing the native plants of her homeland further upsets her. As the story states, “When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub.” This quote reveals that these plants remind her of her beloved homeland, which holds great significance for her. By bringing the plant home, it's as if she's bringing a piece of her homeland with her. The quote “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” shows that Saeng has regained hope in her life. This is a significant turning point that will likely make her happier in her new life in the United States. That's why the author ended the story with this sentence.
305	9168	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way because Saeng is not yet ready to move forward with her life. She believes that when the natural cycle restarts, she will take the test and progress. Until the flowers are gone, she won't worry about school. For example, the author wrote, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, like geese.” This implies that Saeng has become accustomed to change and has accepted her current situation.
306	9169	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with that statement because the snow does not melt in spring, the geese do not return in winter, and the hibiscus does not bud until spring. The hibiscus is a beautiful plant that Saeng adored. This connection between Saeng and the hibiscus likely influenced the author's choice of ending.
307	9170	4	2	The entire story of Saeng purchasing the hibiscus stems from her failure in the driving test, which deeply crushed her. She yearns to be reminded of her homeland, where she didn't need to pass driving lessons. So, she visits a greenhouse to find plants similar to those from her native land, hoping to feel better. However, even in the warm, moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng breaks down and cries. The hibiscus offers her hope and memories of her old country. Her mother, noticing this, doesn't scold Saeng for spending $20 on the plant and instead says she's glad Saeng got it, as she knows it comforts her daughter. By getting the hibiscus, they are essentially planting Saeng's hope to grow, not only to pass the driving test but also to succeed in the new country. The story ends with those lines because Saeng decides that if the hibiscus can grow, so can she. She will face the driving test with hope and support, having adapted to the new environment, just as the hibiscus, though not from her old country, can adapt and grow in the new one.
308	9171	4	2	The author aims to convey that Saeng will never give up, and her confidence will increase, enabling her to retake the test, much like the hibiscus in spring. The comparison of Saeng to the hibiscus plant in the last paragraph is intended to illustrate how she will grow and be ready to take the test again at the appropriate time. The melting snow symbolizes the fading of her sorrows, while the sun represents her success and growth, similar to the hibiscus plant she bought. The plant growing in the sunlight represents her confidence to take the test next time, getting rid of the cold, brisk snow, which is akin to her negative self - esteem and attitude. By comparing Saeng to the plant in the last paragraph, the author shows how it relates to her life and attitude and how her life will change as a result of the hibiscus plant.
309	9172	4	2	The author concludes her story with this paragraph as it effectively showcases Saeng's determination and perseverance. It also reveals a great deal about her character and concludes the story on a powerful note. This is the reason why the author chose to end the story in this way.
310	9173	4	2	When the snow melts and the geese return, it indicates that spring is approaching. This natural phenomenon serves as a clear sign of the changing seasons and the arrival of a new, more vibrant time of the year.
311	9174	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as she felt ready for the new test. After failing the linear driver test and walking home, she spots a familiar plant. Subsequently, she visits a florist shop to check if the plant is available for purchase. She decides to retake the test as she believes she is confident enough to pass it the next time.
312	9175	4	2	The author concludes the text with this statement to illustrate the courage the girl, Saeng, exhibits in immigrating to @LOCATION1. After failing her driver's test, Saeng felt defeated and worthless. Her mother, understanding her situation, did not scold her for buying the flower. Instead, she planted the flower to show Saeng that things would eventually work out. When Saeng saw her mother doing this, she was filled with determination and took over the planting. Immigrating to a new country is arduous, and many immigrants face daily challenges. Saeng's mother endured the cold to plant the flower, making the best of her circumstances. Inspired by her mother, Saeng realized she could also make the most of her situation. This is why Saeng decides to retake the driver's test and adopt the same positive attitude as her mother.
313	9176	4	2	They can compare the story and the statement because in the story, the protagonist does not give up, and the same applies to the person taking the test. The individual taking the test again did not surrender and is willing to attempt it once more. This shows a parallel in the theme of perseverance between the story and the test - taker's situation.
314	9177	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph in a spirit of hope. The conclusion implies that over time, Saeng will overcome her previous failure and be better prepared for the second attempt at the test. The text indicates that Saeng has noticed that many things she once considered strange have now become somewhat familiar, which is a sign of progress. This suggests that Saeng is growing and adapting, increasing her chances of success in the upcoming test.
315	9178	4	2	"Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate the transformation in Saeng's heart and her attitude towards her new life in @LOCATION1. Spring, which symbolizes rebirth, is not included in the text by accident. It represents Saeng's time of renewal, when she can take the test and start afresh in her new life in @LOCATION1. The mention of ""When the snow melts"" is significant as winter symbolizes death, and as the snow melts, so will Saeng's fears, allowing her to embrace a new beginning."
316	9179	4	2	In spring, the snows melt, and the grass, though initially muddy, provides a delightful environment for pigs that relish wallowing in mud. Consider a muddy ford and observe the transformation winter brings. Notice the trees as they regain their leaves and come back to life. It truly is a good life.
317	9180	4	2	The author concluded the last paragraph with the story to demonstrate that the protagonist, Saeng, has not given up. This is evident from the mention “overhead...geese...honk...familiar to Saeng now” in the second - last paragraph. When Saeng buys the hibiscus, it serves as a vessel of memories from home, motivating her to persevere. Moreover, her mother making an “omelet with slices of bitter melon” makes her eyes water, reminding her of home and instilling hope that keeps her from giving up.
318	9181	4	2	Saeng has a deep love for flowers and plants. The author concludes the relevant paragraph with a story as it aligns with the overall narrative. In spring, when the snow melts, Saeng eagerly awaits the end of winter to see the plants and flowers again. She values plants and takes pleasure in planting them. The author includes this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's profound affection for plants. She can hardly wait for the new winter break to end.
319	9182	4	2	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to showcase Saeng's connection to the plant that evokes memories of her home. This connection is significant as it demonstrates how individuals can find ways to cope with life's changes. Saeng achieves this by purchasing and planting the hibiscus plant. Seeing the plant reminds her of home and also motivates her to retake the test she failed in the spring when the flower begins to bud.
320	9183	4	2	Since she is confused and not yet accustomed to the country she is in, she struggles to concentrate on her test. However, she believes that once the flower blooms, she will feel more at home. With this sense of familiarity, she thinks she will perform better on the test.
321	9184	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as the hibiscus brings her comfort. She states, ""When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" As the story reveals that the author failed the test, she will find solace in retaking it when the hibiscus reappears after the snow season."
322	9185	4	2	The author concludes the story by stating that she will attempt to pass the test when the geese return in spring. This reflects the idea of perseverance, suggesting that if one fails initially, they should keep trying. Additionally, the author's conclusion indicates that Saeng has been in @LOCATION2 for several years and still misses her home in Vietnam.
323	9186	4	2	She believes she will pass the test in spring because everything comes back to life. Flowers begin to grow, trees turn green, the geese return, animals emerge, and people go to the beach to relax. This might be what she wants to experience as well.
324	9187	4	2	The author most likely concludes the story with the quote due to renewed hope. She was extremely upset after failing the driving test. Seeing the hibiscus flower made her more emotional as it reminded her of home. However, when she saw the geese after planting the flower, she decided to retake the test next spring.
325	9188	4	2	"The author concludes the story with the statement, ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to illustrate Saeng's growth. As another year passes, Saeng will become more at ease with her situation and be ready for a fresh start, just like the blooming and budding plants. Failing the driver's test deeply upset Saeng. By waiting a year, she can practice more and improve. When she retakes the test, having had time to practice and start anew, she will be a better driver. The hibiscus plant is familiar to Saeng, allowing her to relate to it. As the plant buds and starts fresh, so will Saeng. This is why the author concluded the story with that phrase."
326	9189	4	2	I believe the author included this paragraph in the story because it is logical that the geese return home after the snow melts. Around this time, Saeng also attempts to take her test again. This sequence of events adds a sense of natural rhythm and hope to the narrative, suggesting that new beginnings are possible even after setbacks.
327	9190	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the story with the line ""When they come back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This ending indicates that Saeng is willing to adapt to her new environment but acknowledges that she requires more time. Throughout the story, Saeng struggles to adjust to moving from her home to an unfamiliar place hundreds of miles away. She clings to her old memories, but in @LOCATION1, everything is different. Even a familiar plant she buys is not as she expected, which makes her angry. However, by the end, she realizes that difference is not always negative and vows to accept the new culture, understanding that full acceptance will take time."
328	9191	4	2	"The author concludes the story with that ending paragraph because in spring, she will try again. While reading the story, it is revealed that Saeng's mother asked her ""What happened?"" and Saeng replied, ""I - I failed the test."" I predict that her mother will assist her more with studying and gardening. When the snow melts, Saeng vows to work harder and pass the test. This shows her determination to overcome her setback and make a fresh start."
329	9192	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is the time when she will retake the test. Additionally, the geese made her realize that many things she once considered strange have become familiar, just like the geese through the repeated cycle of seasons. This realization adds depth to the story, suggesting that with time and experience, one can adapt to new and initially unfamiliar situations.
330	9193	4	2	The author ends the story with that paragraph because it represents a new beginning. When the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, it symbolizes a restart, allowing her to confront her memories of home and her adaptation to the new country. I believe she will handle these challenges better and retake the test, demonstrating her refusal to give up. This ending leaves a positive impression, showing that growth and resilience are possible even in the face of difficulties.
331	9194	4	2	She stated that her failure to keep the tropical plant alive made her disappointed in herself. As a result, she said that in spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus starts budding, she will take the test again. After her failure, her mother comforted her, saying it was okay and that she could always try again.
332	9195	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story with the given paragraph because she is both telling the reader and reminding herself to work in the garden once more to see if it piques her interest. I believe this is the author's intention as at the start of the story, she showed no interest in the garden or the world around her. For instance, when she was supposed to buy only garden seeds, she used some of her mother's money to buy herself a Big Mac. In conclusion, I think what I've written clearly explains how the author feels and why she ended the story in that way.
333	9196	4	2	The author concludes the story with the line “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because Saeng previously failed the test and now aims to pass it. On that day, she learned a great deal from her mother, which completely transformed her attitude towards life.
334	9197	4	2	The author likely concluded the story with that sentence to show that the girl still cares about the test rather than just a plant that will eventually die. Also, since she needs to pass the test, the author implies that in the end, the girl will pass and won't have to retake it. Moreover, the author wants us to understand that life isn't all about expensive things; instead, school is more important than anything else.
335	9198	4	2	Minfong Ho, the author of “Winter Hibiscus,” ended the story with the last paragraph because in the story, the girl took a test (the nature of which is unknown) and failed. She then returned with a saebba hedge, a tamed plant that the family, who are newcomers from Vietnam to @LOCATION1, loves. She went for her driving test and came home having failed. Her mother asked why she spent so much money on the plant when she could have bought a Big Mac, their favorite fast - food sandwich. The daughter brought back the plant because she felt she had failed her parents on the driving test. She wants to try again and says, “Then the snow will melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return to take the test again.” She believes that next time, she will pass the test, avoid shame, and make her parents proud. In Vietnam, few people drive, and it is a high honor for the family for their daughter to achieve this.
336	9199	4	2	After recently relocating from Vietnam, Saeng is clearly grappling with homesickness. However, as time progresses, she will learn to strike a balance between her affection for her new country and her homeland. As the story unfolds, it becomes evident that Saeng yearns for memories of her homeland while also starting to discover new things to enjoy in her new home. For instance, while the hibiscus flower evokes nostalgic memories, she is fascinated by new experiences such as eating Big @CAPS1 and making new friends. Although homesickness has presented challenges, she is aware that with time, she will be able to overcome the hurdle of leaving behind the old ways for the new, without completely forsaking either. She is confident that by spring, she will surmount this obstacle and have the self - assurance to face any future challenges.
337	9200	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to illustrate a sense of change in her. As Saeng's mother mentioned, winter is harsh, but spring is when everything comes to life. This symbolizes the transformation in Saeng. Even though winter is tough and one might feel buffeted by the wind, when spring arrives, she will retake the test, emerge anew, and learn to appreciate the @LOCATION1, despite being far from the familiar rain. I believe the author made the right choice in concluding the story with that vow as it effectively captures Saeng's journey of growth.
338	9201	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the idea that whenever someone leaves their home, they often have a longing to return. The hibiscus flower serves as a powerful reminder of Saeng's home in Vietnam, and it is where her heart truly lies. Saeng failed her driver's test and declared that she would retake it when the geese return. The plant reminds her of home, yet as she says, “Not like the tird we had before” (Ho). This indicates that she believes the ones in Vietnam are superior, and her longing to go back is fueled by her deep - seated nostalgia.
339	9202	4	2	Saeng is discussing how flowers will return in the spring. She vows to retake the test once the snow has melted. The description “The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing” portrays the harshness of the current season. Saeng can hardly wait for spring to arrive so that she can attempt to plant again. This shows her hope and determination to start anew when the more favorable season comes.
340	9203	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that when things return to a better state, Saeng will attempt everything anew. She desires a change from the way things used to be. By ending the story this way, the author emphasizes Saeng's hope for a different and improved future, highlighting her determination to make things better.
341	9204	4	2	The character Saeng appears to have a strong affinity for nature. When spring arrives, she remarks that a new natural cycle will commence, and this fills her with motivation to retake the test she previously failed. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to suggest that there is hope for Saeng. She will take the necessary steps to feel at ease in her new home country. The entire narrative details her dissatisfaction with her new environment, but this is contrasted with the prospect of new opportunities and a fresh start, symbolized by the arrival of spring.
342	9205	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to imply that by this point, Saeng may become comfortable in her new home. I can relate to this as when I moved, I initially disliked the new place because I had few friends. However, after a year or two, I adjusted well as I made many friends. Similarly, Saeng misses her old home; she often talks about it and cries. For instance, when she saw a plant that was also in her old home, she started crying due to the nostalgia. In conclusion, this is the reason the author included this part at the end of the story.
343	9206	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author included a significant part at the end where Saeng made a vow. The reason she made this vow is that when everything in her life restarts, she will once again love her life and become a much happier person. This shows that despite her current circumstances, there is hope for a more positive future for Saeng.
344	9207	4	2	The author included this part in the story as it shows what the character has to do after facing a failure. Just as the character has to take action to overcome her set - back, in this story, it is clear what she must do, perhaps taking inspiration from the geese. This inclusion helps to drive the narrative forward and shows the character's path to recovery and progress.
345	9208	4	2	I firmly believe that the author chose to end the story with that paragraph because it symbolizes new beginnings and the chance to start afresh. When Saeng fails her driving test, she experiences a moment of vulnerability and loneliness. Then, she spots a plant that reminds her of her home in Vietnam, and this plant offers her comfort. As her mother says, “It’s flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” This quote shows that like the flower, which is out of place yet has the courage to grow, Saeng can also find the strength to face her fears. In the closing paragraph, Saeng decides that, similar to the flower and the birds, she will gather the courage to retake the tests, signifying her determination to move forward.
346	9209	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with the given paragraph to convey her determination not to give up and to show this resolve to her mother as well.
347	9210	4	2	I believe that the author was suggesting a new start. I come to this conclusion because everything is coming back. Additionally, Saeng now understands what is important and will treat it seriously. This is what I think the author was trying to convey at the end of the story.
348	9211	4	2	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, a young girl named Saeng and her mother move to a new place, and Saeng struggles to adapt. Saeng discovers a dok faeng - noi plant that reminds her of home, so she buys it and takes it home to show her mother. Initially, her mother is upset about the $NUM1 plant purchase. However, upon seeing her daughter's self - disappointment, she finds joy in the plant while cooking dinner. Saeng plants the beautiful plant and decides that when the geese return, the hibiscus buds, and spring arrives, she will retake the test. She finds the inner strength and courage to improve. I think the author intended to show how Saeng gained self - respect by the end of the passage, which is why the story concludes in this way.
349	9212	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it encapsulates the main idea. The story is about how Saeng misses home and fails the test after buying the hibiscus. She fails because she allows herself to be drawn to the flower and recall her home, which makes her sad. In the last paragraph, Saeng says that when the geese return in spring, she will have adjusted to the new country and home and won't fail the test. She realizes that if tempted by something from home, she won't take it as it will cause her sadness. This conclusion shows her process of getting used to the new home, which is the core of the story.
350	9213	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” written by Minfong Ho, the author uses the concluding paragraph to summarize the entire story. Moreover, it is also used to leave the reader with a sense of wonder.
351	9214	4	2	The author concludes the story by having Saeng silently vow to herself, “When they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This demonstrates that despite failing the test, Saeng refuses to give up. She is determined to persevere and continue her efforts. The ending effectively showcases the determination within Saeng's heart. Even after failing the test and disappointing her grandmother, she has the resolve to keep trying, both for her grandmother and herself. I truly appreciate this ending and am glad the author chose to use it in the story.
352	9215	4	2	Saeng was deeply upset after failing the driver's test. To make matters worse, she had to move to a new country, and the loss of her grandmother compounded her distress. In the story, the hibiscus plant serves as a powerful symbol. It represents Saeng's life and evokes memories of her life in Vietnam. As she sees these flowers, memories flood back, revealing her innermost feelings. The story is all about starting anew and overcoming obstacles. When Saeng says, “... and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it indicates her readiness to begin afresh and endure the difficult times, symbolized by winter. The hibiscus is a symbol of herself and the hardships she will overcome, signifying her resilience and hope for a better future.
353	9216	4	2	In the story, the author concludes in the last paragraph by showing that despite her hardships, Saeng perseveres and attempts to lead a normal life after moving. For instance, when it states, “Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring I will take the test again,” it illustrates that even after a single failure, one should never give up. At the same time, it's important not to forget the past. This ending conveys a valuable lesson about resilience and the importance of learning from past experiences while moving forward.
354	9217	4	2	Minfong Ho, the author of “Winter Hibiscus,” concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author writes, “When they come back … in the spring … then I will take that test again.” Through this, Saeng silently resolves to move forward in the spring, demonstrating her ability to overcome the setback of failing the test. The narrative also mentions, “... in the spring … when … this hibiscus is budding …” Spring symbolizes a fresh start, and a budding flower represents the beginning of a new life. Similarly, Saeng decides to start anew by taking the test in the spring. Additionally, the story shows that Saeng adapts to her new life by purchasing a familiar hibiscus plant, which helps her through disappointing times. The geese also serve as a reminder of the similarities between her new home and the place she left behind. Minfong Ho uses this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's ability to adapt to her new circumstances.
355	9218	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to convey that the character is going to take the test again and make an attempt. She likens herself to the flowers, understanding that she needs time. Just as the flowers need time to bud, she will wait until the right moment to take the test. This ending shows that she is patient and determined, willing to bide her time and make a fresh start when the conditions are right.
356	9219	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrative concludes with Saeng promising herself to retake the test in spring. The author likely ends the story this way to illustrate Saeng's process of overcoming sorrow. When Saeng says “I - I failed the test (@NUM1)”, it reveals the sadness brought by @CAPS2 leaving her homeland. However, she then vows to herself, stating “…in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (pg @NUM2). This shows her determination to move forward, getting over her sorrow and being ready to face the test once more.
357	9220	4	2	The author concludes the story with the line “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, when the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again”. By doing so, the author demonstrates how Saeng gradually adapts to change while still cherishing her roots. The use of symbols, with geese representing the new home and sounds she must adjust to, and the hibiscus symbolizing old memories of her past and homeland, shows that she has come to accept both places. Saeng's commitment to retaking the test in spring indicates her readiness for change, as the test represents her feelings towards @LOCATION1. Passing the test allows her to embrace the change in her life and adjust accordingly.
358	9221	4	2	The reason for using this sentence is that she desires to see the flower bud, which makes her feel at home again. At that point, she will take the test. Moreover, she will feel lucky and be reminded of home, which is why Saeng silently vows to herself. This shows that the sight of the budding flower is a significant trigger for her to face the test with a positive mindset, as it connects her to her sense of home and good fortune.
359	9222	4	2	The author ends the story with the sentence “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The story details the numerous hardships and obstacles Saeng has endured, with the two major ones being moving to a new place and failing her arrival test. Saeng struggled to overcome these and other difficulties. I believe this sentence was placed at the end so that readers could see that she would be okay and overcome all that had happened. We now know that this special plant will assist Saeng in dealing with future problems, as it symbolizes hope and resilience for her.
360	9223	4	2	After reading the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I am convinced that the quote “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” was included for a purpose. This quote concludes the story as it sets a tone of hope. For instance, in the story, it is stated that “Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the plant into it”, indicating the plant's great significance to her. The story reveals that the plant holds memories of her grandmother. It represents hope for Saeng as it evokes happy memories, motivating her to better cope with her loss. Thus, the quote concludes the story as it reflects Saeng's longing for hope and peace. It symbolizes that when the plant blooms in spring, she will gain a new sense of hope and happiness.
361	9224	4	2	"Winter Hibiscus,"" penned by Minfong Ho, is a narrative centered around a character's transition to @LOCATION1 and her discovery of inner strength. Saeng experienced disappointment when she failed her driver's test and walked home dejectedly. On her way, she halted at a florist shop upon spotting a plant that reminded her of the one from her homeland. The sight of this plant triggered a flood of memories from her native land. Once she arrived home, she planted the plant and resolved to retake the driving test when the geese returned. The plant served as a source of encouragement for her, symbolizing hope and resilience in the face of change."
362	9225	4	2	The author concludes the story with the given paragraph as the narrative revolved around the protagonist's adaptation to the cyclical nature of things in the natural world. By adding the last paragraph stating that she will repeat her actions when everything recurs, the author ties up the theme of acceptance and continuity. This conclusion effectively encapsulates the story's essence, highlighting the character's understanding and embrace of the repetitive patterns in life.
363	9226	4	2	In my opinion, the author includes that part because she might have faced setbacks and requires additional time to study and master @NUM1. Other than that, it could be a way to introduce new elements or challenges that the character needs to overcome. This addition might contribute to the development of the plot and the character's growth, making the story more engaging and relatable.
364	9227	4	2	The author employs this sentence to conclude the story in order to illustrate the restoration of Saeng's hope. Throughout the narrative, Saeng is depicted as sorrowful and nostalgic for her homeland. She feels a sense of hopelessness in the unfamiliar new land. The hibiscus plant, however, serves as a powerful reminder of home, evoking memories of her time with her grandmother. These memories initially make her long to return home but ultimately inspire her to persevere. The inclusion of the geese leaving also symbolizes the universal experience of leaving one's home. The hibiscus, therefore, represents Saeng's strength and her ability to endure the challenges of moving to a strange land.
365	9228	4	2	I am of the opinion that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng will not give up and will continue to persevere. Throughout the story, the memories of her old country act as a driving force, encouraging her to be strong. For instance, the flower initially brought sadness but ultimately had a positive impact on her. At the beginning, Saeng struggled to accept the new changes and yearned for home. However, by the end, she found that some of the cherished memories from her past were present in her new country. These factors lead me to believe that the author chose this conclusion to emphasize Saeng's resilience and the power of memories in helping one adapt to new circumstances.
366	9229	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" I am of the opinion that the author concluded the story with that particular paragraph. It serves to illustrate that if the hibiscus plant possesses sufficient strength to recover and thrive, then the protagonist has the strength to retake the test. For instance, the story states, ""but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months,"" which clearly indicates the plant's resilience. Saeng perceives this and realizes that just as the plant can bounce back after a harsh winter, she can rebound from her test failure. Overall, I firmly believe that both Saeng and the hibiscus plants exhibit remarkable strength."
367	9230	4	2	"In this story, it depicts the similarities between Saeng and the hibiscus plant in terms of adapting to their surroundings. Just as the hibiscus endures and continues to grow, Saeng shows the same perseverance with her ""test."" When she says, ""Then I will take that test again,"" it's a clear indication that she, like the plant, will thrive once more. In conclusion, Saeng truly mirrors the plant. She will persevere through many seasons to come and adapt to changes, much like the resilient hibiscus."
368	9231	4	2	The author chose to end the story with the last paragraph as spring arrives and the geese return. This natural cycle symbolizes renewal and a fresh start. The character will likely feel better about herself during this time, enabling her to retake the test with a more focused mindset. As the season changes and nature rejuvenates, it gives her the motivation and confidence to approach the test again, with a greater chance of success.
369	9232	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the story with that specific paragraph as it aligns seamlessly with the narrative. In the story, Saeng goes in search of the plant that reminds her of her grandma. Upon finding it, memories of her grandma flood her mind, and she breaks down in tears. I believe she was testing herself to see if she had moved on from her past, but unfortunately, she failed. Hence, I think she bought the plant as a symbol of hope, intending to try again when the plant is in full bloom, signifying a new beginning and a chance for personal growth."
370	9233	4	2	He desires to learn the spirits of the hibiscus. One should not be afraid of failure. Instead, one must keep moving forward and continuously pursue what they want, and then success will follow. The hibiscus showcases strong vitality by battling against the environment. The author uses this paragraph to conclude the story, with the intention of suggesting that Saeng will retake the test. Just as the hibiscus will bud when spring arrives, Saeng will also have a new start and an opportunity to achieve success.
371	9234	4	2	In the spring, when the hibiscus starts to bud, Saeng silently vowed to herself that she would take the test. It is believed that the author concluded the story with this paragraph as she intended to test the characters once again.
372	9235	4	2	The author chose to end the story in this manner because it mirrored the beginning. At the start, the little girl was observing the flowers and plants. Thus, the author considered it fitting to conclude the story in a similar vein. Additionally, Saeng's friendship with the plants and flowers will be re - established in the spring when everything is in full bloom and looking beautiful. The plants offer a sense of comfort during her difficult times. This is the reason the author ends the story with Saeng and the plants.
373	9236	4	2	In Ho's “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with a significant paragraph. The author aims to convey a message to Saeng. When Saeng saw the geese “slowly fading into the distance,” she related it to herself. She thought that “when they come back,” she too would return to school. The phrase “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” implies that Saeng will return to school as a new person. “This hibiscus is budding” indicates that Saeng, like the hibiscus, is still growing. She will take the test again because it represents a new start and a fresh beginning for her. Spring, as an archetype of rebirth and new life, suggests that just as the flowers grow and have a new life, so will Saeng.
374	9237	4	2	Saeng made a vow to herself. When the hibiscus starts to bud again, she will retake the test. The hibiscus symbolizes hope for Saeng, suggesting that a second attempt can lead to a positive outcome. The author concludes the story with this vow as it represents Saeng's last glimmer of hope. For instance, the hibiscus comforted her in a new country with unfamiliar surroundings and also reflects her emotions. Saeng's vow shows her determination not to give up despite failing the first time. As the quote “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral” (Ho) reveals, it explains the deep significance the plant held for her. This is the reason the story concludes with Saeng's vow.
375	9238	4	2	The author ends the story with this paragraph to showcase Saeng's determination. Her family left many things behind in Vietnam. She carried the memories of her grandmother and the hibiscus. In the new location, they are facing difficulties, as indicated by the mother's reaction to the cost. The hibiscus she bought was a source of comfort. Saeng believes that if the plant can endure the harsh winter environment, she can persevere despite the differences in the new place. Passing the driver's exam is a common achievement and a way for her to adapt to her surroundings and fit in.
376	9239	4	2	The author concludes the story with this sentence as it demonstrates that the girl is willing to overcome obstacles. Despite having failed once in @MONTH1, she will persevere. Moreover, it shows a connection between the geese, the hibiscus, and the girl's desire to surmount her challenges. Additionally, the girl wishes to overcome her obstacle at a specific time.
377	9240	4	2	In the last paragraph, she stated that she would retake the test in spring when the snow melts and the hibiscus buds. She makes this statement because spring is her favorite time of the year, and she will feel more confident then. For instance, when she mentions the Madagascar hibiscus growing through bricks, it's evident she loves hibiscuses. So, she wants to take the test when she feels at her best.
378	9241	4	2	In my opinion, the author concluded the story with that paragraph to convey to readers that Saeng is a survivor, much like the hibiscus. Saeng has yet to fully adapt to America, and this plant reminds her of home.
379	9242	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way because spring represents a new beginning. Since Saeng failed the test, she wants to start afresh in spring, similar to how flowers do. Knowing that the hibiscus will regrow despite currently withering, spring is a time for renewal, when babies are born, flowers bloom, and a new start is taking shape.
380	9243	4	2	The author concludes the sentence in this manner to show that Saeng is a highly determined girl. No matter how many times she fails, she keeps trying until she succeeds. By doing so, the author reveals what Saeng believes in: regardless of how large or difficult the challenge, she will persevere until she finishes what she started. Moving was extremely hard for her; she had trouble communicating with others and making friends as being new isn't easy. However, as time passed, she got used to it. The author is trying to convey that as long as one tries, they can achieve success.
381	9244	4	2	In the story, a young girl named Saeng took a test but failed. She plans to retake it next spring. This is reflected in the last paragraph where Saeng silently vows to herself, “When the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding in the spring, then I will take the test again.” The story mentions hibiscus flowers, and instead of simply stating she'll retake the test next spring, it ties the event to the budding of the hibiscus flowers, which occurs in spring.
382	9245	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way to convey to readers that the daughter, Saeng, will return to take the test again. Since Saeng loves the garden, she will not forget the positive impact spring has had on her, thus motivating her to retake the test.
383	9246	4	2	The text indicates that she has a deep - seated love for her plants. The story details all the plants and elaborates on her fondness for them. She perceives each plant as unique and finds more enjoyment in her plants than in school or other aspects of her life.
384	9247	4	2	"Minfong Ho concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to showcase Saeng's determination to succeed in her new country despite the obstacles. The winter hibiscus serves as a symbol, reminding Saeng to be strong, just as the hibiscus endures the winter. The text states, ""....but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus...."" (Ho @NUM1). Saeng realizes she must be ""strong"" like the ""winter hibiscus."" She also notices that she is beginning to adapt to the new country, as she writes, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become almost familiar..."" (Ho @NUM1). Knowing she can adapt, Saeng is determined to succeed. The author concludes with, ""..in the spring, the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" (Ho @NUM1), suggesting that spring will bring new opportunities for Saeng."
385	9248	4	2	In Minfong Ho's story @ORGANIZATION1, the author concludes with the last paragraph to imply that when the flower comes back to life and starts anew, Saeng will also embark on a new beginning by retaking the test. For instance, “Look how root - bound it is, poor thing” shows that the plant was on the verge of dying when she bought it. Similarly, “I - I failed the test” reveals her disappointment at failing. Just as the flower reached its “breaking point,” so did Saeng. The paragraph shows that Saeng will take a break and wait for the flower to regain strength before retaking the test.
386	9249	4	2	The author included the last paragraph as Saeng's vow allows the reader to understand Saeng and her pain, along with her optimism that circumstances will improve. The vow can be interpreted as indicating that when life returns to normal, her situation in this new country will significantly improve. Spring represents normalcy as her homeland, which she perceives as normal, is adorned with beautiful flowers, similar to spring. The melting snow symbolizes the fading of pain, and the return of geese signifies that Saeng is aware that things will get better, just as she knows the geese will return in spring. The hibiscus in the story symbolizes her home and grandmother, which stand for happiness, so she will be happier when things improve.
387	9250	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this sentence as the young girl, Saeng, desires to retake the test and also hopes that her hibiscus will remain strong and continue to grow. Thus, she declares, ""I will take the test again when my hibiscus starts to bloom again."" This shows her connection between the growth of the hibiscus and her readiness to face the test once more."
388	9251	4	2	"Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho delves into an individual's pursuit of acceptance and adaptation to life - changing circumstances. In the story, Saeng, a young girl who has recently moved from her Asian homeland to America, fails a test. Afterward, she spends a considerable amount of money on a flower. When consoling with her mother, Saeng silently makes a vow to herself: ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". @CAPS1 Ho ends the story in this manner as it represents the journey of adaptation. Saeng's vow demonstrates her acceptance of her new home in America, despite always remembering her homeland."
389	9252	4	2	The author concludes this paragraph in the article because Ron is infatuated with the plant and uses it as a sort of clock to determine when she can take the driver's test. If one is not a @CAPS1.S citizen, they can only take the driver's test once a year. This connection between the plant and the test - taking time is a significant aspect of the story's conclusion.
390	9253	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng wishes to do something beneficial for herself. In the last paragraph, it states that ""Saeng vowed silently to herself"", which implies that she is seeking what is best for her. This self - directed vow shows her determination to take positive steps for her own well - being."
391	9254	4	2	"Saeng, after failing her driving test, believes that this setback will hinder her transition to a new country as she embarks on a search for her past. She discovers her past through plants, deeply sorrowfully recalling Vietnam. The narration describes, ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes..."" She remembers and yearns for everything she once had - her country, her grandmother, and her former life. She returns home to her mother with a plant, disappointing her mother with the cost, yet her mother understands her pain. The narration quotes, ""It's a beautiful plant,"" she finally said sadly, ""you got it."" Eventually, Saeng realizes how this plant has affected her and how easily it has survived. She makes a promise to herself, as the narration states, ""and if this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."
392	9255	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with the line, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This ending emphasizes that if the hibiscus, a plant that reminds Saeng of her home, can endure, so can she. After failing her driving test and walking home, seeing the flowers connected her to her past and made her feel less alone. For instance, when the author writes, ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her,"" it shows her longing for home. The flower allowed her to connect deeply with her memories. Also, when she says, ""like the geese in the distinctive V against the sky,"" it implies that just as the geese move to a new place to start afresh, she too can adapt over time. In conclusion, the ending further emphasizes Saeng's feelings towards her hometown and her new place of residence."
393	9256	4	2	"The author concludes the story by drawing comparisons to the concepts of adaptation, change, and starting anew. For example, geese fly away when it gets cold but always return, giving their home another chance. The hibiscus is another prime example; it buds at a certain time each year and endures the winter without dying, always making a comeback. Saeng has clearly recognized this and has vowed to retake her driver's test, believing it might be successful this time. The author aims to convey the message of ""don't give up."" By using these natural examples, the author encourages readers to persevere in the face of challenges, just as the geese and the hibiscus do."
394	9257	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with the given paragraph for several reasons, including determination, help, and strength. First, determination is a key factor. Saeng failed her driver's test initially but is determined to wait and try again. She is willing to take different steps to pass the test. Second, help plays a role. Saeng believes that the hibiscus plant will assist her in passing the test and in achieving other things. The author is showing that Saeng will return, prepared and ready. Finally, strength is the last reason. Saeng thinks the hibiscus plant will give her the strength to pass the test. The author ends with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng will go back, stronger than before. These are the reasons why I believe the author chose this paragraph to conclude the story.
395	9258	4	2	"Mingfong Ho concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with the paragraph, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This ending indicates that Saeng will not give up in her struggle to adapt to the new environment. Saeng has faced difficult times, such as moving to the United States and failing her driver's test. In the greenhouse, she even breaks down and cries. The hibiscus flower she bought cost the family a significant amount of money, but it holds great importance for Saeng. It represents hope. When the flower buds again, it will be the right time for her to take the driver's test. Additionally, the flower symbolizes adapting to a new place, as Saeng adapts to the United States while the hibiscus adapts to the new garden. Overall, this ending effectively portrays Saeng's resilience and hope for a better future."
396	9259	4	2	The author concludes the story with a specific paragraph to illustrate Saeng's transformation. Initially, Saeng was reluctant to take the test and lacked confidence. Throughout the story, Saeng's mother provided unwavering support, even understanding when Saeng spent @MONEY1 on a plant that reminded her of home. After receiving comfort, Saeng feels more at ease and is now prepared and more confident to retake the test. Evidently, Saeng has undergone a significant change.
397	9260	4	2	The author concludes the story with the line “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This ending serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it conveys the message of maintaining faith. Saeng experienced homesickness throughout the story, which may have affected her performance on the driving test. By waiting a season or two, her homesickness is likely to subside, allowing her to focus on achieving her goal. The longing for her grandmother and her home in Vietnam might have had a substantial impact on her test - taking ability. Secondly, the author may have intended to lighten the mood. Saeng's breakdown in the greenhouse was melancholic, and her self - vow to retake the test in spring raises hopes for her future success.
398	9261	4	2	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to convey that the protagonist was unable to concentrate on the test due to her strong desire to return to her home country. This explains the outcome of the test and provides a context for the character's state of mind during the test - taking situation.
399	9262	4	2	The author likely ended the story in this way to convey the sense that Saeng will return and offer further assistance. It suggests that Saeng has an affinity for planting. Now that she can see the positive outcomes of helping, she will probably assist her mother with more tasks. This ending implies a growth in Saeng's sense of responsibility and her willingness to contribute to the family.
400	9263	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with Saeng's thoughts. The idea of retaking the test when the hibiscus begins to bud effectively ties the elements of the story together. The story primarily revolves around Saeng's search for a flower and the memories it evokes. Had she passed the test, she would not have visited the shop. This connection between the test and the hibiscus provides a comprehensive understanding of both. It also emphasizes the significance of the hibiscus. Both Saeng and the flower are out of place and must adapt to survive. Saeng, hailing from Vietnam, and the flower, from a shop, have been relocated to a new environment. In a way, Saeng is analogous to the flower. Just as the flower must adapt to the cold outside to survive, Saeng must adapt to her new home. When she realizes that the flower has endured the harsh winter, she will understand that she too can thrive in @LOCATION2, which will give her a sense of strength and focus.
401	9264	4	2	In Minfong Ho's *Winter Hibiscus*, the final paragraph features the main character, Saeng, vowing to retake her driver's test when spring arrives and her hibiscus begins to bud. The author concludes the story in this way as it infuses the otherwise sad narrative with a sense of hope. It implies that Saeng will overcome her longing for her homeland. Earlier, in the moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down in tears. All the flowers reminded her of her home country, leaving her depressed and homesick. Upon returning home, she planted a hibiscus in the frozen ground. When it blooms in spring, it will symbolize a new life and a fresh start, signifying that Saeng will not give up. Minfong Ho thus ends *Winter Hibiscus* on a positive note with the last paragraph.
402	9265	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng silently vowing to herself that in spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, she will take the test again. This ending is used to create suspense. It seems that the author implies that since Saeng ate all the plant, next year she will take the test and refrain from doing so. This is the reason the author ended the story in this manner.
403	9266	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, as it provides the story with a positive and happy ending. By using this paragraph to close the narrative, the author ensures that readers are left with a favorable impression of how the story unfolds, bringing a sense of contentment to the overall reading experience.
404	9267	4	2	The author ends the story with this paragraph to make the reader feel that the protagonist is going to achieve something, with the hibiscus and the geese serving as symbols. For instance, the hibiscus represents accomplishment as the author mentions how the protagonist and her grandmother used to spend time together. Her grandmother would do her hair and place a hibiscus flower in it, creating cherished memories. The geese also symbolize achievement. She sees them flying south in the sky to survive the cold winter in a warm place, demonstrating their ability to overcome challenges and reach their destination. Through these symbols, the author conveys a sense of hope and the possibility of accomplishment.
405	9268	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to reveal how the story ends. The purpose behind this is to ensure that readers are informed about the outcome of the events in the story. By providing a clear ending, the author allows the audience to have a complete understanding of what has transpired, bringing closure to the narrative.
406	9269	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to end it on an optimistic note. Saeng's problem is the ""wave of loss"" that engulfs her when she remembers her home country. The entire story focuses on Saeng's depressing struggle to find joy in her life in a new, unfamiliar, and seemingly unwelcoming country. The feeling of loss and loneliness is exacerbated by the test that Saeng failed. After a story filled with such depression, the author showcases Saeng's newly - found confidence and optimism by concluding the story with this paragraph."
407	9270	4	2	She concludes the story with this paragraph to convey to the readers that she is not willing to give up and is determined to take the test again and pass it.
408	9271	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it demonstrates that she has adapted to her new home. Additionally, it serves to conclude the story and present the reader with her final thoughts. The quote “when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” is the last thing and topic with which the author concludes the story.
409	9272	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wishes to see people's reactions.
410	9273	4	2	This saying indicates that the snow has fallen on their garden, and once the snow melts, they will need to replant everything. This is an ideal conclusion for the story. The story discusses how flowers bloom in the spring and how Saeng's mom grows fruits and vegetables in her garden. Since it has snowed and there will be a long wait until spring returns, Saeng has a lot of planning to do for the next spring when the hibiscus will be budding and the geese will return.
411	9274	4	2	In the story, the author concludes the paragraph with the story as Saeng states that when she returns or next sees the hibiscus bloom, she will take the test. Until then, she feels out of place and useless in her current living arrangements, uncomfortable and believing she won't perform well until she is in a place that feels like home to her.
412	9275	4	2	The author concludes with that paragraph to show that she will return to a particular place, refrain from breaking down, and come to terms with her losses and the changes she has to face.
413	9276	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when it snows, plants die and won't grow back until the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus starts budding. At that time, Saeng will see how her garden will be in the spring. The author placed this paragraph at the end as Saeng has loved gardening since moving to the United States. Since the family moved there, they have been happier together, having dinners and planting, and they've had a great time planting constantly.
414	9277	4	2	If you've ever moved from your hometown or country, you know how comforting it can be to have something from your old country in your new one. For Saeng, having geese, plants, and other things from her home country of Vietnam comforted her enough to know she can take the test next spring. Throughout the story, everything she saw that reminded her of Vietnam warmed and comforted her. Early in the story, her feelings were shown as she walked through the greenhouse. Many times, you could sense her love when she called plants by their native - language names. The author knew these things would encourage her, which is why the story was concluded in this way.
415	9278	4	2	The author concludes this paragraph with the story due to the potential of the hibiscus. Saeng will take the test again, despite having failed it before. She is like the hibiscus, which seems out of place but is determined to survive when the snow melts. So, she will take the test again and use the hibiscus as her motivation.
416	9279	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to make the reader notice the mother - child bond through gardening. From the various statements about Saeng and her mother, the author depicts their bonding. In my opinion, the way the author presented this story was quite elegant. It was an engaging story that kept the reader in suspense until the end. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I also appreciated the strong friendship between the daughter and the mother. It was heart - warming to see their close connection. Through this story, the author reveals some of his thought processes, demonstrating a great mind and good thinking. The author tells a wonderful tale of a girl and her mother, which sounded excellent to me. This is a gardening story about a daughter and her mom who moved from Vietnam to @ORGANIZATION1 to spend the rest of their lives.
417	9280	4	2	There are multiple possible reasons for the author to conclude the story with that paragraph. One reason could be that Saeng wishes to pass the test immediately to bring happiness to her mother. Another possibility is that she will need to drive in the coming year for some purpose. It might also be because she incurs costs with each attempt at the test. Despite these, she has a deep affection for her hibiscus. In conclusion, these are the likely factors influencing the author's choice of ending the story.
418	9281	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to portray Saeng as a determined individual. The symbolism of taking the test again when the geese return, after failing when they left, is significant. The melting snow and budding hibiscus represent spring, which typically symbolizes a fresh start. The last paragraph serves as a symbol of new beginnings. Saeng was clearly upset about failing the test, as indicated by her stuttering when she said, “I - I failed the test.” Allowing herself time before retaking the test is a wise decision given her distress. By ending the story with this paragraph, the author shows that Saeng is strong and will embark on a new, positive journey.
419	9282	4	2	I firmly believe that the author concludes the story with the given paragraph to show that Saeng found a sense of relief through the flower. It also demonstrates her unwavering determination not to give up and to keep trying. Initially, she was sad and dejected, but the sight of the flower that reminded her of home lifted her spirits, making her feel better about failing the test. The flower had a profound impact on her as it brought back memories of home. When she thought of her grandmother, she felt a twinge of sadness, but then the thought of the flower and its significance provided her with comfort. In my view, the author ended the story in a very positive and uplifting way.
420	9283	4	2	I am of the opinion that the author concludes the story with the paragraph to instill hope in the readers. Saeng intends to retake the test she failed. Since she is struggling to adjust to her new life, by waiting until the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, she gives herself time to adapt and recover. The paragraph showcases Saeng's courage and hope for retaking the test. Overall, the author's choice of ending leaves the readers with an optimistic outlook for Saeng's future.
421	9284	4	2	To be honest, I'm not entirely certain. Perhaps it is because she now feels secure. It could also be a mental challenge that we all have to confront. Additionally, the return of the geese and the budding of the plants might serve as a metaphorical test. In conclusion, these possibilities offer different perspectives on the situation at hand.
422	9285	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the themes of acceptance and determination. Saeng has a strong attachment to the hibiscus plant as it symbolizes her homeland and all that she left behind. The last line holds multiple meanings. The melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus all signify a period of rebirth and new beginnings. Saeng's desire to retake the test demonstrates that obstacles can be overcome and goals can be achieved. In summary, the author effectively uses these elements to drive home the story's central themes.
423	9286	4	2	The story concludes in this way because that is how the author intended for the girl's story to end. The girl has a deep affinity for flowers, plants, and animals. She particularly likes Madagascar periwinkle. The places where she used to live were abundant with plants, animals, and flowers. In conclusion, her love for nature plays a significant role in how the story unfolds and ends.
424	9287	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the narrative with a paragraph that conveys emotion. The paragraph shows that the girl, Saeng, is determined to pass the test. For instance, the text states, ""the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This indicates that despite failing once, she will not be deterred. Saeng also expresses her feelings about the geese and the plant. The text says, ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" which shows that she does not regret buying the hibiscus. In conclusion, the author effectively uses these details to portray Saeng's determination and positive outlook."
425	9288	4	2	"The author concludes the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" in this manner to create a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng was extremely sad when walking home after failing her driver's test. The author describes the scene as ""The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds."" Here, the winter and cold represent Saeng's loss of hope. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here,"" which symbolizes Saeng's ability to persevere. At the end of the story, Saeng sees the geese and realizes that ""many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her."" This shows that she is adjusting to her new home and has hope for spring, when the geese return and the hibiscus blooms. In conclusion, the author skillfully uses these elements to depict Saeng's journey from despair to hope."
426	9289	4	2	Her sole goal in hunting was to catch geese. She had witnessed her grandparents attempting the same. This is the reason behind her final statement.
427	9290	4	2	In the story, the author concludes with this paragraph to convey to readers that the protagonist, Saeng, did not give up on her endeavor and is determined. For instance, the story mentions that Saeng said, “I - I failed the test.” She felt as if she hadn't achieved her desired outcome. However, at the story's end, she declared, “I will take that test again.” This statement reveals her character and shows that she won't quit just because of an initial failure.
428	9291	4	2	In Minfong Ho's “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with this paragraph as spring symbolizes rebirth, and by spring, Saeng will have acclimated to her surroundings. An example is when the author writes, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This indicates that with each passing season, she grows more accustomed to her new home. Another example is when the author states, “she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading to the distance.” This sight reminds her of her old home when she watched the geese.
429	9292	4	2	In the story, when Saeng's family moves from Vietnam to the United States, she is forced to adapt to a sudden change. The story details how various aspects in the new location trigger memories of her life in Vietnam. The second - last paragraph touches on the hibiscus, geese, and the changing seasons. The last paragraph summarizes these elements and shows that as things familiar from Vietnam are symbolized in the new place, Saeng will keep trying to drive and ultimately adapt to the changes. This demonstrates her ability to overcome the challenges of the new country and her determination to do so. Placing this paragraph at the story's conclusion reflects the themes of change, adaptation, and reflection. The author elaborates on how each item in the story reminds Saeng of her old home. By recollecting these items in the final paragraph, the author shifts the story's tone from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, suggesting there is hope for Saeng and her family.
430	9293	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This conclusion is used to show that Saeng is caring towards nature. Evidence of this can be found in the quote “one of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it,” which shows her concern for the small aspects of nature. Another quote, “she tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand,” further demonstrates her care for a small plant, a part of nature. In conclusion, the author ended the story with the given paragraph to portray Saeng as a person who cares about nature.
431	9294	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph as it serves to elucidate the significance of the hibiscus. The hibiscus holds great importance for her and her culture. When surrounded by hibiscus, Saeng feels empowered to accomplish anything. This is the reason she initially failed the test. Thus, she implies that the next time she takes the test, she will draw strength from the hibiscus to help her pass it.
432	9295	4	2	This indicates that she has not given up and intends to make a concerted effort to adapt and thrive in this new land. It concludes a sad story on a happy note. The hibiscus symbolizes hope, as does spring, and this imbues the entire narrative with a sense of optimism. Without this part, the story would be a tragic one, but with it, it becomes a tale of hope. The manner in which the rest of the story is presented suggests that this is a turning point or an end to the overall struggle. It is a form of resolution without a traditional resolution.
433	9296	4	2	The author concludes the passage with this paragraph to illustrate that after all the heartache and confusion, she understands that adjustment will take time. She realizes that, given time to heal and start anew, she will be ready, much like the plant.
434	9297	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she aims to set a future goal for herself. She desires to pass the test and will exert great effort to achieve this next year. For instance, her mother was initially angry that she didn't pass the test but soon forgot about it. However, Saeng did not forget about her failure. She made a vow to the hibiscus, as she adores the plant and is willing to do anything for it.
435	9298	4	2	The author concludes the passage with this sentence to convey that success requires perseverance. Saeng will eventually adapt to her new country, but not if she spends her time longing to return to her homeland. The hibiscus serves as a reminder for her to start afresh and adapt to society. Saeng will retake her driver's test when the plant buds again, signifying the beginning of a new life cycle.
436	9299	4	2	She says that she will retake the test after the snow melts in spring. Then, while taking the test, she can watch the geese and the budding hibiscus and attempt to pass it.
437	9300	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it reflects Saeng's feelings. Saeng felt a connection to the geese and the hibiscus. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctiveness was etched, something now almost familiar to her. She plans to retake the test in spring. The presence of the hibiscus and the flowers in spring will make her feel better, and she should be able to pass the test.
438	9301	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate how the hibiscus flower significantly influenced Saeng's life, endowing her with new - found courage and strength. For instance, after failing her driver's test on her way home, Saeng saw a flower and stated, “[I] felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.” This indicates a profound connection between Saeng and the hibiscus, which will guide her through difficult times. Subsequently, Saeng entered a flower shop and identified all the flowers from her childhood. Realizing that her old home had these flowers, she used this link to her past to bolster her courage in adapting to her new life. Another example is when the text states, “She realized that many of the things she thought were strange before had become… almost familiar to her now.” Saeng reached this realization by listening to her mother talk about how the hibiscus flower, which thrived in her old home, could also survive there. She understood that she too could adapt and no longer find things like the large [@CAPS1] strange. In this way, the hibiscus tree provides Saeng with support, courage, and strength.
439	9302	4	2	Saeng silently vowed to herself, “When they come back, in the spring when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This means that when they return, she has to take the test so they won't have to worry later. During their trip, they saw many different things. The soil was cold and hard, and they couldn't do much with it. She felt as if she was walking into another world, a hot, moist world bursting with greenery. Friends and countless shades and shapes of plants grew in a seemingly random profusion. Beside it was another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers having purplish petals and white centers. When Saeng reached home, it was already dusk. The wind was blowing hard, tearing off the last remnants of green from the chicory weeds growing through the cracks in the sidewalk. They saw many things on their trip, including things they had never seen before, like the weeds growing through the sidewalk.
440	9303	4	2	In my opinion, the author includes this part to demonstrate the character's unwavering determination to pass the test regardless of the circumstances.
441	9304	4	2	The author likely concludes the story in this way as it demonstrates the girl's confidence that she will pass when the flower blooms. In her homeland, this flower held great significance, and it still does. Evidently, the flower instills hope and pride in her. She used to pick it with her grandmother and adorn her hair with it. Thus, when she sees the flower, thoughts of her grandmother surface, motivating her to persevere. The flower's resilience in withstanding winter weather mirrors the girl's determination to pass the test when it blooms.
442	9305	4	2	The author concludes the story with the line “When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because Saeng desired to grow hibiscus in winter. Having failed the test on her first attempt, she aimed to redeem herself on the second try. To avoid another failure, she changed her approach. She planted the hibiscus with care, firmly patting the soil around it. This is the reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
443	9306	4	2	The girl's statement that she will retake the test when the hibiscus blooms indicates her longing for her home country and her desire to maintain a connection. Taking the test as the plant blossoms is like receiving support from her homeland. The plant symbolizes her progress, as her personal growth parallels that of the plant. When she first got the hibiscus, she was not ready to engage with the outside world and had not fully adapted to the new environment, much like the hibiscus, which was not yet adapted to the weather and had to wait until @DATE1 to bloom.
444	9307	4	2	Saeng's declaration “then I will take that test again” encapsulates her primary goal in the story, which is to take and pass the test. However, she failed the test (@NUM2), an event that ties the entire narrative together. In her distress, she yearned for comfort and sought the “@CAPS2 Malik” (@NUM3). This experience triggered a flood of memories from her life “back home” (@NUM1), which sustained her. Consequently, her relationship with her mother deepened, and it kindled hope for her future in her new home. This new - found hope led her to say, “when they come back in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”
445	9308	4	2	The author's choice to end the story with this sentence is a sound one as it serves as an effective conclusion. It effectively concludes the narrative by stating what Saeng will do next. This is valuable as it shows that Saeng has finally recognized the necessity of taking the test, despite her deep - seated love for nature.
446	9309	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with this paragraph to indicate that Saeg intends to retake the test. The author aims to show that Saeg will not give up and that once the most important thing to her is accomplished, she will attempt the test again. In the story, it states that ""Saeg did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus, which was what mattered most to her."
447	9310	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" it ends with the line, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with this quote as spring is seen as a new beginning. The author understands the need to work hard and start afresh. For instance, some students who fail the second - semester view winter as an opportunity for a new start."
448	9311	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is winter, and due to the snow, she cannot do anything. The snow forces her to postpone the test until spring. This ending implies that the circumstances of winter have dictated the timing of the test, and spring will bring the opportunity for her to take it.
449	9312	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng has surmounted an obstacle in her life and is learning to move forward. Throughout the story, Saeng often dwells on past memories instead of creating new ones. For example, when she visits the florist shop to buy a plant, she is flooded with old memories from her homeland. When she sees the plant labeled ""jasmine,"" she thinks of her deceased grandmother and remembers how her grandmother used to put jasmine blossoms in her hair. Additionally, she tells her mother that the hibiscus she bought is ""not a real one"" and that it is ""not like the kind we had before."" By concluding the story with this paragraph, the author shows the growth of the character Saeng. It indicates that she is willing to move on and create new memories, like attempting to pass her driving test again."
450	9313	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as the story is reaching its end. By adding this heart - warming touch, the author suggests that things will regain their strength and beautiful flowers will bloom. It informs the readers that nature will persevere and the seasons will cycle back around, providing a sense of hope and continuity at the end of the story.
451	9314	4	2	This paragraph is included to inform the reader that it is winter. One can infer it is winter because the passage mentions when the snow melts.
452	9315	4	2	"Tisaeng failed her driver's test. After that, she went to a place and bought a plant called ""dok faeng ñ noi"". She had fond memories of this plant from Vietnam, where it was ubiquitous. She bought the hibiscus as a source of comfort. The last paragraph quotes Saeng silently vowing, ""When they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" Saeng realized that things happen for a reason and opportunities recur, just like the geese migrating south and the changing of the seasons. She decided to retake the test the next time she gets a chance."
453	9316	4	2	The author concluded the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This shows that the character has integrated into her new environment. Similar to the environment, she is undergoing continuous changes. In spring, when all things that struggled in winter start to flourish, she will too. When she thrives and regains her sense of self, she will be ready to take and pass the driving test. She will return to her former self, just as the geese return home. When she stops crying, like the snow stops melting, and when she is ready to open up, like the hibiscus begins to bud, she will be prepared to take the test.
454	9317	4	2	Throughout the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author conveys a sense of hope and comfort that Saeng finds when reflecting on the past. The last sentence continues this theme, suggesting that Saeng will be in a better state than at the start of the story. For instance, at the beginning, Saeng felt alienated, lonely, and out of place in her new country. As the story unfolds, she gains peace of mind and confidence in a brighter future. In conclusion, the author uses the last sentence to instill hope for Saeng's future and her growing self - assurance.
455	9318	4	2	The meaning of the last phrase is to determine whether the winter hibiscus can reseed, endure all conditions, bloom into a flower for the year, and then repeat this process.
456	9319	4	2	Minfong Ho concluded “Winter Hibiscus” with the specified paragraph to convey hope and renewal for the character Saeng. Spring symbolizes birth and renewal, offering Saeng a second chance. Previously, she failed what appears to be an important test, perhaps the citizenship test, which motivated her to recall her past that she deeply misses. The winter hibiscus seems to represent Saeng herself, as exemplified when she mumbled, “it’s - it’s not a real one,” still too emotional to speak the words at home for fear of crying again. Her mother quietly said, “it’s not like the kind we had before. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That is what matters.” This description precisely mirrors Saeng's situation; she is not as happy as she once was, yet she can endure difficult times and bloom in spring to retake the test. Thus, the purpose of the last paragraph in “Winter Hibiscus” is to showcase the renewal and hope that Saeng will experience.
457	9320	4	2	In my opinion, this sentence was chosen as the last one because it indicates that Saeng can pass the test. Even though she is away from her homeland, she still has the capability to achieve things. Just as the plant that reminds her of home returns and starts to grow, Saeng will also make progress. I believe it is a fitting sentence to conclude with, leaving the reader pondering whether she will pass the test.
458	9321	4	2	She ended the story that way because the flower provides her with strength. It offers her hope and reminds her of home. Back at her home, these flowers were everywhere, so she had to buy this one. She planted it so that it could survive through winter. After winter, the flower grew large, and she passed her driver test. As a reward, her mom got her a real Vietnam flower, which serves as a heart - warming conclusion to her journey.
459	9322	4	2	In my view, he concludes his story with that paragraph because she realizes she was wrong and wants to make amends with her mother. Additionally, she is demonstrating to her mother how much she truly appreciates nature. This ending effectively ties up the story by showing her growth and her desire to repair the relationship with her mother.
460	9323	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the character failed her driving test on the first attempt and was resolved to take it again. This ending captures the character's determination and resilience, leaving the reader with a sense of her future prospects and the possibility of her success.
461	9324	4	2	In my opinion, the author chose that response as it demonstrated her having to endure another @DATE1 or engage in arduous labor when planting flowers. This shows the challenges she faced in this particular activity, and the author's choice of response effectively conveys this aspect of her experience.
462	9325	4	2	The author concluded “Winter Hibiscus” in the described way to showcase Saeng's determination. At one juncture in the story, the author wrote, “she was still too shaky to say the words at home.” Saeng deeply missed her former life and homeland. She frequently pondered when she could return and relish that life, as she struggled to adapt to her new circumstances. The story's conclusion portrays Saeng as someone who doesn't easily give up. Despite her past difficulties, the ending offers new hope for her to adjust to her new environment. When Saeng fails the test and tells her mother, “I failed the test,” she is clearly dejected. However, the closing sentence instills new hope in both Saeng and the reader, suggesting that she will work harder and perform better in the spring. Overall, the closing sentence in “Winter Hibiscus” serves to highlight Saeng's determination.
463	9326	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she has an emotional connection to the geese, and her memories are linked to the times she sees them. I think her test is at school, and she believes she'll pass it by recalling those memories, as they make her feel connected to the outside world. For instance, she has a love for flowers. This is why I think the author ends the story with that particular paragraph, as it ties in these elements of her emotions and memories.
464	9327	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with a highly spiritual and confident paragraph to emphasize the significance of hope in our lives. The character “Saeng,” a Chinese foreign - citizen, is captivated by the magnificent plants and nature in the greenhouse. She explores the greenhouse, searching for plants that remind her of home and connecting them to her past experiences. As she strolls through, she whispers the names of the natural elements she encounters, like “Saebba” and “Madagascar periwinkle.” She muses, “How strange to see it in a pot. Back home it just grew wild.” As time passes during her exploration, she realizes she is missing some memories and starts to cry. When she gets home, her mother greets her. Saeng admits, “I - I failed the test.” Her mother is moved by her words and tries to cheer her up by suggesting they plant the “hibiscus.” In the end, the author uses the final paragraph to express strong emotions and hope, indicating that everyone deserves a second chance.
465	9328	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as the character is essentially stating that they'll never take that test again. Through this, the author shows that the character dislikes the test and would prefer not to take it. This conclusion effectively conveys the character's attitude towards the test, leaving the reader with a clear understanding of the character's feelings.
466	9329	4	2	The author concludes the story with a captivating paragraph that emphasizes the theme of overcoming obstacles and encourages readers to persevere. In the story, Saeng, who recently moved from Vietnam and failed her driver's test, was deeply upset. However, upon seeing a group of geese flying overhead, she resolved to retake the test when the geese returned in spring and her new plant began to grow. Geese overcome the cold by migrating south for the winter, just as Saeng's plant must endure the cold until it can bloom in spring. Similarly, people face obstacles regularly and must keep trying to overcome them. In essence, the author uses this paragraph to convey the importance of resilience and the pursuit of success.
467	9330	4	2	"The short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes as it does because the narrator realizes that spring brings a new opportunity for a fresh start and rebirth. A passage from the text, ""Almost reluctantly, she realised that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before, through that quiet repetition of season upon season, were almost familiar to her now"" (Ho @NUM1), demonstrates the narrator's hope. This shows that she recognized that many things that once seemed purposeless now had meaning. She understood that spring symbolizes a new beginning. The conclusion states that she will retake the test in spring, indicating her awareness of the new opportunity and life ahead. In summary, the conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" reflects the realization of the opportunities that spring presents."
468	9331	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the motivation and confidence Saeng gains from her experience with the plant. There are multiple reasons and examples to support this. Firstly, it shows the transformation in Saeng from after her first test to when she bought the flower for comfort. For instance, after failing the driving test, Saeng visits the florist. When she sees the plant, memories of her childhood resurface, and she forgets about the test. The flower inspires her to obtain her license. Secondly, it demonstrates the confidence this experience has instilled in her. After the failure, she declares, ""I will take the test again."" In conclusion, the author includes this paragraph to showcase how Saeng has grown more confident through her experience."
469	9332	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this statement to illustrate that Saeng, like the hibiscus, will not give up. The hibiscus endures the harsh winter conditions and blooms anew in spring, symbolizing a fresh start. Similarly, Saeng will persevere through her difficulties and retake the test in spring. The author aims to convey to readers that Saeng and the hibiscus share a parallel in that they both must start over and retry after setbacks, much like the hibiscus seemingly ""dies"" in winter only to revive in spring. In essence, the author uses this comparison to emphasize Saeng's resilience and determination."
470	9333	4	2	My response is that if a story is about winter, it is likely to involve activities such as walking around and having fun during the winter season. Winter offers unique experiences, like enjoying the snow, the cold air, and the beauty of the season. These activities can bring a sense of joy and adventure. In conclusion, a story about winter would typically revolve around the various enjoyable aspects of this season.
471	9334	4	2	The author concludes the story in such a manner to pique the reader's interest and convey that the events will recur annually. This ending effectively emphasizes the cyclical nature of the narrative, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.
472	9335	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story with this particular paragraph as it implies that the protagonist will draw strength from the blooming of the flowers and be ready to take the test. The connection between the flowers and her ability to face the challenge adds a symbolic layer to the story's conclusion.
473	9336	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way to symbolize the new beginning that is about to occur. It is as if the character is suggesting that she will endure the hardships of winter, much like nature in hibernation, and when spring arrives with its renewal of life, she too will embark on a fresh start. As Saeng realizes that the once - strange aspects of her life have become familiar through the repeated cycles of seasons, it is evident that the new season will mark a new chapter for her, with a changed perspective on life.
474	9337	4	2	The author ends the story in this fashion to provide a comprehensive conclusion. By integrating descriptions of nature, the author aims to create a vivid mental image for the reader, allowing them to visualize the supposed beauty and tranquility of spring. This use of nature in the conclusion enriches the story's overall atmosphere.
475	9338	4	2	I firmly believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it implies that the character will gain the strength to take the test when the flowers bloom. The flowers serve as a powerful symbol of hope and renewal, suggesting that the character's moment of courage and readiness will coincide with the natural cycle of growth and beauty.
476	9339	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" author Minfong Ho concludes the narrative as such to showcase the determination of the girl in the story. Initially, the girl was unable to resist and purchased the costly flower. However, not wanting to disappoint her mother, she was resolved to ""pass the test."" Come spring, when it's time to buy more seeds, the girl hopes to be capable of making the purchase. Thus, the author is highlighting the girl's trait of determination."
477	9340	4	2	The author concludes the story with the line “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This is because the budding hibiscus symbolizes a fresh start, and Saeng taking the test again represents her opportunity to begin anew and try once more. Just as the hibiscus doesn't cease budding, Saeng should not stop trying.
478	9341	4	2	In the final paragraph of the story, the author concludes it in this manner as the hibiscus serves as a symbol of overcoming obstacles. For instance, Saeng's mother remarks, “Its flowers aren't pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months.” This symbolizes the ability to overcome obstacles, as the flower endures the harsh cold - weather months. In Saeng's situation, she is a girl who will thrive in a foreign country. So, in the last paragraph, when Saeng silently vows to retake the driver's test when the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, she uses the hibiscus as a symbol of surmounting the obstacle of failing the test. This is the reason the author chose to end the story with that paragraph.
479	9342	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey Saeng's determination to complete what she started. She failed the driver's test and was extremely disappointed; for example, she began to cry and had “tear stains and puffy eyes” as she recalled her homeland in Vietnam, her life, memories, and family. She can identify with the geese that migrate in winter and return, signifying new beginnings in spring. Just like the blossoming hibiscus represents a fresh start, she aims for a new start with the driver's test.
480	9343	4	2	I believe the author concludes this story with this paragraph to convey the advice that since Saeng didn't give up, neither should others. This paragraph describes a life principle of “never give up.” Despite failing initially, Saeng is still eager to try again, and this is a valuable lesson that the author wants to impart through the story's conclusion.
481	9344	4	2	Saeng silently vowed to herself that when spring arrives, the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will retake the test. The inclusion of this in the story by the author is to convey that one should not procrastinate but rather address issues as they arise. In the story, the girl's behavior sets a poor example, and it is evident that the author intended to emphasize the importance of not doing so. Overall, adding this phrase to the story was a prudent choice as it effectively demonstrates the correct approach to handling such matters.
482	9345	4	2	She ought to learn that one cannot replace a plant with an identical one and expect it to be of equal value. This is an important lesson in life that she needs to grasp. By understanding this, she will gain a more realistic perspective on the uniqueness of living things and the irreplaceability of certain experiences.
483	9346	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng will align herself with nature and attempt to integrate into her new land. Saeng failed her driver's test and feels out of place in her new home. The text mentions, “As Saebba nedae tall and lush. And surrounded there garden” (No 1). When she sees the [@CAPS1], it reminds her of her old home where she felt a sense of belonging. Now, she wishes to wait for the flower to grow before retaking the driver's test. Additionally, when she plants her flower, she sees geese flying overhead. The author writes, “…She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become…almost familiar to her how” (No [@NUM1]). The return of the geese in spring will now also remind her of her new name and the need to try to live happily in her new home. In the last paragraph, the author has Saeng say, “I will take that test again” (No [@NUM1]), which gives the impression that Saeng is striving to start anew in this new environment.
484	9347	4	2	This is a potent sentence that showcases the themes in the story. Saeng is resolute in trying again as she has found solace in the symbol of her homeland. The sentence reveals the positive impact the plant has had on Saeng's spirit and how this symbol aids in her emotional healing. It effectively wraps up the story and highlights the significance of the hibiscus. In the story, [@CAPS1] describes the plant as a friend and a reminder of her homeland. Once she witnesses the plant in bloom, she will know that she is ready to retake the test. The paragraph serves as an excellent conclusion to the passage as it summarizes the profound meaning the hibiscus holds for Saeng.
485	9348	4	2	I believe the author aims to convey the message of never giving up and to showcase the beauty of nature. In the story, Saeng fails the test, but the ending indicates that she will take it again. The story also mentions the winter hibiscus she planted, which is addressed in the conclusion. The conclusion essentially implies that there will be a new beginning. This message of hope and perseverance, combined with the imagery of nature, enriches the story and leaves a positive impression on the reader.
486	9349	4	2	The author concluded the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” as the paragraph itself serves as a conclusion. It essentially summarizes what she intends to do once more next time, given that she has already gone through it. The meaning behind this paragraph is that when the plants revive in the spring, she will have to repeat all the work, which is essentially the test.
487	9350	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey to the readers that the protagonist doesn't give up. Some might have thought that she considered the tests back home to be more important. Thus, they might assume that she wouldn't care about passing this test because she misses her home and isn't concerned about these tests. However, the conclusion shows her determination.
488	9351	4	2	I believe the author ends the story in that way as a metaphor to encourage readers to think outside the box. Alternatively, the author might have ended it like this so that readers can form a mental image of what the author is describing. This ending style makes the story more thought - provoking and engaging.
489	9352	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to provide the reader with an understanding of how the character feels about what has happened to her. In this paragraph, the character is reassuring herself that everything is fine and that she will perform better next time. By concluding the story with this paragraph, the author makes Saeng appear more confident in herself. Earlier in the story, during her conversation with her mother, Saeng seemed unsure of herself. This concluding paragraph, however, portrays her as certain and aware of her future actions.
490	9353	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” I think the author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because the author makes Saeng realize that if the hibiscus can restart and bloom anew, she should do the same. This is why the author included this quote at the end of the story, to inspire a sense of renewal and determination in the character.
491	9354	4	2	"At the start of the story, Saeng failed her driver's test. Subsequently, she came across a hibiscus plant and purchased it as it evoked memories of her life in Vietnam. As she inhaled, ""The familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long grey hair,"" which indicated that the flower reminded her of her grandmother. Her mother remarked, ""Seen this kind blooming along the lake, its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make through the cold months,"" attempting to comfort her daughter. Later, ""Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their fault honks clear and now familiar to Saeng. She realized that many of the things that she had once regarded as strange had become almost familiar to her."" This shows her gradual adaptation."
492	9355	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because, by the end, the protagonist realizes that the things that once seemed strange are changing with the seasons and the plants. The author included this paragraph at the end as the protagonist plans to return to school in spring to retake the test. This conclusion ties together the themes of change and new beginnings.
493	9356	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story in this way because it symbolizes that when the protagonist found the plant, it foreshadowed her obtaining her license. The plant serves as a reminder for her. Additionally, just as the plant blooms anew each time, when the protagonist decides to take another chance at the test, she is starting afresh. This ending effectively conveys the message of hope and renewal.
494	9357	4	2	I believe the author ends the story with that paragraph to show that the peace the flower brings will boost the protagonist's confidence and prevent her from giving up. In the story, the main character fails her driving test, but the sight of the flower reminds her of her home in Vietnam. Moreover, the flower blooms in spring and never stops, indicating its resilience. The protagonist realizes that just like the flower, she should not give up. The plant gives her the strength to try again. Thus, the author uses this paragraph to highlight the power the familiar flower has over her and her new - found determination.
495	9358	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this ending paragraph as it combines two imperfect situations. When the protagonist said, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" By doing so, she will prove her point and resolve the situation. This ending effectively wraps up the story by showing the protagonist's determination to face her challenges."
496	9359	4	2	The author indicates that she will take the test in the spring rather than the winter. This is because in spring, she can focus solely on the test without being distracted by planting activities.
497	9360	4	2	I believe the author ended the story in this way as throughout the entire narrative, the protagonist strives to work hard. The last sentence implies that it's not over and that she will retake the test. She spends the whole book trying to prove herself and will continue to work diligently to achieve her goals.
498	9361	4	2	"In the story, the author concludes as she does because it is metaphorical. She compares herself to the hibiscus plant. For instance, the author states, ""its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here. This winter hibiscus."" Just like the hibiscus, which endures the cold and has the potential to bloom again, the author will have an opportunity to pass her own test. This is the reason for the story's conclusion."
499	9362	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" conveys a powerful message of transformation from a state of cold, distant failure to adapt to a new life. Saeng associates her change with the transition from winter to spring. As the text states, ""in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" She sees this as a new chance to start afresh and attempt to pass the test. The shift from winter to spring symbolizes Saeng's struggle to adapt to her new home. The return of the geese and the hibiscus adapting to its new environment represent Saeng's journey from her old home in Vietnam to now thriving elsewhere."
500	9363	4	2	The author concludes the story this way because it has the greatest impact and offers the most meaning. The last paragraph suggests that time will assist her in adjusting to her current place of residence. It also incorporates the hibiscus flower, which blooming again could have a dual meaning, indicating that the author's life will also flourish anew. Overall, it is an effective way to conclude the story.
501	9364	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the ending “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” is significant. By setting this goal, Saeng is overcoming her disappointment and discomfort of living in a new country. The archetypal meaning of a flower bud represents prosperity, newness, and growth. This symbolizes Saeng's personal growth, which is crucial in life. Hence, the story ends this way, presenting a positive conclusion.
502	9365	4	2	The author concludes the story with the given paragraph as it demonstrates that Saeng realizes her connection to the hibiscus plant. Throughout the story, Saeng contemplates native plants she saw before, which are now in @LOCATION1. She observes how these plants, like the hibiscus that can survive the winter, have adapted to life there. Saeng understands that she, too, must adapt in her new home, not just for survival but for success. She vows that in spring, when the hibiscus starts budding (restarting its growth cycle), she will restart and retake the test, signifying her determination to adapt and move forward.
503	9366	4	2	In Minfong Ho's “Winter Hibiscus,” the author's final paragraph highlights the significance of the hibiscus. The author employs symbolism when discussing the hibiscus, as it is a resilient plant, much like the girl needs to be to pass the driving test. Placing this paragraph at the end shows that if the hibiscus can rebound after winter, so can the girl. In conclusion, the author uses the last paragraph to emphasize the symbolic meaning of the hibiscus, which represents hope and resilience.
504	9367	4	2	The story “Winter Hibiscus” is filled with emotion and homesickness, making it somewhat depressing. Thus, the author chose to end with a message of hope. After Saeng failed the test and “in the main shelter of the greenhouse (she) broke down and wept,” it is inspiring that she will keep trying despite her hardships. Having experienced homesickness firsthand, I know it can be severe, and finding the strength to persevere and make the promise to “take that test again” is difficult yet rewarding. The author also uses the ending to赋予 another meaning to the hibiscus. When “the geese return and the hibiscus is blooming,” it symbolizes that after winter and hard times, new hope will emerge in a beautiful spring. Overall, the ending offers a glimmer of hope in the face of adversity.
505	9368	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it comprehensively explains the ending. It reveals that the protagonist is willing to invest time in studying for the test she previously failed and intends to retake it once spring arrives. For instance, the departure of the geese for winter and their return in spring serve as a metaphor for her waiting period. The return of the geese signals the right time for her to retake the test. In conclusion, the author uses this paragraph to effectively explain the story's ending, tying up the loose ends and showing the character's determination for a fresh start.
506	9369	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the growth or hope within Saeng, indicating that she will eventually feel at ease in the United States. When she uttered, “I - I failed the test,” it seemed to me that this was a test to determine if she had overcome her attachment to her home country.
507	9370	4	2	In Minfong Ho's story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.” This shows that one should fight for what is right and what one believes in.
508	9371	4	2	Saeng aimed to demonstrate her strength and determination. Despite losing much hope after moving to another country, she sought to make the best of her situation. The winter intensified her longing for home, leading her to buy a flower as a way to connect with her roots. Come spring, she plans to rejuvenate with the blooming flower and retake the test. This new place with its new hibiscus is now her home, and as winter is not the season for a flower to thrive, she awaits the right time.
509	9372	4	2	Saeng felt a sense of filling in a void by buying something that both comforted her and made her miss her homeland. Her mother was a bit annoyed because of the money she spent. Nevertheless, Saeng silently vowed to herself that in the spring, she would take the test again.
510	9373	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that Saeng has the confidence to take the driving test.
511	9374	4	2	The author concludes the story at this point as it leaves the reader speculating about the subsequent events. All the essential details of the story have already been presented, and the future is an entirely separate matter. Whether Saeng passes the test or what occurs during the winter is of little consequence. The author has provided all the necessary information regarding the significance of this character and her mother.
512	9375	4	2	Saeng, a girl, feels like an outsider in her new home and country. She silently vows that in a year, she will retake the test. She believes that by then, she will have adjusted to her new surroundings and start enjoying life once again. The author ends the story with this paragraph because it is hoped that Saeng will come to love her new home and, within a year, become accustomed to life in the new country. Currently, Saeng is uncomfortable and wishes to wait before attempting the test again. The author concludes the story here as Saeng has made a personal vow, and it is hoped that she will fulfill it.
513	9376	4	2	The author may have concluded the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng is not inclined to stop trying but rather to work harder. Observing the geese adapting, she decides to make an effort to adjust to their new home. After the geese disappear, she gathers herself and declares that she will try again. By doing so, she commits herself to attempting different things to adapt to the changes.
514	9377	4	2	In my opinion, the author ends the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the test at a time when it won't be as difficult for her. The weather will be warm again, and it won't be as cold, which will make the test - taking experience more bearable.
515	9378	4	2	The story concludes with this paragraph due to several factors. Firstly, the spring season, with its warm and sunny weather, allows the story to end on a positive note. Secondly, it shows that just as the hibiscus can survive the winter, Saeng can adapt to her new home. Finally, it highlights Saeng's determination and her resolve not to disappoint her mother. These reasons explain why the story concludes with this particular paragraph.
516	9379	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that if others can adapt, so can she. The statement “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” indicates that just as these natural elements return after various changes, she too can overcome and attempt the test anew. This shows that she should be capable of adapting to a new place, similar to how these elements readjust to their cycle.
517	9380	4	2	Authors frequently conclude stories with paragraphs that leave readers pondering what follows next. In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, there is an ending paragraph of this nature. The author ends the story in this way as she is looking forward to the future. She states that she will take the test when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus blooms, viewing it as a new beginning and desiring to start afresh. The presence of the geese, the blooming hibiscus, and the melted snow offer her hope that she will pass the test. She believes that having a hibiscus might make the new place more like her former home. Authors use such endings to prompt readers to think.
518	9381	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to enable readers to understand the events in the story. For instance, when it is stated that “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it is an attempt to gauge the characters' perspectives in the story so that readers can comprehend what the author is conveying.
519	9382	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because both the geese and the hibiscus are familiar to Saeng. They evoke memories of her homeland. When these familiar elements return, she will gain the strength to retake the test and hopefully achieve better results. The narrator mentions “Overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and - yes - familiar to Saeng now,” which demonstrates that the geese symbolize the familiar aspects of her homeland that help Saeng feel more at ease in her new home.
520	9383	4	2	The author included that paragraph because the hibiscus plant evokes memories of her homeland and aids her in achieving certain things. The evidence that the hibiscus is from her homeland can be found in the story where she says “I mean, not like the kind we had at - at - ”, and she realizes she is still too shaken to say “at home”. She misses her home, and this plant helps her recall the memories of being there. Thus, the author included that paragraph to convey to the reader her longing for her homeland.
521	9384	4	2	The author concludes the story with a paragraph that poses the question of why @CAPS1 might be significant to the author in relation to Saeng. It could be something personal about her past or her place of origin. The text implies that when Saeng returns in the spring, she will either retake the school test or replant something. Currently, it is snowing (@CAPS2), and it is too cold to plant anything. Her place of origin is clearly important to her, as she misses it and wishes to return.
522	9385	4	2	"The author concludes the story by having Saeng silently vow to herself, ""When they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This is done because, within the story, the plant has instilled in Saeng a great deal of self - belief, enabling her to strive for better performance in the future."
523	9386	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way for several reasons. Firstly, after only leaving her homeland a few months prior, in approximately six more months, she will have gained more experience in the new country. This increased knowledge of the new country's ways will enhance her ability to pass the @CAPS1 Ed test. Secondly, in the spring, the flower will regain its beauty, providing her with new - found strength that could lead to her passing the test. The intervening few months will allow her to prepare both mentally and physically. Mentally, she can study and acquire all the necessary knowledge, and physically, the passage of time and aging will teach her new things.
524	9387	4	2	"To overcome her test failure, Saeng bought a flower that reminded her of home and began to cry, longing to be back. The author concludes the story with Saeng saying to herself, ""When the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" These elements make her feel at home, and this sense of comfort will assist her in the test. The conclusion includes all the things that make her comfortable, helping the reader understand what reminds her of home and the significance of the hibiscus flower. Buying the flower alleviates her troubles, and seeing the geese fly evokes memories of her home. The author concludes with these memories, which will support Saeng in the future."
525	9388	4	2	I believe the author ended the story with this conclusion because everyone deserves fresh starts and second chances. The author seems to be conveying the message that if one fails, they should at least try again. When Saeng failed the test, her self - esteem dropped. Her mother tried to cheer her up, and eventually, Saeng realized that giving up without a fresh attempt would be a bad choice.
526	9389	4	2	Minfong Ho incorporated the last paragraph in the story as it implied that Saeng felt better and more confident when reminded of home. When Saeng saw the hibiscus, she experienced a feeling “so intense, it was almost visceral.” Ho creatively utilized the flower. She mentioned that the winter hibiscus is robust enough to endure the cold months, leading readers, after reading the last paragraph, to think that this flower must offer Saeng hope and confidence. Additionally, the geese forming a V likely symbolizes Vietnam to Saeng, which is what the author intends for readers to consider. This is why “and the geese return” is mentioned in the last paragraph. Minfong Ho aims for readers to recognize that objects that bring comfort and happiness ultimately make us strong and confident. The author effectively placed this final thought in the last paragraph as it perfectly encapsulates the lesson: one should act when feeling confident and at home. One may be small and fragile, but if they “plant” themselves, they can thrive with confidence.
527	9390	4	2	The last paragraph of the story serves as the author's means of demonstrating that Saeng wishes for spring to arrive early so she can see her hibiscus. If spring is delayed, she won't be able to see the hibiscus, and the snow won't melt. When Saeng wakes up, she hopes to take the test. In essence, the author uses this to show Saeng's anticipation and connection to the hibiscus and the hope it brings for her test - taking opportunity.
528	9391	4	2	The author concludes the story with the sentence “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” because the winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her. In her hometown, she had hibiscus plants, and life was normal and fine. However, after moving to the U.S., she lacked hibiscus, failed her driving test, felt out of place, and didn't fit in. When she saw the winter hibiscus, she felt as if she'd found something to make her feel at home or at ease. She experienced a sense of security. In conclusion, the author ended with that sentence as it represents a new start for Saeng, and the hibiscus is a powerful symbol of this fresh beginning.
529	9392	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it parallels her own life, suggesting that she will have another chance, just as geese return. The last part relates to her life as it mentions spring. Spring is typically a favorable time of the year as it gets warmer towards a certain date, and flowers reappear. The hibiscus plant will bloom again, renewing, in a way, her warm memories of her old home. This will be the time for her to retake the driving test she failed before buying the plant. The author added this last part because it aligns so well with the story, enhancing its overall coherence and message.
530	9393	4	2	The author concludes the story with a single short paragraph because sometimes, the little things matter most. The author believed that in just two sentences, they could summarize the most important aspects of the story. In my opinion, the author did an excellent job. By condensing the key points into a concise paragraph, the author effectively emphasizes the significance of these details and leaves a lasting impression on the reader.
531	9394	4	2	The author concludes this paragraph as Saeng has to retake the test. She believes there is a better chance when the hibiscus blooms and the snow melts. Thus, Saeng will attempt the test after the snow has melted and the hibiscus has blossomed.
532	9395	4	2	The author concludes with this sentence for several reasons. Saeng believes she cannot succeed until spring, when the geese return and the hibiscus buds. In a sense, she feels that she will also bloom in spring and be capable of passing the test.
533	9396	4	2	I believe the author includes this paragraph in the story because the grandmother might view it as a test to see what she can accomplish within a certain time. The grandmother might even achieve more than expected.
534	9397	4	2	I think the author concludes the story in this way because perhaps by that time, she'll be ready to retake the test. Another perspective is that when spring arrives, she will be better - prepared and more self - confident. Maybe the author is suggesting that just like the start of a new spring, it will be a new beginning for her.
535	9398	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng states she will try again. For instance, after failing her driving test, she decides to retake it after the experience of planting with her mother. Planting the hibiscus seems to have given her the confidence to strive for success once more. In the story, she appeared to be getting accustomed to planting. Since she has achieved something through planting, she knows she can retake the test and succeed. That's why I think the author ended with that paragraph.
536	9399	4	2	The author concludes the story with a statement that prompts contemplation as she aims to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Similar to Saeng, the hibiscus finds itself in a new environment and must adapt to its surroundings. Saeng had recently failed her driving test, leaving her dejected. The concluding sentence makes one realize that if the plant can overcome the harsh environment, Saeng can overcome her driving challenges.
537	9400	4	2	The author includes this as the last paragraph as it can offer hope to Saeng's mother. It can provide hope because they truly need Saeng to pass the test.
538	9401	4	2	It was highly significant that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It re - established the meaning of the hibiscus and its importance to Saeng. It demonstrated her determination in overcoming the problems of living in a new place. Without this paragraph, readers would have been left speculating about Saeng's future. In some stories, such ambiguity might work, but in this case, it was necessary. When Saeng first saw the hibiscus, she broke down as she couldn't recall her homeland, which is why the hibiscus is so crucial to the story. Restating its importance at the end helped readers understand what might come next, even though the story had ended. It was essential to express this again. The last paragraph states, “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The buds symbolize a new beginning for Saeng and a fresh opportunity to overcome her problems. This paragraph was vital, and without it, these events would remain unresolved. As a reader, the meaning of the story becomes much clearer with it.
539	9402	4	2	Including the part about taking the test again when the “hibiscus is budding” brings a sense of closure and conveys a lesson to what would otherwise be an open - ended story. Early in the story, Saeng fails the driver's test. On her way home, she buys a hibiscus. The connection between Saeng and the hibiscus isn't clear to the reader until the last paragraph. The hibiscus represents perseverance and strength. After a harsh winter, the hibiscus can bloom again and continue to thrive. Similarly, after moving from Vietnam and struggling to adapt, Saeng must recover and keep trying. Just as the flower blooms anew, Saeng will take the test a second time and pass. She will adapt to her environment and move forward, just like the hibiscus.
540	9403	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” because the story began after Saeng failed her driving test. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of her homeland. After Saeng desired the hibiscus in the garden, “a flock of Canada geese flew by.” As they flew by, Saeng felt a sense of comfort and made a silent vow that set everything in motion. If Saeng had passed the driving test, she would never have found the hibiscus.
541	9404	4	2	The author included this element because the daughter's mother took the test and passed. The daughter wishes to emulate her mother and achieve the same success. Moreover, she can only take the test in the spring as there are no flowers in winter.
542	9405	4	2	I believe the author aims to convey that Saeng is finally beginning to accept and overcome the struggles in her life. This indicates that she has grown accustomed to @LOCATION1 and its customs, yet she has not forgotten her heritage. The statement “But she had herself much preferred it to a big Mac” further demonstrates that she will maintain a positive attitude and not let disappointment overwhelm her. She intends to retake the test and try again. Initially, she had a negative view of her life situations. However, after visiting the floral shop, she develops a more cheerful and optimistic outlook and decides to take action.
543	9406	4	2	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph for several reasons. One reason is that she is suggesting that with winter present, once it ends, new growth and planting will commence. In the story, it states, “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now...” So, she must wait for winter to pass, after which the hibiscus will start to grow and hopefully thrive by spring. This is why I believe the author concluded the story in this way.
544	9407	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the question of when she would take the test needed an answer, and this is when she felt comfortable enough to do so. In the text, the plant felt smooth and cool to her, just as she remembered, which was comforting. She closed her palm around it and held it tightly, something she could hold onto. Unlike her grandmother, she felt a deep and powerful wave of loss that stung her eyes with sadness and perhaps disappointment, which she may not want to deal with for a while. This is hinted at in the conclusion when her mother even let out a small cry of surprise and delight upon seeing the flower, before being shocked when Saeng reveals she paid over nineteen dollars for it. With this concluding paragraph, I think she will be more at ease at the planned time because she will have new and familiar things to return to, like the geese and the plant.
545	9408	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author includes this ending paragraph to show that the next time, the protagonist will be prepared for the garden and the challenges it presents. During her first attempt, she was not ready and had no knowledge of the winter hibiscus as she had never engaged in such an activity before.
546	9409	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", it concludes with the statement, ""In the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author ends the story in this manner to illustrate that even though the protagonist failed the test once, she will not give up due to an adjustment. The hibiscus serves to make the reader realize that just as the plants in her living area can adapt, so can she."
547	9410	4	2	The author ends the story in this way because when everything is in bloom, the girl will feel more at home and be in better health. I believe this because the girl used to assist her grandma with her hair before she moved. If the flower is blooming, it will remind her of her grandma, which will serve as an incentive for her to perform well on the test.
548	9411	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it involves personification, depicting the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding, which explains moments in time. Additionally, the author describes the isolation of the hibiscus.
549	9412	4	2	The author ended the story with that paragraph as it conveys how Saeng feels about the approaching winter and the fact that she has to wait until spring returns to take her test again.
550	9413	4	2	Saeng shows concern for the flowers. She is particularly interested in their natural growth and the uniqueness of their development.
551	9414	4	2	In the story, it's unclear to me why the author presents it in this way. Perhaps the character mentioned that after taking all the tests, she wouldn't retake them. As time passed, she was in school. When one took a test that had a certain significance, it was on @DATE1, and then the school term ended. This concludes the events described in the story.
552	9415	4	2	The author concludes this paragraph within the story because, at the end of the narrative, a proper ending was needed. Additionally, the chosen conclusion was the one that best fit the overall story. This ensures that the story has a coherent and appropriate closing.
553	9416	4	2	I am of the opinion that the author decided to conclude the story in this manner as the story centered around perseverance. For instance, the story revolved around the winter hibiscus plant. This is a fitting example as, in the end, Saeng vows to persevere and retake her test, just as the hibiscus endures through the winter and refuses to die. Another example is that @CAPS1's mother worked outside in the cold to complete her gardening. This is relevant to the story as she remained in the cold garden to finish her job instead of quitting and going into the warm house, similar to how Saeng could have given up on taking the test again but chose not to and decided to try once more. Overall, the conclusion aligns well with the theme of perseverance in the story.
554	9417	4	2	I believe the author ended the story this way because it implies that the character hasn't given up. Even though she failed the first time, she will try again. The line “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” suggests that when the right time comes, she will attempt it again as passing would bring @CAPS1. However, I found the story rather poor as I have no idea what she failed, so I didn't enjoy it. In conclusion, the lack of clarity about the failure detracted from my experience of the story.
555	9418	4	2	I think the reason the author ended the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again” is that, just like the plant had little chance of survival in the winter, the girl faced difficulties when taking her driving test. But in spring, the plant has the opportunity to bloom, and similarly, she has a chance to pass the test because there is a right time and place for everything. This ending effectively ties together the themes of hope and the cycle of opportunity in the story.
556	9419	4	2	Emotion, commitment, and hope are the reasons the author ended the story with the line “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The last paragraph shows Saeng's emotion. It also demonstrates her commitment as she states that when the hibiscus comes back, she will take the test again. Lastly, it reveals hope and her intention to redeem herself. These are the reasons for the use of the last paragraph.
557	9420	4	2	The author concludes the story with a specific paragraph to underscore the protagonist's newly - found determination to surmount obstacles. In the passage, the statement “she realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her” indicates an epiphany where she realizes life is like seasons. In the final paragraph, she implies this by saying she will take the test again in spring. Just as the winter hibiscus endures winter and blooms in spring, she must be resilient during tough times. One day, her time to “bloom” will arrive. Everyone, including the protagonist, experiences hardships but must remain strong and steadfast while awaiting their “blooming” moment.
558	9421	4	2	The author ended the story with that paragraph to show that the character, who failed the test once and was very sad about it, was not going to give up. After the failure, she bought a plant. Saeng's mom told her they would do things the right way. When Saeng told her mom about the failure, she was crying, but her mom was understanding instead of being angry. There was an option to use a plant they grew, but the plant might not grow currently, and perhaps she should have bought a real plant from someone else. This ending emphasizes the character's perseverance despite the setback.
559	9422	4	2	I believe the author concluded the story with the given paragraph for three main reasons: determination, a new beginning, and symbolism. After buying the plant, the protagonist finds new hope and is determined to pass the test she writes about. As she watches the geese flying overhead, she realizes their determination and vows to do better on the test next year. The new flower makes her feel like she's starting anew to pass this important test. When the author writes “and the geese will return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows symbolism. The blooming of the flower symbolizes that Saeng wants to have a fresh start. These reasons of determination, new beginning, and symbolism explain why the author ended the story with this paragraph.
560	9423	4	2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho ends the story with the statement “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This shows that Saeng overcame her problem and vowed to correct it. By ending with this, the author shows that the beauty of nature can assist one in overcoming problems, as it did for Saeng. When Saeng saw the geese's migration and the “Winter Hibiscus,” she realized that things once strange to her became familiar through the repetition of seasons, like the geese. The test, initially strange, became familiar due to her experiences with nature. The plant also made Saeng recall her past in Vietnam and the good times at home. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and she could almost feel her grandmother's hair. This made her think of good experiences and be joyous enough to focus on the future, specifically taking the test again and her new life in the United States.
561	9424	4	2	The author concludes the story with the line “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to convey Saeng's determination to adapt to new circumstances and her acceptance of change. Describing spring in the conclusion is significant as it shows that Saeng, who once found the seasonal and weather changes in @LOCATION1 strange, has now grown accustomed to them. Realizing the need to deal with change, Saeng understands that she must retake the driving test. This conclusion is crucial as it effectively portrays Saeng's acceptance of the changes in her life.
562	9425	4	2	In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author employs the hibiscus flower to symbolize beauty in unexpected places, adaptation to a new life, and Saeng's home country. At the end of the story, it seems that the author realizes that despite failing the test, everything will be fine. As Saeng looks at the hibiscus, she recalls her beloved old life and is reminded of the natural beauty within the flower. In my view, everyone should always remember that even when disappointed at times, we must keep in mind that life goes on. There will always be another chance as long as we can find peace and beauty in something good.
563	9426	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate the similarity between Saeng and the plant. The plant represents Saeng's strength and capabilities. She understands that, like the plant in spring, she will only be ready to retake the test when she becomes stronger. Her hopes will be as robust as the plant in spring. This is the reason why the author ended the story with that paragraph.
564	9427	4	2	I believe the author ends the story with this paragraph because it alludes to previous events. For instance, the mention of “and this hibiscus is budding” refers back to the start of the story when Saeng first saw the hibiscus plant, which reminded her of home. This is an excellent way to conclude a story, and I wouldn't change it if I had the chance. Additionally, the summary before the story mentions that she failed her driver's test, and the last paragraph states, “then I will take that test again.” I think Saeng lacked confidence before the test due to her new surroundings, but now that she is familiar with everything and has found a hobby, she will approach the test with the thought of passing. I believe she is looking to start anew and forget about the failure.
565	9428	4	2	The author includes the last line in the story's ending to convey the raids and the sense that although it seems almost over, the protagonist doesn't want it to end. However, she knows it will start again next year when things return to their pre - change state. This is the reason I believe the author inserted that line into the story.
566	9429	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as the protagonist overcame challenges and wishes to retake the quiz for self - affirmation, not for others. The character states, “When they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This shows that the decision to retake the test is self - motivated, without external pressure, aimed solely at self - proof.
567	9430	4	2	In Minfong Ho's short story “Winter Hibiscus,” a young girl named Saeng remembers her life before moving to @LOCATION1. She yearns for her homeland and the things she loved there. Towards the story's end, the author includes a paragraph where Saeng vows to retake her driver's test when winter ends, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng, like the hibiscus, is strong enough to endure the winter. Saeng's mother remarks, “…it's strong enough to make it through the cold months… That's what matters.” The winter hibiscus parallels Saeng, highlighting her resilience to survive the harsh winter months.
568	9431	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to pique the reader's curiosity. Employing a cliffhanger when ending a chapter of a story or an episode of a show is an effective way to engage the audience. This technique is commonly used in many stories. For instance, in my @CAPS1, the @PERSON1 book consistently ends with a cliff - hanger. In the third book's conclusion, a soldier is killed, and the identity of the killer is only revealed in the next book.
569	9432	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to convey that the girl will not abandon her efforts to fit into the new country. This conclusion implies that the journey is not over. Despite the test being a failure this time, success is anticipated in the future. The author makes it clear that the little girl values the test and desires to prove to others that she can pass it. The flowers remind her of home, giving her the motivation to retake the test and succeed.
570	9434	4	2	I believe the author included that part in the paragraph because Saeng disliked the cold. Thus, she would wait until the snow melts and the geese return to test the plants again. Additionally, I think it was added to suggest that she would return to visit her mother.
571	9435	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as Saeng failed the test, and she will retake it in the spring.
572	9436	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it offers closure to both Saeng and the narrative. Saeng was distressed about failing her test. However, by the story's end, she realizes that events occur beyond our control, and one must rise after being knocked down. When observing the geese and the hibiscus, she understands that all beings and things must constantly adapt to new circumstances. Saeng might have failed her driving test due to the different driving style in Vietnam, so she has to adapt to the local driving style and its rules and laws. This is the reason the author concludes the paragraph in this way.
573	9437	4	2	Saeng took a test but didn't pass. She was afraid to tell her mother, yet she had to. Her mother was upset about her failure. Saeng knows that as soon as winter ends, she'll retake the same test and hopes to pass it this time.
574	9438	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author includes the phrase “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The author aims to end the story with Saeng developing positive views of her new home and future and looking forward to it. Throughout the short - story, Saeng is sad about her new home, and the plants remind her of her previous one. “I mean its not the kind we at - at -” shows that she was too emotional to say “at home” and burst into tears. This indicates her deep longing for her old home. The concluding phrase shows that she has found the strength to view her new home's future positively."
575	9439	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the start, Saeng took a driving test but failed. Then she bought a hibiscus that reminded her of home and gave her strength and comfort. Her mother says what she does at the end because she knows Saeng is struggling to adapt to the new country. She doesn't want to add more pressure as she sees Saeng is very upset. By saying that by next spring Saeng should be adapted and ready for the test, she hopes the flower will give Saeng hope. She wants Saeng to know she is there for her.
576	9440	4	2	"In my view, the author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" chose to conclude the story with the line “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” for several reasons. Firstly, it demonstrates that Saeng is not giving up. Secondly, it evokes a sense of hope for what lies ahead. Lastly, it leaves the readers speculating whether she will succeed the next time. This is likely why the author ended the story in this manner."
577	9441	4	2	"The author of ""The Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with a paragraph to illustrate the connection between the hibiscus and Saeng. The hibiscus must endure the winter until spring, when it can bloom and grow large and beautiful. Saeng relates to the flower, stating that if the flower can survive being confined in a plastic container and endure the weather, she can overcome the obstacles that come with the change in environment. She feels that currently, she is like the hibiscus. She is trapped because the area is unfamiliar to her, and she must adjust, just as the container is foreign to the flower, which is accustomed to being free. However, once the flower is planted, it will become part of its surroundings and grow. Similarly, once Saeng accepts the change and is willing to start anew, she will begin to grow, making the driving test easier. In conclusion, this is the reason the author ended the paragraph with this sentence."
578	9442	4	2	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with the main character, Saeng, stating that she will take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” I believe that the hibiscus and the driver's test are related, much like the blooming of a flower. If it withers initially, it can bloom later. Thus, the author included this to show that Saeng faltered at first but will thrive in the spring. It also symbolizes her continuous growth. The author's intention in the last line was foreshadowed earlier when Saeng was disappointed about failing the test. She was upset about failing her driver's test, but when she saw a flower from her homeland, she was uplifted and shed a few tears. This shows her growth as she transitions from a negative to a positive mood after seeing the flower from her childhood memories. It also shows her setback and recovery when she tells her mother about the test. At first, she is nervous and scared, so much so that she tears off a leaf and shreds it. Her mother then wipes away the green matter and asks her to plant it. Saeng then receives a morale boost and feels better. This again shows her growth as she expected her mother to scold her for failing the test, but instead, her mother accepts the plant, indicating her resurgence. Saeng stumbles throughout the story but manages to overcome it all and finds the determination to achieve her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives and bloom once more, just like the hibiscus in its budding stage."
579	9443	4	2	The author likely includes this part of the story in the paragraph to add more details. The author is discussing Saeng's silent vow to herself that in the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, she will take the test again. This implies that when the flowers start blooming and spring returns, she will take the test and pass this time.
580	9444	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story in this way to show that Saeng has the strength to attempt something she failed at the first time. She regarded the plant as a memory and a marker of time. Saeng planted it as a reminder of home and her promise. Saeng said, “It's not a real one,” “Not like the kind we had before.” Saeng loved her home and wished to be back there, but her new promise was what truly mattered.
581	9445	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it marks the start of a brand - new day. This implies that the character will take the test on a fresh, budding day. For instance, the return of geese signals spring, and the hibiscus buds during this season. Since the test is in spring, this is the reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
582	9446	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the character intends to take the driving test in spring. Spring symbolizes positive feelings, which she derives from the blooming of the winter hibiscus.
583	9447	4	2	They had to return, so they did. As they walked in, they entered a world in the corner that felt just like the childhood world she had always known it would be.
584	9448	4	2	The last paragraph is written for multiple reasons. Firstly, Saeng will attempt the test again when she deems the time appropriate. Similar to the geese's return, Saeng will come back to take the test, and the Hibiscus plant will bloom once more. She believes it is the right course of action and that the time will be right to retake the test. This paragraph effectively depicts Saeng's approach to life and her resolve to retake the test when the moment feels right.
585	9449	4	2	I'm convinced that the author ends the story this way to show Saeng's determination to pass the test. The quote “She paused as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes.” (Ho) reveals that passing the test held great significance for Saeng. Her tears were a result of her inability to avoid buying the plant and then failing the test. Her sadness at the failure was evident in her crying. The quote “Then I will take the test again.” (Ho) demonstrates that despite the setback, she is resolute in passing the test and achieving success. The failure deeply pained her, and her determination to succeed makes her eager to retake the test. This is crucial as it shows that determination is the key to success, and Saeng clearly possesses it.
586	9450	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's determination and her adaptation to her new home. The statement “I will take that test again” shows her determination, and it also indicates that she has adapted to her new environment.
587	9451	4	2	I believe the author ends the story with this paragraph because the character was distressed about moving and failing her driver's test. After planting the plant, she says that she will retake the driver's test when spring arrives, showing her resolve to move forward.
588	9452	4	2	In Minfong Ho's “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with a paragraph where Saeng vows to take the test again in the spring. Minfong uses this paragraph to convey the message of never giving up, even after an initial failure. For instance, Saeng fails her driver's test but, after purchasing the hibiscus and reflecting, realizes she should persevere.
589	9453	4	2	The author uses the concluding sentence for emphasis. It diverts Saeng's attention from the flower and makes her focus on the test. Waiting until next spring to take the test gives her something to anticipate. This statement also conveys the message that one should never give up on their endeavors. Ending on this note provides a break from the rest of the story and represents Saeng's final thoughts.
590	9454	4	2	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to suggest that when the hibiscus begins to grow again, Saeng will resume what she started. This is evident from her statement, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is blooming, then I will take that test again.”
591	9455	4	2	The author concludes the story with a paragraph to encourage readers to read the entire story rather than merely speculating about its outcome.
592	9456	4	2	The author's conclusion in the story posits that, despite potential changes, the momentum built through teamwork and hard - work should be maintained annually.
593	9457	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to evoke a sense of hope. Saeng endured a difficult period, from failing the test to experiencing a profound sense of loss. However, after finding and planting the hibiscus, she appeared to gain new insight. Although she missed her homeland, the memories provided comfort. Her declaration to retake the test in the spring showcases her determination and new - found confidence. In archetypal terms, spring symbolizes new beginnings and life. As the hibiscus buds, representing rebirth, Saeng will take the test, marking a fresh and improved start for her.
594	9458	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination. She wishes to take the time to adapt to her new life and surroundings, believing that once she has acclimated, this place will start to feel like home. She thinks that getting used to the new place will increase her chances of passing the test, and she is resolute in her goal to pass it.
595	9459	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as when Saeng talked to herself, she promised not to give up on obtaining her license. The hibiscus makes her feel at home again. In the text, the mother says, ""@CAPS1 seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters."" This statement comforts Saeng. Knowing that the hibiscus will remind her of the one at home gives her the strength to attempt the test again in the spring."
596	9460	4	2	The author concludes the story with the line “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This clearly portrays Saeng, the main character, as a persistent individual. Saeng's persistence is evident as she repeatedly attempts the “test” and also strives to adapt to her new country. The aforementioned quote demonstrates that Saeng can endure failure and still be determined to achieve success. Moreover, Saeng's move from one country to another is a significant transition, and her self - confidence in this situation further showcases her persistence. Thus, the author's choice of ending the story with this quote effectively serves the purpose of highlighting Saeng's persistent nature.
597	9461	4	2	The author concludes the story in a certain way to pique the readers' interest and make them eager to read more. For instance, I once read a book that ended with a question, and I was immediately curious to find out the answer, which made me want to continue reading. Another time, I read a book that ended with a statement. I was so intrigued that I wanted to read another book in the series, but unfortunately, there wasn't one, leaving me in the dark about how the story concluded. This shows that authors often end stories in such ways to entice readers to engage with other related works.
598	9462	4	2	The author concludes the story with the specific paragraph for multiple reasons. Firstly, the author aims to convey a sense of hope. When the character vows to take the test again in the last paragraph, it gives an impression that everything will turn out well. Earlier in the story, the character was crying and missing her homeland, creating a troubled and sad tone. The shift to a hopeful tone in the final paragraph is quite evident. Secondly, it shows the growth of the character. The determination to try again after failing the test indicates that the character has become stronger and more resolute. Lastly, the paragraph foreshadows future changes. The imagery of the geese coming back, the snow melting, and the hibiscus budding symbolizes a change in seasons, which represents the internal change in the character and implies that things will be different from now on.
599	9463	4	2	The author concluded the story with that message because, upon reflection, not ending in this way would seem to undermine the entire story and leave an opening for a sequel. It is obvious that the whole point of the story is to make the reader think. By ending the story in this manner, the author encourages the audience to engage deeply with the narrative and draw their own conclusions, thereby achieving the goal of provoking thought.
600	9464	4	2	I firmly believe that the author added this paragraph because it symbolizes a new beginning for the character. Just because she has had a difficult time doesn't mean that difficult times will always be her lot. This addition by the author is a powerful way to suggest that there is hope for a better future for the character, and it adds a positive and forward - looking element to the story.
601	9465	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it held great significance for Saeng. Saeng failed her driving test and was afraid to tell her mother that she had also spent nineteen dollars on “Dok Faeng - noi,” a plant native to their home. For instance, “As Saeng walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant.” The plant Saeng saw was very important to her mother. “@PERSON1 uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. ‘Dok faeng - noi,’ she said. ‘Where did you get it.’” This quote indicates that her mother was excited upon hearing about it. The story concludes with that paragraph because, despite all that Saeng had been through, her mother was glad she bought the plant. “It’s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng - noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.”
602	9466	4	2	Authors sometimes use intricate sentences as their concluding sentences, which can be difficult to understand. In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes by stating, “When they come back. Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author says this to show that Saeng is not yet ready and needs to learn more. The mother is very disappointed in her daughter for buying an expensive plant, which demonstrates her inexperience as buying things based on emotions is wrong. This is evident when they say, “I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” “You what?” She also says, “@CAPS1 facing. Na where did you get that,” showing her surprise at the expensive and beautiful plant. Authors use such paragraphs and sentences to show or recap the story. The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes her story with that paragraph because Saeng should not have bought the plant based solely on her emotions and that she should try again next year to avoid making mistakes.
603	9467	4	2	The author of the passage ends the story with these statements to create curiosity. This curiosity is created by referring to the spring and the return of the geese. Spring is the beginning for many creatures on Earth; thus, Saeng is attempting to start over as she must wait for spring. The hibiscus reinforces the feeling of a new beginning, as each year new buds grow, just as she can have a second chance. Saeng waits for spring because she knows it is when everything else creates new life, so she must wait until then to have her new beginning.
604	9468	4	2	I believe the author ended the story with that paragraph because it represents the time when she thinks Saeng will be ready to retake the driver’s test. Before making this decision, Saeng was disheartened due to failing the test. Perhaps she chose spring because it gives her time to gather herself and practice between then and spring. By waiting for spring, she hopes to be better prepared and more likely to succeed on her next attempt.
605	9469	4	2	The author includes the sentence, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to showcase her determination. Saeng is resolute in her goal to pass the test. Even though she is facing challenges adapting to @LOCATION1, she is determined to succeed there. So, she will wait a year and then try again when she is better prepared, demonstrating her strong will and commitment to achieving her goal.
606	9470	4	2	"The narrative follows a girl who has recently moved from Vietnam to the United States. Initially, she finds it difficult to understand her new surroundings, and various things trigger memories of Vietnam. After failing a test, Saeng tells her mother, ""I - I failed the test."" Her mother understands the reason behind the failure and allows Saeng to keep the hibiscus as it brings her comfort. Despite missing Vietnam, Saeng is determined to overcome the obstacles in her new life."
607	9471	4	2	The author concludes the paragraph to enhance clarity for readers, enabling them to better understand the content. Additionally, this approach makes the paragraph stand out.
608	9472	4	2	The author ended the story with that paragraph as it conveys that over time, once the character has adapted to everything, she will be capable of taking the test. This is why the statement “...and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding...” is included. It emphasizes that all it requires is time - time to warm up and time to grow. Moreover, the paragraph is well - crafted and relevant to the entire story. Thus, the author concluded with a highly appropriate paragraph that made perfect sense in relation to the narrative.
609	9473	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Ho concludes the story with a particular paragraph because the flower symbolizes the protagonist's happiness from her homeland. The flower represents the past and a sense of comfort. When Saeng started to plant the ""winter hibiscus,"" she began to hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen, and all her senses returned, making her happy. Similarly, the author uses the geese to illustrate Saeng's comfort. The country around her gradually felt like home as she became familiar with her surroundings. Throughout the story, there are numerous references to home as it is a place of comfort and happiness. As a result, Saeng gains more confidence, which explains why Ho concluded the story with that sentence."
610	9474	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the [@CAPS1] melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This paragraph holds a profound meaning for the author, similar to the meaning of life. It implies that it's okay to make mistakes; one should simply try again and strive for improvement.
611	9475	4	2	She concludes the paragraph with the story as she sincerely hopes people will recognize that she is having a great deal of fun and always will. Moreover, she loves her current location. She is making her mark in the world, and she adores watching the flowers, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus. These indicate that her favorite activity is related to flowers.
612	9476	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to reiterate the significant elements within it. The statement “I will take that test again” refers to the test she failed on that day. This test evaluated her memory of her home. Her native country held great importance for her. The part of the quote “when they come back.... when they show me it and the geese return” corresponds to her realization that many things she once considered strange had become almost familiar, similar to the geese. She implies that she is gradually getting accustomed to everything in this country, just as the geese fly south every winter. When she mentions “and this hibiscus is budding,” she suggests that she will recall all the things she forgot upon moving to this country. When she reached the hibiscus, she gently touched a petal. It felt smooth and cool, with a velvety texture towards the center, exactly as she expected. Overall, this statement conveys that as this country becomes more familiar, she is starting to forget aspects of her own country. However, when the geese return, which means at @DATE1, she will remember again and retake the knowledge test and pass it.
613	9477	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that the plant symbolizes new beginnings, which represents Saeng's vow. In the story, taking care of the plant teaches Saeng responsibility in obtaining her license. By caring for the plant, it will instill patience in her and help her learn from her mistakes.
614	9478	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that the protagonist is not ready to abandon her new life. Saeng failed her driver's test and was extremely disappointed. She also disliked her new home and felt too unsettled to feel at ease. She missed her old home and was on the verge of giving up. After a conversation with her mother, her hopes were rekindled. The author uses this paragraph to indicate that in the end, she still has hope and will try again when she is ready. As she says, “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again.”
615	9479	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way to convey a particular tone. The paragraph showcases Saeng's determination to try again and succeed. This imparts a valuable lesson to the reader: to strive their hardest and never give up. The final paragraph concludes the story with an air of curiosity, leaving the reader eager to know more, especially whether she will pass the test.
616	9480	4	2	I believe the concluding paragraph implies that after all significant events have transpired, she will take the test as it is essentially the final step. Moreover, I am of the opinion that she will pass it because it is destined to be so.
617	9481	4	2	I believe Saeng made that silent vow to herself because after the plant endures the harsh winter and everything returns to a state she prefers, with the plant starting to bud again, it symbolizes her difficult experience of moving. If the plant she loves so dearly can survive, then she believes she can too.
618	9482	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concludes the story with the excerpt “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. This emphasizes both Saeng's pain of coming to an unfamiliar place and failing her first test, and her determination to work hard after seeing a flower reminiscent of home. The flower holds great significance for Saeng. For instance, the text describes it as “And besides it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers”, demonstrating Saeng's love for her hometown through this familiar flower. Another example is when Saeng told her mother about failing the test, and her mother's attention was immediately drawn to the flower. In conclusion, the hibiscus flower is Saeng's source of strength as it is the only familiar thing in the United States. Saeng aims to show the same resilience on her test as the flower shows in the harsh winter."
619	9483	4	2	The author concludes the story with the aforementioned paragraph to illustrate the connection between the hibiscus's budding and Saeng's regained resolve. In the photograph for the relevant question, the hibiscus flower seems out of place, much like Saeng. The hibiscus represents a link to Saeng's past, as shown when the author writes, “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world”. Being native to her homeland, the hibiscus helps Saeng remember her past, enabling her to cope with the present and look forward to the future. As Saeng silently vows, “when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again”.
620	9484	4	2	Through this quote, the author is suggesting that Saeng will eventually be prepared for her test. When the geese return, they are ready to end their migration, and when the hibiscus is budding, it is on the verge of becoming a beautiful flower. Saeng believes that in the spring, just as the flower and the geese are ready, she too will be ready to take the test.
621	9485	4	2	"The author concludes the passage with this paragraph as the narrator is now ready to accept and adapt to her new environment, similar to how a flower would. Geese prefer warm climates over cold ones, so they fly south for the winter. Saeng's ""comfort zone"" is @LOCATION1, where she has numerous childhood memories, including those of her grandmother and the hibiscus flower. She is accustomed to the flower thriving in a warm environment. Therefore, when the geese return in spring and the flower blossoms anew, she will be better prepared to adapt to @CAPS1 life and take her driver's test. The geese and the hibiscus flower symbolize her old home in @LOCATION1, which she misses dearly. After these events, she will attempt to adapt to the ways of life in @CAPS1."
622	9486	4	2	Saeng is set to return to her homeland, marking the end of her time away and the beginning of a new chapter in the place she holds dear.
623	9487	4	2	"In the passage ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with the phrase ""when they came back, Saeng vows silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again."" I believe the author ends the story this way because Saeng is showing a change. Just as the birds fly away and then return with the changing seasons, Saeng is indicating her readiness to face challenges again. For instance, when she mentions the birds easing into the hibiscus, it implies a sense of harmony and the cyclical nature of life. The last paragraph suggests that Saeng plans to stay and continue pursuing what she desires in the next season. This is what the final paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" means to me."
624	9488	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that when spring arrives and the geese are present, Saeng silently vows to herself that she will retake the permit test. This ending shows her determination to move forward and overcome obstacles in her new situation.
625	9489	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to showcase Saeng's determination to survive and find happiness in her new home. Despite being dissatisfied with her purchase, she is attempting to make her new place feel more like home. When she says, ""will take that test again,"" it reveals her desire for a comfortable and familiar environment. Ending with this paragraph also emphasizes the strength of the seasons and Saeng's resolve to start anew in her life. She is content for the moment but plans to please herself and her mother in the spring. This paragraph serves as a promise to discover a new way of living and make friends. The plant symbolizes her transformation; she will explore and pass her own tests, proving that she deserves to be happy and feel at home."
626	9490	4	2	In the story, the author concludes the paragraph as it demonstrates that during spring, there are geese that linger around the garden. This conclusion effectively conveys this seasonal sight to the readers.
627	9491	4	2	In this story, the author explains how challenging certain changes can be. Additionally, the author elaborates on how family and items from home, like flowers, can offer comfort. The essence of the story is to present one of the author's life experiences.
628	9492	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story at this point to convey to the reader that the little girl isn't ready to give up on planting flowers. When spring arrives and the snow melts, she intends to plant more and see how they fare during the season. Despite the lack of success in winter, she refuses to be deterred. The author seems to be suggesting that if an attempt fails, one should persevere, as different outcomes may occur.
629	9493	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with the line “When they come back take that test again.” This is done to show that the character still harbors hope and won't quit. After experiencing a great deal of hardship upon moving and seemingly being in a state of depression throughout the story, she finally regains the motivation to tell herself to keep trying. The statement “I will take that test again” clearly indicates hope. Also, when “in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept,” it's evident that the plant reminds her of home. In my opinion, ending the passage with this positive attitude was a very wise decision.
630	9494	4	2	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph for several reasons. Firstly, it makes the reader aware that Saeng will never stop trying. Secondly, something as unassuming as a flower can inspire someone to persevere, even when they feel they have no purpose. Saeng considers the flower so significant that working harder will spur her on to do her best. The author concludes with this powerful sentence as it instills courage in Saeng.
631	9495	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way as the protagonist had already failed the test and aimed to pass it next time, so as not to disappoint her mother.
632	9496	4	2	In my opinion, when the narrator says this, she wishes to return when everything is beautiful again. She wants to wait for all the snow to melt and the geese to come back so that she can see the colors of the flowers. And if she passes her test this time, she'll get to drive past all the flowers. That's what I think the character means in this story.
633	9497	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng will not give up, just like the hibiscus. Earlier in the story, it is mentioned that the winter hibiscus does not die. In the paragraph, the phrase “the snows melt” implies that the seasons will continue to change, and Saeng should also keep persevering. Similarly, “and the geese return” indicates that the geese will keep coming back, which serves as a metaphor for Saeng's continuous attempts at taking the test.
634	9498	4	2	I believe the author included the lines “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again” in the last paragraph because they really liked the idea.
635	9499	4	2	I think the author concludes those paragraphs to add more depth and meaning to the story. Perhaps the author intended to provide more detailed insights into the narrative.
636	9500	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate how the protagonist, Saeng, will embark on a new start by retaking the test, paralleling the hibiscus budding new flowers after a dormant period. Just as the hibiscus and geese overcome the challenges of winter, Saeng demonstrates her resolve to surmount the obstacles she encounters. In the narrative, the hibiscus symbolizes the means of adapting to life's changes. The winter hibiscus can be seen as a representation of Saeng, as it adjusts to the harsh winter conditions. Similarly, Saeng must confront the difficulties of being in a new country and retake her driver's exam. This connection between Saeng and the hibiscus emphasizes her resilience and determination to thrive in her new environment.
637	9501	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” to show Saeng's commitment to adapting to her new home and leaving her old one behind. For instance, in the story, Saeng couldn't say “I mean, not like the kind we had at home.” without breaking into tears, which shows her sadness and struggle to let go of her past. By choosing this conclusion, the author highlights Saeng's determination to move forward and embrace her new life, despite the emotional ties to her homeland.
638	9502	4	2	There are multiple reasons why the author might have concluded the story with that particular paragraph. It is likely that the author intended to convey that Saeng is eager to adapt to her new environment and is neither a failure nor a quitter. Additionally, ending the story in this way may be a means to demonstrate Saeng's determination to achieve success and bring happiness to her mother. Overall, these motives explain the author's choice of concluding the story with the given paragraph, as it effectively portrays Saeng's positive and determined character.
639	9503	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the winter hibiscus offers Saeng a faint glimmer of hope. The hibiscus evokes memories of her homeland, Vietnam, bringing her a sense of pleasure. Moreover, the fact that the hibiscus she buys can endure the winter, unlike those in her native land, symbolizes Saeng's determination to adapt to her new country. The future of the hibiscus serves as a metaphor for Saeng's ability to survive and adjust to her new surroundings, which includes retaking her driving test. This connection between Saeng and the hibiscus enriches the story and emphasizes her journey of adaptation.
640	9504	4	2	The author concludes her story with this statement for several reasons. Firstly, just as the hibiscus will regain its strength once the wind ceases to blow, Saeng will also find her inner strength. Additionally, Saeng is allowing herself time to acclimate to her new environment and is setting a tangible goal for herself. She identifies with the flower, which provides her with comfort and evokes precious memories of her beloved homeland and her grandmother. By concluding the story in this way, the author effectively conveys Saeng's process of emotional healing and her determination to build a new life.
641	9505	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's determination. In the story, when Saeng sees the hibiscus plant, she is filled with joy. She also tries to recall doing her grandmother's hair, viewing it as a self - test. She wants to see if she can move forward and not dwell on the past. When she is away from home, she says, “I failed the test.” This shows that while she desires to move on, it is not as easy as she hoped. The mention of the hibiscus in this paragraph symbolizes life and indicates that Saeng is attempting to move on, and she is distinct from an English person in her self - journey.
642	9506	4	2	In my opinion, in the story, Saeng is sad because she misses her home and the hibiscus flower. She concludes the story effectively as she can now achieve a sense of inner peace by waiting to retake the test. I think this is the reason she ended the story in this way, to avoid leaving herself worried or angry. When she says she will retake the test when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, she manages to transform a negative attitude into a positive one.
643	9507	4	2	The author concludes the story with this sentence to illustrate that Saeng will attempt to adapt to her new home. It indicates that Saeng will no longer grieve and be sad; instead, she will adapt and continue with her life. The author includes the line “I mean, not like the kind we had @NUM1at - ”. This occurs when Saeng has just returned home and talked to her mother, and she is extremely sad as she reminisces about old memories of her former home. However, the last statement of the story shows that Saeng has decided to move on and stop being sad. She has set a goal to accept her new situation, which is why the author concludes the story in this manner.
644	9508	4	2	Many authors conclude their stories in diverse ways. Minfong Ho ended hers almost like a proverb. One reason for this ending is that it somewhat reveals Saeng's future. For example, the statement “I will take that test again” at the end implies that the author might write another story about Saeng when she takes the test. Another example is that it shows Saeng is strong and will try again. When the author says “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” the “hibiscus” refers to Saeng. Without these writing techniques and hints, we might not know if there will be a sequel and what could happen.
645	9509	4	2	The author likely included this in the story to depict change. In all things we do, we should understand the author's intention. People often overlook the minor damages that accompany major changes. The small changes are significant as they are turning points. Additionally, we all face difficult situations, both big and small, and we must overcome them all. Just as we need to deal with the old ways of doing things, we should also focus on moving forward and adapting to change.
646	9510	4	2	This paragraph is of great significance for the narrator to include in the story. For example, Saeng expresses that her new home with the flowers holds more importance than school and a test. Moreover, Saeng has few friends at school, yet the hibiscus will evoke memories of all her former friends. Saeng simply tells herself that once everything returns to normal or the way she desires, she can retake the test. In conclusion, the narrator uses this paragraph to convey Saeng's feelings.
647	9511	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it effectively concludes and wraps up the narrative. It illustrates the relationship between nature, the process of adapting, and how these elements soothed her after failing the test. This conclusion serves to provide a sense of closure and understanding to the overall story.
648	9512	4	2	The author concludes the story with such a sentence because as winter transitions into spring, the snow melts, and trees and flowers blossom into an array of colorful blooms. After the flowers have fully blossomed, the leaves emerge, and the pollen finds its way to the appropriate trees. As the end of [DATE2] approaches and fall sets in, the leaves begin to wither, change color, and eventually fall off. Then, the snow blankets the ground once again, marking the cycle's return.
649	9513	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This shows that Saeng refuses to remain defeated. Just as the hibiscus will overcome winter, as Saeng's mother says, “...but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters.” This symbolizes Saeng's ability to overcome not only failing the driver's test but also the challenges of moving to [LOCATION1]. She has changed from her former self back home, yet she is strong enough to navigate this life - changing transition. Taking the test in the spring symbolizes a fresh start, a time when everything is new, and she has overcome her difficult period. This ending paragraph is crucial as it showcases Saeng's promise to herself that she will surmount the challenges in front of her and those yet to come. When Saeng says “...When the snows melt...”, it symbolizes the time in her life when her failures will turn into something positive. She will approach the test with a new perspective on life. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize that Saeng will not stay down.
650	9514	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “Where Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Minpong Ho does so because Saeng failed the test. Saeng was unable to find the fine - toothed comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well, and her gentle grandmother. Apparently, these things can be found after the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. This ending shows that Saeng is looking forward to a new opportunity when the natural cycle renews, symbolizing her hope for a better outcome in the future.
651	9515	4	2	"The author employs the concluding paragraph to convey Saeng's perspective on the future. This conclusion is apt as it integrates multiple elements from the story and showcases Saeng's growth. Saeng mentions, ""When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" Through this statement, she demonstrates an increasing acceptance and even fondness for her new homeland. The geese, once regarded as ""strange,"" are now ""familiar to Saeng."" The hibiscus represents a part of her past, adapted to her present circumstances. Saeng's vow to ""take that test again"" in the spring, as indicated by ""When the snows melt…"" etc., reveals that despite significant losses - her home, grandmother, and way of life - she remains determined to make the best of her situation. She is resolute in passing her driving test come spring, regardless of the challenges. The concluding paragraph effectively wraps up the story, intertwining the threads of Saeng's past and present and revealing her attitude towards the future. With its optimistic tone, it nearly reconciles the mood of optimism with a tinge of regret. The author's choice of words is commendable."
652	9516	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as the story contains the statement ""I will take that test again."" This implies that the character is going to assess how well she has adapted to the changes in her life. Additionally, the story mentions ""when they come back,"" which suggests that when the flowers return in the next season, she will reflect on her memories of her homeland, her grandmother, and the positive aspects of her past. This conclusion allows the reader to understand the character's journey of self - discovery and adaptation in the face of change."
653	9517	4	2	The author concludes the story with this particular paragraph to convey to the reader that there will be a subsequent story. Moreover, it is used to illustrate that Saeng was not pleased with the melting of the snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus. This ending leaves the reader with a sense of anticipation for what is to come while also highlighting Saeng's complex emotions in the given situation, thus successfully fulfilling the author's intended purposes in concluding the story this way.
654	9518	4	2	In my opinion, now that the narrator has shown that the girl has gained a great deal of knowledge about plants, it appears that she is interested in the new world and the diverse, beautiful plants that bloom during the season. To me, it's evident that the girl truly enjoys these plants. I believe she is an adventurous individual who has a strong desire to explore new worlds and uncover the mysteries that await. Her enthusiasm for the plants and the new environment showcases her inquisitive nature and eagerness to learn about what lies beyond her current experiences.
655	9519	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it demonstrates that Saeng can overcome her weaknesses and achieve success in her new home. The statement “In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” indicates that she will attempt the test anew. By doing so, she aims to become more comfortable in her new surroundings and learn from the experience. This conclusion emphasizes Saeng's resilience and her determination to make the most of her new life.
656	9520	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for multiple reasons. Firstly, it demonstrates that Saeng is a determined young girl. By vowing to retake the “test”, she shows her resolve and refusal to give up. Secondly, the author intended to emphasize the significance of Saeng's personality. The conclusion effectively encapsulates these key aspects of the character.
657	9521	4	2	Minfong Ho concluded the story with this passage as it showcases Saeng's determination to pass the driver's test. Failing the test made her feel bad and triggered feelings of homesickness, similar to the effect of the familiar plant. In the final paragraph, she vows to overcome the challenges of being in an unfamiliar place, much like the winter hibiscus, and pull herself together to achieve her goal. This ending effectively portrays Saeng's resilience.
658	9522	4	2	The author included this sentence in the paragraph because Saeng was an extremely determined girl. She would persevere until she achieved success. Regardless of the time and effort required, she would complete the task. Just like the hibiscus flower beside the highway, which seemed out of place but did everything to survive. It is difficult to be strong when one can only rely on oneself, but Saeng draws determination from her losses and the tenacity of the hibiscus flower. This inclusion highlights Saeng's indomitable spirit.
659	9523	4	2	In the concluding statement, Saeng says, “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The author concludes the story with this passage as she uses the hibiscus as an example of survival. The hibiscus, like Saeng, is from another place, and she uses it to represent her well - being in the new place. In a sense, she is saying that if the hibiscus can survive the winter, so can she. I believe she uses this as a conclusion to portray her uncertainty about her new home, effectively capturing her complex emotions.
660	9524	4	2	I think the author uses this as the last paragraph because it reveals how Saeng wants to overcome difficulties and be strong despite missing her home. For instance, Saeng thought that since she cried upon seeing the hibiscus plant, she had failed, but she believes she will grow stronger over time. This last paragraph effectively conveys Saeng's journey of self - improvement and resilience.
661	9525	4	2	The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to summarize the realization and determination that Saeng attains. Initially, Saeng is upset after failing her test. When she spots the flower and goes to a shop to find it, she is deeply affected by this small reminder of her former home. This tiny flower makes her realize how much she misses her old home, and purchasing it becomes essential for her. She likely feels that with the flower, she will always have a piece of home in this new world. After recognizing that memories are crucial and witnessing the flower's determination to survive a cold winter, she develops the resolve to retake the test. She vows to do so as she has gained faith from the flower's survival and her understanding of the importance of memories. In conclusion, the ending paragraph conveys these specific messages.
662	9526	4	2	The author was inspired by the flower, which has the ability to endure harsh winters and adapt to new environments. She decides that she will overcome her obstacles, just as the flower overcomes its challenges every winter. This inspiration from the flower's resilience drives her to face her difficulties head - on, and she is determined to persevere in the same way the flower does.
663	9527	4	2	Memory, promise, and life are the concepts that explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Memory is a significant factor as Saeng misses her old life and country. Promise also plays a role because Saeng vows to retake the test once spring arrives. Life is another aspect; Saeng buys the flower and plants it so that it can thrive when spring comes, and she also decides to retake the test at that time. Memories will resurface in the spring, along with the promises she has made and the new life she wishes to start. By planting the hibiscus, which evokes many memories from her past, Saeng is taking steps towards fulfilling these aspects. In summary, these three ideas - memory, promise, and life - justify the author's choice of concluding the story with this paragraph.
664	9528	4	2	The author concludes the story with that statement because the weather had turned colder, and all the plants and flowers were on the verge of dying. This change in the environment likely serves as a significant event in the story, and the author uses this statement to bring the story to a close, perhaps highlighting the impact of the changing seasons on the setting and the characters.
665	9529	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with the mentioned saying for several reasons. Firstly, the character was extremely eager to pass the test. She promised herself and vowed to retake the test when the geese return and the snow melts. Secondly, she failed the test the first time, and passing it is of great importance to her, which makes her highly motivated. These factors explain why I think the author included this in the story. The character's strong desire to succeed and her determination to try again are the key reasons for the author's choice of conclusion.
666	9530	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng fails her driver's test. While walking home, she spots a flower that evokes memories of her former home. She purchases the flower and returns to her new residence where her mother is gardening. They decide to plant the flower in the garden. As soon as the flower is planted, a flock of geese flies overhead. Saeng then realizes that what was once strange to her now feels familiar. She concludes the story by stating that when the geese return in spring, she will retake the test. She believes that by then, the flower will be blooming, signifying growth, and she too will have grown accustomed to her surroundings, making her ready for the test, just as the geese are ready to come home and the hibiscus is ready to bloom.
667	9531	4	2	The author employs this comparison to a plant because when the plant begins to bloom, the character's confidence will be restored. By concluding the story with this paragraph, the author imparts meaning to the narrative, enhancing its depth and resonance.
668	9532	4	2	The author concludes the story with the specified paragraph to emphasize its content and increase its allure, enticing readers to continue and discover what unfolds next.
669	9533	4	2	I believe the author included the last paragraph in the story to demonstrate the character's determination to pass the test and highlight its significance to her. This is the reason I think the author chose to incorporate this element into the story.
670	9534	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph as it illustrates the connection between nature and the girl. The paragraph states, “...when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (No @NUM1). Spring, when these events occur, is a symbol of life, birth, and renewal. The return of the geese represents symbolic “renewal.” When the snow melts and the grass becomes visible, it is a sign of life. When plants bud, it is a sign of new beginnings. The character decides that when nature is symbolically reborn and renewed, she will also start afresh, mirroring the cycle of nature.
671	9535	4	2	He concludes the story with that paragraph to convey that he intends to retake the test when it is not winter. Saeng also vowed to herself to retake the test outside of winter, as the test was not passed in winter, and it could have been passed when the snow on the ground melted.
672	9536	4	2	In the story, the author included the concluding paragraph. If one reads the rest of the story, they'll know the person mentioned wanting to retake the test upon her return because the weather would be nicer than when she first took it. Another reason the author added this conclusion at the end of the novel is to test if readers truly understood the novel and its underlying message. The author aimed to help readers better comprehend the book's ending through this concluding paragraph. These are the reasons I believe the author included the concluding paragraph at the end of the novel.
673	9537	4	2	They wanted to finish the story quickly, so they made the ending similar to the beginning. I really like the part when the birds returned and some of the flowers came back with them. This ending, with the return of the birds and flowers, brings a sense of renewal and makes the story more engaging.
674	9538	4	2	Saeng and her mother must be determined to do their best to survive. They have endured a great deal, and when Saeng failed the test, she was more depressed than before. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to let readers understand what it means to be determined to adapt and survive in a new place. Even though Saeng and her mother are away from their homeland, they still enjoy things from Vietnam, such as flowers, hot peppers, and bitter melons. Her friends may not like the taste, but it doesn't stop her from loving these things. This shows their strong connection to their roots and their ability to find joy in the familiar.
675	9539	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it demonstrates that she won't stop trying and will pass the test one day. She made a vow to herself, which shows her determination to overcome challenges. It also makes readers eager to find out if she will follow through on her vow and pass the test. For instance, the story ends with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again.” This ending leaves readers with a sense of anticipation and hope for Saeng's future.
676	9540	4	2	The author concluded the story in this way because she held a different perspective of Saeng. Saeng would believe that in each season, the author would be in a different mood, and the garden would change accordingly. As a result, Saeng's mom would always be outside during every season.
677	9541	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate how a memory can instill determination in a person. For instance, Saeng failed her driver's test, but when she came across the hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her former home. Moreover, while planting the plant, she regarded the geese with a new sense of familiarity. These two experiences combined make her determined to retake and pass the test. Having reminders of both her old and new homes comforts her, assuring her that she can adapt easily and cherish her memories.
678	9542	4	2	He stated that one should not give up and should keep persevering, just like the plants in spring. The plants in spring keep growing despite various challenges, and similarly, people should keep trying in the face of difficulties.
679	9543	4	2	I believe it's a great thing when people make vows to themselves. The author concludes the story with that paragraph as she's promising herself to retake the test in spring when the hibiscus is budding. She realizes the need to take the test and start driving, and this self - commitment is a positive step towards achieving her goal.
680	9544	4	2	He is referring to Saeng's lifestyle, including the activities they engage in, as well as the weather conditions of the area. Understanding these aspects helps in getting a comprehensive view of Saeng's living situation.
681	9545	4	2	The author concluded the story with that particular phrase to convey that she will await the next year and repeat the entire process. She will patiently wait for it, once again demonstrating her ability to persevere and indicating that she has grown accustomed to her current living situation.
682	9546	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to signify a new beginning in the spring. Just as flowers blossom and sprout buds during this season, she will transform into a better - version of herself. This is the reason why the author chose this way to end the story.
683	9547	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng will retake the test and embark on a fresh start. It also imparts a valuable lesson to readers: if you fail at something initially, don't be afraid to make another attempt. I believe the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng as she failed the test in winter and is dissatisfied with her current circumstances. However, come spring, when the hibiscus has buds, she will have a new chance at the test, much like the flower finding a new environment to thrive in.
684	9548	4	2	The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph as it allows readers to interpret and draw their own conclusions. It doesn't explicitly state the purpose of the test or whether she passed it; these are left for the readers to determine. Moreover, it leaves readers in suspense about what will happen next. The ending of the story is open - ended, and its meaning can vary from person to person.
685	9549	4	2	The author ended the story with that paragraph because it reveals when she intends to retake the test and make changes in her evolving life. For instance, in the story, she is sad because she failed the test and yearns to go home. If she passes the test in spring, she might decide to make changes and settle down. This is the rationale behind the author's choice to conclude the story with that paragraph.
686	9550	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng has finally become comfortable in her new ""home."" After the passage largely reflects on Saeng's old life, this ending signifies her adaptation to the new way of life. For instance, the mention of ""in the spring, and the geese return…"" indicates that she has grown accustomed to the geese and the natural environment of her new world. Additionally, the author uses this paragraph to convey a sense of release. Saeng had numerous memories from her old life that hindered her from embracing new experiences in her new home. The author's use of this paragraph effectively closes the story, allowing the reader to envision the relaxed scene of the birds flying away, symbolizing Saeng's escape from pain and her integration into the new world."
687	9551	4	2	The final paragraph of the story offers a profound revelation to the reader. Through her mother's understanding and the presence of the hibiscus plant, Saeng is granted new hope. Initially, upon seeing the hibiscus that reminded her of her homeland, she felt hopeless, miserable, and out of place. However, when she returned home and witnessed the plant's roots buried in the ground, a new determination welled up within her. The hibiscus serves as a powerful symbol for Saeng. Just as the plant adapts to survive in cold weather, Saeng endures difficult times in a new country. The roots represent her past; though buried, they are not forgotten. The flower itself symbolizes Saeng's new life in a foreign land. Author Minfong Ho employs personification, attributing human qualities to non - living things, in this story. This creative choice explains the significance of the last paragraph and why it was used in this way.
688	9552	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to showcase Saeng's determination. Moreover, it draws a parallel between the driver's test and the hibiscus plant. The text implies that when everything around her begins to thrive, Saeng will also achieve her goals. She relies on the motivation provided by her surroundings to persevere. Throughout the narrative, Saeng is deeply influenced by her environment. For example, when she enters the greenhouse, it transports her back to her childhood. As described, ""It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery.... Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world."" This connection emphasizes how her surroundings shape her mindset and drive her forward."
689	9553	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" after failing her test, Saeng finds solace in the hibiscus plant. The plant evokes memories of her home and links her to her past experiences. Despite the initial test failure, Saeng believes that with study and another attempt, she can pass. This parallels the hibiscus plant, which withers in winter but blossoms beautifully in spring. Saeng identifies with the plant's rebirth and feels that she too can start afresh and succeed on the test. This is why the author includes the paragraph where Saeng vows to retake the test when spring arrives and the hibiscus blooms, highlighting her resilience and hope for a new beginning."
690	9554	4	2	"In the story, the author concludes with Saeng silently vowing to herself, ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author ends the story in this way because Saeng is expressing her belief that the right time will come for her to retake the test. She has faith in herself and is confident that she will pass. This ending encapsulates Saeng's determination and the hope that comes with the renewal of nature in spring, suggesting that she can overcome her previous failure and achieve success."
691	9555	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that in due time, the protagonist will retake the test she failed, believing the hibiscus will assist her in surmounting obstacles. Presumably, she purchased the plant upon failing the test, hoping that as it blossoms, it will indicate when she is ready to attempt the test again.
692	9556	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it meaningfully summarizes the events. All that happened to Saeng during her time at the florist can be seen as a form of seeking some form of resolution. Saeng was initially sad because she failed her driving test. In the final paragraph, she vows to retake the test when the hibiscus buds. The hibiscus she bought will start budding in spring when the snow melts. The last paragraph allows Saeng to cope with her winter - time nostalgia. The geese flying south make her sad, but they also inspire her. She tells herself that she will retake the driving test when the geese return, the hibiscus buds, and the snow melts.
693	9557	4	2	In the last paragraph, it's trying to convey what's to come. Once winter ends, spring arrives, and the hibiscus will bloom again, making it feel like home. The return of the geese also prompts her to retake the quiz. For her, it's like a fresh start, and hopefully, she'll pass. Since she loves the hibiscus, its return might help her perform much better. Overall, a new phase is approaching.
694	9558	4	2	I believe the author of “Winter Hibiscus” ended the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because it highlights the significance of the plant and how it will aid her in passing the test. The plant symbolizes that just as it buds and overcomes obstacles to survive, she will overcome the hurdles to pass her driving test. For instance, when the story says “When the snows melt and then geese return,” the author is linking Saeng's struggle to pass the test with the challenges of surviving winter. The quote “Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly disappearing into the distance” implies that she will face her challenge and overcome it. In conclusion, this quote shows the parallel struggles of the flower, Saeng, and the geese to overcome challenges and complete what they've started.
695	9559	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it holds significance. The author implies that when these animals and living beings get their opportunities, so will she. For example, the geese will return, the hibiscus will have its chance to bud, and she will get the chance to take her driver's test. This is evident as Saeng's mother talks about how wonderful the plant will be in spring and says, “But it's strong enough to make it through the cold months.” This shows that the mother is trying to tell her that she will get a second chance, which is why the story ends with that sentence.
696	9560	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it describes the seasons, their changes, and their cycles. A new season brings something different. I believe the story is titled ""Winter Hibiscus"" because winter follows spring. In spring, there are beautiful, fragrant flowers, but when spring ends and winter arrives, the plants die and are no longer the same as before."
697	9561	4	2	In “Winter Hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho, Saeng persists and never gives up. The author concludes the story with a short yet profoundly meaningful paragraph. When Saeng says, “…in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” she demonstrates a spirit of perseverance, a willingness to embrace new opportunities, and a constant remembrance of her homeland. Ending the story in this inspiring way reinforces the theme, and a great deal can be gleaned from these few words.
698	9562	4	2	The author's choice to end the story with the final paragraph can be attributed to multiple factors. Saeng declares that she will retake her driving test in the spring. In archetypal terms, spring represents a fresh start or a new opportunity. By ending the story with this archetype, it is implied that Saeng will have another chance to succeed in her test and to fully embrace her life in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new circumstances. When Saeng purchases the hibiscus plant, it evokes memories of her old home in Vietnam and the wonderful moments she spent there. The plant seems to instill hope in her, and the last paragraph of the story makes mention of the hibiscus. This indicates that having the hibiscus around will give her the hope of passing her test and adjusting to @LOCATION1 while still cherishing the memories of her homeland.
699	9563	4	2	The author concludes the story with this statement to convey that when the plants resume growing and the geese return, she will make another attempt. For instance, the plants must regrow their petals, and the geese must rebuild their homes and find food. The author is suggesting that she will retake the test when the geese come back and the plants start to grow again.
700	9564	4	2	The author wrote this paragraph because the character went inside the house to have dinner and won't see the garden again until another day. With winter approaching, she won't be able to play outside until winter passes. As she states, “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This quotation explains the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph.
701	9565	4	2	The narrator concludes in this way because, upon reflection, it presents a form of solution. Conventionally, a solution is placed at the end, which is why the narrator chose this placement.
702	9566	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng is not giving up and has found a hobby to anticipate. For instance, “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it; overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by.” This is the reason the author ends the story with this paragraph.
703	9567	4	2	The author concludes the story with the specific quote to illustrate an understanding of the beauty and marvels of nature. Saeng spent a significant amount of money on a unique flower, the dok faeng - nol. While taking her driver's license test and failing, she discovered this plant. Despite her shame at failing the test, she showed the flower, different from the ones at home, to her mother. Her mother was pleased with the flower and understood her test failure. The mother's comment, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters,” is a figurative way of suggesting there is hope for Saeng to pass her test after further learning. The geese flying away for winter and returning in spring symbolize a fresh start at achieving success.
704	9568	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way because currently, the outside conditions are unfavorable for taking the test. When the weather turns warm and pleasant, they will attempt the test again.
705	9569	4	2	The last statement is truly powerful. Despite failing her driver's test, Saeng realizes she must remain strong and patient. As the geese return and the snow melts, she will be determined to retake the test and pass. Saeng bought the hibiscus to evoke a sense of being back in Vietnam, filling the void in her heart for her homeland. When she says, “I paid nineteen dollars for it,” it shows her disappointment at failing the test and the shock of the flower's high cost in the United States compared to its free availability in Vietnam. Since the hibiscus is a tropical flower, its blooming in spring represents her readiness to retake the test.
706	9570	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way as it implies that if the plant revives and blossoms, the protagonist will retake the test and strive to pass. She is aware that passing the test will be arduous, yet she believes she can succeed, just as she is certain that the plant will endure the winter and bloom in spring. This comparison gives her the confidence that if the plant can overcome the harsh winter, she can pass the test. Hence, this is the reason the author ended the story thus.
707	9571	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story by stating that the character will retake the driver's test. This is because not only will she attempt the test again, but she will also feel more at ease in her life. The driver's test is not the core issue; rather, it is the difficulty of adapting to the new environment that causes Saeng great distress. For instance, in the text, Saeng has thoughts like “A wave of loss so deep and strong stung Saeng’s eyes now and swept over her” and “in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” This shows that Saeng is struggling to readjust to her new life, is reminded of her past in her old home, and cries due to its loss. I believe that failing the driver's test was the final straw that made her cry under the stress. When she said “and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again,” it indicates that she will overcome all these challenges and move forward.
708	9572	4	2	It was a wise choice for the author to conclude the story with this paragraph. Saeng has a deep affection for the hibiscus. When spring arrives and the hibiscus blooms, it will be the ideal time for her to retake the driving test after her previous failure. This timing is likely to boost her confidence for the test. In conclusion, this is the reason why the author ended the story with this paragraph.
709	9573	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner because the character implies that she will grow with the changing seasons. She is in a new country and has just failed her driver's test, feeling dejected. However, the hibiscus reminds her of her homeland. In the story, the mother says “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake; it’s strong enough to make it through the winter.” Saeng can relate to this because if the flower can survive the winter, she can adapt to life in a new country.
710	9574	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author ends the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the start, Saeng bought a hibiscus plant as it reminded her of her hometown. As the text states, “Plants that she had not realized that she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.” So she purchased it. Due to bad weather, Saeng needed to get the plant and plant it in the garden in time but failed. This is why she says “I will take that test again.” She will retake the test in spring when the hibiscus blooms once more. This is the reason the author ended the story with this paragraph.
711	9575	4	2	The author concludes the paragraph in this way as it demonstrates that she is not going to give up. This can be inferred from her silent vow to herself to retake the test in spring. Additionally, certain elements in the text seem to imply a sense of perseverance. In conclusion, this is the reason why the author concludes the paragraph like this.
712	9576	4	2	The story “Winter Hibiscus” is penned by Minfong Ho. The author concludes the story with the excerpt, “When they come back, ‘Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.’” The purpose of this ending is to allow Saeng time to adjust. Since all of this is new to her, she just needs a bit of comfort. The use of “Almost familiar to her now. Like geese” is figurative language as the geese remind her of herself. In conclusion, this ending effectively portrays Saeng's state of mind and her plans for the future.
713	9577	4	2	It is almost spring, just as he said. The snow is melting, the geese are returning, and the hibiscus is budding. The grass is growing, the trees are budding, and the birds are singing. This all indicates the arrival of a new and vibrant season, full of life and hope.
714	9578	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with an interesting paragraph: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author ends the story this way because Saeng is out of her comfort zone. She has moved to a new country and misses things like the flowers and the hibiscus. So, she decides to wait until she feels at home and comfortable again to retake the test. As the text states, “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,” showing that she is realizing it's not so bad and is getting used to the new environment. In conclusion, this ending reflects Saeng's adaptation process and her determination to face the test when the time is right.
715	9579	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This ending is crafted to make the audience think and adds a touch of dramatic effect to the story. By leaving Saeng's future test - taking in the context of the changing seasons, it creates a sense of anticipation and depth. In conclusion, this ending successfully engages the audience and enriches the story.
716	9580	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to demonstrate that the protagonist will be fine and retain her determination. Her way of referring to future times indicates her confidence in making it until spring. The way she talks about the test showcases her resolve. The use of the word “vowed” suggests that she will fulfill her statement.
717	9581	4	2	The author concluded the story with this sentence to convey that she prefers nature over school.
718	9582	4	2	The author concludes this story with this paragraph as the flower is a recurring element throughout the narrative. The author mentions that when the hibiscus is budding, she will take the test again.
719	9583	4	2	The author concludes this story with this paragraph as she is informing the readers about events that will occur beyond the scope of the story we are reading. It implies that when the snow melts, she will start anew and reconstruct the greenhouse.
720	9584	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story the way she does to illustrate determination. I also think it symbolizes adaptation. Just as the season changes, Saeng will adapt and take the test again. Everything will soon return to normal and adjust, just as she will. As the text states, everything is “almost familiar to her now”.
721	9585	4	2	The author concludes the story with this ending as it offers hope, akin to a happy ending for a sad tale. It represents the author's final thought for the story and serves as an appropriate conclusion.
722	9586	4	2	The author concludes this paragraph in the story because at this point, the character starts growing plants again, signifying her desire to have a fresh start.
723	9587	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it indicates that Saeng will make another attempt once spring arrives. For instance, the statement “I failed the test” (Ho) shows that Saeng indeed failed the test, yet she got her mother a hibiscus to plant in the garden. Her mother, feeling remorseful about Saeng's failure, cooks food for her to comfort her and help her move past the set - back. This is significant as it gives Saeng a sense of comfort and relief, knowing she can take the test again with confidence.
724	9588	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph due to several reasons. Saeng makes a silent vow to herself, which shows that she has calmed down and has adapted well to her new country. When she observes the snow melting and the geese returning, she declares that she will retake the test. This indicates that she is no longer overly troubled by the test failure. She realizes she has the opportunity to take it again and do better. Her perspective on her problem has changed, and she views her new country with a fresh outlook. All aspects of her life are improving, which explains why the author ends the story with this paragraph.
725	9589	4	2	The author concludes the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to illustrate that she will embark on a new attempt with a fresh start. When Saeng sees the flower, the clerk tells her it is a hibiscus. The hibiscus evokes memories of her childhood. She then takes it home and shows it to her mother, who responds with a “You what?” upon hearing the price. The hibiscus, being something of significance, instills more hope in her. By stating that she will start anew once the flower has bloomed and the geese have returned, she implies that she will make a fresh and renewed effort.
726	9590	4	2	The author concludes the story with the given paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination in the face of sadness. Although she misses Vietnam, she intends to retake the test next year. The author's word - choice in the concluding paragraph evokes a sense of hope and anticipation. In the story, Saeng is disappointed in herself for failing the test, but purchasing the plant aids her as it reminds her of home. The final paragraph effectively conveys Saeng's persistence and the hopeful tone of the story.
727	9591	4	2	"The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph because it seemed to be a crucial thought for ""Saeng"" and was essentially the main subject of the story. Additionally, the author might have ended the story with that paragraph as it was Saeng's last memory of her previous lifestyle before moving to their current place of living."
728	9592	4	2	The author concludes the story with the line “In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” because Saeng failed the test. She spent her money on a Big Mac and didn't have enough to buy the type of flower her mother had sent for. Since she failed, she wants to retake the test to make her mother happy.
729	9593	4	2	I think the author ended the story with that sentence because it offers a sense of uplift after a sad narrative. Saeng missed her homeland, was sad about her driving - test failure, found solace in the flowers, and really liked the plant. The last sentence serves as a comfort zone, making the reader feel a bit more at ease.
730	9594	4	2	The author concludes the story with the final lines to establish a hopeful tone that forms a theme. Final lines have a significant impact on readers as they are the last thing read. In this story, when Saeng refers to “when the snow melts”, the snow symbolizes the sorrow she experiences due to leaving home. At one point, “Saeng broke down and wept”. Spring is a time of archetypal rebirth, so when “the snow will melt”, her sorrow will fade away, creating a tone of hope for future happiness. Next, when Saeng mentions the hibiscus budding, the hibiscus represents a comforting link to her old country. She calls the plant “yet another old friend”. If the hibiscus blooms, her new life will thrive as she will feel secure. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times she speaks of are followed by a promise to retake the test despite her first - time failure. The author uses the theme of hope to show that we can overcome difficulties. Saeng shows optimism towards spring and is willing to face challenges, thus imparting a life lesson of courage.
731	9595	4	2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with the given paragraph to emphasize the significance of the Winter Hibiscus. In the narrative, Saeng relocates from Vietnam and experiences intense homesickness. She fails her driver's test and is deeply upset. Upon seeing the familiar plant, she is transported back to her home in Vietnam. The Winter Hibiscus evokes fond memories of her grandmother and simple things like her fine - toothed buffalo - horn comb and the hibiscus hedge that left soft red petals in her well water. The text states that “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral,” highlighting the plant's importance to her. By ending the story with this paragraph, the author demonstrates that the winter hibiscus offers comfort to Saeng and will likely inspire her to perform better on her next driver's test.
732	9596	4	2	After reading “Winter Hibiscus,” it's evident that Saeng is a determined individual with an affinity for nature. She is also resolute in her goal to pass the driving test. The author concludes the story with the specific paragraph because at the start of the tale, Saeng fails her driving test. She then walks home and, during her walk, encounters a familiar plant that transports her to her childhood. Had she not failed the test, she wouldn't have walked home and come across the plant. The author includes this to ensure the readers don't forget the reason for her walking home, as it was a pivotal event in the story.
733	9597	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that Saeng will have another opportunity next spring. The author suggests that Saeng will associate with the blooms of the hibiscus plant and attempt the driving test again. By doing so, the author creates a cliff - hanger, indicating that there is more to Saeng's life yet to unfold. In the story, Saeng struggles to adapt to change. Her mother tries to cheer her up, but just as winter arrives, Saeng must wait until next spring to retake the driver's test. This ending shows that there is hope and a new chance for Saeng in the future.
734	9598	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, … then I will take the test again” because Saeng, like the hibiscus, needs time to grow. Saeng did not perform well on a test but declares that she will try again after the snow melts and spring arrives. After moving, Saeng feels lonely and longs to return home. However, in her heart, she believes that given time, she can persevere. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of the flowers in her home country, helping her realize that she must let go of the past and embrace the present. This ending shows Saeng's growth and her ability to face the future with hope.
735	9599	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it portrays Saeng as mature and confident. She understands that she can take the test again. When the text says “Saeng vowed silently to herself,” it implies that she has reflected on everything and is on the verge of a fresh start. This ending shows Saeng's resilience and her positive outlook towards the future, suggesting that she will learn from her experience and move forward with determination.
736	9600	4	2	The author concludes the story with a sentence regarding retaking the test when the geese return and the hibiscus begins to bud, as each symbolizes something else. The geese symbolize change, as they alter their environment during winter, similar to how Saeng changes hers by going to the plant place. The hibiscus evokes a sense of home for her, as there are comparable plants at her residence. The budding hibiscus represents a new life, just as Saeng has to start anew in a new home. Overall, the author's concluding sentence is used to compare Saeng's life to that of the geese and the hibiscus.
737	9601	4	2	Saeng was elated as the snow started to melt because she eagerly anticipated spring's return. She looked forward to seeing the animals frolic around her garden and the majestic geese flying in after their long hibernation. Saeng was excited to witness everything come back to life, confident that this time she would pass the test.
738	9602	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph due to Saeng's anticipation for winter to end. Once winter is over, Saeng will retake the test and plant flowers. Saeng has a deep affection for the hibiscus and hopes it won't perish during winter. This conclusion ties together Saeng's eagerness for a new season and her connection to the flower.
739	9603	4	2	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to illustrate how the flower provided strength to the little girl. The girl found herself in a new place, far from home where there were numerous beautiful flowers she adored. The absence of these flowers in the new location made her feel down and upset. She missed her home deeply and was in pain, with the flowers being the only source of mild comfort. For example, when the girl said, “It’s - it's not a real one...I mean, not like the kind we had at...”, she stopped, too distraught to say “home”. Although the flower she currently has is not real, when the real one blooms in spring, it will comfort her and give her the confidence to retake the test.
740	9604	4	2	The author's conclusion reveals her feelings. The statement “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” indicates that she has transformed into a new person. Taking the test implies change and a readiness to embrace new challenges. For her, the test represents stepping into the unknown. This is the message I gleaned from the conclusion.
741	9605	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that Saeng has hope and that hope still exists. The ending paragraph allows readers to envision their own ending for Saeng. I prefer to picture Saeng having a large garden beside her and successfully passing the test.
742	9606	4	2	In my view, the author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph for multiple reasons. The final paragraph consolidates and integrates all the concluding ideas. It indicates that in spring, when nature awakens, Saeng will gather the strength to retake the test. The central ideas in the last paragraph illustrate how Saeng and her mother have adapted, and that spring ushers in new beginnings and possibilities. As stated in the text, “I know,” her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.” This implies that despite the differences from Saeng's home, they will adapt and survive in their own way.
743	9607	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner as it demonstrates that Saeng needs to recover from the disappointment of failing the test before attempting it again. Saeng is aware that she can heal. She realizes that she has grown accustomed to her new surroundings, and that aspects of her new land, such as the sound of geese, have become “familiar to her.” As the narrator states, “...she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… almost familiar to her now.” Initially, things in Saeng's new home seemed strange, but she has healed and adjusted. Saeng has also overcome the pain of leaving her native Vietnam. Although she was heart - broken to leave, as described by “A work so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her,” she has healed. Saeng remembers the flowers from Vietnam as “old friends,” indicating that recalling them no longer causes pain. Once Saeng recovers from failing her driving test, just as she adapted to moving from Vietnam to the United States, she can retake the test without the burden of pain.
744	9608	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the character, Saeng, will adapt to her new home and remain resilient. When Saeng's mother says, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,” I think she is also referring to Saeng. It's as if she's suggesting that the move has affected Saeng, but she will be strong and endure the change. Similar to someone who fails a test, Saeng will study harder and strive to pass it the next time. Saeng won't give up and will persevere. She knows that adjusting to life's changes is difficult, but with a bit of courage and hard work, it will be manageable. If she believes in herself, she will be able to settle into this new place.
745	9609	4	2	When they return, Saeng silently vows to herself that in spring, when the snow melts, the geese come back, and the winter hibiscus begins to bud, she will retake the test. There are several reasons for this. Winter with its snow destroys her garden. So, she longs for spring to start growing plants in her garden again. She has to take a test on the plants she grows to ensure they are suitable for consumption. That's why I think the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” is significant.
746	9610	4	2	In Minfong Ho's story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concluded the narrative with an engaging paragraph: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1). This indicates that the girl is acclimating to her new country and anticipates performing better in the spring. The author ended the story with this paragraph as it demonstrates that the girl has successfully adapted to her new homeland and is resolved to grow stronger over time. She implies that when the hibiscus blossoms again, she will be prepared to retake the test and avoid failure.
747	9611	4	2	The budding of the hibiscus signifies that the flower is in the process of growth. The hibiscus is a flower renowned for its vivid and bright colors, and in nature, few other flowers can rival its beauty. The reason other flowers cannot outshine it is that the hibiscus holds significant symbolic value and is one of the most naturally - occurring and distinctive flowers. In essence, its unique charm and symbolism set it apart from other floral species.
748	9612	4	2	The author chose to conclude the story with that particular paragraph because it aligned with the envisioned ending of the narrative. The author intended to end the story with the character engaged in self - dialogue, which provided a fitting and intimate way to close the tale, allowing the reader to gain a final insight into the character's thoughts.
749	9613	4	2	When people relocate, they are often required to adapt to different cultures. They can achieve this through various means, such as making new friends and getting accustomed to the local environment. Nevertheless, while adjusting to a new place, it is important to retain memories of one's former home. This concept is exemplified in the ending paragraph of Minfong Ho's “Winter Hibiscus.” In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moves from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. While visiting a plant store, she has numerous recollections of her past home. She purchases a plant that is common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story states, “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again.” This showcases Saeng's aspiration to integrate into the new culture by taking the driving test, while also remembering her past through the hibiscus. The final paragraph effectively encapsulates Saeng's feelings for her old country and her determination to succeed in the new one.
750	9614	4	2	She made a promise to herself that when spring returns, she will retake the driver's test. This self - commitment shows her determination and eagerness to overcome the previous setback and achieve success in obtaining her driver's license. By tying her goal to the arrival of spring, a season often associated with new beginnings and growth, she infuses her promise with a sense of hope and renewal.
751	9615	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate her determination. When Saeng states, “...when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” she is drawing a parallel between the geese's determination to fly back and the hibiscus's determination to bud anew. She reasons that if they can show such determination, she too should have the resolve and confidence to retake the test. Saeng had previously admitted, “I - I failed the test,” and it seemed that this driving test failure made her fear failure in the new country. However, after witnessing the geese and hibiscus persevere through harsh conditions, she became determined to attempt the test once more.
752	9616	4	2	The author ends the story with that paragraph to convey that she has already taken the test, and since it is currently winter, she will retake it when all the flowers and plants revive and start anew. Saeng wishes to retake the test to prove to her mother that she can pass. To this end, she spent nineteen dollars on a plant called “dorl Faeng - noi” to avoid disappointing her mother. Nevertheless, her mother was disappointed that she spent so much money on a plant.
753	9617	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it reveals that seeing things from her homeland and daily life brings her comfort in her actions. The author appears to rely on elements from her native land to make the best of situations and recall pleasant memories of her earlier life. I find that whenever I aim to do well, thinking about the things that hold great significance for me makes me happy and motivated to perform well. The author is wise to want to see those things before retaking her test. If she sees her plant thriving and is reminded of the geese, it will likely bring her good luck.
754	9618	4	2	The author ends the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng has gained a new sense of hope from her memories and the now - familiar aspects of her new home. The combination of failing the driver's test and being away from her original home made Saeng feel a profound sense of loss. In the flower shop, “aware of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” Throughout the rest of the story, Saeng remains down, leaving the reader uncertain about her well - being. However, her recovery begins with the presence of familiar things. “The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth watered,” “The winter hibiscus was in the ground now,” and “overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and – yes – familiar to Saeng now.” The realization that the geese are familiar to her leads to new insights and a wave of hope. She realizes that she is becoming accustomed to many things in her new home that initially seemed strange. This is what the final paragraph conveys to the reader, summarizing Saeng's new hope that she will not only survive but thrive in her new home.
755	9619	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story with this statement as it shows that, for her, the hibiscus symbolizes overcoming obstacles. When she says, “...and the geese return and this is budding, I will take that test again” (Ho @NUM1), it indicates that despite failing the test this time, she will retake it when the hibiscus grows. This shows her determination to overcome obstacles. Additionally, the hibiscus “gives her strength from her old country,” which means it will help her overcome the test by providing comfort and strength. Thus, the author uses this statement to end the story, highlighting the hibiscus's symbolic role in Saeng's journey of overcoming challenges.
756	9620	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph as it indicates that Saeng is confident and willing to return and take the test. Saeng has a positive self - perception and is eager to undertake this task.
757	9621	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was engaged in a test. In the story, there are quotes to support this, such as “I - I failed the test,” Saeng said, which reveals that she was taking a gardening test. Another reason for the author to end the story with this paragraph is that the story revolved around spring, gardening, and the associated way of life. The paragraph discusses spring and flowers. The daughter and mother sustain themselves by planting vegetables and fruits.
758	9622	4	2	The last paragraph of “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho is crucial to the story. It provides a definite ending, allowing the reader to clearly envision what will occur in the future. This paragraph serves as a highly significant conclusion as it represents symbols within the story. The author conveys that the hibiscus holds importance for the character. Alongside the hibiscus, the geese and the melting snow symbolize a fresh start and a new beginning. These symbols are vital as they offer the character an opportunity to start afresh, and she recognizes this in the winter hibiscus.
759	9623	4	2	Saeng was extremely distraught upon learning that she had not passed the test. To her, it was a significant let - down or disappointment. This situation showcases Saeng's ambition and determination, as she is clearly driven to pass this test.
760	9624	4	2	The author concludes the story with the part “when they come back …” to illustrate how Saeng has transformed throughout the story's plot. At the beginning, she described her new home as “walking into another world.” As a teenager, she had to relocate from Vietnam, where traditions differ greatly from those in the United States. However, there is one common plant, the winter Hibiscus. This plant bridges her past life and home with her current one. Adapting to the move was challenging, but the plant brought familiar scents and a “familiar fragrance” that “filled her lungs.” It was even difficult for Saeng to say “at home” without crying. Once the winter Hibiscus was planted, it changed Saeng, and she realized she needed to appreciate what she had. In conclusion, the author ended the story with that paragraph because it demonstrated how the plant mirrored Saeng and how her outlook on life had changed.
761	9625	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story with this phrase to illustrate how Saeng is adapting to her new home while still cherishing her old one. The essence of the sentence is that Saeng will retake the test in spring, which demonstrates her perseverance. Moreover, the sentence shows Saeng's growing familiarity with her new land. When she says, “when the snows melt and the geese return,” it is significant as the geese and snow are part of her new home, and she now accepts them. However, when Saeng also says, “when this hibiscus is budding,” it reveals that she is still thinking of her old home, as the plant is her link to the memories of Vietnam. Therefore, I believe the author uses this statement to conclude the story to show how Saeng is growing up and coping with the changes in her life.
762	9626	4	2	I believe that what the author is trying to convey is that during winter, the hibiscus struggles against the cold. While most plants simply perish, the hibiscus confronts the cold head - on. This showcases the hibiscus's resilience in the face of harsh winter conditions, highlighting its unique ability to endure rather than succumb to the elements.
763	9627	4	2	I think the author includes this part to avoid leaving the audience in suspense about what would happen next. The quote “I will take the test again” indicates that although Saeng may have failed the test related to the plant, she will never give up and will try again in spring. I feel that the author added this to help readers better understand the experience of leaving one's homeland to come to an unfamiliar place, just like the flower situation in the story. When Saeng thought about the plants and their scents, it brought back old feelings about her homeland and her close relationship with her grandmother. She was accustomed to seeing plants growing freely, not confined in pots. Witnessing this made Saeng break down and cry. In conclusion, I believe the author added the final paragraph to aid understanding and to show that although Saeng is in a new place with a new culture, she will never stop trying until she passes the test.
764	9628	4	2	I firmly believe that the author of “Winter Hibiscus” deliberately included the last paragraph, and in my opinion, the story is much better with it. In the last paragraph, the line “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” is truly impactful. When the author describes these natural phenomena, it symbolizes rebirth, a fresh start, and a new chance, which is exactly what Saeng needs for her driver's license test. The author effectively uses these symbols to convey hope for the girl to overcome her difficult time. Finally, the last paragraph gives the story a sense of completeness and closure, making it a well - rounded and finished piece.
765	9629	4	2	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it is a valuable learning story from which readers can gain insights. The author does this to help readers better understand the story. The statement “Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam” provides background information on what happened right before the story began, enabling readers to have a clearer understanding. To me, it wraps up the story neatly. That's why I believe the author chose to end the story with this paragraph.
766	9630	4	2	I believe the author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story in this way because Saeng agrees to retake the test. She intends to take the test when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, that is, when spring arrives, she will be prepared for the test. In the story, Saeng states, “It’s the flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters.” I think Saeng uses this as a guiding principle since she has just moved from Vietnam. She plans to persevere and uses the plant as a symbol. She will attempt to obtain her driver's license again at the start of spring, showing her determination to overcome the set - back.
767	9631	4	2	The author included the line “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” as it symbolizes her mother's renewal, awakening, and restoration. Saeng expressed her intention to retake the driving test when this occurs. She was deeply saddened by her failure, saying “I – I failed the test,” and seemed both embarrassed and sad. The last paragraph effectively depicts Saeng's plan. She will adopt an optimistic outlook, restore herself, and return to pass the test, demonstrating her resilience in the face of disappointment.
768	9632	4	2	As the narrator, I appreciate this paragraph in the story. The hibiscus is a valuable plant, and having a garden is a personal choice, much like how Saeng's mother chose to grow hot peppers. A garden is a means to experience diversity, such as the various types of foods one can plant and the different plants in the world, including roses, lilies, and other similar ones. It showcases the beauty and variety that nature offers and the personal decisions we make in interacting with it.
769	9633	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as Saeng is attempting to overcome an obstacle. Failing the driver's test was a setback for her, so she decides to take it again. She uses the hibiscus as motivation because the winter for the hibiscus represents the process of overcoming difficulties. Just as the hibiscus endures the cold months, Saeng will persevere through her challenges and try to succeed in obtaining her driver's license, highlighting the theme of resilience in the story.
770	9634	4	2	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it reveals the significance of the test to Saeng. It shows that she genuinely cares about passing the test. By demonstrating her concern, she is motivated to take the test again. This conclusion emphasizes her determination and the emotional investment she has in achieving this goal, making the story more impactful and showing her growth in the face of a challenge.
771	9635	4	2	She concludes the story with that paragraph to convey that she feels most at ease during spring. Additionally, she expresses her eagerness for the geese and hibiscus to start budding as it is her favorite time of the year.
772	9636	4	2	Saeng is uncomfortable in her new surroundings and has not adapted to the changes from her previous location. She spots a hibiscus and decides to purchase it as it reminds her of her home in @LOCATION2. When she brings it home, her mother is initially shocked by the price Saeng paid but becomes more understanding when she realizes Saeng misses @LOCATION2. Saeng says she will retake her test in the spring, implying that she will change her attitude about living in @LOCATION1.
773	9637	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story in that way because they are referring to the return of the geese.
774	9638	4	2	The author reaches this conclusion to demonstrate that Saeng was not giving up. Saeng moved to a place she disliked and knew no one. The author aims to convey that no matter the circumstances, one should not give up and should have faith. By the end, Saeng has faith in herself to pass the test next time. She may have realized that being in an undesired place does not mean one cannot move forward.
775	9639	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to convey to the reader that one should not quit upon failure. When Saeng stated that she would return to take the test again in spring, it shows her determination not to quit and her belief that life will continue. This is why I think the author chose this conclusion for the story.
776	9640	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that she is unwilling to abandon the fight against homesickness. When she first purchased that plant, it evoked memories of her former home, revealing the depth of her longing. By stating that she will take the test again, it demonstrates that she refuses to let this setback defeat her in her new home and new life.
777	9641	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to demonstrate that Saeng possesses the ability to overcome obstacles. Saeng perceives herself as a failure. Her hibiscus symbolizes the courage to surmount the obstacle of her failed driving test. The geese represent survival and the determination to never give up, to consistently strive for success. In essence, the author uses these elements to convey Saeng's potential for growth and resilience.
778	9642	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story in this way because the girl in the narrative is akin to the flower. Just as the flower will bloom, Saeng will retake the test, both getting a new beginning. Ending the story like this leaves the reader with a positive feeling. It's a brief yet meaningful conclusion. The line “...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” is truly inspiring, making one want to start anew just like Saeng.
779	9643	4	2	The author concludes the story with “When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” for multiple valid reasons. Firstly, it shows that she will continue to move forward and adapt to her new life in Canada. She intends to change her lifestyle and integrate into the new culture. Additionally, she has to relive the memory of her grandmother and wishes to handle it more effectively, as seen in “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eye now swept over her.” The author emphasizes that the story is not over, suggesting there is more growth and development in store for the character.
780	9644	4	2	There are numerous reasons the narrator might have ended the story with this paragraph. Firstly, since it is the start of winter, the hibiscus will not return until spring. Moreover, as it is the end of the story, it serves as an excellent way to conclude, aligning with the end - cycle of the hibiscus. The last paragraph also succinctly summarizes the story. Its brevity and charm make it a great ending. It stands out as unique because most story endings are not centered around nature. In conclusion, there are many valid reasons for the narrator's choice to end the story with this paragraph.
781	9645	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate how individuals can regain their determination. At the start of the story, Saeng is disheartened after failing her driving test. Upon seeing the Hibiscus, she is inundated with memories of the past and begins to weep. Her mother's kindness enables Saeng to draw strength from the flower, which, as her mother remarks, is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" Anticipating that the Hibiscus will bud in the spring, Saeng renews her resolve to pass the test."
782	9646	4	2	The author concludes with this response as they aim to convey that Saeng will repeat her actions, but this time she will be more helpful in the garden for her mother. She will also try harder with her schoolwork and focus less on gardening.
783	9647	4	2	In my opinion, Saeng's personality in this story showcases determination and confidence. I believe she feels capable of handling more experienced tasks related to different plants. This is, in my view, a perfect hobby experience for someone who loves plants. I feel that by @MONTH1, Saeng has accomplished her goals of planting. I think she @MONTH1 desires to pursue a career in gardening. When she said that when the plants come back, she would take the test again, I think she means she is willing to explore more plants. I believe she @MONTH1 gained this planting experience from her mother. To me, this @MONTH1 has been a family tradition. Saeng will likely have kids and teach them about different types of flowers.
784	9648	4	2	"The author ended the story with the paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng is looking forward to her life with a positive outlook. It indicates that she will no longer be depressed by the changes in her life. The hibiscus serves as a plot device in this story. When changes occur to the hibiscus, corresponding changes take place in the story. Initially, Saeng is without the hibiscus and feels hopeless. When she sees it, she recalls her past and is saddened. Once she plants it, the situation starts to improve. When the last paragraph states, ""when they come back... and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" it shows that Saeng is viewing her future positively. With this positive change, the hibiscus is now beginning to bloom. The author concludes the story symbolically, which helps to convey the story's themes."
785	9649	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “Saeng vowed silently to herself” because Saeng wants to act in the proper time and season. During the “winter season,” the land or soil was so cold that plants could not grow properly. “Hibiscus costs nineteen dollars,” and Saeng failed the test. “There was a frail, wiry beauty to her mother that touched Saeng deeply”; her mother shines when working with plants. All these descriptions from the past lead Saeng to want to make corrections, shine like her mother, and pass the test.
786	9650	4	2	At the conclusion of the short story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng states, “when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Here, she is referring to her driver's test. She decides to retake the test as she is reminded that her family didn't give up; they moved to @LOCATION1 for a fresh start. The “plant she had forgotten drew her back to her childhood world.” After failing the test, seeing these flowers makes her recall that she has never given up before, so she won't do so now.
787	9651	4	2	The author aims to convey a sense of hope for Saeng in her new country. After noting her test failure, presumably a citizenship test, the author concludes the story in a way that reassures the reader. It is evident that this test was significant as Saeng couldn't even look her mother in the eye, which was likely the reason she bought the flower for her mother. The ending reassures the reader, eliminating any concerns about Saeng's future.
788	9652	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that Saeng will attempt to find the flower to evoke memories of her old home. It shows that the flower will return and survive, even if it is not from the place she originally desired. In the story, Saeng says, “I failed the test,” indicating that the hibiscus she bought was not what she expected. In the last paragraph, she states that she will take the test again, expressing her intention to find a winter hibiscus like the ones in her homeland. She hopes the flowers will survive and that she will find a similar one. As the last paragraph reads, “Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” suggesting she hopes and prays to find a flower like those from her old homeland.
789	9653	4	2	The author ended the story quickly, which is why the story concludes with this particular part. The hasty ending was likely a choice to wrap up the narrative promptly.
790	9654	4	2	When spring arrives and the snow melts, she plans to plant new seeds. The author concludes the story this way because she didn't perform well on the test the first time. However, next year, she will work with her plants and then retake the test to pass it. The author includes this in the conclusion to prevent readers from thinking that she only worries about the plants. Instead, it shows that she is using her work with the plants as a way to prepare herself for the test and move forward.
791	9655	4	2	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" revolves around a girl named Saeng, along with her mother and grandmother. Flowers hold great beauty for them, and they spend the whole day planting, picking, and presumably doing other flower - related activities. At one point, Saeng did not dare to look her mother in the eye."
792	9656	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with that saying because it demonstrates the protagonist's self - confidence. Despite failing the test, she knows she can take it again and pass. Initially, she was upset about the failure. However, after talking with her mother, she felt better and more confident to retake the test, knowing she could succeed. That's why I think the author chose to end the story with that particular saying.
793	9657	4	2	In my opinion, this paragraph implies that when winter ends and the geese return from the south, and her favorite plant from her old country reappears, she will attempt what she previously tried. This time, though, she will do so with greater confidence. That's what I understand this paragraph to mean.
794	9658	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it effectively sums up the plot and resolves the conflict of Saeng failing her driver's test. When Saeng declared, ""… I will take that test again,"" it clearly showed her determination to pass the test and try once more. Since the conflict has been resolved, introducing a new conflict would be necessary to continue the story. So, the author decides to end it. The excerpt from the last paragraph also draws a parallel between Saeng's difficulties in getting her driver's license and the hardships faced by geese. Just like the geese, Saeng will face hardships again but is willing to confront them."
795	9659	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author ends the story in a well - crafted manner. The final paragraph is used to show that Saeng will not be disheartened, even though she is far from home. At the start of the story, she was in a downward spiral after failing a test, and the hibiscus made her feel nostalgic. When she got home, her mother greeted her with kind words and prepared food without peppers and bitter melons, acting like an anti - depressant. This made Saeng see the positive aspects of life, giving her the confidence not to give up and to believe she will pass the test."
796	9660	4	2	In the story, Saeng fails her driving test. While walking home, she spots a familiar plant. She then visits a florist and learns that the plant is a hibiscus. With the little money she has, she purchases the plant as it reminds her of her homeland, childhood, and the grandmother she left behind, forging a connection with it. Additionally, she observes geese flying south for the winter and says, “When they come back,” referring to when the geese fly north in the spring. She also mentions “when the snow melts,” indicating the arrival of warmer weather and the start of spring, and “when this hibiscus is budding,” meaning when spring arrives and the plant begins to bloom. At that time, she will “take that test again,” vowing to retake the failed driving test in spring. She gives herself the winter to practice and prepare for the test, determined to pass it when spring comes.
797	9661	4	2	She said this to demonstrate the determination required to succeed, regardless of how many times one fails. One must get back up and try again. By doing so, she also showcases her courage, as it takes great strength for someone to face failure and then persevere. She refuses to accept failure and aims to redeem herself, which is why she declares she will try again. This is the reason she ended the story in that manner.
798	9662	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph so that readers will know what the protagonist plans to do next spring. This may also inspire them to envision a continuation of the story, as they are informed that she will take the test in the spring.
799	9663	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with that paragraph because when winter arrives, the hibiscus plant she loves will disappear. The flower brought her good luck, so she says, “When the snow melts in the spring, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The flower holds great significance for her. She remarks, “That rich, sweet scent that was familiar too,” comparing the flower's smell to that of her grandmother's shell, finding them to be the same.
800	9664	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way because the protagonist intends to return and repeat the same actions the following year.
801	9665	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way because the protagonist wants to retake the test. Her motivation is to pass the test for her mother, so she brings home a flower to apologize to her.
802	9666	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as the events in the story are cyclical, similar to the changing seasons where one cannot plant or grow in winter. For instance, the protagonist remarks that the plants are unlike her home, yet she must adapt to being away from home and adjust to her new environment. If she fails to do so, she will remain unhappy, constantly dwelling on her origins.
803	9667	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the response by stating that when spring arrives and the hibiscus begins to bud, the girl will retake the test. This is because she likely feels a sense of hope and faith. The girl has recently moved away from home and is extremely lonely and depressed as she longs to return. The sight of the plant evokes nostalgia and offers her a sense of comfort, as if she were back home. When she says, “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it is evident that her failure on the test has upset her, and the plant provides the comfort and confidence she needs to believe she will pass in the spring.
804	9668	4	2	When they return, Saeng silently vows to herself that in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese come back, and the hibiscus starts to bud, she will take that test again.
805	9669	4	2	In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus” by @PERSON1, the author selects the last paragraph as it aligns with the tone, hope, and representation of the essay. The story has a depressing mood as the protagonist fails the driver's test and is deeply upset. When she sees the winter hibiscus, memories of her native country flood back. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept,” indicating her intense longing for Vietnam. The onset of winter makes her feel that all hope is lost. “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,” showing that the same old routine year after year brings no new hope. The plant's representation deeply affects her. “She found that she was still too shaky to say the word at home, lest she burst into tears again,” highlighting that home for her is in Vietnam, not the United States. The winter hibiscus triggers a flood of emotions related to her past. The last paragraph reflects how she will try again when hope returns in spring. The tone, hope, and representation all support the choice of the last paragraph, which is why it fits so well.
806	9670	4	2	This was an extremely captivating story that vividly depicted all the hardships the young girl endured. The author concluded it in a highly engaging manner. When the story ended, I couldn't help but think about how beautifully it concluded. I believe the author did an outstanding job. She managed to portray all the difficulties Saeng faced, likening them to a harsh winter. Then, as the author stated, “as the snow melts away…”, I think this symbolizes that even though Saeng's problems seem endless and severe, one day they will vanish, and things will become beautiful again, much like a flower budding in spring. Moreover, she did a great job because throughout the story, I could deeply feel Saeng's pain. Thanks to her use of descriptive words such as “exploding”, “shock”, “intense” and others to describe the suddenness of events, I felt as if I was right there with Saeng. When the story ended, it was as if the author was showing us Saeng's hope for a better future, despite the fact that things were not the same as back home.
807	9671	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” because Saeng believes that when the hibiscus blooms, she too can bloom by passing the test. Saeng relates herself to the hibiscus. Her mother tells her “Its flower isn't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through here, this winter hibiscus.”, trying to convey that Saeng can also be strong and make it through the tough times. When Saeng “like the geese she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance”, she realizes that she should be proud of herself and that there will be other chances. She should not always doubt herself and should not be afraid to try again. In conclusion, through these elements, the story encourages a positive and resilient attitude.
808	9672	4	2	The author concludes the story with a particular paragraph to signify that the protagonist will return after winter to care for a plant. By placing this in the ending paragraph, the author conveys the protagonist's deep affection for the plant. The plant serves as a powerful reminder of her hometown, which is the reason she takes such meticulous care of it. In this way, the plant becomes a tangible link to her past and a source of comfort in her new surroundings. Ultimately, the act of caring for the plant is a way for her to carry a piece of home with her.
809	9674	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about the geese as it illustrates that Saeng, similar to the geese, will adapt to her new environment. Just as the geese do what is necessary to survive, Saeng will also take the necessary steps to thrive. She is determined to take the test again and will not give up. The paragraph reflects her desire to adapt to the new country. For instance, the narration mentions “… she noticed the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes”, which shows that Saeng is not accustomed to being in the new country and dislikes it. However, as demonstrated in the closing paragraph, she will get used to it and make her best efforts. Additionally, the narration states “…she admitted to herself, she much preferred it to a Big Mac”, proving that even though Saeng may not like certain things at times, she is willing to try them to adjust to the new country. Moreover, “…she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become familiar to her now” indicates that Saeng is increasingly getting used to her surroundings, just as the geese adapt. This is why the author ended the story with the paragraph about the geese.
810	9675	4	2	I firmly believe that the author wrote the conclusion paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng is looking forward to a more promising future. Saeng hopes to see the geese once again as they remind her of her homeland, and she also wants to pass the driving test. In this story, I perceive Saeng as a highly sentimental person. I think this is precisely the reason why the author crafted the conclusion paragraph in this way. It allows us to understand Saeng's emotions and her longing for a better life while still holding onto the memories of her past. Overall, the conclusion paragraph effectively captures Saeng's hopes and dreams for the future.
811	9676	4	2	The author concludes this paragraph in the story as it has a pleasing cadence and aims to convey to the readers that regardless of the adversities one faces in life, one should persist in doing what one deems best. Similar to the flower that endures hardships and keeps coming back, one should maintain resilience.
812	9677	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph due to specific associations. The hibiscus evokes memories of Vietnam for her, while the geese represent her current home. These two elements instill strength in her. As a result, she intends to take the test upon their return, believing she can pass it as long as the flower and the geese are part of her life.
813	9678	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng is beginning to assume responsibility for her school - work. In the story, it was evident that she previously cared more about the garden than her studies, but now there is a shift.
814	9679	4	2	Saeng was discussing testing the plants to determine if the geese liked the locations where she planted them. This can be inferred from the mention of geese in the last paragraph, and the indication that the geese approved when she planted the hibiscus.
815	9680	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as the story predominantly focused on the hibiscus. Saeng stated that when spring arrives and the hibiscus starts budding, she will retake the test. The hibiscus serves as a reminder of her homeland from the past.
816	9681	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph as it discusses a new beginning. Moreover, at this new start, the author mentions that she will retake the test.
817	9682	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as the protagonist has a better state of mind after finding a flower that reminds her of her homeland. Fearing her parents' anger for failing the test, she buys a flower that evokes such memories. When she gets home and tells her mother the price of the flower and her test failure, her mother is briefly upset but then understands what her daughter is going through. By the end of the story, the protagonist has more confidence that she will succeed next time.
818	9683	4	2	"Minfong Ho ended the story with a phrase - dialogue as it pertains to the main topic of the story. Saeng was supposed to buy a plant and bring it home, yet her mother disapproved. The narrative quotes her mother's reaction: ""You what?"" Her mother stared at her incredulously"" (Ho). This shows her mother's displeasure. Saeng also admits, ""I - I failed the test"" (Ho), indicating her reluctance to displease her parents. When Saeng vows, ""When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" (Ho), it demonstrates her love and desire to grow for her parents, signifying maturity."
819	9684	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to inform the reader that Saeng will retake the test. Since Saeng failed the test, she is aware of her mistakes and intends to correct them. For instance, when Saeng said, ""then I will take that test again,"" it shows her remorse for failing a simple test and her determination to retake it when the snow melts."
820	9685	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the non - budding plant, the departing geese, and the test failure made the protagonist sad. However, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the plant begins to bud, she will be happy again. At that time, she will retake the test and is likely to pass as her positive state of mind will contribute to her success.
821	9686	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner for multiple reasons. Firstly, it demonstrates that Saeng will not abandon her efforts and will continue attempting to pass her test. Secondly, it conveys that even if one's life has undergone changes, it does not necessitate giving up. These are among the reasons why the author concludes the story as such.
822	9687	4	2	"In my opinion, the author concluded the story with this paragraph to illustrate the character's strong commitment to nature, particularly to the hibiscus. The character regarded the hibiscus as special due to her interactions with it. For instance, when it was described that ""she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the centre"". This is the reason I believe the author chose to end the story with this paragraph."
823	9688	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng believes the appropriate time to retake her driving test is when the hibiscus is budding. Another reason is that the author intends to showcase her determination.
824	9689	4	2	She made a vow in this paragraph as she desired to make her mother proud by passing the test after failing it. However, she waits for the plant to begin budding. The budding of the hibiscus symbolizes a new start. If the plant can survive the winter, it implies it can thrive, and by analogy, Saeng believes she can pass the test as well. Since she knows a tropical plant can endure a harsh winter, she is confident she can pass the test the following spring.
825	9690	4	2	I think the author concludes the story with the last paragraph because it serves as a moral for the narrative. The character is suggesting that when the time is right, she will keep trying until she succeeds. Without this final paragraph, the message of the story would be unclear.
826	9691	4	2	Saeng is a highly helpful young lady to her mother. The author crafted the ending sentence to enhance the story's intrigue for readers and keep them engaged until the end.
827	9692	4	2	The author concludes the story with that sentence as she aims to convey that she will repeat this action when the hibiscus returns to season.
828	9693	4	2	I assume she makes this statement because she only wishes to take the test when she feels confident in the presence of flowers, plants, and greenery.
829	9694	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph. The text states “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take the test again”. This implies that as she grows older and gains more confidence, she will thrive and be ready to take the test, much like the hibiscus is ready to bud anew.
830	9695	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph. When it comes to flowers and nature, there are seasons when flowers do not bloom, such as winter. The paragraph indicates that in spring, after winter has passed, she tells herself that she will anticipate seeing all the plants that nature has to offer.
831	9696	4	2	I am of the opinion that he chose this ending to guarantee that she would be resilient and do whatever was necessary to persevere.
832	9697	4	2	The author incorporates this sentence into the paragraph because it marks the commencement of a new beginning.
833	9698	4	2	In the story, the author concludes with Saeng silently vowing to herself, “When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I believe the author did this to convey that one should not give up. In the story, Saeng goes to the store and touches a petal of a plant. She buys it to remind herself of her old home. It seems that Saeng is willing to part with her past memories in this way. When she brings the plant home, her mom helps her plant it in the garden. I think Saeng is trying to make her new home resemble her old one.
834	9699	4	2	Minfong Ho, the author, concludes the story by having Saeng vow to take the test in spring when the geese return, the snow melts, and the hibiscus buds. This conclusion is used to symbolize the various lessons Saeng has learned. For example, she has learned to adapt to life - changes and become accustomed to new things. She admits that the geese and snow, which were “strange before,” have now become familiar to her. The hibiscus in the last paragraph also holds significance. It represents the ability to overcome obstacles, a connection to the past, and a source of comfort. The last paragraph is rich in symbolism, and a deeper analysis can reveal what Saeng has learned.
835	9700	4	2	The author concludes the story by having Saeng vow to herself about the relationship between passing the driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is associated with Saeng's past in Vietnam. For example, what is called “hibiscus” in @LOCATION3 was “Madagascar periwinkle” in Vietnam. Just as the flower can adapt when taken to a different country, Saeng is adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. When Saeng says she will take the test again in spring, it symbolizes the connection between the flower and her current life. It shows her ability and determination to overcome obstacles when the flower buds. It also represents a link to her past experiences and offers her comfort after failing the driving test. The author effectively links the flower's significance to the story's ending, demonstrating Saeng's hope, dedication, and the challenges she has overcome to reach her present situation.
836	9701	4	2	I believe the author concluded the story in that manner because the protagonist has a tendency to start anew. For example, in the story, the protagonist mentioned failing a test and initially thought of giving up. This is why I think the author ended the story with that particular line, emphasizing the cycle of starting over.
837	9702	4	2	The author concluded the story with that paragraph to convey that Saeng will embark on a fresh start, much like the hibiscus. Life may present difficult times, but one should persevere and start anew until things improve. Moreover, the paragraph effectively restarts the story, mirroring Saeng's intended course of action. In essence, the author's choice of ending serves to highlight Saeng's resilience and the possibility of a new beginning.
838	9703	4	2	She implies that upon her return, she will repeat the same action to determine if she can achieve better results. This shows her willingness to give it another try and see if she can improve her performance.
839	9704	4	2	"Saeng silently vowed to herself, ""In the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, I will retake that test."" Her thoughts were diverted from the test when she noticed a fallen hibiscus blossom. She carefully picked it up and smelled it, which distracted her. After failing the test, she was silent for a long time, and her mother, who was focused on the plants, simply brushed the green fragments off Saeng's hands. Seeing her mother made Saeng think of geese. As a teenage girl who moved to the United States from Vietnam with her family, Saeng decided to retake the driving test as she adjusted to her new life. Although the intro mentions her move, it doesn't elaborate on her family. In the end, Saeng's interaction with the hibiscus and her mother influenced her decision to try again."
840	9705	4	2	"The author included this paragraph to illustrate the girl's deep longing for Vietnam. The sight of the hibiscus triggered vivid memories of her homeland, offering her a sense of comfort. It also highlights the contrast between the United States and Vietnam. The changing seasons in the United States help the girl adapt to her new environment. The plant remains a constant, and she must seek the positive aspects of the United States. As the author states, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This quote demonstrates the girl's growing familiarity with the United States while still cherishing memories of Vietnam. In conclusion, the paragraph showcases the girl's nostalgia for Vietnam and her ability to find solace in her new home."
841	9706	4	2	They essentially state that he will return, much like geese that always come back.
842	9707	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for multiple reasons. Firstly, she remains uncomfortable discussing her old home, as indicated by “She was still to make to say the words at home” [HO]. The melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus remind her of home; Saeng says, “Just as she known it would feel …” and mentions that back home, things “Just grow wild just at from the cracks in the brick walls or between tiled roofs” [HO]. These reminders offer her both comfort and confidence. Therefore, the author concludes with this paragraph because when the geese return, the hibiscus buds, and the snow melts, which remind her of home, she will regain the confidence and strength to take the test again.
843	9708	4	2	Adding this paragraph to the story's end demonstrates that a resolution has been reached and that the theme of overcoming obstacles is present. When Saeng failed the test, she was miserable and heart - broken. However, after buying the hibiscus, she found hope and motivation. In the end, she decides to take the test again “in the spring, when the snow melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”. This hope at the story's end eases the reader's curiosity about what happens next and helps conclude the story. Most endings are meaningful in this way, allowing readers to grasp the author's message. In this case, the author's message is to never give up and that people can find motivation in simple things. Understanding what an author is trying to convey through such paragraphs is crucial, whether one is a reader seeking to understand a story's purpose or a writer aiming to express ideas clearly to an audience.
844	9709	4	2	I believe the author uses the quote “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is buding, then I will take the test again” (@CAPS1). It symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope. The lines “But where was the home thought come? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother?” and “BOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone” (@CAPS2) show her journey from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. One night, she had abundant hope, but the next, she was in a foreign land unlike her old home. Spring, when flowers bloom, brings new life, a chance to move on, and hope. There is hope that spring will come, flowers will bloom, and birds will return. It is a chance to let go. The ending quote brings hope to her, and she promises herself that things will get better. Hope makes overcoming obstacles easier and life more bearable.
845	9710	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng. In spring, the hibiscus grows, just as Saeng does. When Saeng arrived at the new place, she was small and puny, similar to the plant described as “Its leaves quavering in the wind” (@NUM1). This quote shows the plant's weakness; a strong plant would not quiver. Saeng's breakdown and purchase of the plant suggest her lack of strength. By using this paragraph at the end, the author conveys to the reader that just as the hibiscus has become strong, so has Saeng, and she can overcome any obstacle.
846	9711	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate that Saeng is resolute and does not give up on passing the test. The narration mentions, “Not like the kind we had [@NUM1].” Saeng has a deep - seated affection for her old home and desires hibiscus similar to what she and her grandmother used to have. Since she couldn't bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is both sad and determined to obtain another. The text further states, “... and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test [@NUM2].” This also demonstrates her determination as, despite failing the test once, she is willing to try again. She misses her home and yearns for the hibiscus she had at her old abode. In conclusion, the author's ending effectively showcases Saeng's unwavering spirit.
847	9712	4	2	In this story, the author concludes in this way to set a tone that makes the person taking the test again feel comfortable. The individual who will retake the test may have chosen this tone based on her past experiences. She takes time to prepare herself, perhaps following the teachings of her parents or grandparents. Through this ending, the author creates an atmosphere where the character can approach the test with a sense of calm and readiness.
848	9713	4	2	The author concluded the story this way because she believes it is the right time for the character, Saeng, to retake the test. The melting of the snow, the budding of the hibiscus, and the return of the geese signify a perfect moment as everything is rejuvenated and the weather is warm. When Saeng says, “when they come back... then I will take the test again,” it indicates that she will have full confidence to take the test. Saeng has vowed to take it again and is convinced that she will pass this time. This is the message the author conveys through the story's conclusion.
849	9714	4	2	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with this paragraph to convey the hope and the significance of the hibiscus to Saeng. Spring, a time of new beginnings when everything comes back to life and starts to regrow, is symbolized by the melting snow and the return of the geese. Saying it's the right time for a second chance, the author uses this imagery. When Saeng failed the test and “tore off a leaf, shredded it to pests,” it represents the dying of the hope that the hibiscus symbolized. Thus, the author ends the story this way to show new horizons and the possibility of a fresh start.
850	9715	4	2	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with a powerful one - sentence paragraph stating that Saeng will take the test when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. This sentence not only incorporates the main point of the story but also leaves the reader in suspense, hinting at what might happen in a potential continuation of Saeng's future and the story. Saeng bought the hibiscus to comfort herself and her mother. As she watched the geese, the author chose this moment to convey Saeng's determination to take the test. In conclusion, the author's concluding sentence not only summarizes the story but also creates a cliff - hanger, leaving the reader eager for more.
851	9716	4	2	As the end of the story nears, Saeng silently vows to herself that when spring arrives, with the melting snow, the return of geese, and the budding of the hibiscus, she will retake the test. The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to prompt readers to reflect on the story even after they've finished reading.
852	9717	4	2	"In numerous stories, narrators often conclude with a dramatic yet conclusive statement. In the short - story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the young girl, Saeng, silently vows to herself about when she'll retake the test. Although not directly addressed to the reader, it still conveys this information. The author includes this ""vow"" to inform the reader of future events and to showcase the girl's determination and spiritual connection with the plant. For instance, the mention of the hibiscus budding indicates the girl's connection, as the plant offers her comfort and confidence, especially as she prepares to retake the test. In conclusion, the narrator ends the story with this paragraph to foreshadow future events and illustrate the girl's spiritual bond with the flower and her homeland."
853	9718	4	2	"In the story, the author concludes the last paragraph with the statement, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The reason for this conclusion is to convey that Saeng is a student who failed a test. Despite her interest in flowers, she also values her schoolwork. Just as the hibiscus begins to blossom with the arrival of spring, Saeng will retake the test when the snows melt."
854	9719	4	2	After their arrival, Saeng silently vowed to herself. In spring, when the snow melts, geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, she'll retake the test. She says this as she feels a sense of being back home. She finds the place familiar and thinks about how quietly each season passes. Her life is quiet and laid - back. She feels at home in this place. Having failed her driving test, she realizes how different life in the United States is from Vietnam. She expresses her feelings through the topic of the flower.
855	9720	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to remind and summarize for the reader. The summary spans from the start of the story, where Saeng failed the test, to the end, where she plants the hibiscus in winter. By doing so, the author aims to make the reader recall the entire story.
856	9721	4	2	He concludes the story in this way so that readers do not perceive her as defeated. Instead, she becomes more aware and believes she can accomplish the task. Moreover, the flower has instilled in her greater self - confidence, and it now serves as a reminder of her home.
857	9722	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner because, similar to the flower that will bloom anew, she too will have a fresh start. The flower symbolizes determination, and it is used to represent her own resolve. Despite failing her driver's test, she remains determined to retake it and strive for success. Just as the flower loses its buds in winter and regrows them, Saeng is putting aside her failure and emerging anew.
858	9723	4	2	The author employs this paragraph as a symbol of realization and a new beginning for Saeng. Saeng spent excessive time dwelling on the past and was unaware of how to relish the present. Thematically, the author conveys the message of “living in the moment”. The hibiscus, as her mother stated, represents strength, being “strong enough to make it through the winter months,... that’s what matters”. Ultimately, the author implies that tough times are inevitable, and one should cherish the moments that bring smiles as they will aid in persevering through difficulties.
859	9724	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the character Saeng faced numerous obstacles. At the story's end, Saeng vows to herself that when winter ends, she will retake the test. I believe the author concludes the story this way to foreshadow Saeng's future. It appears that the author suggests Saeng will take time to adapt to her new lifestyle and focus on other aspects before retaking the test. This also demonstrates Saeng's great courage to complete what she once failed. Her perseverance will surely assist her in overcoming many challenges in her new country. In the text, when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole, Saeng says, “Let me help, mother.” This showcases her love for her mother and her care for the plant representing her past. Thus, adding the vow at the story's end is an effective way to illustrate Saeng's commitment.
860	9725	4	2	I think the author includes that excerpt in the text to show the reader that the character made a mistake and will rectify it in the future. I hold this belief because in the text, Saeng began to cry when admitting to her mother that she failed the test. This indicates that she was deeply upset about the failure and hopes to improve soon. Another reason I think the author concludes the story like this is to lead the reader to believe that Saeng will overcome her homesickness.
861	9726	4	2	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with the passage “When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This indicates that Saeng, having failed the test the first time, intends to retake it. The hibiscus she purchased likely comforted her and reminded her of her homeland. As such, she associated the budding of the hibiscus with a new attempt at the test. The plant instilled in her a positive mindset, shifting her focus from potential failure to the possibility of success. Overall, the presence of the hibiscus comforted Saeng during her distress and helped her regain confidence.
862	9727	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with a paragraph that offers reassurance. Saeng, who has faced challenges adapting to the United States from Vietnam, has just endured a difficult day after failing her driver's test. On her walk home, she decides to buy a plant she saw. While in the greenhouse, she expresses her longing for Vietnam, missing elements such as a fine - toothed comb, a hibiscus hedge, a well, and her gentle grandmother. The final paragraph holds the promise that Saeng will retake the test. The winter symbolizes the hardships she has faced and will continue to encounter. Just as the geese must migrate and the hibiscus must survive the cold, Saeng is away from her homeland. However, like the geese and the hibiscus that overcome winter, Saeng will overcome her challenges. This positive and hopeful ending leaves the reader with the message to have hope in life.
863	9728	4	2	The author ends the story with the given paragraph because it implies that after winter, the protagonist will repeat her tasks. For instance, she will dig, send flowers to customers, and so on. Each winter, these actions will be repeated. In essence, the author uses different words to convey that at the end of winter, the protagonist will resume her routine. This is the reason why the author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph, as it encapsulates the cyclical nature of the character's life.
864	9729	4	2	The author included the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to convey the story's theme. Saeng uses the hibiscus as a source of hope in her life. Through the choice of words or diction, the author shows how Saeng's life is intertwined with this flower. Moreover, this paragraph also reflects how her culture is connected to the story's theme, highlighting the significance of nature and hope in her life.
865	9730	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the plant evokes memories for Saeng, and she can be likened to the plant. Both Saeng and the plant are in a new and unfamiliar environment. The plant is being planted outside her house and must grow in the new soil. Similarly, Saeng must learn to grow, improve herself, and prepare to retake the test. Saeng believes that when the plant has grown and adapted, she too will have grown and adapted. In conclusion, this paragraph serves as an ideal ending for the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, effectively tying together the themes of growth and adaptation.
866	9731	4	2	"I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph to summarize the essence of the narrative and to indicate that Saeng will attempt the test once more. The story states that ""she realised that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This final paragraph effectively ties all these elements together."
867	9732	4	2	A vow serves as a fitting ending. She vowed to retake the test after failing it. It conveys her emotions and her commitment to pass. The author aimed to showcase a great deal of feeling and her desperation. Hence, she found a lot of beauty to keep her motivated.
868	9733	4	2	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph where Saeng silently vows to herself, ""When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She purchases the flower because she failed the driver's test. On her way home, she noticed the familiar plant and visited a florist shop to buy one. The flower brings her joy and reminds her of home. The author ends the story in this way to leave a sense of hope, preventing it from ending on a sad note. She still holds hope of passing the driver's test."
869	9734	4	2	On the same day she failed the test, she obtained the plant and witnessed geese flying overhead. Both the plant and the geese hold symbolic meaning for her. The plant symbolizes her former home, while the geese represent moving forward in life, overcoming obstacles like cold weather and snow to reach a better place, likely a warmer climate. All of this represents a new beginning for her. Therefore, she wants to retake the test around the time of this new beginning, when the geese fly over again and the plant grows. Since she failed, she feels the need to start afresh.
870	9735	4	2	The author incorporated the story within this paragraph for multiple reasons. Firstly, it extends the length of the story. Secondly, it demonstrates that even if one fails the first time, they can still make another attempt.
871	9736	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author includes a paragraph where Saeng silently vows to herself that in spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, she will take the test again. This emphasizes Saeng's willingness to try again in spring. Her desire to plant again in spring shows her attempt to adapt to the new environment and her concern for planting."
872	9737	4	2	Saeng mentioned that she'll take the test next spring and hopes to pass it, inspired by her winter flower and the sight of her geese. She has high hopes and will take the test when she sees buds on her hibiscus. She was really upset when she failed it the first time and is hoping to pass next spring.
873	9738	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's short story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concludes with a paragraph stating when the character Saeng will retake her driving test. Saeng says she'll do it ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" I believe the author concludes this way because it shows Saeng has found new hope. After moving from Vietnam, she was extremely homesick. She was so shaky that she couldn't say ""at home"" for fear of crying. However, when she found a hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her homeland as it grew wild back home. She even bought the hibiscus to plant in her new - home garden. The plant gave her memories of her old life and the strength to embrace the new one, which is why she has the courage to try for her driving test again. This concluding paragraph showcases Saeng's emotional shift from depression to hope and the strength the hibiscus plant provides."
874	9739	4	2	"The author concludes the story's last paragraph as Saeng has realized that she shouldn't fear trying a new life or environment. For instance, the mother in the story says, ""It's flowers aren't pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months... this winter hibiscus."" This indicates that the mother wants Saeng to learn to be strong in difficult times. Another example is when the narrator says, ""she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before became, through the quiet repetition of season upon season…"" This shows that Saeng has recognized that the new place she's living in is similar to their old home. In conclusion, the last paragraph conveys that Saeng should face the new reality of the world, be strong, and go with the flow of life."
875	9740	4	2	"Saeng thinks to herself, ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She finds herself in a new place with no friends. One day, in a plant shop, she comes across a Hibiscus flower. The flower calms her spirit and helps her start to adjust to the changes in her life at that time."
876	9741	4	2	In the essay, the author concludes with a paragraph where the young girl, Saeng, states that when winter turns to spring, the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, she will take her driving test again. Saeng failed the test on her first attempt and sees spring as an opportunity for a fresh start, much like a plant coming back to life. The “winter hibiscus” in the essay reminds Saeng of her grandmother and her home in @LOCATION1. Initially, these memories make her sad, but she later realizes their beauty and how they help her endure this difficult time. These memories will give her the strength to continue her life and retake the driver's test in the spring.
877	9742	4	2	The author concludes the story with a paragraph where the girl mentions that when @DATE1 arrives or spring returns, she will try again. This ending is chosen as it reveals the girl's feelings towards spring and animals. Throughout the story, the girl frequently mentions geese, indicating her fondness for animals. By ending with this, the author gives the story a sense of hope and a connection to the natural world, leaving the reader with an understanding of the girl's positive outlook and her affinity for the changing seasons and wildlife.
878	9743	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it summarizes how memories and the plant impact Saeng. Similar to the plant, Saeng thrives better in her native country but can also survive in a new place if cared for and determined to maintain her beauty. The ending shows that Saeng realizes she can persevere like the plant if she tries harder, which is why she will retake the test. Her mother says, “I've seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” Her mother is reassuring her daughter that she can overcome difficult times. In the end, Saeng is confident in her ability to do so.
879	9744	4	2	In “The Winter Hibiscus,” the author ends the story with a hopeful paragraph: “when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The decision to end on an optimistic note has reasons. The hibiscus symbolizes resilience in the face of challenges and the determination to adapt and succeed. Saeng's situation parallels that of the flower; it has been uprooted, replanted, and must survive the winter. Saeng has left her beloved homeland, started a new life in another country, and faced the obstacle of failing an unnamed test. In the final paragraph, she realizes that, like the cherished hibiscus, she must be resilient and determined to succeed in her new home.
880	9745	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This ending explains what Saeng will do after winter. It also keeps readers in suspense about what will happen to Saeng and her mother. Additionally, it sets the stage for a new story once winter ends, leaving the possibility of further adventures and developments in the characters' lives.
881	9746	4	2	I understand the reason behind the author's choice of ending the story, and it is a valid one. The story implies that since she failed this year, when the time comes to prepare the garden next year, she will try again. This conveys a valuable moral lesson: one must persevere in the pursuit of success. Even if one fails, no progress is lost. This is similar to what happened to @PERSON1. Despite taking @DATE1 attempts to successfully invent the light bulb, he simply stated, “I just found out @NUM1 ways not to make a light bulb.” Therefore, I wholeheartedly agree with the author's decision on how to conclude the story.
882	9747	4	2	She engages in this activity to illustrate her struggle with gardening. Each year, she has to tend to her garden because the winter destroys it, blowing it away and causing the plants to die. This annual cycle showcases her ongoing battle and the challenges she faces in maintaining her garden.
883	9748	4	2	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph as it demonstrates Saeng's unwavering determination not to give up. Saeng's primary goal is to make her mother proud, and she is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve this. All Saeng tries to do is bring happiness to her mother. When she failed, her mother was initially disappointed but then surprisingly understanding. When Saeng told her mother about her failure, she started to cry, but her mother gently wiped away her tears. This ending emphasizes Saeng's resilience and the supportive relationship between her and her mother.
884	9749	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it implies that when the shovel - like plants grow again in the spring, as the snow melts and the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will take the test again. In essence, she will wait until the next spring to attempt the test once more. This ending sets a hopeful and forward - looking tone, suggesting a cycle of renewal and the opportunity for a fresh start.
885	9750	4	2	In the story, the test was whether she could overcome her homesickness. When she visited the greenhouse, all the plants and flowers triggered memories of her homeland. The sight of a particular flower reminded her of the times when she would draw water from the well, and a flower would be floating in it. After the winter, she planned to return to that place to see if she still felt homesick. I believe the author ended the story this way because it showcases her perseverance. It shows that she will not give up and is willing to try again to overcome her feelings of longing for home.
886	9751	4	2	"I believe the author included the last paragraph as the story could benefit from a section about Saeng and her future plans. Additionally, the author might have added this paragraph in @MONTH1 because they were considering writing a second installment of ""Winter Hibiscus"" and wanted to include a part that could be relevant to the next story. It makes one wonder if Saeng retakes the test after the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, whether she will pass it this time. This is likely the reason the author added this paragraph to the story."
887	9752	4	2	"I think Minfong Ho ended her story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the way she did to showcase the strong determination of the main character, Saeng. Although Saeng failed the test, obtaining the hibiscus helped her regain the resolve to pass it. Having moments that reminded her of her homeland and family there, she was probably reminded that they would have wanted her to succeed. As a result, she promises herself to retake the test when the hibiscus plant starts budding. This is why I believe ""Winter Hibiscus"" concluded in this manner."
888	9753	4	2	"I think the author, Minfong Ho, concluded her story ""Winter Hibiscus"" to demonstrate the unwavering determination of the protagonist, Saeng. Despite failing the test, Saeng found solace in the hibiscus, which rekindled her motivation to succeed. The memories of her homeland and family likely inspired her to persevere, leading her to vow to retake the test when the hibiscus blooms. This ending effectively highlights Saeng's resilience and the transformative power of hope, making it a fitting conclusion to the story."
889	9754	4	2	"The essay ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho concludes on a positive note. Saeng silently vows, ""When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I think the author included this line to show Saeng's connection to her country. The arrival of spring in the new country reminds her of spring in her original homeland, making her feel at home and giving her the confidence to take the test. This is why the author placed this sentence at the end of the essay."
890	9755	4	2	"Saeng makes a promise to herself: ""In the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again."" The hibiscus serves as a metaphor for Saeng's childhood. She grew up in Vietnam and later moved to the @LOCATION2. Missing her homeland, the flowers trigger a flood of memories, causing her to break down in tears. Adjusting to change, especially moving to a foreign country, is difficult. Planting the winter hibiscus is her way of coping. She realizes that many things she once found strange have now become almost familiar. She knows she will eventually adapt to this major change. Just as a flower changes, Saeng will also change. When the hibiscus overcomes the cold, dreary winter and blooms, Saeng will know she is ready to retake the test, as the flower symbolizes her journey through change. The geese in the story also represent change; they migrate south in winter to avoid the cold and return home when it's warm. Like the geese, Saeng will avoid the test in winter but feel comfortable taking it in spring."
891	9756	4	2	She stated that she will take the test next year.
892	9757	4	2	"The author concludes the story in this way because, in my opinion, the author wants to convey that the character will be ready to ""sprout again"" next year. The character will be prepared to face the test, not to cry or break down when seeing the plant, and to recall childhood memories. He will be ready."
893	9758	4	2	"Saeng purchases a winter hibiscus to plant in the garden, which reminds her of her homeland. She has failed a test and is quite upset. Her mother, feeling sorry for her, doesn't mind the cost of the hibiscus. After planting it, Saeng tells herself, ""In the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, I'll take that test again."" The author uses this paragraph to make readers ponder whether Saeng will pass or fail the test. The mention of ""hibiscus is budding"" and ""the geese return"" implies it's a once - a - year test, as she says she'll take it in spring."
894	9759	4	2	I believe the author concluded this paragraph in the story to convey a message to the reader. The author is suggesting that if a plant can survive the cold winter, then she can pass her driver's test. This is why I think the author included that paragraph.
895	9760	4	2	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with Saeng silently vowing, “When they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Ending with this promise shows hope and determination. Saeng's vow demonstrates her resolve and refusal to accept failure, which offers hope to those who've failed and seek a second chance. This paragraph also showcases Saeng's good character and strength. Despite failing the first time, she's willing to endure the pain of trying again for success, which reflects great inner strength. Additionally, the description “when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding” brings the story full circle, promising spring and better times ahead. There are multiple valid reasons for the author to conclude the story with this vow.
896	9761	4	2	"The author included this addition at the conclusion not merely to bestow a happy and hopeful ending upon the story but also to illustrate to the reader that Saeng gradually adapted to the changes in her life. The preceding paragraph clarifies that Saeng recognized ""the numerous things that once appeared strange had now become... nearly familiar to her."" Consequently, the author ultimately concludes that despite failing the test this time, just as the geese will return in spring, she can retake the test. The author effectively conveys the story's essence and concludes it in an optimistic manner."
897	9762	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the story with Saeng silently vowing, ""When they came back, in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This shows that the hibiscus plant has instilled hope in Saeng and helped her endure challenging times. In the story, Saeng fails her @CAPS1 test and walks home dejected. On her way, she spots a familiar flower, enters a flower store, and is directed to the hibiscus. The flower evokes memories of her hometown in Vietnam. Saeng plants the flower in the vegetable garden, and it gives her the hope to attempt the @CAPS1 test once more."
898	9763	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the season has ended. For instance, it is winter, and the hibiscuses are withering. Additionally, the character is leaving and will not return until spring when she can plant flowers again and retake the test. In summary, this is the reason the author ends the story with this particular paragraph.
899	9764	4	2	"I believe the author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" ends the story with the last paragraph to infuse hope into the conclusion. After a moderately depressing narrative, it provides a sense of joy. It demonstrates that with sufficient determination, one can persevere. It also implies that the end of one's world is a self - imposed concept. This is why I think the author chose such a powerful statement for the ending."
900	9765	4	2	The character appears to have discovered new - found confidence and a fresh sense of joy in the plant that reminds her of her homeland, offering comfort and motivation. She declares that when certain things reemerge, she will strive to complete the test. By setting a specific time, she is pushing herself, much like what most people attempt to do.
901	9766	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it demonstrates that sometimes one must wait for the right time to make another attempt. For instance, the book states, “Madagascar periwinkle, its tag announced, ‘How strange to see it in a pot.’ Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between roofs.” This indicates that any task can be accomplished when the time is appropriate.
902	9767	4	2	I believe the author concluded the story in that manner for multiple reasons, including emotions and symbolism. Firstly, the ending leaves the reader with a mix of emotions such as sadness, hope, and wonder. The girl's test failure and longing for home evoke sadness, while the possibility of returning home instills hope. The open - ended conclusion also sparks wonder as many questions remain unanswered. Secondly, the author uses symbolism in the concluding sentences. The plant and the geese are given significance; the plant is associated with the home she misses deeply. Additionally, the ending leaves various perceptions, like the importance of the plant and the reason for leaving a beloved place. Overall, these factors explain why I think the author ended the story as they did.
903	9768	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng has a deep affection for the beautiful flowers that once grew in her homeland. Her favorite among them was the winter hibiscus, which had stunning red petals as soft as velvet. She also failed a test she took. The story seems to convey that nothing can match the charm of home, but at times, one just needs another opportunity to succeed.
904	9769	4	2	In my opinion, he did what he did because he aimed to showcase his love for all aspects of life. This act was a way for him to express that he embraced every part of the world around him, whether it was the mundane or the extraordinary. His actions were a testament to his positive outlook and appreciation for life in its entirety.
905	9770	4	2	The author ended the story in that way because, despite all the hardships the plant endured, it will still face challenges at the end of winter. The author implies that the plant will take the test of surviving the cold winter and blooming again. This test represents the plant's resilience and the cycle of life. By ending the story this way, the author emphasizes the idea that even after difficulties, there is always a chance for renewal and growth.
906	9771	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for multiple reasons. Firstly, the author aims to convey that the protagonist will overcome the obstacle, which is the test, regardless of the circumstances. The text states, “It can make through the cold months,” which not only supports the last paragraph but also implies that as the protagonist is in a new country and starting afresh, she will adapt. The mention of “Not like the same kind we had before” indicates the difference in this new country, suggesting that she will soon adjust. Finally, the statement “this hibiscus is budding” symbolizes that she will thrive.
907	9772	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as Saeng is alone and is reassuring herself that she will retake the test she failed. Having found something that reminds her of her life before leaving, she is beginning to acclimate to her new home, which gives her the motivation to try again.
908	9773	4	2	The author ends the story in this way so that readers can grasp the theme, which is that one can always start anew after making a mistake. For instance, Saeng failed her driving test, which took an emotional toll on her. However, she decides to try again in the spring, presumably believing that after rejuvenating herself, she will perform better.
909	9774	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a valid reason. The paragraph is a crucial part of the story. When the text says, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return,” it implies that when the snow has gone and the grass has returned, Saeng will start planting again and will be content with it. The statement “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again” shows that she will replant her plants and test them to see how they fare so that she can improve. Saeng loves this plant so much that she can hardly wait. Once the time is right, she plans to plant a large number. In essence, the paragraph indicates that Saeng will wait to plant a hibiscus, and since coming to the United States, she has developed a deep affection for this flower.
910	9775	4	2	For her, it is the ideal time to undertake activities because the return of the geese and the blooming of the hibiscus bring back all the happy memories.
911	9776	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as the hibiscus serves as motivation for her to take the driver's test. In spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will attempt the test once more.
912	9777	4	2	There are several reasons. Firstly, by spring, she will have had more time to adapt to her new life. Additionally, when the hibiscus starts budding, she will feel comforted as it automatically evokes her childhood memories. It also serves as a connection to her former home in Vietnam. When the hibiscus adjusts to its new life in the ground soil, she too will adjust and be prepared to retake the test. It is as if when the plant is ready to bud, she will be ready as well.
913	9778	4	2	The author concludes the story with that sentence, a vow to the flower. It simply indicates that Saeng will return and try again next year to see if things work out with the hibiscus.
914	9779	4	2	The author included the paragraph to demonstrate their care for the flowers. Flowers only bloom during spring and @DATE2, and that is when one plants and studies all that grows in a garden. By doing so, she can pass the test and find happiness in the garden.
915	9780	4	2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” for a few reasons. Primarily, the blooming hibiscus symbolizes hope - the plant will endure the winter months, regrow, and become strong. Similarly, Saeng will also overcome her difficulties. Despite being in an unfamiliar and unwanted place, Saeng can overcome adversity and hardship, just as the hibiscus can withstand the winter. This is why the author ends the story in this way, to convey that Saeng still holds hope.
916	9781	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", Saeng makes a silent vow to herself. She says, ""In the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This vow signifies her intention to start anew, make changes, and adapt to her new life. She does not want to disappoint her mother and will not let her memories break her down. By concluding the story in this way, the author shows how Saeng's life will change in the future and how she will learn to appreciate her current situation."
917	9782	4	2	"The author concludes the story with a paragraph where Saeng silently vows, ""When they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This is done to convey that Saeng is not going to quit. She is determined to take and pass the test. It also means that Saeng will wait for the right moment, until the situation she is in improves, as indicated by the imagery of ""The snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding."
918	9783	4	2	The author concludes the story with the last paragraph to show that by spring, Saeng will be ready to retake her test. Just as the geese return, she will have time to study and pass. The inclusion of this paragraph truly demonstrates her dedication to eventually becoming comfortable in her new home and passing her driver's test in due time. Saeng wants to be at ease with her new life but is not yet because of what she misses. However, she knows that she can try again, like the geese do every winter. This is a very effective way to end the story as it clearly communicates Saeng's dedication and her longing to overcome the obstacles of her new home and driving.
919	9784	4	2	"I believe the author concludes the story in this way because it's like a new beginning. The ending makes one think that Saeng is going to move forward with her life. It makes me think that she plans to start afresh, just like the hibiscus. Once the plant ""starts over"" (rebuds), she will do the same. It also shows that she is determined to continue her life in [LOCATION1]. She won't let her move from Vietnam disrupt her life. She hopes to start anew. The ending is a ""cliff - hanger"" indicating that her story isn't over yet. It shows there's a possibility for her to move on and that she doesn't let her failures control her. She's a strong young woman determined to overcome this."
920	9785	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is an effective ending that grabs the reader's attention. Moreover, it shows that the girl is determined to pass her test, which makes the story seem like one about determination. This is the reason why the author chose to end the story with this paragraph.
921	9786	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to convey that Saeng is determined to make another attempt. One instance of her renewed effort is when she spots the plant and comprehends its symbolic meaning for her. Another example is her declaration of wanting to plant the hibiscus herself to preserve the memories. This is precisely why the author chose this way to end the story.
922	9787	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to imply that since the hibiscus has been planted, they will observe how it fares during the winter. When spring arrives and the hibiscus remains standing, she can take the test. The author seems to be comparing the hibiscus to their life and the obstacles they will encounter. If the hibiscus endures, it indicates that everything will be fine, allowing her to retake the test.
923	9788	4	2	"The final paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" depicts determination and personal growth. Saeng states that ""when this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Just as the hibiscus blossoms, Saeng will also thrive and persevere through the winter to succeed in passing her test. By making this statement, Saeng realizes that she cannot remain sad indefinitely. She must be determined to pass the test. The next season will bring renewal, a fresh start, and beauty, much like a blooming hibiscus."
924	9789	4	2	"Minfong Ho, the author of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking her driver's test again when the geese are present and the hibiscus is blooming. The author aimed to end on a positive note. At the beginning of the story, Saeng, who had recently moved from Vietnam to the location, failed her driver's test. She found a plant from Vietnam, which made her sad. As she said, ""I mean itís not like the kind we had at ñ at -"" and was too emotional to mention home without the risk of tears (Ho, @NUM1). By ending with descriptions of positive future events, Saeng can focus on these and distract herself from other concerns."
925	9790	4	2	"The author concludes the story with these paragraphs for a valid reason. In a way, Saeng is letting go and waiting to retake the test. It is beneficial that she found the flower as it has a positive impact on her and her mother, making her feel better. For example, when she says, ""the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" it shows her new - found resolve. This ending reflects her readiness to move forward and face the test again."
926	9791	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate the transformation of the main character, Saeng, from the story's beginning to its end. It demonstrates a slight new - found confidence in Saeng. This ending also reveals the significant impact of the “Winter hibiscus” on her, as it evokes memories of her homeland. Had Saeng not discovered the hibiscus, she would never have begun to reminisce about her old home. This reminiscing not only reminded her of her past but also enabled her to compare her new home with her old one. Through this comparison, she realized that life in @LOCATION1 is not so bad and that she still carries a part of her old home with her daily. This realization provided her with sufficient hope and confidence to attempt the driving test again. The ending showcases Saeng's change of heart towards @LOCATION1 and her modest gain of hope and confidence.
927	9792	4	2	The author concludes the story this way to firmly imprint the moral of the story in the reader's mind. She believes that one always has a chance to try again, just as the flower restarts its cycle and gets another opportunity to bud. This symbolizes that, like the girl who will retake the test, one can start afresh. The girl will take the test again when the flower starts anew, and the budding flower will support her and instill hope in her.
928	9793	4	2	I'm of the opinion that the author ends the story in this manner because it addresses both subjects. The author intends to convey that when the girl takes her driving test next spring, the hibiscus will give her the confidence to pass it.
929	9794	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus”, I believe the author concludes the story in a way that indicates the protagonist wants to start anew. When she talks to her mom at the story's end, she says, “In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again.” This shows her desire to start over and adapt to her new country. Additionally, she wants to wait for the seasons to change before retaking the test, as she mentions “when the snow melts and the geese return.” She makes this statement because she wishes to have a completely fresh start when she takes the test again. This is why I think the author chose to conclude the story in this way.
930	9795	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story like this because it depicts the passage of time. As time passes, the character has grown more and may be ready to take the test since she now has an understanding of what it's like. Moreover, the budding hibiscus will make her feel more comfortable and relaxed, as it gives her a sense of security and a feeling of home. When the “hibiscus is budding,” both the flower and she are starting anew.
931	9796	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng needs to adapt to the new country. She awaits the hibiscus budding. Just as the plant's budding indicates its adaptation to a new environment, so does it symbolize Saeng's adaptation. The story reveals that Saeng is unaccustomed to the new country; she cries upon seeing the plants as they remind her of her old home. The plant also offers her comfort. Once she adapts to the new country, she will retake the test.
932	9797	4	2	In the story, Saeng failed her test and knew her mother would be angry. As a result, she got a flower. The author concludes the story with Saeng silently vowing to herself, “When they come back in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Had she not failed the test, she likely would not have gotten the flower in the first place.
933	9798	4	2	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the narrative with Saeng making a vow to herself, which underscores the significance of the hibiscus flower to her. For instance, the hibiscus provides her with determination as it evokes memories of her home. Saeng states, “... and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The flower instills confidence in her and reminds her of her home in Vietnam before they relocated to @LOCATION2. Thus, the author concludes the story with this particular paragraph as it symbolizes the importance of the flower.
934	9799	4	2	I believe she feels a strong connection to the hibiscus plant because it reminds her of her homeland. She seems to imply that when the hibiscus shows its inner budding, she will also blossom. The plant must exert effort to produce flowers, and the sun must shine to melt the snow. Similarly, she needs to shed her bad habits and fulfill what is necessary to pass the test. However, she must not forget her origins and the memories left behind. As she silently vows, “... then I will take that test again.”
935	9800	4	2	In the story “Winter @CAPS1,” the author concludes with the last paragraph because when the budding season returns, the protagonist will be eager to explore. She will want to learn more about hibiscus plants and their growth. Moreover, she anticipates taking care of them as they begin to bud. This is the reason the author ended the story with that paragraph.
936	9801	4	2	The inclusion of this paragraph serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it indicates that the budding flower will offer emotional encouragement to the protagonist as it will evoke memories of her home. This is evident when she states, “a blossom of two would have blown into the well,” which clearly reminds her of her homeland. Secondly, it demonstrates her adaptation to her new home. When the geese flew by, she realized that many things she once considered strange had now become almost familiar. This shows that she is not only adapting but also starting to enjoy her new life. In conclusion, this final paragraph is significant as it portrays the transformation in her life.
937	9802	4	2	The author conveys that the protagonist will be ready when the flowers start to grow and the geese return home. This implies that certain natural phenomena act as indicators for her preparedness. Once these events occur, she will reach a state of readiness. In essence, the author uses these natural elements to mark the time when the protagonist will be fully equipped for whatever lies ahead.
938	9803	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the protagonist, Saeng, failed her driver's test. As stated, “As Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test,” it is clear that she did not succeed. It is speculated that the snow on the ground may have caused her to make mistakes during the test. Saeng expresses that when the weather gets warmer and the plants start to grow, she will retake the test with the hope of passing. In conclusion, this is the reason why the author ends the story with this paragraph, highlighting Saeng's determination to try again under more favorable conditions.
939	9804	4	2	In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with the statement “in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to convey a specific point. The author implies that all these natural occurrences are necessary for the protagonist to be in a mentally and emotionally stable state to retake the test. These events symbolize renewal and a fresh start, which are essential for her to approach the test with confidence. In conclusion, the author uses this conclusion to emphasize the significance of these natural elements in the protagonist's journey towards retaking the test.
940	9805	4	2	The author ends the story in this manner because the hibiscus plant symbolizes new beginnings, which Saeng desperately needs. After failing her test, Saeng sought comfort and went to the greenhouse, where she spent @MONEY1 on a hibiscus plant. This plant not only reminded her of her home but also made her realize that her new home is a new chapter in her life. The hibiscus plant instills in Saeng the hope that starting over can be a positive experience and that she will pass the test the next time she takes it. In conclusion, the author uses the hibiscus plant as a powerful symbol to end the story on an optimistic note for Saeng.
941	9806	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. The reason is that the author wishes to conclude by writing about geese. Additionally, the author has an affinity for plants and the seasons when they bud. The author vowed to take the test in the spring and eagerly anticipates the melting of the snow to take the test.
942	9807	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she desires the same environment and all the things she wanted when she previously took the test.
943	9808	4	2	In my opinion, the author's choice of words in the story's conclusion signals to the reader that the story continues. Moreover, I think the test serves to remind her of home.
944	9809	4	2	The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself. In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author does this because the story begins with Saeng failing her driver - license test. Also, she considered the Winter Hibiscus to be good luck after it disappeared, and she associated it with the geese. By combining these elements, she said that when the geese come back and the snow melts, she will take the test again.
945	9810	4	2	I believe Saeng concluded the story this way because there's always an opportunity to make amends for the past, provided the past permits it. Saeng failed the test. When she said, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it implies that just as a vegetable garden can start growing again in spring despite the snow outside, even though Saeng failed the test, there's always another chance. We can make up for past losses, retry, and strive for success.
946	9811	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with the sentence “when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself in spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The winter hibiscus symbolizes Saeng's fondness for her former home. It is not a real hibiscus in the common sense, as she was too emotional to say “at home.” When the hibiscus buds, she will still cherish her past home but will have better adapted to her current environment. The return of the geese indicates that she will one day find a sense of home in her new place. Once she finds that place, she will be ready to “take the test” and resume normal life. By ending the story with this sentence, the author shows that Saeng will eventually integrate into her new life.
947	9812	4	2	The author concluded the story in such a way because of a positive outlook. Similar to the returning geese, she is optimistic about retaking the test and believes she will pass. In the story, she stated, “Many things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This implies that when she first moved, everything seemed strange due to her lack of prior experience. However, as she settles in, she becomes accustomed to the new environment, and nothing will seem strange anymore as this has become her home.
948	9813	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the girl named Saeng took a test and failed. She received a flower that brought back memories of the past. After that, she decided to retake the test as she believed things would get better. When she saw the geese flying overhead, she knew they would return in spring after winter. At that time, the flower that evokes good memories from the past will blossom, and she will retake the test and pass. These are the reasons why I think the author concluded the story with that paragraph.
949	9814	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner because the protagonist loves her homeland, nature, and her mother. She adores the greenery and eagerly anticipates the arrival of spring. As a result, she decides to take on the challenge of overcoming the feeling of being out of place. This is the motivation behind the author's choice to end the story in such a way.
950	9815	4	2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story in this fashion to showcase the girl's determination and to leave the reader eager for more. Clearly, Saeng is determined to succeed. By ending the story on a cliff - hanger, the author builds suspense and excitement for further action. This approach effectively engages the reader and leaves them looking forward to what might happen next.
951	9816	4	2	"The author concludes the story with the given paragraph as it demonstrates that Saeng is adapting to life in a new place. Towards the text's end, Saeng remarks that many things she once found strange have now become familiar. The winter hibiscus offers comfort and evokes memories of her home. Her mention of ""In the spring when the snows melt"" indicates her growing accustomed to ""the quiet repetition of season upon season."" The geese forming a distinctive V are also becoming a familiar sight. The last paragraph effectively concludes the story as it shows Saeng's increasing comfort in her new surroundings and her hopeful outlook for the future."
952	9817	4	2	When they returned, Saeng silently vowed to herself that in the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will retake the test. The author uses these lines to engage the reader and show Saeng's adaptation to her circumstances. Saeng values the uniqueness of plants and finds solace in memories of her homeland.
953	9818	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to convey that Saeng will wait until the plants are abundant. This way, if she fails the test again, she will have something to hold onto. For instance, when Saeng failed the test, she tried to overcome the feeling of failure by buying something that reminded her of her country and brought back past memories. Another example is when Saeng felt a powerful shock of recognition, almost visceral, and forgot about her life's troubles, from moving to a new location to failing the test. This feeling made her feel at home again. In conclusion, the author's conclusion suggests that Saeng copes with her problems by recalling memories associated with plants that remind her of her home country.
954	9819	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story this way to show that Saeng will be settled by next year. She initially found all the new things in this place strange, but now they have become second nature to her. I think the hibiscus serves as a symbol of hope and inspiration for her. I believe she finally realizes that she is in this new place to stay and can't return to Vietnam. So, she has to accept that this is her new home, and I think she is on the path to doing just that.
955	9820	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng has faith in a new start. Saeng draws a comparison between herself and the hibiscus. She says that when the “hibiscus is [in a certain state],” she will retake the test. This implies that when the hibiscus restarts its life, she will too. Saeng believes that when the hibiscus is “strong enough to endure the cold,” she is strong enough to pass her driver's test and live in a new country. Winter and cold symbolize death, while spring represents a new life or beginning. Saeng thinks to herself, “in the spring… I will take the test,” which marks a new beginning and a new hope for her.
956	9821	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with the sentence “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This shows that although the main character, Saeng, failed once, she will try again. The geese return in spring to experience a new season, and the hibiscus buds new flowers, symbolizing a fresh start. Saeng believes that if these natural elements can succeed after trying again, so can she, and this time she will achieve success. Moreover, it demonstrates the determination of all living things to fulfill their main purpose. The flower has the drive to re - bud, the geese are driven to return in spring, and Saeng is driven to pass the test. Minfong Ho included this quote as the last line of the story to inspire people. It encourages them to persevere in life and, if they fail a task, to try again, thus offering inspiration to continue living.
957	9822	4	2	In the story's final paragraph, Saeng makes a silent vow to retake the driving test in spring. The author ends the story with this paragraph to illustrate the hope that nature instills in Saeng. The author describes peaceful natural elements such as geese and hibiscus, from which Saeng draws strength as they remind her of her homeland. In this way, she always carries a part of her past with her. Throughout the story, Saeng has a connection with nature and gains strength from it. Her mother has a garden, and Saeng's preference for natural foods like bitter melons over [LOCATION1] reflects her different past. This concluding paragraph showcases how the beautiful nature of her homeland has brought hope to Saeng, aiding her in adapting to life in a new place.
958	9823	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the hope that the main character will become stronger. Specifically, she will feel more at ease in her new environment and will miss her home less. During the year, she attempted to meet a certain goal but failed because she didn't get her grandmother what was asked for and instead spent the resources on something else. This is the reason I think the author added this paragraph to the story, as it gives a sense of potential growth and adaptation for the character.
959	9824	4	2	The author concludes the story with the given paragraph to demonstrate the main character, Saeng, adapting and exerting her best efforts in her new lifestyle. For instance, in the last paragraph, Saeng vows to herself, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This indicates that she is putting in more effort in her new environment. In summary, the author uses this paragraph to show how an individual can adapt to change.
960	9825	4	2	The author includes this part in the text because metaphors are employed to explain the author's perception of Saeng's personal life. By using these metaphors, the author can convey complex feelings and situations related to Saeng's personal life in a more vivid and nuanced way. This literary device helps the readers to better understand the underlying emotions and circumstances of Saeng's life as perceived by the author.
961	9826	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it showcases Saeng's sympathy. Due to disappointing her mother, Saeng wishes to assist her in the garden. For example, she feels remorse for upsetting her mother. While her mother is gardening, she offers, ""Here, let me help, mother,"" as her mother's frail beauty has affected her. When Saeng informed her mother of failing the driving test, she was aware not to meet her mother's gaze, as stated, ""Saeng didn't dare look her mother in the eye,"" which indicates Saeng's concern for her mother's reaction. Eventually, her mother expresses happiness about the plant, saying, ""It's a beautiful plant, I'm glad you got it,"" demonstrating a close bond between the mother and daughter. Thus, Saeng's sympathy and her desire to improve herself are evident in the story's conclusion."
962	9827	4	2	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" revolves around a young girl who prioritizes gardening over schoolwork. The provided conclusion suggests that when spring arrives and the winter hibiscus fades, she will pass the school test she previously failed. Currently, Saeng is solely focused on the winter hibiscus. For instance, the line ""I paid over nineteen dollars for it"" reveals that she spent all her money on this plant instead of buying food. Additionally, the quote ""I failed the test"" accompanied by Saeng's tears indicates that her failure was due to her preoccupation with the hibiscus. In conclusion, as spring approaches and the winter hibiscus disappears, Saeng will shift her focus from gardening to school. Perhaps then she will pass her test and resume her gardening hobby."
963	9828	4	2	The author has a valid reason for concluding the story in this manner. The story's main character, Saeng, relocates from Vietnam to the United States and fails her driver's test. Saeng has yet to adjust to life in the United States. When she encounters a familiar hibiscus plant, she purchases it to preserve her memories of Vietnam. The author aims to convey that since Saeng planted the hibiscus in winter, when it blossoms in spring, she will be prepared to retake and pass her driver's test as she will have adapted to life in the United States. The story's theme is that when moving away from one's place of origin, it is beneficial to bring items that evoke memories of that place to retain a connection to its culture. Therefore, the author begins and ends the story with the same subject.
964	9829	4	2	"The author concludes the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a sentence about retaking the driver's test in the spring to convey the themes of adapting to circumstances and the determination to succeed. The main character, Saeng, is an immigrant. As the United States is not her homeland, she is still unaccustomed to many aspects of life here, and the story depicts her struggle to adapt. For example, when she sees the flower ""Madagascar penwinhle,"" she remarks, ""how strange to see it in a pot"" because ""Back home it just grows wild."" The last sentence of the story, ""and the geese return,"" is symbolic. Geese adapt to circumstances by flying south for the winter, similar to Saeng's attempt to adapt, and Saeng realizes their pattern is becoming familiar. The final line, ""I will take that test again,"" summarizes Saeng's determination throughout the story. She is not only determined to pass her driver's test but also to succeed in other areas. For instance, when planting the hibiscus, Saeng notes that ""the soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting her shovel into it."" Despite the difficulty, she ""Dug out a hole"" and believes the plant is strong enough to survive the cold months, just as she will be strong enough to overcome obstacles. The last sentence of the story is significant as it expresses important themes and provides valuable insights into Saeng's character."
965	9830	4	2	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph to establish the story's theme. In the story, the hibiscus represents significant aspects for Saeng, such as confidence, beauty, adaptation, and memories of her homeland. After failing the driving test, Saeng buys the hibiscus to alleviate her homesickness. The hibiscus can be seen as a metaphor for Saeng; it is the same plant but growing differently in a new area, just as Saeng remains the same person in a new home. The significance of the last paragraph lies mainly in the hibiscus budding. It represents Saeng's homeland as its blossoming symbolizes her love for it. When the author writes, ""then I will take that test again,"" it refers to the new confidence Saeng will gain when the hibiscus blooms, which is another metaphor comparing the hibiscus to Saeng."
966	9831	4	2	The author, @PERSON1, concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with the paragraph “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding…” to indicate that Saeng is starting anew. Although she misses her former life, including her grandmother, the well, and the fine - toothed comb, she is making an effort and saying “take that test again”. By referring to the test, it shows she is not ready to succumb to the “weight of loss” and her grief. In essence, this conclusion depicts Saeng's resolve to move forward.
967	9832	4	2	The author concludes the story with the statement “when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The reason is that the hibiscus offers comfort to Saeng. Once the plant is healthy and thriving, she will feel at ease to take the test. While seeking comfort from a plant may seem naive, it is not the plant itself that brings comfort but rather the memories of her beloved home in Vietnam that the hibiscus evokes. When the plant flourishes, similar to her tropical home, she believes it will give her enough comfort to pass the test. Thus, this is the rationale behind the author's choice to end the story with this paragraph.
968	9833	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that as the hibiscus plant grows, so will Saeng. After failing the driver's test, Saeng visits the greenhouse and discovers the Hibiscus plant. This plant reminds her of her true home in Vietnam, where they had similar plants. The plant triggers a flood of memories, and despite her sadness, these memories comfort her. She uses the plant as a source of comfort, allowing her to reflect on her origins and the positive memories, which in turn lifts her spirits. To boost her confidence, she decides to plant the hibiscus. “The ‘winter hibiscus’ was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around.” Then, she sees geese flying in the sky, which serves as a symbol for that day, something to remember it by for the next year. When “the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” she will take the test again. These elements evoke good memories that strengthen her resolve. In conclusion, the author uses this ending to show Saeng's growth and determination.
969	9834	4	2	I think Saeng needs to retake the test to improve her grade. She is worried about the snow in spring because she is concerned that the flower will be covered by it. Saeng's mother allows her to help with the peppers and melons and lets her stay for dinner. Overall, these circumstances contribute to Saeng's situation and her motivation to retake the test.
970	9835	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to convey to the readers that the protagonist is not giving up on the test. The statement “…then I will take that test again” clearly shows that she still holds hope. The author wants the character to continue the test in search of the right flower. This is the reason why the author chose to end the story with this particular paragraph, emphasizing the character's perseverance.
971	9836	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as, during winter, all life subsides, only to revive in spring. This seasonal cycle implies that Saeng, akin to a plant, would feel more inspired to perform well on the test. Saeng's situation parallels that of a plant; she struggles and frets in the winter and then flourishes beautifully in the spring. Additionally, I believe the memories associated with the winter hibiscus plant motivated her to stop dwelling on the past and look forward to the future.
972	9837	4	2	He wrote this piece because he is discussing weather changes. In the context of his work, the exploration of these weather - related aspects forms the basis for his writing.
973	9838	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is drawing a parallel between the plants and herself. Just as plants bloom, she hopes to achieve success by taking the test. Moreover, she has come to realize that many things she once considered strange have, through the repeated cycle of seasons, become almost familiar to her. Like the geese that lift their heads and face the distance as their distinctive V is etched against the evening sky, she too is looking forward. This is why I think the author included that paragraph to conclude the story, as she is comparing herself to the geese and following their example.
974	9839	4	2	The author includes the last quote because he hopes for her to achieve her dream. The text describes how she has come to realize that many things she once regarded as odd have, through the quiet passage of seasons, become familiar. Saeng hails from Vietnam, and her family has a certain dream. Thus, the author wishes for her family to adapt to their new life in the given location.
975	9840	4	2	She makes this statement because currently, it is winter, and the cold weather makes it difficult for flowers to grow. So, she is indicating that when spring returns, she will attempt the test of growing flowers again. In conclusion, this is the reason why the author makes that statement at the end of the paragraph.
976	9841	4	2	The author concludes the story with the given paragraph to evoke a sense of hope and determination for the future within Saeng at that moment. Throughout the story, Saeng appeared to be succumbing to despair when remembering her homeland. She was not faring well in her new country, a realization that hit her hardest when she failed her driving test. However, when she passed by a flower - shop and saw the plants that once bloomed freely and beautifully in her homeland confined in tiny pots and struggling to survive, it made her think of herself in @LOCATION1. As she started planting her hibiscus, she compared herself to it. Thus, when her plant blooms well in spring, she believes she will pass the test.
977	9842	4	2	The author concludes the story by stating that at Valkay, the hibiscus is yet to bud in winter, and all the geese will return to their home and stay there because they dislike the winter. This conclusion ties up the story's themes and gives a sense of natural order and the cycle of life.
978	9843	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several reasons. Firstly, it reflects the change in Saeng's attitude. At the start of the story, Saeng is disheartened and has no hope of adapting to her new home. By including this paragraph at the end, it demonstrates that she has gained hope and will not give up. Secondly, it shows that life continues even in the most difficult situations. The arrival of a new season symbolically indicates that Saeng's current state of mind is not permanent and that she too will change. In conclusion, the author uses this paragraph to conclude the story for valid reasons.
979	9844	4	2	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because after the girl failed her test, the bud reminds her of her grandmother's long grey hair, which she believes brings her good luck. As winter passes and spring arrives, the buds start to reappear, and that's when she will retake the test. This is why the author made this statement the last sentence of the story, providing a sense of hope and a new beginning.
980	9845	4	2	I'll explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. One reason is that it portrays Saeng as confident. It also shows that she will not give up. Moreover, it indicates her willingness to enhance her abilities. These aspects are why the author chooses this paragraph to conclude the story, effectively summarizing Saeng's character development.
981	9846	4	2	"The author likely intended to convey the hopeful enlightenment regarding Saeng's complex dilemma. In the phrase ""When they come back"", the author presumably refers to the hibiscus flowers that symbolize the fond memories of her homeland. Through the ""test"" of planting the buds, just as she did with her grandmother back home, the author depicts Saeng's struggle to adapt to her new life. This test represents the achievement of adapting to her new circumstances. Therefore, the author concluded the story with a paragraph indicating that Saeng will indeed take that test again."
982	9847	4	2	"The author concludes the story with a specific paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination to adapt to her new life. On the second page, in the third paragraph, the author writes, ""Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile… That at least, she could hold onto."" After failing her driver's test, Saeng felt alienated and alone. She desperately regarded the flower as a reminder of her homeland, Vietnam. The flower evoked comforting memories for her, leading her to buy one of the plants and return home. After a conversation with her mother, Saeng realizes that she must come to terms with her new home, just as the flower must adapt to its new environment. By ending the story with the stated sentence, the author informs the reader that Saeng must ""blossom"" in her new home to thrive. Similar to how the flower needs time to establish its roots in the ground, Saeng also requires time for this process."
983	9848	4	2	"The author concludes the story with a particular paragraph, perhaps to demonstrate the confidence that Saeng would repeat all her efforts if necessary. For instance, the statement ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" shows that she is willing to take the step and the chance. The author ends the story on a note of confidence and courage, leaving the impression of Saeng's determination to face challenges anew."
984	9849	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The author does this to end the story on a hopeful note, suggesting that Saeng will take the test again and perform well. Additionally, the author chooses this ending because Saeng has faith in herself and has made a vow to take action. It is hoped that this vow will further encourage and motivate her to achieve her goals.
985	9850	4	2	The author of the story concludes it with a paragraph essentially stating that winter is approaching, and things will wither but will return in the next spring. The author is referring to the plant. It seems that the author is keeping track of the memories the plant left with Saeng and the thoughts that came to her mind when she connected with the flower through her senses. Saeng is eager to see how the flower buds next spring and what other new experiences she will have.
986	9851	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way to showcase the character's attitude change. She is now determined to focus on what she needs to do. She will retake the test with pride in the spring when the snow melts.
987	9852	4	2	The author chooses to end the story with the given paragraph to convey multiple messages. Firstly, the ending paragraph is used to illustrate optimism. The entire story was melancholic, yet the ending offers a glimmer of hope. At the start, it mentions “a sense of loss so deep…”, while at the end, it states “I will take that test again.” This shows the shift in her attitude from cynicism to hope. Another reason for ending the story with this paragraph is to demonstrate Saeng's acceptance. When the story says that the geese were “almost familiar to her now,” it indicates that despite her sadness at leaving home, she is adapting well. In conclusion, the author ends the story with an inspiring paragraph to depict a positive change.
988	9853	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, stating that when spring and [DATE2] arrive again, she will retake the test. This implies that she will plant the flowers and attempt to make them grow once more, hoping not to fail. For instance, “Mrs. Lambert, liked it. this sharp bitter melon that left a golden after - taste on the tongue.”
989	9854	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to end it on a positive note and convey a valuable message. The characters are not going to quit just because they failed the first time.
990	9855	4	2	I believe the sole reason the author included the last paragraph was to show that she wouldn't give up easily. She was still going to retake the test, perhaps hoping for good luck from the hibiscus. One day, after failing her driver's test, Saeng was walking home. She noticed a familiar flower and went to a florist to buy it. After purchasing it, she went home and gave it to her mom, and they planted it. Maybe it can evoke good memories of her hometown or bring good luck.
991	9856	4	2	The author concludes the story with this passage due to its symbolic nature. The return of the geese in spring represents a new beginning, and the budding of the hibiscus signifies new life. When these events occur, Saeng will also have a fresh start. Ending the story in this way creates a cliff - hanger for some readers. It makes them eager to know more. Given that she failed her test, readers want to know if Saeng will pass it in the spring, a time of new beginnings. When the new season starts, everything and everyone will have new starts. When the hibiscus blooms, it will be as if she has the new ability to overcome obstacles, form new connections with her past, and find comfort during difficult times. The hibiscus symbolizes all of these aspects.
992	9857	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it encapsulates the essence of the narrative. Saeng observes the events of winter and tries to memorize them so that she can anticipate what will happen when winter returns. This shows her attempt to understand and adapt to the cyclical nature of life in the story's setting.
993	9858	4	2	The author ends the story in this manner because by the time winter concludes, the character will have acclimated to her new society, much like the hibiscus adapts to its environment. This ending suggests a parallel between the character's personal growth and the natural process of adaptation.
994	9859	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, a young girl named Saeng has moved from her native Vietnam to the United States. She was hoping to obtain her driver's license but failed the test. The hibiscus she sees provides her with comfort, as it reminds her of Vietnam. When she buys the hibiscus, her mother is initially concerned about the price. However, upon seeing her daughter's homesickness, her mother becomes understanding. After planting the hibiscus, Saeng watches the geese and realizes that they change their habitat every year. Inspired by the geese and the hibiscus, Saeng promises herself that “in the spring when the snow melts away, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This shows her determination to overcome her setback and embrace a new opportunity.
995	9860	4	2	The author uses this paragraph as it serves as a perfect ending. Through this, Saeng tells that when all the snow has disappeared, she will retake the test. Reading between the lines, it conveys more than just this statement. She has a deep affection for the hibiscus, and when it comes back to life in the spring, she will gain new energy to take the test again. Her experience with the hibiscus clearly shows that the plant has a significant influence on her, as it strongly reminds her of her old home. It also implies that everyone and everything deserves a second chance. In her case, it is the test she wishes to retake. Additionally, by spring, after living in the new location for a couple of months, she will adjust to the new situation. Currently, she is just homesick, even though her new home is now this place. Thus, the hibiscus is beneficial for her; it is something she can hold onto from her past home.
996	9861	4	2	Author Minfong Ho concludes the story in this manner to illustrate the overcoming of obstacles. The narrative depicts the numerous difficulties Saeng encounters when leaving her old home and moving to a new one. On the day described, she fails a driver's test, skips lunch with her friend, and spends all her money on a plant from her former home. Additionally, this paragraph demonstrates how the Hibiscus symbolizes Saeng. The plant is out of its native environment, facing multiple challenges such as the cold, its small pot, and the overall surroundings. In every aspect, the plant's situation mirrors that of the main character, and the last paragraph serves to connect them.
997	9862	4	2	The author included this paragraph to convey that the snow will melt away in spring. This implies a sense of renewal and the passage of difficult times. The mention of the snow disappearing in springtime likely serves as a metaphor for the resolution of problems or the end of a challenging period. Overall, the author's use of this paragraph is to communicate this seasonal change and its associated implications.
998	9863	4	2	The last paragraph conveys a single, profound message: to be like a Hibiscus and persevere in the tests of life. Just as the Hibiscus will return in spring, one should have the resilience to face life's challenges again. The comparison to the Hibiscus emphasizes the idea of renewal and the ability to bounce back. Clearly, the last paragraph holds a significant and meaningful message.
999	9864	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is willing to change and aims to do so by the arrival of spring. By ""change,"" Saeng desires to feel comfortable in @LOCATION1, recall memories of her former home without breaking down and crying. Moreover, the author uses the geese as an example because they leave their home annually and manage to cope, suggesting that Saeng can also handle the changes in her life. In conclusion, the author's choice of concluding elements effectively portrays Saeng's journey of adaptation."
1000	9865	4	2	"The author ends the story with that statement because when one fails at something, time is needed to recover and try again. When Saeng fails her driving test, she is disheartened. After the failure, she visits a greenery area where she sees flowers from her homeland and buys a hibiscus. This purchase reminds her of the differences between her old and new places and how things change when moving to a new location. Initially, these changes may not be pleasant, but one can get used to them, like Saeng's experience with the geese flying in a ""V."" At first, she found it strange, but now it is familiar. Through this experience, Saeng learns that despite life's changes, she must have the courage to try again."
1001	9866	4	2	She ended the paragraph with those words to demonstrate her commitment to gardening and her decision not to garden until the geese return.
1002	9867	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph because Saeng has a deep - seated love for nature. She is so in love with nature that she would never cause it any harm. I believe the author wanted to end on a positive note. Also, it seems she needs to take the test again.
1003	9868	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way as it showcases the protagonist's determination. The text indicates that she will persist in adapting to her life until she fully accepts her new home. It also draws a parallel between the growth of buds and her own development, which is more mental than physical. Her decision to retake the test implies that she has self - confidence, believing that she will mature and become someone who, while missing her homeland, can accept her new place of residence. This is the reason behind the author's choice of ending.
1004	9869	4	2	I think what she's saying is that when spring arrives, she'll turn over a new leaf and do better on her driving test. I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng isn't a quitter and will put in more effort.
1005	9870	4	2	It is necessary to conduct a thorough and meticulous check of the reserved items.
1006	9871	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph either because the cold was unbearable or because the author did not want to be present while the cold persisted. At that time, it was extremely cold. The conclusion effectively captures the influence of the cold on the situation and the author's response.
1007	9872	4	2	In my view, the author ends the story with this paragraph for multiple reasons. Firstly, the author aims to evoke sympathy for the hibiscus. Secondly, it shows that Saeng desires to make her mother proud, indicating that she is not willing to give up. This also reflects Saeng's self - belief and her confidence in passing the test. Lastly, the final paragraph reveals that Saeng wants people to understand that even something as seemingly insignificant as a plant can help her overcome obstacles and pursue her dreams. The author chose this paragraph to conclude the story because it clearly shows that Saeng will never stop believing in herself.
1008	9873	4	2	The author of the story decides to end it with that sentence as the story mainly revolves around Saeng failing her driver's test. When Saeng saw the hibiscus, it reminded her of home and alleviated her distress. In paragraph @NUM1, Saeng remarks, “And that rich, sweet scent – that was familiar too,” describing the pleasantness and familiarity of the flowers through the recognizable scent. Saeng was already disheartened about leaving her home in @LOCATION1. Coming to @LOCATION2 and then failing her driver's test compounded her misery. However, the sight of the flower, which reminded her of home, made her feel slightly better. By using that quote to end the story, the author shows that Saeng will gain the courage to retake the test when the flower blooms.
1009	9874	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way to emphasize certain points. Saeng vowed that it would teach her that everything lives with hope and adaptation. She implies that when everything recovers and shows it can survive, she will too. At that time, she will take the driver's test. The author also intends to prove that people need to have faith in themselves and adapt to their surroundings. This is the reason behind the author's choice of conclusion.
1010	9875	4	2	In stories, authors conclude in various ways, each with distinct effects. In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author ends with this paragraph because it has a “touching” impact on the reader and summarizes all the key points of the story. For instance, at the start of the conclusion, it states “Saeng vowed silently to herself.” Through this unique quote, the author creates imagery, painting a mental picture of a solitary girl kneeling in the cold garden, whispering to herself. This part of the quote touches the reader's heart. Another reason is that it sums up the story. The quote “When the geese return, hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again” mentions the hibiscus, which is frequently referred to throughout the story, the geese at the end, and the test failure at the beginning. In conclusion, this is why the author used this paragraph as the conclusion for this touching story.
1011	9876	4	2	In the story, the author concludes that Saeng failed a winter test. Due to her affection for the hibiscus plant, spring will assist her in taking the test.
1012	9877	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wanted the reader to understand that just because she failed, it doesn't mean her life is over. She will recover and attempt the same thing next year.
1013	9878	4	2	The author uses this paragraph to conclude and show that she will retake the test and adapt to her new surroundings. For instance, the story states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This indicates that she is getting accustomed to her current location and is willing to give it a chance. It seems that she no longer finds it as bad as she initially thought, despite it being different from her home and the place she was used to.
1014	9879	4	2	Perhaps the author wrote that as the last sentence or paragraph because in the story, the character did something and failed at it. Thus, she wants to attempt it again.
1015	9880	4	2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with the closing paragraph as it ties up all the themes. It demonstrates that Saeng has the determination to overcome obstacles and uses the plant as a metaphor, similar to the rest of the story. The hibiscus represents Saeng's adjustment to change. The plant “dies” in the winter, which is equivalent to Saeng not getting her driver's license. However, the plant will revive, symbolizing determination and adjustment. This is why Saeng says she will return and pass the test, as she has adapted and is now determined to overcome this obstacle.
1016	9881	4	2	After reading the quote “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test” from Minfong Ho's story “Winter’s Hibiscus,” I believe the author intends to convey that after the winter and fall have passed, Saeng will be ready to face the challenge of planting again and will feel good about herself. She lifted her head and watched as the geese's distinctive “V” was etched against the evening sky, gradually fading into the distance. Reflecting on this, I think Saeng felt that the geese were secretly assuring her that what she was doing was right. In conclusion, the imagery of the geese and the hibiscus in the quote serves to symbolize Saeng's hope and determination for a new beginning.
1017	9882	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate that the protagonist desires and is willing to overcome the difficulties of leaving her homeland. In the story, she visits a greenhouse to test herself. Inside, she discovers a plant from her homeland, which reminds her of her grandmother. As she finds other plants that evoke memories of her homeland, she begins to cry. I strongly believe she had a profound connection with her grandmother. When they left their home country, she likely cried for days, as if she had lost a part of her soul. In conclusion, these experiences in the greenhouse highlight the protagonist's deep - seated emotions related to her homeland and her grandmother.
1018	9883	4	2	The author includes this paragraph in the story because the girl had started to lose faith in herself. Her move to the United States, her failure in the driver's test, and the disappointment of buying a fake plant had made her feel sad. However, the author also wanted to show that her self - esteem had improved, and she had become more confident and was no longer going to give up on herself. In conclusion, this paragraph serves to depict the girl's emotional journey from despair to hope and determination.
1019	9884	4	2	The author ends the story with those words as it presents a significant metaphor. Although not fully developed, it is clear that the “metaphor” compares Saeng and her test to the perennial nature of the winter hibiscus. Both share a common trait: they both return. Saeng returns to complete her test, while the winter hibiscus comes back, buds, and thrives again. I can relate to this as I once participated in a triathlon with the goal of placing first. I placed @NUM1 overall that year. The next year, I trained hard until the triathlon came around again, and I placed @NUM2. Just like the winter hibiscus, I came back and achieved my goal. In conclusion, the metaphor in the story effectively conveys the message of resilience and the ability to overcome challenges.
1020	9885	4	2	The author includes that part in the story because it focuses on nature and the beautiful aspects of the natural world. There are @CAPS1 @CAPS2, tall green grass, and a white @CAPS3 fence, and similar natural elements are present in the story. In conclusion, by including this part, the author brings the beauty and tranquility of nature into the narrative, enhancing the overall atmosphere of the story.
1021	9886	4	2	The author perceives the hibiscus plant as a symbol of a new beginning. For instance, when the author states, “In the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Evidently, the author failed the test the first time, and having acquired the hibiscus plant, anticipates passing it the next time.
1022	9887	4	2	The author includes these paragraphs in the story because it is spring, a time when the snows melt and the geese return. It can be inferred that the author is referring to winter, a season characterized by continuous snowfall until spring arrives. With the emergence of the sun, the snow begins to melt away. One reason for including these details is to depict how the weather changes with the transition of seasons.
1023	9888	4	2	She was disappointed in herself for buying the hibiscus instead of the plant seeds. This realization made her recall the beauty of their former plant, causing her to break down in tears. She has decided that when the snow melts and the flowers start to bloom, she will retake the test. By ending the paragraph in this way, the author intends to symbolize a fresh start in the coming year.
1024	9889	4	2	I'm convinced that she included this part in the story to emphasize its significance to her. For example, when she mentions taking the test again in the spring, it implies that she will put in more effort to ensure everything is done correctly. This shows her determination to follow through on matters that hold importance to her. These are my thoughts on the reason behind her inclusion of this paragraph in the story.
1025	9890	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several reasons. Firstly, Saeng failed the test. Secondly, it takes time for a hibiscus to bud. Moreover, taking the test in the snow doesn't seem practical, so the idea of waiting until spring when the hibiscus buds makes for a more fitting end to the story.
1026	9891	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey to readers Saeng's feelings about the hibiscus. It is believed that the author does so to inform the readers that the hibiscus brings good luck to Saeng, and with this good luck, she will pass the test. In the story, it is evident how much Saeng adores the plant. For instance, when she approached the hibiscus, she gently reached out and touched a petal. It felt smooth and cool. Therefore, the author uses that paragraph at the end to indicate Saeng's sentiment towards the hibiscus and how it makes her feel confident.
1027	9892	4	2	The author concludes the story with the given paragraph to create an air of suspense, leaving readers speculating about what will unfold next. This can be discerned from the tone of the last paragraph: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author effectively leaves a tone of uncertainty, which piques the readers' curiosity.
1028	9893	4	2	In the short - story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author's way of ending the story offers readers a sympathetic understanding of Saeng's struggles to live in a foreign country and her longing to return home. I believe the author aimed to end the story on a strong note that reflects Saeng's personality, pulling the reader back into the narrative. For example, by repeating the statement “I will take that test again,” the author shows that Saeng has not given up. It makes the reader aware that she will persevere and live a strong life.
1029	9894	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because now Saeng has a goal to work towards. Another reason could be that she has to wait a long time before she can take the test again. Additionally, Saeng is eager to watch the plant grow, become bigger, and stronger. These are the reasons I think the author chose to end the story with this paragraph.
1030	9895	4	2	The author concludes the story at this point to demonstrate that Saeng is not a quitter. Instead, she has set a specific time to attempt again. Saeng desires to succeed in this world and have a good life, which is why she is willing to try new things. This ending showcases her determination and resilience.
1031	9896	4	2	The story “Winter Hibiscus” is about a foreign girl who has a fondness for tropical flowers and is attempting to adapt to @LOCATION1. The author's choice of the last - paragraph ending is appropriate as it effectively concludes the story. In the ending, when the man leaves and the flowers start to grow, it implies that the girl will strive to integrate in the coming spring.
1032	9897	4	2	In my opinion, the author used this paragraph for the ending because it truly reflects Saeng's deep love for the garden, which is something special to her. Additionally, when all the snow melts, she will take the test and hopefully obtain her driver's license. This ending ties together her connection with the garden and her future goals.
1033	9898	4	2	I firmly believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The hibiscus in the story represents fresh starts. When the character says, “When the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” it clearly shows that this will be a new chapter for her. The blooming of the plant brings her joy and reminds her of her grandmother. By the time spring arrives, she will be ready to face new challenges, just like the hibiscus plant starting anew.
1034	9899	4	2	I think the author chooses to end the story with this paragraph as it symbolizes closure. The plant represents her home. However, upon seeing the geese flying south, she realizes that everyone has to leave home at some point. She has now accepted the situation and will soon attempt to get her driver's license again. When the hibiscus buds once more, it will hold great symbolic meaning for her, and that is when she will be ready to make another try.
1035	9900	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show that the character is making an effort and desires another chance. She has recognized her mistakes and is ready to start afresh. Even though she failed in trying to grow the hibiscus in winter, she is looking forward to a new beginning when @DATE1 arrives. As stated in the story, “the winter hibiscus” was in the ground, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks familiar to Saeng in the snow. This is why the author chose this ending for the story.
1036	9901	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as she believes it will bring her good luck in the test. When she retakes the test, the comfort of her homeland represented by the hibiscus plant will encourage her to pass the driving test. Due to the sense of home, she will surely pass the test upon retaking it and will be accustomed to the area being different from her homeland. To perform well in the test, she needs something to boost her confidence slightly. Reminders of home and her current residence can significantly enhance her self - confidence.
1037	9902	4	2	She stated that she would retake the test to prove to her mother that she can succeed this time, rather than worrying about her old home. By focusing on the test, she aims to overcome her concerns and achieve a positive outcome.
1038	9903	4	2	I firmly believe that this shows hope. She had deeply missed her homeland and found a sense of peace and tranquility when surrounded by the flowers. When she said, “That at least she could hold on to,” referring to the bud, it was evident that she was extremely upset due to homesickness. She yearned for her grandmother washing her hair and inserting a dok mallk into it. Since she had little else to remind her of her homeland apart from the flowers, as the text mentioned, “where was the fine - toothed comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well, her gentle grandmother,” she was missing all these things. Placing her in this situation made her miss not only the people but also the beautiful aspects of her homeland. The flower ensures that she always carries a part of home with her.
1039	9904	4	2	In the last paragraph, the author uses the statement “when they come back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test.” After moving from her homeland, Vietnam, to the United States, Saeng felt homesick. However, she found comfort when she came across a flower that reminded her of her time in her homeland. The plant made her recall her grandmother's smell. When she returned home to her mother, she showed the flower to her, and they planted it together. This gave Saeng a sense of relief. That's why she vowed to take the test when winter ended and spring arrived, as the feeling of home within her provided her with encouragement and strength. It also demonstrates that even in a new area, there is always something that can make one remember the time spent in their place of origin.
1040	9905	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way to illustrate her determination to pass the test. Just as birds can fly south, she believes she can pass the test. This conclusion emphasizes her resolve and implies that she has the ability to overcome the challenge presented by the test.
1041	9906	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This is done for multiple reasons. Firstly, it shows that Saeng retains hope and believes she can correct her situation. Secondly, it indicates that Saeng will continue to attempt to adapt to her surroundings and make friends. Additionally, Saeng is determined to pass the test the next time she takes it. Finally, it emphasizes the conflict and how Saeng overcame it.
1042	9907	4	2	In my view, the author ended the story with this paragraph because life goes on. The statement “When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” demonstrates that the character is moving forward with life, just as all creatures in the world do. Moreover, even though she has moved to a new country, it doesn't mean she can't still enjoy things from her homeland, as shown by “but she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to the Big Mac.” This is why the author included that last paragraph, to convey that life persists.
1043	9908	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the character is not overly concerned about when the test will be retaken; instead, she is focused on the plants she has selected. Additionally, she is aware that it will be a long time before she takes the test again, which gives her more time to study, prepare, and concentrate. The author also ends the article with this paragraph to inform readers that since the character failed the first time, she will return to retake the test, and nothing will prevent her from trying again.
1044	9909	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph for several reasons. Firstly, it conveys the message of not giving up. Even though the character failed the test initially, she intends to try again later to pass it. Secondly, the story ends in a similar way to how it began, with the character taking or preparing for the test, which is a well - crafted writing technique. Lastly, it shows that people should not become overly attached to the past. The character takes the test to see if she can face familiar flowers without being overwhelmed, as looking at reminders of the past might cause her to break down.
1045	9910	4	2	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to end on a happy and motivating note. In the story, Saeng reveals that she failed the test and was extremely disappointed in herself, suggesting that the test was of great importance to her. The author likely ended with this paragraph to show Saeng's dedication to passing the test. Saeng appears to be a sentimental yet reliable person. I believe the test involves spending a minimal amount of money, and she hopes to earn her mother's respect. This is why taking and passing the test is so significant to Saeng, which is why the author ended the story with that paragraph.
1046	9911	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with the statement, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author uses these lines to re - establish the symbolism of the plant. The text indicates that the plant buds in spring after having time to grow and adapt to the new environment. Just as the plant requires this time, the main character Saeng also needs it. Saeng has recently moved from Vietnam and failed her driver's test. She is quite uncertain about her new culture; for instance, it is mentioned that she likes bitter melon and admits, ""But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself much preferred it to a Big Mac."" She feels misunderstood and believes no one likes her. However, just as the plant will adapt to its new life, so will she."
1047	9912	4	2	"The author concludes the story by having the character vow silently to take the test again in spring. Spring reminds Saeng of her home in Vietnam, where there were many beautiful wild flowers. After failing her driving test, Saeng goes to a flower shop to find a piece of home. The description of the flower's ""leaves quivering in the wind"" shows that the plant is not in its normal state as there are no buds. Saeng needs hope at this time, and waiting until spring when the hibiscus will bloom again will give her a sense of home. This sense of home will, in turn, give her the hope to perform well on the driving test."
1048	9913	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng's entire world revolves around plants. Since the plants are gone, she has no motivation. This lack of motivation is a significant factor in how the story ends, as it reflects Saeng's current state of mind and her connection to the plants.
1049	9914	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with the line, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author's reasoning for this conclusion is that the memories of Saeng's homeland comfort her. These comforting memories are so powerful that they will enable her to pass the test with ease as she will not be nervous. When Saeng entered the florist shop after failing her driver's test, she said, ""it was like walking into another world."" It was as if she completely forgot about her failure and only focused on the plants and flowers. The flowers transport her to a happy and peaceful place, making her feel at home and assuring her that everything will be alright. This is why the author concludes with such a sentence, as it shows that memories of her farmland will assist her in passing the driver's test."
1050	9915	4	2	The author may have concluded the story in that way because of the title and the beginning of the story. Alternatively, the author might have made that conclusion out of personal preference. By concluding the story in this manner, the author shows what has happened. Overall, it can be considered a good conclusion as it ties in with the events and elements of the story.
1051	9916	4	2	I am truly at a loss as to why the author chose to conclude the story with this particular paragraph. It is possible that she began to discuss... Eventually, though the reason remains somewhat obscure, it shows there might be an aspect of the story the author wanted to emphasize through this ending.
1052	9917	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination. Saeng has endured numerous hardships and yearns for home. Despite feeling out of place and different, she remains resilient. Life progresses, and this paragraph demonstrates that Saeng will move forward with it. The paragraph states, ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Spring will surely arrive as time is inexorable. The snow will melt due to changing weather, the geese will return home, and the hibiscus will bloom in spring. Saeng adopts a positive outlook and decides to embrace the changes. Although she failed once, she is strong - willed and eager to try again. As the saying goes, if at first you don't succeed, try again. Saeng will always cherish her memories of home, yet she is willing to adapt to her new surroundings. The concluding paragraph effectively showcases Saeng's determination to succeed and thrive in the new world."
1053	9918	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way to convey that Saeng is self - confident and will not hesitate to retake the test. After this, she walked over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. This action further shows her resolve, as if she is preparing for a new start, and the author's ending helps the readers understand Saeng's unwavering spirit.
1054	9919	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to evoke a sense of hope and growth. The flower symbolizes Saeng's homeland, offering her comfort. It connects her to her emotions and reminds her of her roots. The growth and blooming of the hibiscus mirror Saeng's own development. When the hibiscus blossoms, she will have a tangible piece of home with her and will be ready to take the test again. The story revolves around overcoming obstacles and adapting to change. The vivid and almost lyrical description of the blooming hibiscus makes the rewards of one's struggles appear all the more beautiful, effectively concluding the story on an inspiring note.
1055	9920	4	2	"The author concludes the story with a sense of hope in this sentence. The beginning of the story was quite negative, with Saeng failing her driver's test and her mother scolding her. However, when this sentence appears, it fills the reader with hope for the young girl Saeng. The author does this to show that Saeng will adapt and persevere. Earlier, she was extremely upset, as evidenced by her statement, ""I - I failed the test."" For Saeng to recover from this setback gives the reader hope, and that is precisely why the author crafted the ending in this manner, leaving the story on an optimistic and inspiring note."
1056	9921	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it conveys the concept of a new beginning. Since Saeng failed the test, similar to a plant that dies in winter but buds again in spring, she will retake the test. It represents a fresh opportunity to start anew.
1057	9922	4	2	Saeng, a girl who didn't like to talk much and sometimes preferred to be alone, silently vowed to herself. When spring arrived, it was a different situation. Saeng adored spring and @DATE2. She would spend every day playing outside. Overall, Saeng was a kind - hearted girl.
1058	9923	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate that the character will retry what she failed. In the story, the character has a passion for gardening. When her favorite plant reappears, she will attempt to pass her test once more.
1059	9924	4	2	The author concludes the story with that part because as winter approaches, everything fades away. Trees shed their leaves, geese fly south, and flowers wither. The passage implies that in spring, when everything revives, she will retake the test. It is akin to starting a new life.
1060	9925	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concludes with the paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, than I will take that test again."" The author placed this at the end because when things seem to decline, people often wait for a revival. Just as failure makes everything seem to fall, waiting can lead to a new rise, like the blooming of flowers. The author's intention was to convey that it is acceptable to fail as long as one gets up and perseveres until the goal is reached. Minfong Ho included this ending so that readers could learn from its message."
1061	9926	4	2	The author concludes the story with the last paragraph to establish the final mood. The intention was to convey that Saeng will persevere and continue to acclimate to her new environment. This ending imparts a sense of warmth and serves as an inspiration. It encourages readers not to give up and sets an example of how they can vow to improve. The author likely knew that the last paragraph would inspire and potentially assist readers going through similar experiences.
1062	9927	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as the plant reminds her of her homeland, which soothes her. When the plant is budding, she feels stronger. In the story, Saeng is somewhat of an outsider, and seeing the plant brings back a part of her past from home. The story mentions that she gets shaky when trying to say “at home.” When she says “and this hibiscus is budding,” it can be interpreted as her readiness to accept this country as her home, as the flower is a reminder of her homeland. At the end of the story, it indicates that she is getting used to the geese flying in a “V,” suggesting she is becoming more accustomed to this country. When she is ready, she will take her test again.
1063	9928	4	2	The author includes the paragraph “when they come back...then I will take that test again” to demonstrate that the hibiscus symbolizes time. Saeng uses the hibiscus to gauge the time until she retakes her test. The hibiscus also represents the strength to overcome struggles. Saeng encountered difficulties in her test, but the hibiscus serves as motivation to prepare her for the next attempt. It also helps Saeng's mother through the tough time of seeing her daughter sad due to test failure. The plant encourages the mother to stay positive and guides her to do what is best for her daughter. In the story, the mother decides to plant the hibiscus in the garden to cheer her daughter up. The hibiscus holds significant symbolism and supports Saeng and her mother in staying strong during their challenges.
1064	9929	4	2	This final paragraph aligns with one of the main themes of the story: not to quit and to persevere to find understanding and happiness in the world. Saeng is taking a “test” to determine if she is ready to change and adapt to her new environment. She failed this time, but when the circumstances are right and the hibiscus is in the appropriate state, she will try again to see if she can let go of the past and embrace the new with happiness.
1065	9930	4	2	She said she failed because she didn't do what she was supposed to. Her mother was initially angry but then calmed down. She said she loved it and asked if she wanted something to eat, so they went inside. Since she regarded the task as a test, she resolved to do it right the next time.
1066	9931	4	2	I believe the author concluded the story with the “test” as it constitutes a significant aspect of Saeng's life or is part of her tradition. This conclusion underscores the importance of this element in Saeng's journey and overall narrative.
1067	9932	4	2	There are multiple reasons the author ends the story with that paragraph. Firstly, the ending evokes a great deal of emotion, preventing readers from perceiving the story as uninteresting. Secondly, it showcases strength, specifically mental strength. Saeng declares that despite failing the test initially, she will retake it. Another reason the author may have used this paragraph to conclude is to convey the message of perseverance. It depicts how she failed and her mother was disappointed, yet she refuses to quit and will take the driver's test again. In summary, the author concludes with this paragraph as it projects a powerful image of continuous effort and never giving up.
1068	9933	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story with this sentence because it demonstrates the dedication of the author and her child to gardening. I suspect that the young child's favorite plant is the hibiscus, and I think the mother and child's favorite shared activity is gardening. This is an excellent way to end a story as it leaves readers with a sense of curiosity, making them wonder why the author chose this ending. In my opinion, it adds an element of intrigue to the story.
1069	9934	4	2	The final lines of the story “Winter Hibiscus” aim to offer a glimpse into the near - future and illustrate a shift in Saeng's attitude. Prior to this, Saeng had been mourning her old country and struggling to adjust to the new one. The hibiscus serves as an inspiration, showing her that the new country has similarities to her homeland. In the last line, she reconciles with her current situation. The phrase “When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” implies that she will allow some time to pass and, by retaking her driver's test, will embark on her new life.
1070	9935	4	2	The author ended the story by stating that Saeng will retake the driving test in spring to make a point. After her test, while walking home, Saeng spotted a familiar flower and decided to visit a flower shop. There, numerous flowers reminded her of home, so she bought a hibiscus and went home. She and her mother planted it after Saeng realized the flower could survive the winter. Looking up, she saw many birds flying overhead and understood that she had adapted to life in @LOCATION1. The hibiscus has instilled in her the will to persevere, and she is confident she can adapt to life in @LOCATION1. The author's point was that the hibiscus gave Saeng the courage and hope to retake her driver's test and continue thriving in @LOCATION1.
1071	9936	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with the last paragraph because having a passion for plants is Saeng's driving force. She loves plants deeply and will continue this activity annually. The final paragraph vividly demonstrates her dedication. Moreover, she highly values spring and the hibiscus, which play significant roles in her life.
1072	9937	4	2	The author concludes the story with this line to illustrate that, much like the hibiscus adapting and struggling to survive in a non - native land, Saeng will persevere. She won't abandon her fight to pass the test and become part of her new country. Throughout the story, this is supported when her mother comments on the hibiscus by the lake, saying, “It’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters” (Ho @NUM1). Here, the author draws a parallel between the hibiscus' struggle in a foreign land and Saeng's life. Both must be strong and fight through difficult times when no one, “not even her classmates or friends, or Mrs. Lambert” (Ho @NUM1), understood how alone and out of place she felt. Just as she vows to take the test again, she promises herself to fight through hardships and grow strong, like her winter hibiscus.
1073	9938	4	2	The main reason she said that is that she believes time brings change. She essentially implies that as time passes and circumstances shift, her performance could also improve. We can tell that she is gradually getting over her longing for her home in Vietnam, and with the passage of time, memories change. It's a basic principle of logic that time ushers in change. I think I've correctly interpreted the overall meaning of what she said. In conclusion, Saeng said this because she understands that time brings about change.
1074	9939	4	2	The author ends the story in this way to emphasize the significance of the plant to the readers. Since the author is away from her native country, there aren't many things in this new place that can offer her comfort. Discovering a hibiscus in a place where she least expected it gives her the strength to face any challenge. Regardless of what the challenge in @MONTH1 might be, the support she gets from the plant gives her the confidence and a sense of achievement to complete her tasks.
1075	9940	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner because there are strong similarities between the hibiscus and Saeng. Additionally, the narrator compares her to the returning geese. The return of the geese symbolizes her restarting at driver's school and trying again. The hibiscus represents her resilience during the winter, and come spring, she gathers her strength and takes the test once more. This is the reason why the narrator chose to end the story in this way.
1076	9941	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way to set up a spin - off. In my opinion, it implies that when spring arrives, she will attempt again, enabling both her and her plant to have a new beginning. I believe this is an excellent way to end the story.
1077	9942	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” for multiple reasons. Firstly, just as the hibiscus flower adapts to spring, Saeng should adapt to her new environment in the United States. Secondly, similar to the hibiscus budding, Saeng has grown older and wiser, which allows her to retake the driving test in spring with hopes of passing. Finally, the text states “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This indicates that Saeng is becoming familiar and comfortable in her living place, much like the hibiscus flower easily adapting to its location and getting used to the seasons.
1078	9943	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng says that when she returns, she will retake the test. This implies that her time there was a test of sorts. The start of the story marks the beginning of this test, and at the end, the test is over as they are leaving. She wishes to return to see what has grown. Additionally, the author is suggesting that one often doesn't realize how good their situation is.
1079	9944	4	2	The “Winter hibiscus” was in the ground, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, and their faint honks were now clear and - yes - audible to Saeng.
1080	9945	4	2	The author includes this paragraph in the story as it demonstrates that forming an impression of work ethic and adapting to a new environment can be challenging. The statement “not even @PERSON1, looked it” makes it evident that when a new student doesn't receive positive feedback, it can lead to a poor work ethic and mental issues. As a result, the girl is neither comfortable nor enthusiastic about working on something that no one will appreciate.
1081	9946	4	2	The author concludes with this statement as she is resolute in passing the driving test she previously failed. For instance, she writes “she vowed silently to herself.” Vowing to do something typically indicates strong determination. Every subsequent statement she makes is sincere. Thus, the author concludes with this sentence to demonstrate her commitment to her goal.
1082	9947	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author ended the narrative with that paragraph to convey that Saeng is finally beginning to adapt to her new home. She will no longer spend excessive time yearning for her past. The line “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept” shows that this emotional release was what she needed to move forward with her life.
1083	9948	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to inform the readers when Saeng will retake the test, which is when the season changes. Saeng might be embarrassed, explaining her long - awaited retake. After failing the test, Saeng took a long walk home and stopped at a flower shop to distract herself. She bought a nice flower or plant for @MONEY1. Initially, her mother was upset but then realized her daughter was unhappy and changed her mood.
1084	9949	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story in this way because he is indicating that she will persevere and not give up. This is because she has recently moved from Vietnam to America and is struggling to adjust. I think the geese symbolize entities that constantly change their surroundings. When the geese arrive, she will attempt to obtain her license again.
1085	9950	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because now Saeng has a goal to strive for. Additionally, the author might have ended it this way because Saeng has to wait until she can retake the test. Moreover, Saeng may want to wait and watch the plant grow, become bigger, and stronger. These are the reasons I believe the author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph.
1086	9951	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way due to the significance of the hibiscus to Saeng. For her, the hibiscus symbolizes strength and comfort. She believes that if the hibiscus can endure the snow and cold of winter, she too will not fail. The hibiscus represents herself; if it survives, she knows she can as well. Saeng plans to retake the test when the hibiscus is budding as it reminds her of her homeland and brings her comfort. Even if she fails, she will be content because her favorite plant is in bloom. I think the author ends the story this way because both the plant and Saeng face obstacles. The plant must survive winter and reappear in spring, while Saeng must pass her driver's test. Ultimately, the author's ending choice is based on what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives, she knows she will too, and life will go on.
1087	9952	4	2	I'm of the opinion that the author ended the story with the line “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the gesse return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” as it encapsulates the story's entire theme. The theme of this narrative is about adapting to life's changes. The conclusion shows this when Saeng says she'll take the test again. The hibiscus helped her cope with life's transitions. For instance, “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long grey hair.” The hibiscus, a reminder of home, brought back pleasant memories. It inspired her to embrace her new life and keep striving to improve it.
1088	9953	4	2	The author probably concludes the story in this fashion because it's the time when Saeng feels most at ease. Saeng and her mother moved from Vietnam, where winter hibiscus are well - known and familiar to Saeng. The author ends the text this way as it reminds Saeng of Vietnam and makes her feel better during that time of the year. When she says “And beside it was yet another old friend,” she perceives the plant as a friend, which enhances her comfort. This is the reason the author ended the story in this particular manner.
1089	9954	4	2	The author concludes the story with this statement because it represents a fresh start, and spring is a beautiful season. The phrase “@CAPS1 plant it right now” indicates that she desires another attempt. She yearns for a new beginning, and when spring arrives and all the lovely flowers are blooming and getting their chance, she wants her opportunity to succeed at her best.
1090	9955	4	2	It seems the original text in the first item is quite jumbled and hard to fully understand its exact meaning. However, here's an attempt at a rewrite: In spring, Saeng would silently vow to take the test again. The story has a good ending because it's associated with the spring, a beautiful time for plants. The hibiscus, which can endure the harshness of winter, symbolizes strength. Just as the plant can survive and thrive in spring, Saeng believes she can overcome her challenges. The ruler - like strength of the hibiscus gives her hope. This is why it's a good ending, and Saeng is determined to persevere.
1091	9956	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph due to her remorse for her actions. The test she described involved using the twenty dollars they had to buy something. Unfortunately, she spent most of the money on a plant that reminded her of home. The last paragraph indicates that if given the chance to redo the “test,” she will act as she should.
1092	9957	4	2	After reading “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I'm convinced that Ho ended the story with that paragraph to reinforce her theme of overcoming obstacles. Initially, after failing her driving test, Saeng was extremely disheartened and uncertain if she'd ever pass. However, seeing a hibiscus plant reminded her of her home in Vietnam, which served as an inspiration. Secondly, when she purchased the plant, her mother was somewhat annoyed because of its high cost. But upon seeing how much joy the plant brought to Saeng, her mother forgave her. Finally, as Saeng was digging a hole for the hibiscus to grow, it motivated her to retake the test as she had overcome the challenges of bringing the plant home and making it thrive. Thus, I believe Ho ended “Winter Hibiscus” to align with her concept of overcoming obstacles.
1093	9958	4	2	The final paragraph of the story conveys the theme of determination. The hibiscus serves as a reminder that her “home” was her former life, yet she misses certain aspects in her new life. Through this reminder, she gains determination. She eventually realizes that she has found a new sense of home as things around her have become familiar, like the V - formation of the geese. Although she loved her old home, she understands that it's time to move forward. The last paragraph doesn't merely signify retaking a driving test; it symbolizes the resolve to embrace her new home and life.
1094	9959	4	2	She will take that test again. The hibiscus and the snow have given her confidence. When the snow melts and the hibiscus starts to bud, she will try again. She is growing along with the hibiscus, and overall, she will have enough confidence to take the test.
1095	9960	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to inform readers about what transpired in the story and to convey its possible meaning in relation to the narrative. The sentence implies that when spring arrives and the snow melts, the plants will emerge and start budding. By the next class or school year, the character will gather the courage to take the test again. This is the meaning of the sentence in the story and how it can be related to different elements in various ways.
1096	9961	4	2	"In ""@CAPS1 Ho""'s ""Winter Hibiscus"", the final paragraph reads, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently, to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This paragraph draws a comparison between Saeng and the hibiscus. It demonstrates Saeng's resilience, similar to the flower's strength. She is determined to retake the test next year and achieve success. Moreover, taking the test offers her comfort and evokes memories of home."
1097	9962	4	2	"He ended the paragraph in such a way either to entice the reader to continue reading or to illustrate the comparison between the flower and Saeng. The quote ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" shows that the flower can endure the winter and make a comeback. Saeng failed the test once and is now resolved to retake it. This indicates that both the flower and Saeng possess the motivation and integrity to bounce back."
1098	9963	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because it shows that the hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for Saeng. After failing her driving test, seeing the hibiscus provided her with comfort in a moment of disappointment, a connection to her past experiences, and the confidence to overcome obstacles. When the narrator says “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it implies a fresh start, suggesting that the hibiscus represents Saeng. Thus, this is why I think the author chose to end the story with this paragraph.
1099	9964	4	2	The last line in “Winter Hibiscus” is included to establish a connection between Saeng and the hibiscus flower. Despite failing the driving test on her first attempt, Saeng decides to retake it in the spring. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is out of place and must survive the winter to bloom again in the spring. This parallels Saeng's determination to retake the driving test and succeed. Additionally, both Saeng and the flower are unaccustomed to the conditions in @LOCATION1 and must endure the winter months. This further emphasizes the connection between the girl and the flower. In conclusion, the last line serves to conclude the story by highlighting the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus.
1100	9965	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this statement because they are determined to adapt to the new country and its surroundings. Throughout the story, the author expresses homesickness. The author spots a plant native to their homeland and spends over @NUM1 on it. Their mother is incredulous. The author is reluctant to tell their mother the real reason for buying the plant, fearing that they will become emotional. The last sentence indicates that the author is making an effort to adjust to the new environment.
1101	9966	4	2	"The author concludes the story with the given paragraph to present a conclusion that encapsulates the narrative. In the story, the author describes the hibiscus as a ""comfort in time of distress,"" a pastime or activity the protagonist enjoys in their leisure time. As stated in @ORGANIZATION1, these are the reasons the author chose to end the story with that paragraph."
1102	9967	4	2	"The author ends the story with the specified paragraph to convey a message. It emphasizes the significant and familiar elements in Saeng's life that provided her comfort, essentially suggesting that she will retake the test once she recovers. The winter hibiscus, a plant Saeng associated with her life back home throughout the story, evoked a profound sense of loss when she saw it, as described: ""a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" Initially, seeing the plant made it difficult for Saeng to soothe her emotions as she realized how much she missed her old life. The plant is mentioned in the final paragraph because, when it blooms in spring, the winter hibiscus will help fill the emotional gap and encourage Saeng to attempt the test again. Similarly, the geese are mentioned, though in a different manner. Unlike the winter hibiscus, it took time for the geese to become ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" Saeng mentions this to acclimate to the unfamiliar aspects of her life and come to terms with her failed test. By referring to these things in the last paragraph, Saeng uses both familiar and foreign objects to illustrate her acceptance of failure."
1103	9968	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it conveys the story's meaning. Life persists regardless of circumstances, as exemplified by the hibiscus, which will return in spring. The hibiscus serves as a symbol for Saeng's life. Typically, this plant does not survive the winter, yet this particular one did. Saeng's mother remarks, ""It's flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the winter months here..."" Saeng and her mother are akin to the plant; they are resilient and will continue their lives despite being in a new environment. The author chose to end the story with this paragraph because, beyond the literal return of the hibiscus each spring, it implies that Saeng and her mother, like the hibiscus, will persevere and continue living."
1104	9969	4	2	"The author opts to conclude the story in a profound and interconnected manner, ending on a theme of rebirth and second - chances. When Saeng vows, ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, when the Hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again,"" the author links the concepts of a new country, second chances, and rebirth. The melting of snow and the arrival of spring can be associated with rebirth, while the return of the geese symbolizes a second chance, which directly relates to Saeng's opportunity for a retake. Moreover, the author shows that Saeng is adapting to the new country, indicating a sense of hope. This suggests that there is optimism for her test."
1105	9970	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the moral of the tale. I hold this view because in the story, it mentions that orchids, lanno bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vires surrounded the protagonist. These flowers are described as surrounding her as a test of her @CAPS1. The author uses this imagery to ensure the readers grasp the underlying message of the story.
1106	9971	4	2	I believe the author reaches this conclusion in the story because it contains crucial information. The story involves her mother, who loves gardening. The character wishes to work in the garden, have a proper job in this field, just like her mother.
1107	9972	4	2	Saeng believes she has failed due to missing her grandmother. The hibiscus plant she purchases evokes the scent of her grandmother. Saeng spent over @MONEY1 on the plant to feel a bit more at home. She left her country in a flash, feeling she had little time. Her grandmother would want her to be strong and not cry when thinking about being away. Saeng should focus on the positive and smile when remembering the past. She wants to pass the test. Next time the hibiscus buds, she must refrain from crying.
1108	9973	4	2	I think the author includes details about the time the story takes place and the weather to give readers a sense of the setting. It also indicates how long the character will wait, such as until the snow melts and the geese leave and return. This is why I believe the author provides these descriptions.
1109	9974	4	2	In my opinion, this passage is about the winter hibiscus. The hibiscus plants are tall and lush, surrounding the garden. Their lush green leaves are dotted with vermilion flowers. When she reached the hibiscus, she gently reached out and touched a petal.
1110	9975	4	2	The author ended the story in this way to leave the reader with a final thought and to symbolize rebirth. When Saeng says, “... this hibiscus is budding ...” (Ho @NUM1), she implies that they will start anew in spring. This leaves the reader with a thought about Saeng's ability to overcome life in a new place. Additionally, it ties up @CAPS1's feelings and experiences since moving, as seen in the statement “... I will take the test again” (Ho @NUM1), showing she will keep trying in her new home. In conclusion, this quote as the last paragraph shows that Saeng will continue to overcome the challenges of her new environment.
1111	9976	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as she wishes to instill hope for the future. The budding of the hibiscus in spring is what Saeng anticipates. It offers her the hope that she can retake and pass the test. This is evident when she says, “... and if this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” During winter, Saeng hopes to improve, and when the hibiscus buds, she'll know it's time to try again. Saeng views spring as a new beginning, a time to overcome her obstacle. It's possible that the obstacle or test is to refrain from crying when she thinks about her former life in Vietnam. When she achieves this, she, like the hibiscus, is growing.
1112	9977	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for a single primary reason, which is to convey a particular message or bring the narrative to a fitting close. This conclusion serves to wrap up the story in a way that leaves an impression on the reader, perhaps tying up loose ends or highlighting a key theme.
1113	9978	4	2	The author is demonstrating that Saeng has a strong desire to continue her mother's gardening. She aims to inherit the traditions of the elder generation and carry on what her mother initiated. By doing so, Saeng not only honors her mother but also keeps a part of her heritage alive. This act of taking over the gardening is a way for Saeng to connect with her roots and continue the family's legacy.
1114	9979	4	2	I firmly believe that the author ended the story with this paragraph to highlight the main character's remarkable persistence. This belief is grounded in the story's beginning, where the character reveals that she failed the driver's test while walking home. In the final paragraph, she declares that after winter ends, she will retake the test when her hibiscus blooms. Her unwavering persistence enables her to persevere through life, much like a plant striving to survive the harsh winter. This tenacity is a valuable trait that allows her to face challenges head - on and keep moving forward.
1115	9980	4	2	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the character wants to do better next time. The paragraph implies that she can attempt the task every year to get it right and impress her mother. This shows her determination and eagerness to meet her mother's expectations. In conclusion, this is the significance I find in the paragraph, as it showcases the character's motivation and the importance of family approval in her life.
1116	9981	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author most likely ends the narrative with the given quote to illustrate that Saeng perceives the hibiscus as more than mere flowers; it is also a repository of memories. For Saeng, the winter hibiscus is like a storybook. Simply by smelling the flower, it unlocks wonderful recollections of the precious time she spent with her “gentle grandmother” in her first home. The author uses the flower to demonstrate to the reader how a simple object can trigger memories, thoughts, and so on. The last sentence, with evidence from the story, clearly shows that Saeng deeply cares about her past. To fit into her current life, she must not forget who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden, she has a beautiful reminder of her roots. Therefore, this reasoning is the likely assumption for why the author ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with the selected paragraph.
1117	9982	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several reasons. For instance, when the character says “this hibiscus is budding,” it conveys a sense of hope, indicating a new beginning or a fresh start. I believe this is the idea the author aims to convey. Evidently, it was challenging for the author to adjust to her new country. For example, she was disappointed that the hibiscus was not the same as the one in her homeland. Despite feeling nostalgic, this paragraph assures the reader that the author is willing to give her new country another chance, showing her resilience and openness to new experiences.
1118	9983	4	2	The author concludes the story with the specific paragraph for multiple reasons. The last paragraph states, “when they come back ... I will take the test again” (Ho @NUM1). The main character, already distraught about failing her driving test, is also longing for her homeland. The buds of the flowers offer her hope and, essentially, the strength to retake the test. Earlier, when she was in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept” (Ho @NUM2). Clearly, these flowers hold great significance for the main character. They transport her back to her home - country, which she was suddenly separated from and misses dearly. They give her hope and remind her of the things she loves, such as her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because it represents what matters most to the main character.
1119	9984	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that the main character loves the flowers deeply. They mean a great deal to her. When she failed her driving test, she was sad, but the flowers made her feel better. Now that it's snowing, she waits for spring. When the flowers bloom again, she will have the faith to take the driving test once more. The flowers serve as a source of comfort and motivation for her, helping her overcome the disappointment of the failed test and look forward to a better outcome in the future.
1120	9985	4	2	The author concluded the sentence to inform the readers that Saeng would return to the hibiscus and continue to care for it. It shows that she has not forgotten about the hibiscus, which holds a special place in her heart. This ending emphasizes the significance of the hibiscus in Saeng's life and her emotional connection to it. It also implies that the hibiscus will continue to be a part of her life, symbolizing her roots and memories.
1121	9986	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"", a teenager named Saeng relocates from Vietnam to the United States. Subsequently, she takes a driver's test but fails. However, she finds solace in the memories of her homeland. The last paragraph quotes Saeng's silent vow: ""When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. Saeng was deeply upset about failing the test and was reminded of her homeland and the adaptations she had to make during the move. The hibiscus plant offers Saeng hope to persevere through difficult times. Just as winter is a period of hardship and sorrow for the plant, failing the test and being away from her true home are Saeng's moments of distress. The end of winter presents both the plant and Saeng with an opportunity for a fresh start and renewed hope. If Saeng continues to draw comfort from her past, she will find it easier to overcome hardships."
1122	9987	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to pique the readers' curiosity and to demonstrate that the protagonist is not going to abandon her aspirations. This ending implies a sense of determination and resilience, leaving the readers with a feeling that the character will persist in her pursuit.
1123	9988	4	2	In my opinion, Minfong Ho ends the story by discussing the test that Saeng failed and her vow to retake it. In the story, the test symbolizes a step towards moving on and starting a new life, leaving the old behind. However, Saeng was unable to achieve this initially. She spent all her money on a flower because it held precious memories of her homeland. As the story progresses, I believe Saeng realizes that she can embrace both her old and new lives. The author ends the story in this way because Saeng genuinely wants to try again. She desires to please her mother and herself, and she yearns to move forward and begin her new life.
1124	9989	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng realizes she needs more time. If she takes a break and focuses on what she needs to do, she will be able to pass the test. This shows that Saeng is self - aware and understands that patience and preparation are key to achieving her goal.
1125	9990	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner as it allows for the expansion of the narrative into a sequel about Saeng's success. By ending the story this way, the author showcases Saeng's unwavering determination; she will stop at nothing until she passes the test. Saeng is struggling to adapt to her new lifestyle as the familiar plants and landscapes from her homeland are no longer present. Her determination is evident when her mother discovers that she spent @NUM1 dollars on a similar plant. The mother's response, stating that their entire garden is worth less than @NUM1 dollars, further emphasizes Saeng's strong attachment to the symbols of her past and her resolve to make a new life for herself.
1126	9991	4	2	The sentence serves as the conclusion of the passage, demonstrating that when the hibiscus begins to bud and a new season commences, Saeng will transform into a new individual and be capable of taking the test. In this sentence, the cold snow, departing geese, and potted hibiscus can all symbolize Saeng and her current circumstances. They are either cold, on the verge of leaving, or restricted, mirroring Saeng's feelings. However, when a new season arrives, the geese return, and the hibiscus is no longer confined to a pot, Saeng will also mature and be ready to take the test. Placing this sentence at the end shows the extent to which Saeng can grow because she has the hibiscus, which is growing alongside her.
1127	9992	4	2	The author concludes the story with the given sentence. The author implies that when winter ends, it will be time to resume gardening and take the test related to the planted plant.
1128	9993	4	2	I believe the author concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again at another time for a specific reason. Saeng desires to retake the test when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. She feels prepared when that time arrives. Saeng is essentially telling herself that she needs more time to get ready for the test. Once she has sufficient time to prepare, she will attempt the test again. This, in my opinion, is the motivation behind the author's choice to use this paragraph as the conclusion.
1129	9994	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the budding hibiscus will inspire the protagonist to attempt the test again. To pass the test, she wishes to feel at home and draw on memories of her home to encourage her to try once more. Hence, this is the reason the author ends the story with the last paragraph.
1130	9995	4	2	The author concludes the story with a paragraph about taking the test again to illustrate that although the narrator may be distressed about being in a new place, she will persevere. The narrator becomes upset upon realizing that the hibiscus is not the same as those from her old home. This distress likely stems from her longing for the things she was accustomed to before. By using this paragraph, the author shows that the narrator is resilient and will not give up on recreating the way things were. Additionally, it shows her willingness to adapt to her new home. The author does this to convey the message that one should keep trying at something they love. The narrator will keep trying when the geese fly back and the hibiscus is budding. Thus, the author is advocating for perseverance in the face of failure and setting goals to never give up.
1131	9996	4	2	I believe there are multiple reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.
1132	9997	4	2	I reckon the author wraps up the story with this paragraph 'cause he's aware he messed up on the test. He's saying that when spring rolls around again, he'll be ready to take the test. I can tell it's spring 'cause he mentioned when the snow melts.
1133	9998	4	2	Upon moving to America, she witnessed the beautiful spring flowers. A particular blossom, the hibiscus, caught her eye. Intrigued, she went to the florist to check if they had it. Back in her homeland, these hibiscus grew wild, peeping out from the cracks in old walls. The blossom reminded her of her grandmother with her long, freshly - washed gray hair.
1134	9999	4	2	In the passage “Winter Hibiscus” by Monfong Ho, the quote “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again” symbolizes a new journey in the new country where she resides. In the test, Saeng experiences a personal conflict as she misses her homeland, as evidenced by her statement “I – failed the test.” This test holds more significance than just a simple failure; it is a measure of her ability to function in the new country, and unfortunately, she failed. Analyzing the “when they came back…” quote in depth, the snow can be seen as her obstacles, and the hibiscus represents herself. When the obstacles are removed, and she transforms into a stronger individual, she will attempt the test once more.
1135	10000	4	2	She is going to return to the place where her journey began. It's a cyclical process, and she will find herself back at the starting point the following year.
1136	10001	4	2	I am of the opinion that the author concludes the story with this paragraph: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This is because the budding flower would instill confidence in her regarding everything. The flower reminds her of past memories of her homeland, and it is as if she has a piece of home in her new abode. An example is “Not like the kind we had before,” which indicates that the new hibiscus is similar yet different from the one in her home country, thus evoking memories of home. This is the reason I believe the author ends the story in this manner.
1137	10002	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng will not give up but rather overcome the problem. It is an excellent way to end the story as the entire narrative revolves around overcoming difficulties. If Saeng were to give up, it would undermine the story. Just as she managed to move away from her homeland, she will eventually pass the test. The mother also overcame obstacles, such as leaving her homeland and having to plant new plants. She clearly misses the old ones, as evident from her knowledge of her gift. Like Saeng, she can handle these challenges, and Saeng will do the same when she takes the test again.
1138	10003	4	2	In the story, a transformation is imminent. Winter will give way to spring, the snow will melt and disappear, the geese will return, the hibiscus will bud, and Saeng will also undergo a change and mature. Saeng is comparable to the hibiscus plant; just as the plant is out of place on the road, Saeng is out of place in the new country and must adapt. The plant looks different in the United States compared to Vietnam as it has matured and grown. This is what Saeng must do in the new country. For instance, Saeng noticed the difference in the appearance of the plant in the shop window compared to her home country, which made her realize how different she appeared as well. Placing the paragraph at the end shows that she has already matured and grown. Putting it at the beginning would not have the same impact. The hibiscus plant endured the harsh winter, and Saeng can do the same. She made a silent vow to take the test again once she has matured, just like the things around her.
1139	10004	4	2	The author concludes the story with the given paragraph for multiple reasons. Firstly, the author aims to conclude the story without leaving the readers with any questions about what happens next. This is accomplished by including the geese, hibiscus, and the driver's test in the last paragraph. Secondly, the last paragraph adds a theme of perseverance to the story. The main character is motivated to retake the driver's test through memories of Vietnam. Lastly, it enriches the character as she is shown to be realistic and not overly inconsistent by stating that she will “take that test again.” These are some of the ways the last paragraph enhances the story.
1140	10005	4	2	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph shown for several reasons. First, the author needs to conclude the story without leaving any questions in the readers mind as to what happens. This is achieved by incorperating the geese, hibiscus and her drivers test into the last paragraph. Next, this last paragraph adds a theme of perseverance to the story. The main character is driven to take the drivers test again through memories of Vietnam lastly, it adds to the character by saying that she will ""take that test again"", she is shown as being realistic and not overconsistent. These are some of the ways that the last paragraph enhances the story."
1141	10006	4	2	The author concluded the story with this paragraph as it demonstrates that Saeng is beginning to adapt to her new home and will persevere. Her reaction upon seeing the hibiscus plant indicates that she still misses her homeland. However, her recognition of the geese and her intention to decide when to retake the driving test based on their migration patterns show that she is growing accustomed to her new environment.
1142	10007	4	2	The author ended the story with this paragraph because Saeng was not prepared for the test due to her unfamiliarity with the place. Nevertheless, after seeing the plants that reminded her of home and knowing that more will bloom in spring, she will be ready to retake the test.
1143	10008	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way to indicate that the season of the flowers has ended and should be postponed until spring. This provides a point for the author to conclude the current story and start a new one when the flowers return in spring. In conclusion, this is the reason the author ends the story with the chosen paragraph.
1144	10009	4	2	"The author concludes the story with the line ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This is to illustrate that Saeng is determined to retake the test and will not give up. The statement ""then I will take that test again"" clearly shows her resolve to try once more."
1145	10010	4	2	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it is related to Saeng's failure in her driving test. However, she is determined to retake it when she feels ready. The paragraph states, ""in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again,"" which reflects her determination."
1146	10011	4	2	In Minfong Ho's story “Winter Hibiscus”, I believe the elements included are there to keep the reader questioning. Given that her mother was deeply disappointed in her, I think she might strive to change and improve the situation. This shows that the story holds the potential for a positive transformation, making it engaging and thought - provoking.
1147	10012	4	2	The author concludes the story with the line “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This ending choice serves to illustrate the mood shift throughout the narrative. When Saeng arrives home, her mother “noticed the tear stain on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes,” indicating her initial sadness and sense of being out of place. However, by the end, Saeng felt happy and optimistic. This contrast in emotions effectively showcases the character's growth and the overall positive arc of the story.
1148	10013	4	2	I firmly believe the author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with this particular paragraph for several reasons. Firstly, it demonstrates the girl's unwavering determination. Initially, she was crying in the store and extremely depressed, yet she understands the need to persevere. This shows a strong sense of resolve. Secondly, it portrays her adaptation to the new environment. The author skillfully combines her memories of her home country with her current knowledge of the new one, enabling her to draw hope from both. For instance, the text states “many of the things she had thought of as strange before, had become… almost familiar to her now,” indicating her acceptance of the present situation. Finally, this ending adds a positive touch to the story. In conclusion, these are the reasons why I think the author chose this as the final paragraph.
1149	10014	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that the story or the characters within have an affinity for nature. It might be about the beauty of nature, the changes it undergoes, or perhaps the story showcases nature at its best. By ending in this way, the author emphasizes the significance of nature in the narrative, leaving the reader with a sense of the story's connection to the natural world.
1150	10015	4	2	The author wrote the last paragraph to offer hope to both Saeng and the reader. After seeing the hibiscus flower, Saeng is reminded of her homeland and is overcome with sadness, as the author describes: “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng eyes now swept over her.” Saeng purchases the flower and discusses it with her mother at home. The flower not only evokes memories of home but also provides her with inspiration. This is why she declares that she will pass the test when the hibiscus buds bloom. This ending gives a sense of hope and a promise of a better future for Saeng.
1151	10016	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it aligns well with the overall narrative and effectively summarizes it. In the story, the hibiscus holds great significance for Saeng. Throughout the story, she associates numerous memories with the hibiscus. It serves as a reminder of her home and past, thus playing a crucial role. When she plants it, it is winter, and the hibiscus has not yet bloomed. Stating that she will retake the test when it is budding is akin to saying she will do so when it is in a state of new growth again. Her actions mirror those of the flower, further highlighting its importance. This is why I believe the author ended the story with that paragraph.
1152	10017	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it indicates that she cannot work in the garden during winter. However, phrases like “when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding” are all signs of spring. In spring, she will retake the test, which implies that she will also work in the garden.
1153	10018	4	2	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story in this way to inform readers of what will occur in spring. As the text states, Saeng silently vowed to herself that in spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, she will retake the test. This implies that in spring, the hibiscus will enter a stage of growth.
1154	10019	4	2	She believes she will perform better in the spring. I'm not certain if it's because she will be in a better mood or because the environment will resemble her home more. Regardless, this is the reason she thinks she'll do better in the spring.
1155	10020	4	2	The author decided to conclude the story with that paragraph as it symbolizes Saeng's determination to try again. Nature exhibits repetitive patterns; seasons change but eventually return, and geese migrate only to come back. The author used this as a comparison to Saeng's decision to retake the license test. Similar to Saeng, the winter hibiscus was in an unfamiliar environment but was learning to adapt. This inspired Saeng to persevere even after failure, as the hibiscus was striving to survive the winter despite being out of its natural habitat.
1156	10021	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph because regardless of what she said or did, she had to get the flower. It reminds her of her former residence and what life was like there. As a result, she started to cry. The test was not to buy the flower and not to cry. Moreover, she plans to grow her own flower in the spring. This, in my opinion, is what the test is all about.
1157	10022	4	2	She checks if her plant will survive the winter, just like the ones from her home. She believes that things will remain the same. In the end, her hope lies in the plant's ability to endure, symbolizing her own resilience in adapting to a new environment.
1158	10023	4	2	It marks the beginning of a new life. She has a new school and a new plant. It seems as though she has a connection with the plant. As the plant grows, she becomes stronger and more confident. She stated that when they return and the hibiscus is budding, she will be ready for that test. This shows that her growth is intertwined with the plant's, and she is looking forward to facing the challenges ahead.
1159	10024	4	2	I think the author ends the story in this way because it demonstrates that she won't give up and will give her new country a chance. By ending with this, she conveys that she will be as strong as the flower and will stay regardless of the circumstances. She will be there, in that very spot, to witness the flower grow back. This ending reflects her determination to embrace the new life and find her place in the new country.
1160	10025	4	2	Throughout the story, we are provided with background information about a girl, Saeng, who desperately misses her true home. When we first meet young Saeng, she is in a florist's shop, merely looking at flowers. Soon, we learn that she is not just looking at them but seeing pieces of her home and past. She then buys a hibiscus, a flower native to Vietnam. After realizing that she has just failed a test, it becomes more evident that buying the flower is a way for her to cope with her new situation in @LOCATION1 and find comfort in her past. The author can conclude the story with that statement because it implies moving forward without being attached to the past. In the spring, Saeng will have a new home and draw strength from her past, which is what I believe the final paragraph implies.
1161	10026	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as Saeng is resolved to pass the test. She is aware that when spring arrives and the hibiscus starts budding, she will retake it. Presumably, she wishes to retake the test because the hibiscus reminds her of her homeland, instilling confidence in her. She believes she can pass it the next time. The hibiscus fills her with happiness and a sense of being overwhelmed, motivating her to retake the test. She is certain she will perform better next time.
1162	10027	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it demonstrates that if a flower can bloom in various places and endure natural changes, so can she. To me, the flower serves as a symbol for the author, encouraging her to persevere. Regardless of having to start anew, this time one will have learned from past errors. Just as a flower blooms in spring, withers in winter, and reappears the following spring, Saeng failed the test that year but can retake it next time.
1163	10028	4	2	"I reckon she's saying that once winter is over, she'll be ready for the winter test again. I assume this because they weren't prepared for winter when they were planting. As stated in the reading, ""As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel."" This is why I think they weren't ready for winter."
1164	10029	4	2	The author ended the story in this way to evoke sympathy and understanding from the audience for what Saeng and her family endured during this difficult period. It elicits sympathy for Saeng as all she can think of to comfort herself is her hometown and how she was uprooted from it.
1165	10030	4	2	He concludes the story because he wants another chance to take the test.
1166	10031	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to emphasize a new life and fresh opportunities for the main character. The spring setting in the paragraph symbolizes rebirth and a new start after the cold, harsh winter. The author further reinforces this symbolic meaning through additional events. Structured choices are employed to convey her thoughts. When expressing the theme of rebirth, the author uses phrases like ""the geese return"" and ""take the test again"", which enhance the significance of the home setting. Additionally, the physical action of ""the hibiscus is budding"" represents rebirth. In winter, the plant is dormant and less vibrant, but in spring, it showcases rebirth through the colorful buds. By ending with this paragraph, the author effectively conveys the theme of rebirth."
1167	10032	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's story ""Winter Hibiscus"", a girl has recently moved to a new country and is struggling to adapt to the new land and its people. In my opinion, the author included the quote at the end to convey the message of never giving up, that there is always a new beginning and one will succeed. I hold this view because Saeng thinks to herself, ""almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her."" This indicates that she has finally found comfort and confidence, similar to geese adapting to a new area and then returning. The winter hibiscus never gives up and continues to thrive in the new weather conditions each season. This shows that with time, one can overcome the challenges of a new environment."
1168	10033	4	2	At the end of her paragraph, she concludes by stating that she will look forward to the end of winter. She will be able to retake the test in the spring, which is the main point of what she was writing about. This conclusion implies that after the period of inactivity (winter), there is an opportunity for a new attempt and progress.
1169	10034	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it demonstrates the character's attempt to adapt to her new surroundings. The hibiscus serves as a reminder of her old life and provides her with comfort. When she takes her test in the spring, she will feel more at ease and comfortable while recalling her old life in this new place. In the story, it is mentioned that she failed her test and then bought a plant that reminded her of her past. The plant brought back memories of her old life, which comforted her. The spring season also reminds her of her old life as the garden flowers bloom, the geese return, and the snow melts. With the comfort of her past memories, Saeng believes she can adapt to her new surroundings. This shows that memories can be a source of strength during the process of adaptation.
1170	10035	4	2	"The author selected this paragraph as it serves as an appropriate conclusion. For instance, the word ""again"" implies that one has completed something but misses it and thus attempts it once more. In the paragraph, it discusses nature and the idea of testing it again. This use of the word ""again"" in the context of nature suggests a cycle of renewal and the opportunity to experience and understand it anew. The author effectively uses this concept to conclude the text, highlighting the cyclical nature of things and the chance for repeated exploration."
1171	10036	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it continues to demonstrate Saeng's strong determination to retake the test and achieve a passing grade this time. By ending the story with this paragraph, the author creates suspense, likely in anticipation of a sequel.
1172	10037	4	2	"In the short - story ""Winter Hibiscus"", a young Vietnamese girl moves to @LOCATION1 and fails her driver's test. After deciding to spend money on a winter hibiscus as a reminder of her homeland, the ending paragraph “When Troy comes back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” shows her deep connection to nature. She believes that just as the geese are ready to return home and the hibiscus is ready to bud, she too will be ready to retake the driver's test."
1173	10038	4	2	It seems to me that when she talks about the flowers and mentions the “test”, she is referring to how she observes and examines the flowers while watching the snow fall again. It gives the impression that the author either greatly admires flowers, especially this particular hibiscus and its budding process, or perhaps simply enjoys witnessing the changes in nature.
1174	10039	4	2	I'm of the opinion that the author includes this passage in the story to symbolize determination and @LOCATION1. Although Saeng isn't originally from @LOCATION2, she is determined and eager to adapt to our @CAPS1. Despite the cold and harsh winter she endured, spring will bring forgiveness and relief from her @CAPS2. She will attempt to pass the driving test again to better integrate into American @CAPS1, and the blooming of the hibiscus will bring her a sense of @CAPS4 related to home.
1175	10040	4	2	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng has come to understand the importance of confidence and to end the story on a positive note. Additionally, the author weaves elements familiar to Saeng and native to her new home into the last paragraph. At the start of the story, the girl was extremely upset and felt lost in this country, missing her home terribly, as evidenced by “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her.” However, once she gets home and tells her mother about failing the driving test, she starts to feel better. Towards the end, after planting the hibiscus, seeing the geese makes her feel as if they're “almost familiar”. The concluding paragraph effectively ties together her past (the hibiscus), her present (the geese and the snow), and the main drama of the story (failing the test).
1176	10041	4	2	She had a strong desire to learn and engage in more activities. She was captivated by the appearance of the plants at the store. Her mother purchased a plant, and they went home to start planting it. The daughter developed a deep affection for the plant. She expressed her aspiration to grow a plant as magnificent as the one her mother was cultivating next year.
1177	10042	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes this paragraph in the story to illustrate how mature Saeng has become, as it seems she no longer lives with her mother. Presumably, the author intends to emphasize to the reader the new - found independence of Saeng. Since she doesn't live with her mother anymore, what has happened is part of her past, which will remain a memorable part of her life.
1178	10043	4	2	The author employs the passage to conclude the story, aiming to demonstrate that Saeng will attempt to adapt. When Saeng smells the hibiscus and experiences “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng could almost feel the light sounds of her grandmother’s long gray hair”, it indicates that Saeng was seeking familiar things that reminded her of her homeland. The fact that Saeng spent over nineteen dollars on a plant also reveals her profound longing for her homeland. The statement “d - d failed the test that Saeng paid” implies that she tried to adapt to her new home but was unsuccessful. This failure makes her sad and causes her to miss the way things were. At the end of the story, when she said “I will take the test again”, seeing the familiar hibiscus and the geese leaving with the knowledge that they will return gives Saeng hope. The last part of the story shows that she will always remember her homeland.
1179	10044	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that Saeng will persevere and not give up.
1180	10045	4	2	With the presence of the hibiscus around her, Saeng will gain more courage and have more time to adjust to her new home. For Saeng, the hibiscus serves as a source of motivation and also evokes memories of her old homeland. I believe the author chose to end the story with this particular comment to show that, in the end, Saeng has found the courage and is ready to embrace the tasks in this foreign land.
1181	10046	4	2	The story concludes with that paragraph as it conveys that just as there are changes in the weather and seasons, life also experiences changes. One must sometimes confront these life - changes. The test could be a means for her to understand herself. Weather changes occur constantly; there are shifts in spring and fall. One simply has to move past them.
1182	10047	4	2	"In ""The Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the writer concludes the story with a final paragraph. One reason for this conclusion is that it informs the reader that Saeng has not given up on her driver's test. The quote ""… Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" details when she will retake the test. Another reason is that it makes the reader wonder about the subsequent events of the story."
1183	10048	4	2	"I believe the author's choice to conclude the story with ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" was an excellent way to end it. I think Saeng realizes that if the hibiscus can endure, she can handle just about anything, especially the test. Additionally, when her mother said ""You what?"" and ""Her mother stared at her incredulously"", Saeng might have understood that if her mother could get over her anger, she could overcome her disappointment about the test."
1184	10049	4	2	The writer includes this conclusion at the end of the story to convey that the seasons are changing and the flowers are about to wither. The author also wants the readers to know that when the season changes back, the flower will attempt to fit in with the other flowers again. This is what the author implies when talking about taking the test again.
1185	10050	4	2	"The hibiscus flower serves as a symbol of hope and a reminder of their homeland. When Saeng first spots it in the florist shop, memories of home and the freely - growing flowers there flood over her. I'm of the opinion that the author intends for the new flower to signify an opportunity for Saeng and her mother to thrive in @LOCATION1. Planting the flower represents their adaptation to a new land. When Saeng says ""when this hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again"", she seems to be using it as motivation. The paragraph offers closure and a sense of hope, making it a great way to end the story."
1186	10051	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it conveys that if one fails the first time, there is always a second chance. Just like the @CAPS1 that dies in winter and comes back to life in spring.
1187	10052	4	2	At the end of the story, the author has the character say, “When the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The reason is that the girl Saeng failed the test but found something that reminded her of home. She was happy, though the plants were not exactly the same as those from home. Still, she got used to them. The flower @MONTH1 may not be the same, but it's an @CAPS1 flower, and she is getting accustomed to being in @LOCATION1. When she retakes the test, she and her plant will be ready, and her plant will be full of life.
1188	10053	4	2	I believe the author ends the story in this way due to Saeng's reverence for the plant. She not only views the plant as a symbol of her home but also as a token of good luck. In the text, she highly values the plant, having paid @NUM1 coins for it. Thus, I think the story ends like this to signify that Saeng believes the optimal time to take the test is when the hibiscus is growing.
1189	10054	4	2	The author includes that paragraph at the end of the story as it uses symbolism to connect Saeng with the geese and the plant. For Saeng, the snow represents her difficulties in adjusting to @LOCATION1. The geese indicate that she is adapting to her new homeland as they seem familiar. The @CAPS1 hibiscus was beautiful, but the new @CAPS2 hibiscus, which symbolizes her since she arrived in @LOCATION1, is more resilient and can withstand the snow, representing her problems with adaptation. The hibiscus budding again for Saeng represents her growing stronger and overcoming her troubles. She wishes to retake the test when she is stronger. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to link the budding hibiscus with Saeng's triumph over her obstacles.
1190	10055	4	2	The author decided to conclude the story in that manner because it implies that it's not over and that Saeng will take the test again. In the story, Saeng says, “I - I failed the test,” so she is determined to return when the flower blooms again to succeed.
1191	10056	4	2	In my view, the author intends to convey that she will retake her driving test in spring when the flowers bloom. The presence of flowers helps her attain a relaxed state of mind, enabling her to focus better during the test.
1192	10057	4	2	She states that when the @CAPS1 regrow, she will be @CAPS2 to retake the test. This shows her determination to try again under more favorable circumstances.
1193	10058	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concludes with the last sentence to indicate that the plant - growing season has ended. However, when the flowers start growing again, the protagonist will return to tend to the plants as they are her favorite and what she lives for now. The author likely structured the conclusion this way to pique readers' interest and create suspense, leaving them wondering if the protagonist will truly return to the plants. Additionally, since it is still snowing, the protagonist cares about the plants but will wait for the right time. For instance, her statement ""when they come back then I will take the test again"" demonstrates her perseverance and refusal to give up on what she loves."
1194	10059	4	2	"In my opinion, in the story ""The Winter Hibiscus"", the author uses the last paragraph to illustrate that while the memories of the protagonist's old country will always linger, she will gradually adapt to her new one. From time to time, she will also visit her old country. The line ""when the snow melts and the geese return"" and the statement ""then I will take the test again"" imply that whether she is adapted to the new country or back in her old one, she will find enjoyment either way."
1195	10060	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will retake the test when specific events occur. Saeng demonstrates her unwavering determination not to give up and her commitment to keep trying. The hibiscus serves as a lucky charm for her during the test, motivating her to pass. Moreover, the author uses this paragraph to reveal Saeng's personal thoughts and feelings about the test. The spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, signals that it is time for another attempt. In conclusion, this paragraph indicates that Saeng will never forget.
1196	10061	4	2	The author concludes the story with its last paragraph. When they return, Saeng silently vows to herself that in spring, when the snow melts, the geese come back, and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will take that test again.
1197	10062	4	2	It seems she thought it was a good way to unite everyone.
1198	10063	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concludes with Saeng stating ""I will take that test again"". This implies that Saeng will be prepared as soon as spring arrives and her hibiscus is in full bloom. When Saeng bought the hibiscus, she was confident that once winter ended and spring came, retaking the driver's test would be easier, enabling her to overcome the fear and difficult times in a new place. This indicates that Saeng can overcome her fear of a new environment. She also believes that the memories of her homeland will assist her. Ultimately, it is revealed that Saeng has grown strong and has high hopes of achieving success in her new homeland."
1199	10064	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it showcases determination. In spring, it will be challenging for the winter hibiscus to survive, yet it too demonstrates determination.
1200	10065	4	2	"I think the author ended the story with that statement because by the end, Saeng was ready to confront her obstacles once more, and it also shows that she was appreciating her new environment. Saeng's mother said about the plant she bought, ""It's strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This is telling Saeng that if the plant can endure the harsh conditions, perhaps she can also adapt to living in a new country. When Saeng realized that things had a repeating cycle season after season, she must have realized that she could also face the driving test again."
1201	10066	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author includes the last paragraph to convey that the main character, Saeng, retains hope and has not abandoned her new lifestyle. Throughout the narrative, Saeng encounters a plant native to Vietnam, which triggers memories of her homeland. This moment is significant as Saeng remains discontented about relocating to @LOCATION2. After purchasing the plant, she begins to cry on her way home to her mother. As described, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” Saeng’s mother comprehends her feelings and is not disappointed in her for failing the driving test. To comfort Saeng, her mother immediately plants the familiar hibiscus in the garden. The story's final paragraph offers hope that Saeng will persevere in adapting to her unfamiliar life in @LOCATION2. Saeng vows, “When the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This vow suggests that in time, Saeng will find happiness in her new life, beyond merely passing a driving test. The winter hibiscus symbolizes Saeng's strength in the new country while also reminding her of her past in Vietnam.
1202	10067	4	2	Author MiNfoNg Ho concludes the story with Saeng silently vowing to herself, “When they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The reason is that when the plant begins to blossom, Saeng will feel more confident and comfortable. Throughout the story, one can observe her efforts to adapt to new surroundings. In my view, the hibiscus represents comfort during times of disappointment and serves as a connection to her past experiences. This is why she goes out and buys the plant. When spring returns and the hibiscus is in full bloom, she will take the test again because she will feel more at ease in her new environment. This is precisely why the author concludes the story in this manner.
1203	10068	4	2	Our past experiences, whether we are consciously aware of them or not, often influence various aspects of our lives. In this story, Saeng visits a flower shop and attempts to resist buying a certain flower that reminds her of home. However, she fails. She is grappling with the reality that she is no longer “at home,” and the familiar people and things are no longer present. Yet, she is gradually getting accustomed to new things. I believe the author ends the story with the given paragraph to illustrate that change is always possible. Saeng is trying to push aside the elements that remind her of the past. With time, perhaps by next year, she can achieve this. If one truly desires to do something, it is always achievable. The author shows that Saeng is determined to pass her own mental test to better adapt to change, and her mother will be proud of her.
1204	10069	4	2	I believe she is expressing that she didn't overcome a particular challenge this time, but she'll return next year to take the test again. Just like the hibiscus buds when the snow melts and the geese return, she sees the cycle of nature as a symbol of renewal and her own determination. It's as if she's aligning her own journey of growth and perseverance with the natural world. By waiting for the right time, when the hibiscus is in its budding phase, she believes she'll be in a better state of mind and more prepared to face the test. This shows her resilience and her belief in the power of time and change.
1205	10070	4	2	The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to convey to the readers that Saeng is going to retake the test. By including this information, the author provides a sense of closure and hope. It shows that despite the setback, Saeng is determined and has the will to try again. This conclusion also gives the readers an insight into Saeng's character, highlighting her resilience and positive attitude towards facing challenges. Overall, the author's choice of ending the story in this way effectively communicates Saeng's future plans and leaves a lasting impression on the readers.
1206	10071	4	2	"When Saeng stated that she would retake the test the following year, it implied her intention to replant the plants. When she said, ""Here, let me help, mother,"" it was evident that she genuinely wanted to assist with the plants. This indicates that Saeng's words and actions reflect her commitment to the task and her desire to contribute."
1207	10072	4	2	"In the short - story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author's choice of the last paragraph reveals the hope for the future that Saeng experiences. The winter and cold symbolize her sense of displacement and disappointment at not obtaining her driver's license. However, in spring, with the blooming of a part of her homeland and the return of warmth, she will feel ready to retake the test ""when they came back"". This demonstrates her ability to adapt to and accept her new life away from home and memories. The last paragraph serves as proof that she is strong enough to overcome hardships and move forward."
1208	10073	4	2	The speaker concludes the story with that paragraph in @MONTH1 because the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus in @MONTH1 boost her confidence. She desires to feel capable of taking the test. This shows that the natural phenomena in @MONTH1 play a crucial role in her psychological state, giving her the motivation and self - assurance needed to face the test.
1209	10074	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese returned and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”. Saeng realizes that she has another opportunity to pass the test. When spring arrives again, she starts gardening. This shows that the changing seasons and the natural signs of renewal inspire her to take action and pursue her goal of passing the test.
1210	10075	4	2	Saeng draws comfort from memories of her homeland. When she took the test, everything was unfamiliar, leading to her failure. On her way back, she encountered something familiar - native plants of her home. “There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood - red blossom” floating in the bucket. Saeng relies on familiar things to soothe herself. The sight of the geese symbolizes change. “Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched.” Spring, described as “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” is a time for new beginnings. When the familiar objects are at their best, she will be at her best and able to face any challenge. Winter is the preparatory stage for her to gather strength and courage.
1211	10076	4	2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concluded the story with the paragraph “when they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason for this ending is that she bought the flower after failing the test, and she intends to retake the test when the flower blooms.
1212	10077	4	2	It seems the author is suggesting that when the snow melts, around @MONTH1, she will return. The author will likely write a new book in the spring.
1213	10078	4	2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” uses a specific paragraph to conclude the story as it serves as a symbol of Saeng's future. Winter Hibiscus symbolizes Saeng for multiple reasons. Both Saeng and the plant originate from Vietnam and face challenges to survive and thrive in the new environment of @ORGANIZATION1. Saeng vows that when the plant flourishes in spring, she will also strive by retaking her driver's test. This symbol of the future is crucial to the story, which is why Ming Fon Ho, the author of “Winter Hibiscus,” chose to end with this significant symbol.
1214	10079	4	2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author probably selected this as the final paragraph to help the reader grasp the story's message. The message is that regardless of what occurs or what challenges one encounters, never give up and always keep trying. By making this the last paragraph, the author encourages the reader to reflect on its meaning.
1215	10080	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a particular reason. Saeng believes she failed because she got a fake plant instead of a real one. She was disappointed when she brought it home. For instance, she said “I failed” when referring to the plant. She also compares her current situation to where she used to live, stating “it's not like the one at home.” This is why the author ends with this paragraph.
1216	10081	4	2	Saeng made a vow to herself that when spring arrives, with the melting snow, the return of geese, and the budding of the hibiscus, she would retake the test. This statement aligns with the story as she enjoys being in the garden, and snow - covered gardens are off - limits. Additionally, her love for plants and plant - like things is evident. The author concluded the paragraph in this way because Saeng plans to buy plants and flowers in spring. Moreover, when she spots a familiar plant, she visits a florist shop to purchase it. However, she becomes extremely upset when something goes wrong with the plants.
1217	10082	4	2	In the text, the mother said, “It’s flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters.” This sentence suggests that Saeng is similar to the flowers. They are resilient enough to survive the winter, and in spring, they are both beautiful and strong. This emphasizes that Saeng will be stronger and more confident in spring. The author included this at the end as it reflects the flower's beauty and strength in spring, just as Saeng will exhibit her own strength and confidence.
1218	10083	4	2	In Minfong Ho's short story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author includes a paragraph at the end stating that the main character, Saeng, will retake her driving test. Ho includes this to show Saeng's determination to adapt. Saeng and her mother moved to the United States from Vietnam. Throughout the story, she reminisces about her home in Vietnam, her grandmother, and the flowers there, asking, “Where was me...hibiscus hedge?... Her gentle grandmother?” At the flower shop, Saeng finds a hibiscus, a flower also found in Vietnam. Seeing how it has adapted to survive the winter, while planting it in her backyard, she vows to pass the driving test next spring. She wants to adapt to her new environment and live without excessive longing for home. The author included this vow in the last paragraph to show Saeng's desire to adapt to her surroundings and pass the driving test.
1219	10084	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the true meaning of the hibiscus. The hibiscus symbolizes Saeng in multiple ways, with the most significant being that it represents change, growth, and the ability to overcome obstacles. When Saeng sees the hibiscus, childhood memories and sentimentality wash over her. Yet, if she wants to grow as a person, she must adjust to her new home. Just as the hibiscus survives the winter, Saeng will thrive in her new environment. Saeng vows that “in the spring” when “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She is determined to succeed, and the hibiscus represents triumph over obstacles. It stands for survival and endurance through life's disappointments and challenges, from failing a driver's test to starting a new life in a foreign country. The author's choice to end the story with this paragraph shows Saeng's ultimate understanding of her strength through the symbol of the hibiscus.
1220	10085	4	2	I think the author concludes the paragraph in this way to convey an important message to the audience. The message is that even though she failed the test, she will try again next year. An example is the exact quote “in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This is the reason I believe the author ends the story like this.
1221	10086	4	2	The author includes this story paragraph because when Saeng failed her driver's test for the first time as the hibiscus began to bud, it symbolizes a life - changing moment for her. Moreover, Saeng used to have hibiscus flowers at her old home in Vietnam. So, the budding of the flower can signify that she has established a new home.
1222	10087	4	2	The author concludes the story with the line “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again.” The conclusion is significant as it is crucial for Saeng to feel at home. When the hibiscus buds, it will evoke memories of her home, providing comfort. When she feels at peace and at home, she is likely to perform better on the test.
1223	10088	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate that the character, Saeng, is neither giving up on her new home nor forgetting her old one. When she brings home the flower to plant, it shows her determination not to give up and her remembrance of her old home. Additionally, when she says, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” it indicates her willingness to give her new home another try. Another instance is when it states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This shows that she is accepting the changes and giving her new home a chance, not giving up on it.
1224	10089	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph. The reason is that she is eager to repeat the same activities next year. She enjoys spending time with her mom, has an affinity for plants, and has a great deal of fun with her mom. These factors contribute to her decision to conclude the story with that paragraph.
1225	10090	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus offers comfort. Saeng failed her driving test and was new to the place. Frustrated and missing her real home in Vietnam, the hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. After Saeng smelled the flower, she “closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs,” and it made her recall “combing her grandmother’s long grey hair, freshly washed,” bringing her comfort during a disappointing time. Since she didn't have her grandmother with her, the flower served as a source of solace. Despite her disappointment, the hibiscus was “exquisite,” and as she said the word “dokor malik” (meaning hibiscus), she “savored the feel of the word on her tongue.” The joy and comfort the flower brings to Saeng are evident. She will take the test again in the spring when “the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding,” allowing the reader to feel the joy, love, and comfort that Saeng experiences.
1226	10091	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it establishes a new - found connection between the hibiscus and Saeng's circumstances in a foreign country. It reveals that Saeng draws inspiration from the hibiscus and its adaptability. Throughout the story, Saeng mentions having always seen the hibiscus in her home country. Her mother points out that the hibiscus she bought differs from the ones back home, explaining that its strength allows it to adapt to the cold winters of the United States. This becomes Saeng's source of inspiration. Despite failing her license test, she uses the hibiscus's example to set a goal. Just as the plant endures a cold, snowy winter to bloom in spring, Saeng decides to use this time to study and prepare, so she can approach the test with confidence. The concluding paragraph highlights the parallel Saeng has drawn between her own situation and that of the plant.
1227	10092	4	2	The well - known quote “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again” is often used by parents to encourage their children and coaches to motivate their teams. In the short story “Winter Hibiscus,” this quote aptly applies to Saeng's situation. After failing her driver's test, as she walks home, she notices a hibiscus flower that reminds her of her homeland. Overwhelmed with sadness, she buys the plant to soothe her grief. When she brings it home, her mother initially scolds her but then expresses gratitude. While planting the hibiscus, Saeng hears the honk of Canada geese, which have become familiar to her over time. The text states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.” This shows the adaptation Saeng has undergone since coming to @LOCATION1. The author ends the story with this paragraph to illustrate that, like the hibiscus, Saeng will adapt to the challenges of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to persevere and retake the license test, just as the plant endures the winter.
1228	10093	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner because Saeng finds comfort in the hibiscus flower. The flower evokes memories of her homeland and her grandmother. As the story describes, “the familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair.” This indicates that although she misses her homeland, she keeps it close to her heart wherever she goes. The text also mentions that “it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.” Saeng appears to have a close connection with nature and its appealing qualities. After failing the test, she buys the “@CAPS1 Malik” flower for comfort. She and her mother decide to plant it in their garden, and during this process, Saeng gains a significant boost of confidence to retake the test.
1229	10094	4	2	She makes a comparison between the paragraph and the story in the context of school. In this comparison, taking the test is equated with making new friends and performing well in tests and classes. The paragraph contains the statement “Then I will take that test again.” This is the reason she draws a parallel between the paragraph and school, suggesting that just as the character in the paragraph is determined to retake the test, one should be persistent in the school - related challenges of making friends and excelling academically.
1230	10095	4	2	The author ends the story with this paragraph to underscore Saeng's resolve to overcome the hurdles from her past experiences. For instance, the story begins with Saeng taking a “test.” While in the greenhouse, as she relives her memories, she starts to break down. The text describes, “A wave of loss so deep and strong it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her.” After this, she buys a plant and takes it home to her mother, informing her that she “failed.” Her mother shows understanding and supports Saeng's vow to retake the “test.” The narrator emphasizes Saeng's determination to move past the difficulties of her past and embrace the future.
1231	10096	4	2	Her schoolwork was the reason she was studying flowers in a green garden. She failed the test, and when spring arrives and the flowers bloom, she will retake it. She can then conduct more studies to pass and avoid having to take it again. It seems she is also looking forward to spring so she can enjoy the flowers and continue growing and studying.
1232	10097	4	2	I believe the author concluded the story with that specific paragraph to show that Saeng, originally from Vietnam who moved to the United States, was not giving up. She missed her home greatly as everything was different. “It’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. “I mean, not like the kind we had at - at...”. She found herself too emotional to say “at home”. Once Saeng realized she was starting to adapt to life in the US, she decided to take the driver's test again. “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In conclusion, the author used this paragraph to depict Saeng's perseverance.
1233	10098	4	2	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng appears to feel more at ease when she sees the geese and plants the hibiscus in winter, preventing it from dying. As the story states, “... their faint banks clear and - yes - familiar to Saeng now”. This seems to explain how she feels after seeing the geese fly overhead, as she used to witness this in Vietnam. Also, when she says, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”, she gains more confidence as she feels like she's back in Vietnam. Overall, this is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph, to convey Saeng's sense of comfort and connection.
1234	10099	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the reader imagine what will happen to Saeng when spring arrives. This enables the reader to engage their imagination and connect with the story. Another reason is to give the reader hope that Saeng might pass the test next time. It's also a positive way to end the story, leaving the reader with an optimistic outlook.
1235	10100	4	2	The author ended the story with that particular paragraph because, like the geese that return, the character will come back to try again. The author wanted to convey that the character might not have completed everything she intended to do, and to show the reader the character's determination and ambition. It also demonstrates that the character's spirit cannot be broken by one winter, and she will persevere until she achieves her goals.
1236	10101	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with Saeng vowing to retake the test. This is done to convey that, even in challenging circumstances and new environments, one should never succumb to despair. There are always elements that can offer comfort. Throughout the story, glimpses of Saeng's home are provided through her memories, allowing readers to understand the difficult day she is having. The author describes these warm, comforting memories to contrast with the cold, bitter reality of her current situation. For instance, when Saeng “closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs,” she recalls a memory of her grandmother, which saddens her as she thinks of her home and loss. The author builds up Saeng's despair and distress leading to the final paragraph. This final paragraph is significant as it represents hope. When Saeng says, “then I will take that test again,” one can sense her hope. Additionally, the author aims to express that there is still structure and stability in a changing world, and one can find solace in simple things. Saeng mentions, “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” indicating that there are reliable elements that can provide security when one feels lost. The author uses this last paragraph to balance the despair in the story, emphasizing the need for hope and showing that there are always things that can offer hope and security.
1237	10102	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph to complete the narrative. At the end of the paragraph, the character is visualizing and putting effort into the hibiscus, showing her appreciation for the plant. The author also wants to provide more evidence to the story. For example, the statement “in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” includes the winter period for the plant. As the seasons change from winter to spring, the plant comes back to life, and the character Saeng will also regain her connection with it and visit it. This conclusion ties together the themes of renewal and the character's determination in the face of change.
1238	10103	4	2	The author made it seem as if he didn't like something, but in reality, he loved flowers and enjoyed working in the area with the people. His mother was also involved in some way. He liked to see the people around him getting on with their lives and coming back to the place because they liked it. This shows that despite the initial appearance, there was a deep - seated affection for the place and the activities associated with it. The author's portrayal of these feelings adds depth to the story, highlighting the positive aspects of the environment and the relationships within it.
1239	10104	4	2	The author includes this part at the end of the story to demonstrate the character's deep affection for the plant and how it evokes memories of her childhood. Evidence of her love for the plant can be found in descriptions such as “rich scent” (Paragraph Minfong Ho) and “It felt smooth and cool” (paragraph Minfong Ho). Regarding the connection to her childhood, she realizes that she had forgotten certain things but they resurfaced. For example, she had not even realized she had known something but had forgotten it, and when she came back, she could “reed” (presumably read or experience in some way). Based on these aspects, it is reasonable to conclude that the author adds this part at the end to emphasize the character - plant relationship and the link to her past.
1240	10105	4	2	I firmly believe that the author left this as the last thing for the reader to read, intending it to be a powerful message. In the story, the girl has moved to a completely new environment and culture. The only familiar thing to her is a wild - growing flower from her previous home. Her little vow to herself serves as a reminder not to give up. It encourages her to keep going and to be open - minded about new experiences, as one never knows what they can learn. This girl didn't simply give up; her plant symbolizes a new beginning. Just as the plant starts anew, she decides to do the same. It can also be seen as a representation of her life itself. In the text, there are indications that suggest this new start, making it clear that the author uses this ending to inspire readers with the message of hope and resilience.
1241	10106	4	2	I believe the author wrote in this way because perhaps in winter, she truly feels she can reveal her true self. However, when spring arrives, she is like a flower that has withered throughout the winter. This shows a contrast in her self - expression between different seasons.
1242	10107	4	2	The author ends the story with this paragraph. In the preceding paragraph, they were discussing the “winter hibiscus” and the geese. So, the author simply writes a concluding paragraph to wrap up the story, leaving the reader with a positive feeling.
1243	10108	4	2	In Minfong Ho's “The Winter Hibiscus,” the story details the challenges Saeng faced upon moving to a different country. Saeng failed her driving test and was reminded of her homeland by some tropical flowers. At the end of the story, the author has Saeng vow, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, it's the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This part is crucial as it showcases Saeng's growth and hope for change, similar to the geese's return and the hibiscus blossoming. It also indicates that Saeng will not give up and will adapt to the new environment, just as the plants and geese do. This conclusion is significant for readers as it sums up Saeng's thoughts and hopes for the future while adjusting to her new surroundings.
1244	10109	4	2	There could be multiple reasons for the author to conclude the story with this paragraph. I think the author aimed to provide an interesting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows. For instance, the author explains the growth process of hibiscus, including the requirements such as sunlight, water, soil, and waste management. Maybe the author thought that by explaining how the growth process restarts after snowfall, it would be a fitting conclusion for the story.
1245	10110	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng mentions failing a test and decides to retake it when spring returns. The last paragraph states, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” However, the story doesn't clarify which test Saeng is referring to.
1246	10111	4	2	The individual stated that she would wait until spring to retake the test. The purpose of this delay is to determine whether her preference for the bitter melon over the Big - Mac persists.
1247	10112	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of the mention of taking the test again. What is meant by this is that she will have to repeat the same actions next year. Similar to how the hibiscus adapted to its environment, she must adapt to life. Additionally, she is advocating to do one's best as living life to the fullest is the essence of existence. Thus, it serves as a fitting conclusion for the story.
1248	10113	4	2	In my opinion, the reason the author ends the story in such a way is that it provides an open - ended conclusion. This style also implies that there could potentially be more to the story in the future.
1249	10114	4	2	The author concludes that during spring, when the snow melts and the flowers bloom, it brings a sense of the essence of spring at home. This situation allows her to relax. Moreover, spring is a more beautiful season as all the flowers are in bloom, and a particular flower reminds her of the blessings of home.
1250	10115	4	2	Saeng made a silent vow to herself. She decided that in spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus starts to bud, she will retake the test. Saeng intends to wait to take the test until she is confident that she will pass it and obtain her license. She desires the license so that she can drive wherever she wants, eliminating the need for her mother to take her everywhere. However, she has to wait until the snow has melted before retaking the test.
1251	10116	4	2	The paragraph indicates that Saeng has deep affection for her plants. She takes pleasure in them and values the time she spends with them. In the last paragraph, she expresses her eagerness for winter to end so that her plants can start budding and she can once again enjoy their presence.
1252	10117	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it effectively ties all the elements together. I believe the author also uses it to imply that in the spring, she will pass the test. I'm particularly fond of the part where she says ""In the spring, when the snows melt..."". This is because it clearly conveys what she desires and how she is determined to achieve it."
1253	10118	4	2	The author likely employs this paragraph to illustrate the character setting a goal for the cycle to restart. Geese are used as a symbol of spring, when the character would once again commence preparations for the “test”. The budding hibiscus in this paragraph represents hope, as it signifies the start of a new cycle and serves as an object of reminiscence in the story. In conclusion, this concluding paragraph utilizes various symbols and devices to convey hope, evoke good memories, and suggest a fresh start.
1254	10119	4	2	She would grow some flowers and water them when the geese return to her pond. This simple act of nurturing the flowers and observing the return of the geese adds a sense of tranquility and renewal to the scene.
1255	10120	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for multiple reasons. One reason is to truly convey the meaning of the flower. Another is to express the theme. For instance, at the end of the paragraph, it says “Then I will take that test again.” This relates the small topic of the driving test to the larger topic of the flower, which in turn connects it to the theme of adjusting and persevering until one adjusts. That last paragraph was extremely crucial to the theme and meaning of the story.
1256	10121	4	2	I believe Minfong Ho concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with the line “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to illustrate how past memories can be transformed into hope and determination. After failing her driving test, Saeng encounters the hibiscus, and memories of her homeland and grandmother overwhelm her. She purchases the plant and places it in the vegetable garden. After planting, Saeng witnesses a flock of Canada geese flying overhead. Drawing on her memories of her old home and family and applying them to her new environment, Saeng vows to retake the test and try again. By ending the story with this paragraph, the author demonstrates that Saeng will not give up.
1257	10122	4	2	The author concludes the story to show that Saeng is prepared to embrace her new life. When the geese return and the hibiscus begins to bud, she feels at home. It is when she feels more at home that she will be ready to retake the test. As the text states, “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Clearly, the geese and hibiscus evoke memories of her home. Once she feels at home, she will feel at ease. This is why the author concluded the story with this passage.
1258	10123	4	2	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it restates the main idea of the story, enabling readers to understand its essence. By using that concluding paragraph, the author effectively wraps up the narrative and ensures that the central message is conveyed to the readers.
1259	10124	4	2	The author reveals that she has failed the test. It is still winter, and the hibiscus is in the process of regrowing its lovely petals. She tells her mother that she will not take the test again until the hibiscus starts budding and spring returns. This indicates her determination to wait for a more favorable time, symbolized by the blooming of the hibiscus and the arrival of spring.
1260	10125	4	2	Yes, I firmly believe that this ending concludes the story. After all the events in the story and her learning about gardening from her mother, she recalls what her mother said about the hibiscus and its budding. The ending sentence implies that when spring arrives, she will take the test again. This test will determine whether she has learned enough about gardening from her mother over time. The ending effectively ties up the story by linking her learning experience to a specific event in nature, providing a sense of closure.
1261	10126	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph presumably because the grandma passed away when the geese were in flight, or perhaps that's when the flowers began to bloom.
1262	10127	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author included the last paragraph to convey to readers that Saeng will move on while still remembering her old country. Before finding the hibiscus, Saeng deeply missed her homeland. As she said, “It’s - it’s not a real one,” she mumbled. “I mean not like the kind we had at - at...” She found herself too emotional to mention home and burst into tears. She struggled to accept her new country as home. The hibiscus flower brought back vivid memories of her old country, making it harder for her to move forward. One of the blossoms fell, and Saeng gently picked it up and smelled it. She could almost feel her grandmother's freshly - washed long gray hair as she combed it with the fine - toothed buffalo - horn comb. Holding the flower, she finally had a tangible link to home. “Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold onto.” This was the first step towards moving on. Saeng needed time to adjust to her new country. “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.” Like a hibernating hibiscus, she needed a bit more time. She decided that when the hibiscus emerged from hibernation and was ready to bloom, she would be ready to accept her new country and move on. The time between fall and spring would be enough for her to adapt to her new life. By taking this step, Saeng will move on. The author included the last paragraph so readers can infer that Saeng will take the final steps to accept her new country and move on, while still looking back at her old country through the winter hibiscus."
1263	10128	4	2	The story includes this paragraph because at the start, the girl failed the test. When she told her mother, she saw her mother was upset. After they planted the plant, she decided to retake the test, knowing her mother would approve. Also, the story began with her telling her mother about the failed test. If this part were removed, readers might wonder why her mother didn't do anything about the failure. Moreover, when readers learn of the girl's failed test, they will want to know if she retakes it and the reason behind it.
1264	10129	4	2	In my opinion, the author ended the story with an open - ended conclusion. The author did this to maintain readers' interest and encourage them to read his other books. Additionally, such an ending leaves room for improvement and the possibility of a sequel.
1265	10130	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng will not give up until she successfully completes the task her mother assigns. Saeng fails the test because, although she buys a beautiful plant, it is extremely expensive. Her mother exclaims, “But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn’t cost that much!” Saeng becomes very distraught and realizes she has let her mother down. However, she still plants the winter hibiscus in the ground. “Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the ‘winter hibiscus’ into it.” This shows that despite her failure, she refuses to abandon the hibiscus as it symbolizes her home and is very special to her.
1266	10131	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it indicates that the character in the story, Saeng, is beginning to adapt to her new country. At the start of the story, Saeng is homesick and has not adjusted to her new environment. She fails her driver's test and on the way home, she spots a hibiscus in a flower - shop. The hibiscus is significant to her as it reminds her of Vietnam, her home country. For Saeng, it represents comfort in times of disappointment, a connection to her past, and the ability to overcome obstacles. She has struggled to adapt to the changes in her life. The author ends the story with this paragraph to show readers that life will always have changes and obstacles, but there will also always be something or someone to help overcome them. By concluding with this paragraph, the author shows that Saeng uses the hibiscus as a means of overcoming difficulties, and when she is ready and has adjusted, she will retake her driving test.
1267	10132	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it conveys that once winter and spring pass and the hibiscus starts budding, the character will start anew and make another attempt. The author implies that Saeng is eager for spring so she can plant her own small garden. This is the reason I believe the author ends the story with this particular paragraph.
1268	10133	4	2	"This paragraph depicts an action that Saeng will undertake over the course of a year. She is going to develop and transform in time for the retake of the test, which is akin to a rebirth. The girl wishes to be a completely new person by the time the test comes around again. Her mother appears to be annoyed by every action or decision of her daughter. The daughter suddenly realizes the significance of the hibiscus and why it withers. As stated, ""... thought the quiet repetition of season upon season."" She associates the flower and geese with herself. Throughout the year, the flower goes through phases of dying and then rebirth. Saeng desires to improve after going through a similar phase, just like the flower that blossoms beautifully again."
1269	10134	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because after Saeng takes her driver's test and is on her way home, she sees a winter hibiscus that is extremely beautiful. She then goes to the store and buys the flower, which costs a large amount of money. When she gets home, her mother is planting vegetables and asks her what it is. Saeng tells the truth, and when her mother learns of the high cost of the flower, she becomes angry at Saeng's extravagance. Despite her mother's anger, Saeng makes a firm decision to keep the flower, presumably because it reminds her of Vietnam. I think the author includes this paragraph because when the geese return and the flowers grow, Saeng will take the test again. When she bought the flower, it had not bloomed yet, so she will wait until it does. This is a way of showing that one should observe the first signs and wait for the right time to take on a challenge. In my opinion, this is a good ending and also poses an interesting question.
1270	10135	4	2	The author concludes the text with this paragraph as it shows the author's intention to convey a certain message. The author seems to imply that the character's situation is tied to the cycle of the hibiscus. The character, likely Saeng, has faced a set - back in the form of failing the driver's test. The sight of the hibiscus on the way home from the test becomes a symbol. The hibiscus represents hope and a new beginning. Just as the hibiscus goes through seasons, the character will go through a period of growth and change. The author uses this to show that even in the face of disappointment and the anger of her mother over the expensive flower, the character can find the strength to persevere. When the hibiscus blooms, it will be a sign for the character to retake the test, indicating that growth and opportunity come after a period of waiting and self - improvement.
1271	10136	4	2	The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself...” as it provides the reader with a conclusion. This passage implies that once Saeng has acclimated to her new life in a foreign country, she will attempt her driver's test again. When she becomes familiar with her surroundings, she will feel more at home. Throughout the story, her separation from Vietnam leaves her feeling lonely. The hibiscus plant initially offers her a sense of comfort, as described by “It felt smooth and cool... just as she had known it would feel.” The ending paragraph indicates that Saeng will find more sources of comfort in @LOCATION2 beyond just a plant and a few geese.
1272	10137	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when the “snow does melt and the Geese return,” it will be time to plant and work in the garden more intensively. With snow on the ground, planting is not possible, but the return of the geese signals the appropriate time to sow seeds. The test is to determine if she can achieve a better grade than in previous years.
1273	10138	4	2	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because that is the appropriate way to end it, which is why the ending was structured in such a manner.
1274	10139	4	2	The author concludes the story with “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This is done to illustrate that Saeng is adapting to her new country and making decisions, similar to how she did in her homeland. In Vietnam, Saeng used to brush her grandmother's hair, put it into a bun, and place a hibiscus in it, which was one of her traditions. Additionally, when she fetched water from the well, a hibiscus would sometimes be retrieved with the bucket. Thus, the hibiscus was regarded as a comfort object. Now, in the United States, she is attempting to make good use of it while also considering the seasonal patterns in the country. She observes that the geese return in the spring and depart in the winter, and plants begin to grow in the spring. By taking the test again in the spring, it symbolizes that she is ready to start anew, just like the hibiscus that is about to bloom. The potted plant in her garden and Saeng's relocation both signify change, while also serving as a reminder of old traditions and creating space for new ones.
1275	10140	4	2	The author included that sentence in the story because she believes it will give her sufficient time to pass the test successfully, and she has an affinity for geese.
1276	10141	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate the final determination and strength bestowed upon Saeng. It seems as if this plant has served to inspire her to rise again and pass the test. The plant becomes a comforting symbol that reminds her of her homeland. She returned with the plant to show her mother but found herself too tremulous to utter the words “at home,” which indicates her profound longing for home. However, she comes to realize that this is her new home and that everything is gradually becoming more familiar to her.
1277	10142	4	2	She concludes with this sentence as it represents a sign of new life. Just as winter, which causes the death of plants and the end of life, is succeeded by spring, which ushers in a new beginning, this is how Saeng feels. After leaving her country and leaving all her memories behind, she feels out of place, like the winter hibiscus. But as spring arrives, she will feel like a new person, ready and capable of taking on challenges. As she stated, “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,” she describes that with a new season comes new changes, and she will go on to retake the driver's test.
1278	10143	4	2	The author ends the story with that paragraph for multiple reasons. Firstly, it shows that although she has failed this time, more opportunities will present themselves in the future. Secondly, it illustrates that despite the current misfortunes she faces, better times are yet to come. Overall, it was a powerful and effective way to conclude the story.
1279	10144	4	2	The author employs symbolism to convey a distinct message. Saeng stated that in the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is in bud, she will take the test again. The author uses the hibiscus to symbolize Saeng's growth, suggesting that just as the hibiscus matures, she will be ready to take the test once more. By using symbolism, the author enriches the narrative of the story.
1280	10146	4	2	She wrote that response to inform everyone that she will be prepared by the time spring arrives. At that point, she will take the test and pass.
1281	10147	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as Saeng wishes to resume planting. Saeng's life centers around planting, and her family obtains food from their plants. Throughout the relevant time period, they spend a significant amount of time in the garden, growing crops both for sale and for storage. They save the crops for winter and sell them to acquire the equipment needed to continue their activities. In the paragraph, when she mentions “when they come back,” she is referring to the geese. Saeng adores the sight of geese flying overhead and landing in the yard on beautiful days. Once the snow melts, she yearns to get her hands and knees in the soil and start planting anew. When the hibiscus begins to bud, all other plants start to grow. Saeng's life is deeply intertwined with planting. The author included this paragraph in the story because this is what Saeng desires most.
1282	10148	4	2	In the conclusion of “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng mentions that she will retake her driving test in spring when the snow melts and the geese return. Spring is the time when these events occur, along with the annual budding of the winter hibiscus. Her family relocated from Vietnam to a specific location. Saeng bought a winter hibiscus plant to evoke memories of her childhood. When the plant blooms, she will retake her driving test as it will bring her the hope of a new beginning in her life as a citizen in that location.
1283	10149	4	2	In the short - story “Winter Hibiscus,” a young girl named Saeng moves away from home. The story depicts her struggle to adapt to a new lifestyle and the changes that come with it.
1284	10150	4	2	The author ends the story with this paragraph to convey to the reader that Saeng will not give up until she passes her driver's test, just as geese do not stop their migration until they reach the south for winter. The author aims to illustrate the beauty of perseverance, of facing obstacles on the path to achieving one's goal.
1285	10151	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes with a powerful ending. The ending states, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will try the test again.” The author ended the story this way because it showcases Saeng's strength, her willingness to strive and make herself stronger, her determination to try again, and her desire to help herself. Textual evidence to support this includes “then I will take the hibiscus test again,” “Almost Reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become...,” and “There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply.” These statements justify why the author chose to end the story with such a powerful paragraph.
1286	10152	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with a paragraph to illustrate the frequency with which Saeng is tested by her memories. Earlier in the story, when Saeng was in a florist, she was “tested.” Memories rushed back to her like a flood, and she attempted to recapture the feelings she had when her grandmother was alive. Realizing that the things in her memories were long gone, she wept. Saeng informed her mother that she had failed the test and bought a plant to console herself. Her mother was understanding and accepted the situation. Saeng planted the hibiscus and stated at the end, “In the spring when the snow melts, this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Saeng was aware that seeing the flower again would make her cry, bring back her memories, and subject her to another test.
1287	10154	4	2	In Minfong Ho's story “Winter Hibiscus,” a girl named Saeng failed her driver's test on a particular day. She then vowed to retake it in the spring. By ending with this statement, she implies that the new season represents a fresh start in her new life. The archetype of the transition from the harsh, cold winter to the pleasant, warm spring suggests that the troubles between Saeng and her mother will improve. Just as winter's hardships give way to spring's calm and new beginnings, Saeng believes that she will pass the test.
1288	10155	4	2	The author concludes the story with the given paragraph for several reasons. Throughout the passage, it is evident that the hibiscus flower empowers Saeng to overcome obstacles and offers comfort during times of disappointment. The ending paragraph indicates that “in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding,” and the world is beautiful once more, Saeng will retake her test. She is confident that with the support of the hibiscus plant, she will pass. This shows that her hope and trust in passing the test stem from the hibiscus flower. The plant, with its “waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers,” will endow her with the strength, determination, courage, and willpower to succeed in the spring.
1289	10156	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with the statement, “...then I'll take the test again.” This demonstrates Saeng's willingness to adapt to her new living environment. When she refers to the “test,” she is alluding to this process of adaptation. For instance, in the story, when her mother asked what was wrong, she said, “I - I failed the test.” She spent a significant amount of money on a plant in an attempt to retreat into her own world. However, she couldn't cope with the situation. By ending with a positive statement, she conveys her optimism for a bright future in her new home.
1290	10157	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with a particular paragraph for multiple reasons. By presenting examples from the story, these reasons can be discerned. Firstly, it is clear that she will not give up. When she says, “Then I will take the test again,” it indicates her determination to keep trying. Secondly, she is suggesting that there is a future for the hibiscus. When she mentions “...and this hibiscus is budding,” she implies that the hibiscus has the opportunity to adapt to its surroundings, just as the girl in the story is doing. Finally, it shows that she is and will be doing her best. When she states, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought were strange... almost familiar to her now,” it reveals that she is getting used to her surroundings and realizes she can succeed. There are numerous reasons in the story to explain why the author ended with that paragraph, and the examples provided help readers understand these motives.
1291	10158	4	2	In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author reaches the story's conclusion with a determination to pass the test after winter ends and the flower begins to bud. This demonstrates a connection between the plant and the narrator, highlighting the hardships they both endure. Winter serves as an obstacle for the hibiscus, yet it will persevere to flourish in spring. This gives the author the confidence that she too can overcome her hardships and thrive. Another shared difficulty they face is being “root - bound.” The author deeply misses her home in Vietnam. Nevertheless, both she and the hibiscus must and will adapt to their new environments.
1292	10159	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it reveals her longing for her home, which had an impact on her driving test. In her home country, the climate was warm, and she held numerous family memories. In contrast, the new country is cold and snowy, an environment to which she is unaccustomed. The author states that she will retake the test when certain conditions are met because it will feel more like her home country, allowing her to focus on the test rather than on what she misses. This way, she hopes to achieve a better result.
1293	10160	4	2	Minfong Ho, the author of “Winter Hibiscus,” concluded the story with a specific paragraph to convey that Saeng is a tenacious individual. Saeng is determined to pass the driving test and, in a sense, acclimate to her new home. The statement “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” serves as a powerful motivation. The hibiscus flower evokes positive memories, making her happy and instilling self - belief. Minfong also ended the story this way to suggest that by the next year, Saeng will have a fresh start. She will embrace her new life instead of dwelling on the past. Saeng's mention of “... in the spring...” symbolizes the beginning of a new year, a time for renewal and celebration. This is an excellent way to end the story as it creates a positive atmosphere, showing readers that Saeng is strong enough to remember the past but move forward to a new life. The author seems to imply that everyone should possess the strength to do the same.
1294	10161	4	2	She ended the story with that paragraph to prove that despite her longing for the “old century,” she has the ability to adapt and survive in the new environment. This ending shows her resilience and determination to make the best of the current situation, rather than being held back by nostalgia.
1295	10162	4	2	I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph because it exudes a sense of hope. Saeng was struggling to adapt to her new home, which left her feeling hopeless. Her failure in the driving test only exacerbated her situation. To lift her spirits, she bought a hibiscus that reminded her of her old home. The plant offered her comfort and helped her get through tough times. In the last paragraph, Saeng looks forward to spring when she can retake the test with the hope of passing. This paragraph creates a feeling of hopefulness, which is likely the reason the author chose to end the story in this manner. It gives readers a positive outlook on Saeng's future.
1296	10163	4	2	The author concludes the story with the specified paragraph to convey that Saeng will persevere and that hope remains. Additionally, it aims to teach readers the importance of hope, patience, and the understanding that progress takes time. Saeng initially failed to resist the sorrow and longing for her homeland. She remarks, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This indicates her adaptation. By ending the story in this way and drawing a comparison to the geese, it shows that she is growing stronger. Saeng will retake the test as she refuses to give up.
1297	10164	4	2	Evidently, from reading the story “Winter @CAPS1,” the author includes the phrase “when they come Back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test Again” in the story because this passage is related to the story's title, “Winter @CAPS1.” This connection between the text and the title likely serves to enhance the thematic coherence of the story, tying together the elements of time, nature, and the character's determination.
1298	10165	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate that despite Saeng's poor performance on her previous test, she will return to take it again in an attempt to pass. Through this conclusion, the author showcases Saeng's resolve to succeed on the test and improve her performance in the future. This ending emphasizes the importance of perseverance and the belief in one's ability to overcome setbacks.
1299	10166	4	2	In my opinion, the author ends the story with that paragraph because it links the plant, which symbolizes numerous positive qualities, to the character who failed the test she was eager to pass. Both the character and the plant exemplify perseverance. The plant endures the harsh winter, serving as an emblem of steadfastness. Similarly, the main character refuses to abandon her goal of passing the test. I believe the author intends to convey a message to readers: never surrender when striving to achieve something. This ending effectively inspires and encourages readers to persevere in the face of challenges.
1300	10167	4	2	At the end of the story, the author has the character say, “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again.” The author concludes the story in this manner because the character felt she did not perform to the best of her abilities on the test and failed. Therefore, when spring arrives again, she intends to retry and hopes to pass this time. This ending highlights the character's resilience and the cyclical nature of hope and opportunity.
1301	10168	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. She wishes to return and conduct a smell - test when the snow melts and the geese come back.
1302	10169	4	2	The story is about a teenage girl named Saeng. Her family has just moved from Vietnam to the United States. Saeng failed her driving test. On her way home, she found a beautiful Hibiscus plant and fell in love with it. Saeng's mother has a garden where she plants various things and uses the plants and veggies for dinner. The author concludes a paragraph stating that when the Hibiscus plants start budding in spring, Saeng will take the test again. I believe Saeng says this because she wants to see the lovely plants after passing the test and thinks the Hibiscus will help her pass the driving test.
1303	10170	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story with that paragraph as she is giving herself hope of passing the test. When the hibiscus starts sprouting, it will give her the strength to retake the test and hopefully pass. All this is because the winter hibiscus reminded her of home.
1304	10171	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. This is because this paragraph reveals that the hibiscus is the reason Saeng wants to retake the test. If the hibiscus is budding after the snow melts and the geese return, she can draw strength from it and not give up on the test.
1305	10172	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way to show that Saeng won't give up. It's possible to adapt and learn to love one's surroundings. Saeng had difficulty saying “I - I failed the test” and couldn't say “at home”, which shows her insecurity and loneliness in the new world. By saying she'll try again in spring, it gives the reader hope that she'll adapt and love where she is. She reflects on her old life and compares it with her current one and finds some similarities. Deciding to try again in spring means she's willing to give this new place a chance.
1306	10173	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as she states, “Then I will take that test again.” She has faith in the flowers. Both she and the flowers adapt to their circumstances. They are both determined to succeed in challenging places and overcome obstacles. Perhaps she wishes to discover what lies ahead. She hopes her beliefs about the flowers are correct, and maybe she has an affinity for spring.
1307	10174	4	2	I genuinely appreciate how the author concludes the story with this paragraph. It effectively summarizes the narrative in just a few words, leaving the reader curious about what happens next and whether there will be a sequel. This is an excellent story to which I can personally relate in numerous ways.
1308	10175	4	2	The author concludes the story with this scenario because they have a challenge to overcome or a situation to resolve. If one looks closely, they will realize that it is their time to shine. One should seize this opportunity before it is lost, as there is only one chance to prove themselves worthy to others.
1309	10176	4	2	The author concludes with this sentence to demonstrate the girl's confidence in herself. It also allows her sufficient time to prepare for the next test. Moreover, she knows that she will be ready when her flower begins to bud.
1310	10177	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph so that they can write another story. They have vowed silently and will write the story in the spring when they return.
1311	10178	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as she implies that if certain events can occur, she should be capable of taking and passing the test. She makes comparisons between things that she knows do not belong together. For instance, she states that in spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, she will retake the test. Her intention is that if what she loves most can overcome its obstacle, she will redo what hurt her the most. She is uncertain whether she will pass if she retakes the test, but she is willing to keep trying until she does. In the story, she struggles to fit in, as her knowledge is limited to what she learned in her home country. All she needs to do is exert more effort, and perhaps she will be able to pass the test.
1312	10179	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph for a deeper reason. When the protagonist told her mom she failed the test, she was crying. I think the root cause was her intense longing for home, which made it difficult for her to concentrate. She needed to cry about something so as not to let her mom know how much she missed home. In conclusion, this emotional turmoil likely influenced the author's choice of ending the story at this point.
1313	10180	4	2	When they return, Saeng silently vows to herself that in spring, when the snow melts, the geese come back, and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will retake the test. The author concludes the story at this moment. Meanwhile, seemingly unfazed by the cold, her mother is still in the vegetable garden, using a rusty trowel to dig up the last of the onions. This ending captures a sense of both hope for the future (Saeng's vow) and the simple, ongoing tasks of daily life (her mother's gardening).
1314	10181	4	2	I firmly believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus serves as a powerful source of inspiration and comfort for Saeng, something no person can replicate. For example, after failing her driver's test, Saeng was deeply disappointed. On her way home, she spotted a hibiscus and went to a florist shop to purchase it. She plucked a petal from the plant and held it tightly with her eyes closed. The plant reminded her of her beloved home in Vietnam. Even though it was not the same as the ones back home, the hibiscus became a form of solace for her after the test failure. By ending the story with Saeng saying she will wait for the hibiscus to bud before retaking the test, it clearly demonstrates that the hibiscus empowers her to overcome life's obstacles and endure the hardships she encounters.
1315	10182	4	2	What Saeng means at the end of the paragraph is that when it is the season for those plants, she will retake the test. This test is related to getting to know and appreciate aspects such as the plot, features, characters, and the history of these plants. In essence, she is tying her readiness to face the test to the natural cycle of the plants, suggesting that this connection gives her the motivation and perhaps the right mindset to take on the challenge.
1316	10183	4	2	She refused to retake the test unless the winter hibiscus made a comeback. Upset about failing the test, she spent much of her day gazing at the hibiscus. However, she remained disheartened as they were not the real ones from her home. Her mother assured her that the hibiscus were strong enough to survive the winter. Saeng silently vowed to herself that in spring, when the snows melted, the geese returned, and the hibiscus began to bud, she would take the test again.
1317	10184	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it symbolizes the hope that circumstances will improve. The author ends on a hopeful note because the flower represents the girl. The girl realizes that if the flower can endure the year, so can she. This symbolizes hope as the girl understands that adapting to her new country will take time, but she will eventually succeed. This is significant as the girl regarded the day as dreadful, and this statement concludes the day positively. The girl spent the whole day longing to be back in her own country, missing her grandmother and friends. However, in this paragraph, the girl vows to herself that she will endure the winter until spring, and things will get better when she can retake the test. The entire story builds up to this turning - point when Saeng realizes that she will overcome this struggle, just as the flower will survive the winter. She understands that adapting to this new and unfamiliar country and its lifestyle will require time.
1318	10185	4	2	The author concludes the story with this sentence to show hope for the future. It conveys to readers that although the present is difficult, things will improve over time. Saeng may have failed the test this time, but she hasn't lost hope of passing it. She believes she will pass the test in spring when the time is right. Even though Saeng misses her home, she won't let that hinder her future. That's why the author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”
1319	10186	4	2	I think the author is describing that the snow is melting and spring is approaching. I assume they mean that flowers, trees, and grass will regain their beauty. The author is also letting us know that spring has arrived and winter is over. That's why she starts planting in winter so that the plants can grow beautifully in spring. This is what I believe the author intended. It's also the reason the author included this in the paragraph. In my opinion, the author should have added more details, such as how the plants were growing so beautifully, to help us better understand what was being described in the paragraph.
1320	10187	4	2	The author opted to end the story in this manner as it effectively integrates various aspects and principles of the narrative. For instance, the sentence combines the geese and the hibiscus, symbolizing her new and old homes in harmony. It also states that “... Saeng vowed silently to herself... I will take that test again,” which parallels the determination of the hibiscus flower that perseveres through the winter. A great deal of wisdom can be gleaned from the symbolic messages concealed within the final sentence. It suggests that while the past may be behind us, it remains in our hearts as we confront new challenges, and with determination, these challenges can be overcome.
1321	10188	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it demonstrates Saeng's determination and her ability to overcome the challenges of being new in a country. Despite the doubts Saeng had after her test, it is a significant step for her to decide to retake the test, as shown by her offer, ""Here, let me help you, mother"" (HO). With her mother's comfort and reassurance, Saeng gains the motivation to assist her mother and realizes that she cannot let one setback hinder her in life. Given the support she has, Saeng will definitely pass the test next time."
1322	10189	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho concludes with Saeng's silent vow: ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This ending showcases Saeng's determination to succeed in her new country and indicates that memories of her grandmother inspire her to strive for the best in her new home. At the start of the story, Saeng is at a flower shop and sees the flowers of her home country in pots. The sight triggers a flood of memories, bringing both joy and sadness. When she returns home and tells her mother she failed the test, her actions reveal her disappointment, as described: ""I - I failed the test. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye; nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits."" Later, she plants the flower in the vegetable garden, which shows her desire to remember her grandmother and home. Memories of her grandmother, though sometimes sad, also make her happy and help her persevere and succeed in her new environment."
1323	10190	4	2	The author ends the story with a quote indicating that the character will get another chance at something. Many authors choose different ways to conclude stories as it makes readers eager for a sequel or the next installment, adding a twist to the ending. Another reason for such an ending is to stimulate the readers' imagination, allowing them to envision what happens next. This approach is effective as readers are aware of what has transpired and are left wondering whether the character will fail or succeed in the next attempt.
1324	10191	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's willingness to try again. Although it may not be immediate, Saeng wishes to see the flowers that remind her of home without getting emotional. She senses that she has slightly disappointed her mother, as evident when her mother says, ""But how could you? You know how much we—what happened?"" However, after learning of her failure, Mrs. Panouvong expresses that she is glad Saeng took the test. Sensing her mother's subtle disappointment, Saeng is motivated to try again."
1325	10192	4	2	The author likely concludes the story with that paragraph to portray Saeng as a determined individual. Throughout the story, Saeng shows great determination to pass the test on her first attempt. When she fails, the author wants to convey that Saeng will not lose hope and will retake the test. This emphasizes Saeng's strength as a character and her refusal to be defeated by a single setback.
1326	10193	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to provide readers with a perspective on what she is conveying and to enable them to understand it from her up - bringing situation. For instance, she mentioned relevant details.
1327	10194	4	2	The author concludes the story with the sentence “when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” as a means to make a point about immigration. The point being that immigrants who came to @CAPS1 were instructed to forget their origins. In the story, the “test” represents getting accustomed to @LOCATION1 and forsaking one's homeland. Saeng utters those words because she failed the test and purchased an item that reminded her of her homeland. In conclusion, the author depicts how immigrants were treated and pressured to forget their identities upon arriving in @LOCATION1.
1328	10195	4	2	In the story “Winter @CAPS1”, the author implies that Saeng is from a different place than where she currently is. The text states “It was like walking into another world”, suggesting that Saeng feels as if no one knows her except herself.
1329	10196	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it indicates signs of hope. It shows that the family can look forward to spring's return, when everything will be all right. Additionally, the girl will make friends when spring arrives.
1330	10197	4	2	In “Winter Hibiscus”, Saeng took her driver's test and failed. She wishes to retake it in the spring. I believe she ends the story this way because in spring, the hibiscus plant she and her mom planted will be growing and blooming, and the geese will return. This will make her feel more at home. As a result, she will feel comforted and be able to take and pass the test, as it will remind her of home.
1331	10198	4	2	At the conclusion of the story, it is stated that she will retake the test in the spring when the geese return from their winter migration. This implies that she will embark on a fresh start in the spring, commencing anew in a new year. It is a time to study for the significant test and regroup after failing the previous one. Her mother was incredulous upon learning of her test failure but reassured her that it would be fine and that she could retake the test in a new season.
1332	10199	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as she contemplates what the situation will be like when all these events occur. Saeng silently vowed to herself, ""When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This shows that she is looking forward to a new opportunity when the natural cycle renews."
1333	10200	4	2	The author concludes the story with the specific paragraph to end on an optimistic note and convey hope for the future. Throughout the story, Saeng experienced loneliness and depression due to missing her home in Vietnam. The winter hibiscus she encountered during this time triggered childhood memories, instilling in her a glimmer of hope for adapting to the new environment and life. The flower symbolized light and hope for what lay ahead. Additionally, the story showcases a theme of perseverance. Saeng failed her driver's test and returned home feeling unfulfilled. However, her declaration to retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus blooms demonstrates her determination and refusal to give up. Ultimately, the author's choice to end the passage with that paragraph presents a positive outlook on life, emphasizing that regardless of one's origin, with love and perseverance, any obstacle can be overcome, whether it pertains to school, tests, or home, with a bit of hard - work and faith.
1334	10201	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to indicate that she will take the test once she has adjusted to the change of her new country. The phrase “When the geese return” holds significance as the faint honks and the sight of them flying overhead have become familiar to her over the seasons. The budding hibiscus also plays a crucial role as it reminds her of her home in Vietnam. The combination of seeing the flower and hearing the geese will provide her with the confidence and encouragement necessary to retake the driver's test.
1335	10202	4	2	Saeng silently vowed to herself because she found it difficult to make new friends. She has an affinity for planting, as she considers plants to be her friends. Saeng took the shovel and completed the planting task for her mother, which made her feel good about herself. This act of helping her mother and engaging with the plants likely brought her a sense of purpose and self - worth in a situation where she struggled socially.
1336	10203	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" chose to conclude the story with a specific paragraph as it represents a new beginning for Saeng. Saeng moves and fails the test, but the winter hibiscus provides comfort, alleviating memories of her former residence. It offers hope, despite the winter not being as pleasant as spring. Spring symbolizes new beginnings, as nature revives after winter's dormancy. Saeng perceives taking the test in spring as a fresh start. Drawing from personal experience, spring cleaning is often done to initiate anew. Spring's fresh air and vitality inspire positive action. This could explain Saeng's desire to take the test in spring. Thus, the author ended the story with that paragraph to illustrate Saeng's pursuit of a new beginning."
1337	10204	4	2	"Authors often conclude stories with a paragraph depicting a future action. In ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author ends with the line, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" One reason for this conclusion is to demonstrate that change will occur in spring. In the story, the girl admits, ""I - I failed the test."" By acknowledging her driving test failure, it implies that she can improve in spring and pass. Additionally, the quote ""The 'winter hibiscus' was in the ground now, and [someone] tamped down the soil around it"" shows that the hibiscus is being planted currently, but will transform and bloom in spring. In conclusion, authors use such paragraphs to highlight potential future changes."
1338	10205	4	2	"Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph for multiple reasons. The ""budding hibiscus"" serves as a symbol of comfort for the protagonist. When she moved to [LOCATION1], she couldn't bring all her friends and possessions, but she carried memories. The flower evokes a sense of home, which is reassuring after her failed driver's test. Moreover, the ""geese returning"" symbolizes a new beginning. After a long absence, the geese's return signals spring, a time to start afresh after a dreary winter. Finally, the statement ""then I will take that test again"" conveys the message that one should never give up. Despite the challenges of adapting to a new country, she made friends and tried new foods like a Big [FOOD]. Therefore, Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph to convey comfort, new beginnings, and the spirit of perseverance."
1339	10206	4	2	The author included the last paragraph to maintain the reader's interest in the story. Additionally, it conveys the message that the plant, or by extension, the characters or the situation, will never give up. This inclusion serves to engage the reader and impart a positive and resilient message. In conclusion, the author's decision to include that paragraph was a strategic move to both captivate the audience and convey an important theme.
1340	10207	4	2	"The author concludes the story with the quote, ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to illustrate that the protagonist is inspired by memories of her homeland. For instance, the story reveals that she notices many similarities between her new surroundings and her homeland as the seasons progress. Spring, in particular, reminds Saeng of home, motivating her to retake the test. In conclusion, the author included the quote to showcase how memories of her homeland encourage her."
1341	10208	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with the main character vowing to retake the drivers test, symbolizing her forward - movement. When the main character stumbles into a florist shop, she experiences a profound, almost visceral recognition upon seeing a flower that reminds her of Vietnam, her homeland. As she helps her mother plant the seeds she bought, she begins to mature. After reflecting on her past memories and finding peace, nothing holds her back. When she sees geese migrating south in a V - formation, she sets a goal for herself. This goal serves as a tool for her growth and progress in the new country. The main character's vow in “Winter Hibiscus” clearly symbolizes her journey of moving forward.
1342	10209	4	2	In this period of doubt, it is evident that she will overcome her challenges. In the story, the plant acts as a symbol of hope, which in turn instills hope in her. Initially, the memories she recalled made her sad. However, in the end, these memories became a source of hope for her, demonstrating that difficult past experiences can transform into positive forces for the future.
1343	10210	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with that statement for two possible reasons. Firstly, the author might be attempting to convey a message to the readers and capture their attention. Secondly, it's possible that the author simply felt compelled to end the story in that way, perhaps without a specific, well - defined reason. In either case, the ending statement has an impact on how the story is perceived by the audience.
1344	10211	4	2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take the test again.” This conclusion is significant as it symbolizes Saeng's ability to overcome her sorrow and attempt the test once more. After failing the test, she initially only wished to return to her old home instead of considering a retake. However, like the geese that overcome the cold by flying away and returning in spring, Saeng decides to wait until she is more confident and ready to retake the test. The budding hibiscus represents her strength and determination to pass the test on the second attempt, as it endures the cold months and blooms in spring. Thus, the author uses this paragraph to show that Saeng has not given up and is confident of passing the test.
1345	10212	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it indicates that the narrator intends to retake the test and is patiently waiting for a more opportune time. It showcases her perseverance and determination not to abandon her goal of passing the test. Moreover, she realizes that life passes by swiftly, and as a result, she understands the importance of appreciating every moment and seizing the chance to achieve her goals.
1346	10213	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author's concluding paragraph reveals that the narrator, Saeng, has not given up on her driving test."
1347	10214	4	2	"At the conclusion of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author's final paragraph summarizes several aspects of the narrative. It shows that Saeng is resolved to retake the driver's test and is receptive to a new start. The author uses these concluding words to convey Saeng's hope for a better beginning and her determination to pass the driver's test. The author also ties objects in the story to represent this determination and new start. For instance, the hibiscus reminds Saeng of her glorious home, spring is the time she chooses as it symbolizes a new beginning, and the returning geese show her resolve to become a new and better version of herself."
1348	10215	4	2	"Author Minfong concludes the story with this paragraph to evoke hope in the reader regarding the characters. An important life lesson is to never lose hope, as things will improve as long as one tries. Although Saeng was sad about failing her driving test and deeply missed her homeland, through this concluding paragraph, the principle of ""never giving up is important"" is presented and carried out through the character's vow. This principle conveys that people can overcome difficult times regardless of the circumstances. In conclusion, the ending paragraph evokes hope in the reader, contributing to the overall theme of the story: it is crucial to never give up and always have hope, especially during tough times."
1349	10216	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it enhances the story's quality. Placing this paragraph at the end makes the story more engaging compared to if it were at the start. Without this ending, the story would likely be less interesting. The author also aims to help the reader understand the story's essence, whether from the beginning or the end. For example, a poor ending would discourage readers from engaging with the story at all. This ending paragraph is a perfect fit for the story. It aligns well with the narrative and makes it much easier for me to comprehend, truly serving as the ideal conclusion.
1350	10217	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that the plant will bring good luck. The snow will melt, the geese will return, and the hibiscus plant will begin to bud, symbolizing a fresh start. Since the character failed her driving test, she decides to start anew in the spring. This is why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
1351	10218	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that just as plants start anew in spring, Saeng will also have a fresh start. The story indicates this meaning as Saeng endured a difficult winter and struggled to adapt to new circumstances. However, come spring, she can begin afresh, much like the hibiscus. This conclusion ties in with the overall theme of renewal and resilience in the face of change.
1352	10219	4	2	The author includes this paragraph in the story for several reasons. Firstly, the story commences with Saeng failing her driver's test and being despondent about it. Subsequently, it delves into the hibiscus, which reminds her of her homeland and the pleasant memories she has had. This all connects to the paragraph as Saeng will not retake the test until the hibiscus, the source of her happiness and confidence, begins to bud. This paragraph is intricately linked to every aspect of the story from start to finish, highlighting the significance of the hibiscus in Saeng's journey.
1353	10220	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story in this way because the character believes she will be ready to retake the test when they return. This conclusion implies that the character is waiting for a specific time or event to gain the necessary confidence and preparation. It shows that the character is thoughtful and strategic in approaching the test, and that the author is using this conclusion to convey the character's growth and determination.
1354	10221	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the theme that adapting to life - changes is challenging. Saeng has relocated to @LOCATION1 and yearns for her home. The flowers in the greenhouse evoke memories of her hometown and her grandmother. The quote “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her” illustrates her profound sense of loss. Saeng cannot look at the flowers without crying. She tells her mom about failing the test, but in the last paragraph, she vows to herself to pass by spring. Through this, the author provides insight into Saeng's character. Despite the difficulty of letting go of what she loves, Saeng will find the strength to thrive in a new world.
1355	10222	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that her time with nature is not over. When nature's cycle returns, she will resume her activities of growing plants, caring for them, and using them to prepare a good - night dinner. She will continue this routine until she is no longer able to do so. This conclusion shows the character's deep - seated connection with nature and her commitment to a life intertwined with it.
1356	10223	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it shows that the protagonist feels more at ease with her old home. The winter hibiscus is associated with her new home, while the new hibiscus that appears after winter also relates to the new abode. However, the hibiscus from her old home offers her a sense of comfort. Once she experiences this comfort again, she will muster the courage to take the test. The author ended the story thus because it indicates that Saeng still dislikes the change and wishes to return to her old home.
1357	10224	4	2	"The author includes this paragraph because Saeng is starting afresh in a new country. In this unfamiliar land, she misses her homeland, and the hibiscus serves as a reminder of it. Saeng took a test and failed. Just as flowers wither in winter but bloom again in spring, Saeng will ""bloom"" and attempt the test once more when the hibiscus blossoms. Moving to a very unfamiliar place can be a difficult experience. People often find ways to make promises to themselves and to keep the memory of their old home alive."
1358	10225	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the previous spring, she made a mistake, such as buying plants that cost over @MONEY1 dollars, which disappointed her mother. She realizes that when spring returns, she will have another opportunity to do her best and get things right this time. Moreover, she does not want to disappoint her mother again.
1359	10226	4	2	The author ended the story with that paragraph because she stated that the flower aids her in coping with the move and reminds her of her hometown. She believes that when the geese return and the flower begins to bloom, she will know that she can pass the test. Although she is sad about failing the test, it doesn't matter how many times one fails; eventually, one will succeed. She will likely feel confident taking the test again when spring arrives.
1360	10227	4	2	"I think the author concluded the story ""Winter @CAPS1"" with the given paragraph to suggest that Saeng will persevere. By revealing that Saeng was deeply saddened by failing the test but will retake it, it implies that Saeng is a resolute individual. I am of the opinion that the concluding paragraph was added to convey the idea that Saeng remains determined despite facing hardships."
1361	10228	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes with the line “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The hibiscus symbolizes hope and the ability to adapt to circumstances. Saeng is attempting to adjust to the new changes in her life, yet nothing seems to be going well for her. As the text states, “She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again”. The hibiscus eases her life as it reminds her of her homeland and gives her hope. The description “look how root - bound it is, poor thing” represents Saeng in her new country. She is reluctant to try new things and gets scared. However, once Saeng and her mother plant the hibiscus, Saeng realizes that by doing so, she will try to love her new life in @LOCATION1. In spring, when both the hibiscus and Saeng are ready to blossom, she will start to accept her life.
1362	10229	4	2	Mingfong Ho concludes the story with the mentioned paragraph as it demonstrates the progress Saeng has made and her determination to persevere. The narrator describes, “She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly facing into the distance” (Ho @NUM1). This occurs when Saeng is recovering from crying. Despite missing her homeland, she desires to adapt and succeed in her current location. The narrator also notes, “she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again” (Ho @NUM1). Being away from her homeland causes Saeng great distress, though the exact extent is not clearly legible in the text. Overall, this shows Saeng's internal struggle and her growing resolve to move forward.
1363	10230	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they believe the plant will bring them luck. Saeng perceives that the plant offers her a certain level of comfort. This connection between the plant and the characters' emotions is a significant aspect of the story's conclusion, suggesting that the plant serves as a source of hope and solace in their lives.
1364	10231	4	2	I am of the opinion that the author concluded the story with this paragraph due to the statement “through the quiet repetition of season upon season” in the story. This implies that as seasons come and go, the character will always be there, prepared to “take the test”. It shows a sense of perseverance and the cyclical nature of life, where the character is ready to face challenges regardless of the passage of time.
1365	10232	4	2	It is likely that the author is trying to convey that in the spring, when the seasons change, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, the character will take the test again. This indicates a connection between the renewal of nature and the character's readiness to face a challenge. The changing of the seasons and the budding of the hibiscus symbolize new beginnings and the character's opportunity for a fresh start.
1366	10233	4	2	The author reaches the conclusion that failing the test is not the most dreadful outcome. She comes to realize that circumstances change, and one can always obtain another opportunity. This is elaborated in the last paragraph, where it is stated that once the hibiscus buds, she will attempt the test again.
1367	10234	4	2	The author concludes the story by stating that in spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will take the test once more. This indicates that she will not give up easily.
1368	10235	4	2	The author concludes the story with a particular paragraph. This single short sentence conveys a great deal about her. For instance, the statement “take that test again” shows her willingness to start afresh, as she loves the activity and desires to pursue it. Moreover, when she mentions “in spring; when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” it serves as a reminder to remember all the elements she has listed. This is the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.
1369	10236	4	2	I believe this story is all about self - belief and never giving up; it's a tale of perseverance. Saeng firmly believed she could pass her driver's test. Even though she was disappointed with the result, she managed to find a way to deal with the setback. The blooming hibiscus holds great significance for her as it connects her to her homeland and is a thing of beauty, something she needed during that difficult time. Adapting to a new country in a short span is always tough. I can relate to how a single small mishap can make everything seem much worse than it is, leaving you feeling helpless and alone, just like the hibiscus growing beside the highway in the photo. Saeng promised to retake her driver's test when the hibiscus blooms in spring. I truly think the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng as an individual.
1370	10237	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for multiple reasons. Saeng was disheartened after failing her driving test. She found solace in nature after purchasing a plant. Saeng seems to think that when the geese leave and the hibiscus has not started to bud, it is not the right time to take the driver's test. The return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus comfort her, suggesting that nature has a soothing effect on her. The author ended the story this way to show that Saeng is no longer disappointed about failing. She is aware that she will have another chance next year when the geese return and the hibiscus starts to bud. With the comfort provided by nature, she is confident that she can pass the test next year.
1371	10238	4	2	The author concludes the story with a specific paragraph or quote to prompt readers to engage in post - reading contemplation. For instance, it conveys to the reader that the individual will resume plant - growing activities after winter has ended.
1372	10239	4	2	In Minfong Ho's “Winter Hibiscus,” I believe the author includes the given paragraph to showcase Saeng's determination. Saeng struggles to adjust and adapt to her new life. An example is when she returns home with the flower; as the text states, “she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” Saeng bought the flower because it offered her a sense of security, being something familiar from home. I think the author included this paragraph because next year, when taking the test, Saeng will draw on the feelings of security and familiarity from this experience.
1373	10240	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng will not give up. Additionally, it serves as a message to readers that they should never abandon their efforts and should persevere. Even if they need to take a break for studying or re - evaluating their plans, they should keep going.
1374	10241	4	2	When they returned, Saeng silently vowed to herself that in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will retake the test. In the story, the author included this paragraph to show the steps the girl was taking to improve her grades.
1375	10242	4	2	He concludes the paragraph in this way because he implies that he would prefer to retake the test when the outside environment is beautiful. In conclusion, this is the reason I believe the author ends the text with this sentence.
1376	10243	4	2	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus,” author Minfong Ho concludes with the somewhat inspirational sentence, “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.” This sentence is included to instill a sense of hope for the future, which starkly contrasts with the story's depressing nature, thus creating a happy ending. Throughout the story, Saeng is deeply depressed as she was forced to leave her homeland hastily, losing her childhood and beloved grandmother. As she narrates, “A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone.” Her sorrow is further intensified by her frequent crying as she remembers her tragic past. Whether in the greenhouse, recalling moments with her grandmother like “Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s grey hair. Saeng would help knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it,” or in the garden when talking to her mother and planting the flower, her grief is palpable. By inserting a hopeful ending, the author effectively evokes a sense of hope for the future.
1377	10244	4	2	She says that come spring, she will take the test again. She knows that if she fails the test again, her mother will be disappointed because she believes she isn't trying hard enough. Perhaps she fears that they'll never be as close again. The mother thinks she keeps failing the test due to her connection with past experiences, her affection for her new country, and her ability to overcome obstacles. Finally, I think she finds comfort in the memories of her homeland. Overall, her decision to retake the test shows her determination to overcome these challenges and gain her mother's approval.
1378	10245	4	2	The author concludes the story with the given quote primarily to demonstrate that the girl possesses hope. In a story, hope is one of the most valuable qualities a character can have. It piques the reader's interest and contributes to a positive moral for the story. When a character has hope, it makes the narrative more engaging as the reader becomes invested in the character's journey. Moreover, it offers a positive outlook and a lesson that can resonate with the audience. Therefore, by ending the story with this quote, the author effectively uses hope to enhance the story's impact and leave a lasting impression on the reader.
1379	10246	4	2	The author crafted the last paragraph to provide the story with a powerful ending. The central theme is the message of never giving up and persevering through repeated attempts. The author has the character state, “I will take the test again.” Earlier in the story, Saeng admitted, “I failed the test,” but now she refuses to quit. This final paragraph is not only logical but also essential for the story's completeness. Just as people in @LOCATION1 don't give up, Saeng is following suit by retaking the test. This shows that the story's message of perseverance is universal and can be applied in various contexts.
1380	10247	4	2	The author concludes the story with the line “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The intention behind this is to convey to the readers that Saeng is resolutely determined to address what she failed to achieve. Having failed the test on her first attempt, she is eager to overcome this set - back and succeed. By using this ending, the author portrays Saeng as determined, which is crucial as it gives the story a sense of closure and a positive outlook. It shows that despite facing failure, one can have the will to try again and strive for success.
1381	10248	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it extends the story's length and provides a satisfactory ending. However, I am uncertain about its meaning, so it is the author's responsibility to offer an explanation rather than mine.
1382	10249	4	2	The plant held great significance for Saeng as it originated from her homeland. Saeng declared that she would retake her driver's test when the plant blossomed. This plant served as a reminder of her homeland and her roots. It was a source of confidence for Saeng. Despite facing difficult times, the plant remained close to her heart because of its connection to her homeland.
1383	10250	4	2	In my opinion, the author concluded the story with that paragraph to evoke a sense of wonder. I hold this view because when considering the word “test” in context, it can have multiple interpretations. For instance, it could refer to the test of overcoming the sadness of her circumstances. Additionally, it might signify the test of adjusting to her new home when spring arrives. This is why I believe the author aimed to create a sense of wonder with the final paragraph.
1384	10251	4	2	Minfong Ho's “Winter Hibiscus” is a narrative about surmounting adversity. The story concludes with the line “when they come back [the geese] then I will take that test”. The protagonist, Saeng, was encountering difficulties at school. On her way home, she spotted a variety of flowers native to her homeland. “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense it was almost...” The sight of these flowers, especially the hibiscus, made her recall what she had lost and provided solace in the face of those memories. The winter hibiscus could endure despite being away from its native land. Her mother remarked, “It’s flowers aren’t as pretty but it’s strong enough. That’s what...” After hearing this, Saeng resolved to be strong as well and determined to do her best at school, just as the winter hibiscus adapted.
1385	10252	4	2	She made that statement because she had a greater interest in flowers than in a test.
1386	10253	4	2	I am of the opinion that the author concludes with this paragraph as it depicts the conclusion of one thing and the onset of another. After experiencing distress and reflecting on home, she comes to the realization that something novel is occurring, and she must accept it. Consequently, in the spring, she will embark on a new beginning, much like the blossoming of flowers.
1387	10254	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that the character does not wish to rush into matters. Instead, she desires to do what is right and avoid taking the easy way out.
1388	10255	4	2	It illustrates the significance of the Hibiscus to Saeng and her commitment to the flower. Additionally, it indicates that she will await the arrival of next spring to once again admire the flower.
1389	10256	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as she is elaborating on her thoughts and the reason for taking the test. She explains that in the following year, she will determine whether it feels like home to her.
1390	10257	4	2	When the author ended the narrative with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take test again”, it showcases the ability to overcome obstacles, finding solace in a time of disappointment, and her link to past experiences. Firstly, it shows the ability to overcome obstacles as everyone faces obstacles in life, and one has no option but to conquer them as they are endless. Here, the hibiscus flower symbolizes the obstacles, and the weather represents time, as the weather prevents the flower from blooming. Secondly, it represents finding comfort in a time of disappointment because when going through an obstacle, disappointment often lingers. However, she is aware that the hibiscus will return, just as she is aware of the return of obstacles. Finally, it affirms her connection to past experiences as she is in a world she is unfamiliar with, making her feel like an outsider. She captures the sense of being out of place, as the hibiscus flower can be likened to her, being eccentric and different from others in her environment. She is trying to adapt her way of living and survive in this new world, similar to her experience in her own country.
1391	10258	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it represents Saeng's determination and her current situation. Having just arrived in a new country, she has yet to adjust. She was disappointed, described as ""a shaft of the war afternoon starlight,"" where ""war"" indicates her extreme distress. After encountering the flower, she thought of her old country, her homeland, and missed it deeply. She then felt that life was full of hope again. Although she knew she should adapt to the new situation, she was still too unsteady to express her feelings at home. Eventually, she burst into tears once more, missing her homeland greatly. ""Snows"" symbolize the difficult situation she currently faces, but she believes she can overcome it, as life is full of hope. ""Spring"" symbolizes hope for a new life, and Saeng thinks things will improve in the spring and she will succeed. Due to her determination to succeed, the author uses this paragraph as a conclusion, as it symbolizes hope."
1392	10259	4	2	"The author included this part because she believed that since Saeng failed the test, perhaps she deserved a second chance as she had tried so hard previously. When Saeng said, ""Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it,"" it upset her mom. Saeng had spent a large sum on one plant to recreate the feeling of home, as she had a similar one in her old home. Eventually, her mom said, ""It's a beautiful plant"" to console her, feeling remorseful for her earlier behavior towards her daughter. All the experiences Saeng endured are the reasons the author added the last passage to the story."
1393	10260	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that Saeng will persevere until she passes the test. She will keep trying, even until the end of her life. The author is also referring back to the events in the story.
1394	10261	4	2	The author's purpose in this conclusion is that every year when the snow melts and the geese return, she will have to take care of the plant again. This is evident because taking a test is a significant responsibility, and taking care of the plant is also a substantial task, which is analogous to taking the test again. This is what the concluding sentence intends to convey.
1395	10262	4	2	Planting flowers and tending to the garden is @CAPS1's hobby. Without it, she cannot think clearly or be creative. Therefore, waiting for the return of the favorable conditions (presumably related to the garden) will make her happier and enable her to carry out her work.
1396	10263	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for multiple reasons. Firstly, the author indicates that when everything returns to normal, the character will retake the test. Secondly, if the situation does not revert to the desired state, there would be nothing more to say. For example, if one were building a house and a blizzard occurred, they would halt construction and resume only when the weather improved. In conclusion, there are various reasons for the author to end the story with this paragraph.
1397	10264	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"", author Minfong Ho ended the story in this manner to convey the theme of starting over. Saeng's mother contributes to this theme by stating, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty but it's strong enough to make it through the winter. That's what matters."" These words metaphorically represent the family beginning anew in @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 may not be as appealing, but it will endure, which is the crucial aspect. Her words alleviate her daughter's concerns about starting afresh. Additionally, the budding hibiscus can be seen as a symbol of rebirth, as it withers and grows with the seasons. The family is transitioning from a @CAPS1 family to an @CAPS3 family. Even though they ""died"" as a @CAPS1 family, they have not lost their heritage, which is why the author concludes by discussing a flower that is both @CAPS1 and @CAPS3, just like Saeng."
1398	10265	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng will persevere through the winter and attempt to adapt to her new lifestyle. Moving to a new country and culture is extremely challenging, and Saeng has faced difficulties, yet she does not abandon her efforts to build a new life in @LOCATION1. The concluding sentence, ""in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test,"" reflects determination and hope. Throughout the story, Saeng struggled to adapt, and memories of her homeland provided a sense of security. This sentence encapsulates her emotions and demonstrates her strength. Many @CAPS1 individuals might easily give up on their driving test, but Saeng will not. It serves as a happy ending for a somewhat sad story. Moreover, the sentence showcases Saeng's connection to her plant. Just as the hibiscus will survive, so will Saeng. When the hibiscus blooms in the spring, Saeng will also thrive. She will strive to fit in and enjoy her new life. The plant will assist her during this process by reminding her of Vietnam and offering companionship throughout the winter. The author could not have chosen a better conclusion for this story. The conclusion instills a new hope for perseverance and success. As a result, readers experience a sense of pleasure and a positive sentiment towards the story. This conclusion reveals how Saeng is adapting to change and looking forward to enjoying her new life in @LOCATION1."
1399	10266	4	2	"The story follows a girl who, after failing her driving test, breaks down as she reflects on her ""home"" in Vietnam, which she no longer inhabits. After this emotional breakdown, she purchases a plant and gradually comes to accept that she no longer lives in Vietnam and that she failed her driving test. She realizes that she must learn to embrace her new circumstances. She also understands that her opportunity will come, and she will eventually be able to drive. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it represents the culmination of the narrative, where the girl realizes the important aspects of her situation."
1400	10267	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", author Minfong Ho concludes with Saeng silently vowing to herself that she will retake the driver's test. The sight of geese flying in a ""V"" formation and the hibiscus evokes memories of her homeland in Saeng, who deeply misses it. The author aims to convey to the @CAPS1 that Saeng is beginning to feel at home again. The hibiscus serves as a symbol for Saeng, assuring her that everything will be @CAPS2.K. It reminds her that it is acceptable to miss Vietnam while also embracing a new life. Thus, in the spring, Saeng will approach her driver's test with a new attitude and is likely to pass."
1401	10268	4	2	The author employed that paragraph to craft imagery, aiming to evoke a mental picture of the story in the reader's mind. Additionally, the author used this paragraph to convey her emotions.
1402	10269	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph to inform the reader of when Saeng will retake the test and when she will reunite with the plant. This conclusion paragraph offers insights into future events, which is the reason the author included it.
1403	10270	4	2	The author ends the story with the line “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to draw a comparison. As the plant reminds Saeng of home, she will feel more confident to take the test when it buds. When she looked at the flower petals, it was described that “Gently she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least she could hold on to.” This indicates her profound longing for home and her lack of confidence - boosters. The flower provides the confidence she needs to feel at home and even pass her driver's test. Saeng felt out of place in her new environment, and the hibiscus flower gave her motivation and a connection to her old home in the new one. When Saeng thinks, “And that rich sweet scent - that was familiar too,” it shows the flower's sentimental importance to her. Thus, the author ended with that paragraph to show a comparison and highlight the flower's significance in her adaptation.
1404	10271	4	2	In “Winter Hibiscus,” Minfong Ho concludes the story in a way that symbolizes hope. Saeng plans to start anew when the world does. Spring is a time of renewal, when animals emerge from hibernation, trees bloom, and snow melts. Saeng silently vows to try again in spring. She buys the hibiscus to remember her homeland and to know when it's time to re - attempt the test. The hibiscus signals this by budding and blooming. Ho ends the story with the hope of a new beginning. Saeng's vow “Then I will take that test again” and the phrase “That test again” reflects her new positive attitude towards retaking the test.
1405	10272	4	2	It shows how she feels a sense of absence without them by her side. This is evident when the speaker says “when they come back” and “the geese return & this hibiscus is budding.” It reveals her current feelings of loss and how she anticipates feeling when they return. Moreover, when she says “Then I will take that test again,” it shows that she will pick up where she left off. Overall, these statements effectively convey her emotional state and her determination to move forward.
1406	10273	4	2	I believe Minfong Ho's work is quite good. Throughout the story, one experiences a blend of happiness and sadness, all while maintaining a sense of calm. Happiness emerges when the story discusses the plants and when the mother accepts the ones the girl bought. Initially, when it seems the mother will scold the girl for buying the plants after failing her test, one feels sorry for her. However, the overall mood remains calm, showing that the girl doesn't want to give up but rather takes her time. In conclusion, the story effectively evokes a range of emotions while maintaining a sense of tranquility.
1407	10274	4	2	"The author concludes the story with a paragraph stating that the protagonist will retake the test, indicating that this time she aims to pass and won't feel the same as when she failed. The story mentions ""spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" as the time when she'll take the test. This conclusion sets a hopeful tone, suggesting that the protagonist is determined to overcome her previous failure."
1408	10275	4	2	"Saeng silently vowed to herself and her mother. She decided to tell her mother that she had failed the test, knowing her mother might be upset. After that, her mother asked about the plant she had. Saeng said she bought it with some money. She was sad about failing the test, and buying the plant likely made her feel better. I think the author concludes the story this way because it brings hope to Saeng, and she may pass the test. When she said, ""then I will take that test again,"" it could be the plant that made her decide to retake it. In the end, the plant seems to symbolize a new beginning and a source of motivation for Saeng."
1409	10276	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show readers that Saeng is determined to pass her driver's license test. In the story, Saeng failed the test and was sad. However, when she found the flower, she knew she could try again. The flower helped her feel better and gave her the motivation to retake the test. By including this conclusion, the author shows that despite the initial setback, Saeng will eventually pass the test.
1410	10277	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the story ends with Saeng saying, ""when they come back in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author chose this ending to provide a positive outlook. The rest of the story is sad as Saeng misses her home in Vietnam, as seen in her statement, ""It's – it's not a real one. I mean, it's not like the kind we had at – at – she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. Not like the ones we had before."" The ending conveys that despite the differences from her past life, Saeng won't give up on creating a good life in the United States and won't let the change defeat her. This ending leaves the reader with a sense of hope for Saeng's future."
1411	10278	4	2	"The author concludes the story with the given paragraph to convey that the girl, Saeng, will regain her confidence when ""the hibiscus is budding"" and attempt the driving test again. Instead of leaving the reader with the image of the girl watching the geese fly away, the author uses this ending. The girl's disappointment at failing the test evokes sadness in the reader, and the author ends the story in this way to cheer the reader up. When ""the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"", Saeng is reminded of home. Thus, the author ends the story with Saeng regaining confidence and the reader feeling happy."
1412	10279	4	2	"The author concludes the story in this manner because the protagonist is determined to succeed in @LOCATION1. She deeply misses her homeland, including the gardens and her grandparents. For instance, upon entering the flower - shop, she smells the flowers, which brings back memories of home. The scent of a particular flower reminds her of her grandmother's ""long gray hair, freshly washed …"". By stating the last sentence, she indicates that when the hibiscus buds next winter, she will retake the failed test."
1413	10280	4	2	"The author concludes the story with the line ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."" as the girl is resolved to try again and not give up. The girl is distressed as she doesn't have the real flower her mother had. ""It’s - it's not a real one,"" Saeng mumbled, ""I mean, not like the kind we had at - at."" Her distress and fear of her mother's anger make her shake. ""I know,"" her mother said quietly. ""I've seen this kind blooming along the lake."" The author is showing that the girl will attempt the test again next time."
1414	10281	4	2	"The author concludes the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with that paragraph to convey to the reader that Saeng will not give up. Saeng and her family moved from Vietnam, and she has struggled to adapt to the changes. She misses her homeland and the flowers she saw there. She notes that the winter hibiscus here is different from the one in Vietnam, so she plants this type of flower and decides to wait until spring to take the driving test. This shows that Saeng wants to put aside her difficulties for now and deal with them in spring when the weather and atmosphere are more pleasant. She is not giving up but postponing facing the difficulties. This is why the author concluded the story with this paragraph."
1415	10282	4	2	I think the narrator uses that phrase as the last one because the character wants to get another one next year. She wants to experience what it's like to love something so much and take care of it for a while. That's the reason I believe the narrator chose this as the final statement.
1416	10283	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's adaptation to the changes she is experiencing in @LOCATION1. The winter hibiscus assisted her in coping with failing her driving test, and Saeng believes it will bring her luck when she retakes it. Moreover, the hibiscus will survive and develop as she works towards her goal. Once the flower blooms, it will symbolize strength, enabling Saeng to overcome this obstacle. Her mother mentioned that the flower was not as pretty but would survive, implying that @LOCATION1 might not be as great as Vietnam, yet Saeng will remain strong.
1417	10284	4	2	The author's purpose in ending the story this way is to demonstrate how the hibiscus offers Saeng a sense of comfort, in contrast to her state at the story's beginning. Initially, she had very little confidence. Now, she is compelled to call this unfamiliar place home, which drained her motivation until she saw a familiar face that rekindled memories of her happiest times. Having something special to her around constantly makes her feel at home. She found comfort in the hibiscus. As it grows in her garden throughout the seasons, she will also grow, with the reminder of her old home and the good feelings it evoked, along with new memories.
1418	10285	4	2	@PERSON1 proceeds to the top and then traverses over the hill.
1419	10286	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. The author intends to convey that the budding of the hibiscus plant holds symbolic meaning. As Ho states, “Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits.” This moment is significant as it occurs when Saeng has to overcome adverse circumstances, and the dead plant symbolically represents its meaning. Later in the story, Saeng realizes that the seasons have deeper significance. Ho writes, “Through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” She understands that when spring arrives and the plant is healthy and budding, she will be able to succeed and transform into a new person.
1420	10287	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author believes the audience should understand Saeng's feelings. This ending paragraph shows that Saeng will keep attempting to grow her flowers every spring, indicating that Saeng has great potential to fulfill her vow and achieve success.
1421	10288	4	2	This story centers around the themes of overcoming hardships and disappointments, as well as accepting and adapting to life's circumstances. Thus, it is fitting that the story concludes with a goal and a determined attitude. Throughout the reading, Saeng found solace in familiar things, such as flowers and the taste of bitter melon. Amidst her pain and disappointment, these were the only sources of peace for her. It was these elements that gave her the courage to retake her driver's test in the spring. Hence, it seems appropriate that she ends the story with a mention of the hibiscus. The final paragraph also indicates that Saeng is adjusting well to her new country. She states, “when they come back... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return...” Initially, the sounds of geese were foreign to her, but now she has accepted their honking as a normal sound. This implies that she is learning to accept her new country, which serves as a perfect ending for the story.
1422	10289	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner because during winter, she will not be able to see the hibiscus. She is accustomed to going outside to the garden and seeing her beautiful plant. In conclusion, the reason the author ends the story this way is that in winter, she cannot see her plant.
1423	10290	4	2	In the story, Saeng is attempting to come to terms with her new home. I believe the author included this aspect in the story to demonstrate that Saeng has not given up. She will continue to strive to adjust to her new environment. Although Saeng desires to adapt, she misses her old home deeply. This is why she is waiting until spring to make another attempt. Ultimately, her perseverance shows that she has the will to overcome the challenges of settling into a new place.
1424	10291	4	2	The author concludes the story in such a way to leave the reader in a state of speculation. The statement implies that the character is determined to live up to her past and overcome difficulties. The paragraph makes the reader wonder whether she managed to get through the challenges in the following year. The author describes the melting snow and the return of geese as symbols of change, which is precisely what the character hopes to achieve. By doing so, the author aims to show that the character can transform and grow, much like a plant. This open - ended conclusion effectively engages the reader's imagination.
1425	10292	4	2	The author concludes the story with the line “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author writes this because when the flower starts budding, Saeng will feel ready to take the test, as she is likened to a flower. The author uses this conclusion because when the flower buds and the geese return, Saeng will feel as if she is back home. In essence, the author's choice of this conclusion effectively ties together the themes of hope, renewal, and the character's journey of self - discovery.
1426	10293	4	2	"In the winter, a teenage girl named Saeng fails her driver's test. After the failure, she encounters a winter hibiscus, which triggers a flood of memories. The author concludes the story by depicting Saeng's intention to retake the test when the geese return and the hibiscus buds, a scenario that conveys a sense of comfort and familiarity. When the speaker states, ""almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become,"" it reveals that Saeng had lost touch with the authenticity of nature, and reconnecting with it might be the key to her passing the test. The author creates an impatient mood for the reader since it takes until winter for Saeng to make this discovery. Winter is a late stage, as the geese have left and the flower has closed. However, when spring arrives, both nature and Saeng will be open to new opportunities, with the familiar surroundings providing support."
1427	10294	4	2	I believe she ended the story with this statement because she's uncertain if she'll pass the test, yet she refuses to give up. She plans to attempt the test again when her flower regrows. Currently, she's feeling down, and the plant has helped lift her spirits. So, when she sees the plant next year, she wants to take the test as the plant is like a symbol of good luck. I think she concluded with this paragraph to convey the message that one shouldn't give up during tough times and should keep trying.
1428	10295	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. Firstly, it allows the reader to envision how the story might continue. For instance, when the author writes, ""then I will take that test again,"" it piques the reader's curiosity about the subsequent events. Secondly, it provides the reader with a final positive image that can alter their perception of the story. An example is the statement, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" These are the reasons why the author chooses to conclude the story with this paragraph."
1429	10296	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way because Saeng decides to retake the test when the snow melts, the plant buds, and the geese return. This approach gives her a clear time frame to consider when she will make another attempt at the test. When these natural phenomena occur, Saeng will also return to face the test once more, indicating a cycle of renewal and opportunity.
1430	10297	4	2	"In the story, Saeng silently vows to herself, ""When the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again."" For some reason, I think this is an excellent vow that Saeng has made. It shows her determination and her connection to the natural cycle, using the changing seasons as a source of motivation and hope for a better outcome."
1431	10298	4	2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” likely chose to conclude the story in such a manner as it ends on a hopeful note. It also demonstrates how Saeng is adapting to her environment, much like the winter hibiscus. In the second - last paragraph, Saeng hears the honks of the geese, and it is noted that their sound has become familiar to her over time. Saeng probably vowed to retake the test when the geese returned because this time would allow her to grow and adapt further. The hibiscus will be budding then, a sign that it overcame its obstacles and successfully adapted. If the hibiscus could adapt, Saeng could too, and she could draw inspiration from the plant. This sense of hope for Saeng and her future is left in the last paragraph, which is the reason the story ends there.
1432	10299	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because seasons change, and plants typically do not grow during winter. One should learn a lesson from this and accept it, waiting until the right time to learn essentially the same lesson. When the appropriate moment arrives, the knowledge can be reapplied, and the cycle of learning continues.
1433	10300	4	2	In my opinion, “Winter Hibiscus” is a great story. The author added the paragraph at the end because the main theme is about working hard. This is evident as it states at the very end, “I will take the test again.” The message is that one should not give up when faced with failure but instead work hard, get back up, and try again. This positive and inspiring message is what makes the story so impactful.
1434	10301	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the overall meaning of the narrative. Additionally, the paragraph is included because it likely contains the moral of the story. It may also provide insights or details about certain events in the story that the reader might not have previously known. By ending with this paragraph, the author ensures that the key points of the story are effectively communicated.
1435	10302	4	2	The story has a somewhat sad undertone. The girl misses her homeland and is also dejected because she failed her driving test. I believe the author ends the story with the girl stating that she will take the test again to show that despite her sadness over her country and the test failure, she will not give up. Failing a test, especially a driving test, is extremely disappointing as one is so eager to pass. The author aims to illustrate that the girl will persevere until she finally passes. Moreover, the author probably wanted to end on a more positive note, as leaving a story sad with no solution is not ideal. There are multiple reasons for the author's choice of ending, but these are the most obvious ones.
1436	10303	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the ending phrase serves to illustrate that Saeng has set goals. Firstly, she aims to adapt to the new land. This is evident from her statement about their return in spring, indicating her determination not to give up and her efforts to adjust to her new life. It also showcases her tenacity as she plans to continue pursuing her license, stating, ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This shows her resolve to try once more. Additionally, it reveals her courage to persevere and not abandon her goals."
1437	10304	4	2	Saeng was waiting for spring so she could retake the test. I think she was worried about it during spring because she went to watch the geese fly in a U - shape and saw the plants growing, but the snow hadn't melted yet. She started talking to herself about it as she wanted to take the test in spring. She hopes to pass it this time because she doesn't like taking the test repeatedly. Once everyone moves on to different things after the test is over, she'll finally put this behind her if she succeeds.
1438	10305	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the main character, Saeng, who moved to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam with her family, returned home after failing her driver's test. For Saeng, this failure symbolizes her inability to adapt to her family's new lifestyle, leading her to feel that she disappointed both her mother and herself. On her way home, she bought a flower that her family also had in Vietnam to console her mother. As her mother began to plant the winter hibiscus, Saeng felt that her mother had forgiven her for the test failure. Subsequently, she realized that she had adapted to her surroundings, just as she believed the flower would. This realization motivated her to promise to retake the driver's test in the spring. By ending the story with Saeng's promise, the author, Minfong, ensured that the most crucial takeaway for the reader is Saeng's resilience. Her promise demonstrates her courage and perseverance in the face of adversity."
1439	10306	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to emphasize that the character is not giving up. She will take the test again, and just as the plant will grow again on @DATE1, she will persevere in her efforts. This ending shows that despite setbacks, there is hope for growth and success in the future.
1440	10307	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is learning to adapt to the United States. Earlier in the story, she failed the test and felt she hadn't impressed her mom. Both Saeng and her mom, accustomed to life in Vietnam, are trying to adjust. Saeng initially thought the hibiscus she got was similar to the one at home. By the end, she realizes that with faith, everything will be @CAPS1 and it will feel like home. She mentions spring because by then, the hibiscus will be fully grown, and she will retake the test to see if it's like the one her mother expected. Overall, Saeng is gradually learning to adapt to her new country.
1441	10308	4	2	The author concludes the text with that paragraph as it both expresses and sustains the themes of perseverance and adaptation to change. The conclusion revisits the “test”. Based on the reading, it can be inferred that the test the author mentions is Saeng's confrontation with memories of her home without succumbing to the pain of loss. Earlier in the story, Saeng claims to have “failed the test” as she broke down in tears upon seeing the familiar plants from her former home. By ending with the paragraph stating that she will take the test again, it indicates that Saeng will persist in her efforts to adapt to her new home and find peace there, rather than being overwhelmed by the loss of her old one. This showcases the theme of perseverance as she is willing to retake the test and attempt to overcome her sorrow.
1442	10309	4	2	The girl is determined to win. She went and took a test related to a flower but did not pass. Returning sad and emotional, she told her grandmother that these flowers were not like the ones at home. She struggled to say “at home” because it was too painful. Her grandmother agreed that they were not like the real ones. This shows that the girl is facing a difficult situation where the new flowers don't match her memories of home, yet her determination to win suggests she may keep trying.
1443	10310	4	2	In Minfong Ho's story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author concludes with the line, “When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” At the start of the story, Saeng was less confident and failed the test. However, a single flower has given her hope. Consequently, when she takes the test next time, she will be better prepared. This progression in Saeng's character shows her growth and the potential for a more successful outcome in the future.
1444	10311	4	2	The author concludes the essay in the way he does as it effectively ties together all the scattered ideas. For instance, there is a statement where a person says, “She silently vowed to herself that in the spring after the snow melts, she would retake that test.” This conclusion helps to bring coherence to the overall narrative and gives a sense of direction and purpose to the story.
1445	10312	4	2	I believe the author ended the story with that sentence because during winter, all or most plants die. In spring, they have to start growing anew. This cycle of death and rebirth in plants can be symbolic in the story, perhaps representing a new beginning or a chance for the characters to overcome challenges. By ending with this connection to the plant's growth cycle, the author adds depth and meaning to the story's conclusion.
1446	10313	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to demonstrate that Saeng will be committed to hibiscus gardening. Once she proves herself, she will have passed the test. Additionally, it shows that she wishes for her heritage to be a significant part of her life by cultivating the flower of her nation.
1447	10314	4	2	"The author ends the story with this quote as it showcases Saeng's determination to pass her driving test. In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", after failing her driving test, Saeng says, ""Let's plant, right now"" to forget about her failure and focus on something positive. This exemplifies her determination and focus. In conclusion, this is the reason the author ends with this quote, highlighting Saeng's resolve to pass her driving test."
1448	10315	4	2	The author concluded the story in this way to leave a sense of hope. Saeng had experienced hurt and disappointment after failing her driving test. However, in the end, she demonstrated that she would not quit in this new country. Instead, she would move forward and make the most of her circumstances, showing that despite the setback, there was hope for her future.
1449	10316	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is determined to complete and pass the test. Firstly, she failed this year and wants to succeed next year. Secondly, she is comparing the hibiscus to her performance and perseverance on the test. In conclusion, these reasons explain why the author ends the story with this paragraph.
1450	10317	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng intends to try and keep her next plant. She decides to take the test again because she sold the previous plant. Saeng had seen the plant as a child, which is why she was so attached to it. Ultimately, the author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize that Saeng will make an effort to keep her next plant.
1451	10318	4	2	In the conclusion of the text, the author conveys that after a certain period, one can return and attempt something anew. For Saeng, a change in the weather might bring about a different outcome. She seems to draw a parallel between herself and the plant; just as the flower will grow stronger in spring, she believes she will pass the test the next time around when the geese return and the hibiscus begins to bud. This also indicates her appreciation for nature, as evidenced by her willingness to wait until spring, when the snow melts. Overall, the story's conclusion suggests that Saeng has an affinity for nature, as demonstrated by her mention of the hibiscus.
1452	10319	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" a girl named Saeng is attempting to adjust to life in a new location after coming from Vietnam. She is sorrowful and misses her homeland, especially after failing her driver's test. While walking past a store, she recognizes a plant from home, purchases it, and takes it home in a pot. She reminisces about home and the wonderful memories associated with the plant. Her mother then joins her, sharing the moment. Saeng feels better afterward. In the final sentence, the author includes Saeng's silent vow: ""In the spring when the snows melt… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The flower has instilled in her the confidence to succeed, and she is eager to retake the test. This illustrates the connection she has with her home and the flowers. She aims to overcome her sadness and move forward, not discarding her memories but leaving behind the pain."
1453	10320	4	2	"In my view, the author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" chose to conclude the story in this manner to showcase the comfort the hibiscus offered, enabling Saeng to move forward. The greenhouse served as a place for her to express her homesickness, as described in the text: ""And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept."" After returning home, she was confronted with the reality of her test failure once again. I believe that this failure brought to the surface her feelings of inadequacy in adjusting to her new home. However, when the geese fly by, the author brings the story to a close to demonstrate how this experience has led to Saeng's growth. As Saeng silently vows, ""When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again."" I think the author intended to show that through the events in the story, Saeng was able to overcome her apprehensions about her new home."
1454	10321	4	2	"I firmly believe that the author concluded the story with this statement because it appears to signify a fresh start for Saeng in the spring. She mentions that when the hibiscus starts to bud, the snow has melted, and spring has arrived, that's when she'll retake the test. To me, it's as if when the hibiscus ""comes back to life,"" it represents a second - chance opportunity, and Saeng deserves one too. When the world brightens up and things start looking promising again, she'll feel more confident about retaking the test. I think the way the author ended the story is excellent. One just needs to delve deeper and understand the underlying message. Essentially, Saeng is stating that once everything ""comes back to life,"" she'll feel more assured of passing the test the next time. Now, she has the time to prepare."
1455	10322	4	2	"There are multiple reasons why the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph. Firstly, it is evident that she has a fondness for the hibiscus flower. This can be inferred from the text where it states, ""When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently."" Secondly, the hibiscus is aesthetically pleasing. Her description, ""It was like walking into another world,"" attests to its beauty. Lastly, she appreciates the presence of the hibiscus. As she describes, ""Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of ferns, and fronds of various shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion."" These reasons collectively explain why the author ended the story with that paragraph."
1456	10323	4	2	The author of the story made a wise decision by ending it with the statement that the girl, Saeng, will retake the driving test in spring when everything blooms. Saeng had just failed her driving test and was not ready to take it again immediately. The blooming of the hibiscus symbolizes both her past life in her old home and a new beginning. It provides her with the confidence to pass the test and makes her eager for a fresh start in the new year. The quote “Spring is when the snows melt and geese return” implies that just as the snow melts and the geese come back home, Saeng wants to feel at ease and comfortable in her new environment. By ending the story this way, the author instills hope and motivation in Saeng to pursue her goals. This ending was a smart choice as it leaves the reader with a positive outlook on Saeng's future.
1457	10324	4	2	As the author reveals to the audience, the hibiscus is a beautiful flower that represents the memories of a young girl named Saeng who failed a test and was deeply depressed about it. The flower serves as a symbol of encouragement for Saeng during her most difficult time, offering comfort in a fragrant and meaningful way. Saeng vows to overcome her sad memories and prove that she can pass the test. After moving to a different country where she has to adapt to a new environment with limited capacity, it is logical that her adjustment is not immediate. The author's message is to motivate those facing problems in life not to give up. Instead, one should keep working hard until achieving their goals. In conclusion, working hard and not giving up are integral parts of life, and it is up to us to overcome failure.
1458	10325	4	2	In the story, the author concludes with the sentence “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I believe the author ends the story this way because Saeng has accepted her failure but is determined to try again to achieve her goal of passing the test. By making a vow to herself, she shows her commitment not to give up. This ending effectively portrays Saeng's resilience and hope for the future, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism about her ability to succeed.
1459	10326	4	2	The author combines the story with the paragraph because they are thematically related. Both are about the comings and goings of things, the changing of seasons. There is a sense of reluctance to let go, but also the understanding that things will return soon. This connection between the story and the paragraph adds depth and coherence to the overall narrative. By bringing them together, the author creates a more powerful and resonant ending that leaves a lasting impression on the reader.
1460	10327	4	2	In the concluding paragraph, the author expresses hope for Saeng's future. Despite failing her driver's test and struggling to adjust to a new environment, Saeng finds comfort in a hibiscus. The description “it felt smooth and cool with a hint of velvet toward the center - just as she had known it would feel” shows that the memory of this “old friend” lifts her spirits after a disappointment. It was evident that Saeng was uncomfortable in her new surroundings, which her mother noticed when she saw the tear - stains on Saeng's cheeks and her puffy eyes. Even though her mother had spent a lot of money on a single flower, she understood her daughter's struggle. Throughout the story, there was a negative attitude, but when Saeng saw the geese and planted her “winter” hibiscus, she realized that what was once strange had become familiar. Saeng finally understands that with the memory of home, she can achieve her goals and find stability outside of her original home. The author illustrates that success can emerge from failure.
1461	10328	4	2	The author concluded the story within the paragraph. She does not want Saeng to claim the entire quiet room for herself while taking the test.
1462	10329	4	2	She's saying that right now isn't the right time to take the test. She'll wait until spring, when the flowers are blooming. She's really into those exotic flowers. She can't stand to take the test when the time isn't right, so she'll wait until it is.
1463	10330	4	2	Saeng plans to take the test in spring when it's warmer. She loves it when the hibiscus is budding as they smell wonderful. The pleasant smell reminds her of her native country. She also likes fried melon, which leaves a golden after - taste on the tongue. She'd choose it over a Big Mac.
1464	10331	4	2	There are many reasons why the author ends the story with this paragraph.
1465	10332	4	2	"The author included the concluding paragraph because the hibiscus represents ""comfort in her time of discomfort"" for Saeng. She may feel more at ease when the hibiscus is budding as she misses her homeland, and the hibiscus serves as a reminder. She failed the test the first time because she was not comfortable in a new place. However, when spring arrives and the hibiscus is budding, she will be more confident and comfortable."
1466	10333	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as earlier in the story, Saeng discussed her test failure and her desire to retake it. Saeng declared that next year, when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, she will take the test again.
1467	10334	4	2	"The author concludes the paragraph to show that Saeng will wait for things to grow back and try again for her test. The hibiscus holds great significance for her, and she will keep trying as she doesn't want to disappoint her mother again. An example of Saeng's shame is when ""her mother stared at her incredulously. But how could you?"" Saeng aims not to let herself or her mother down. ""Saeng vowed silently to herself,"" promising to pass the test and respect nature and elders."
1468	10335	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with the paragraph: ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" The author ends the story this way as it creates a cliffhanger. In the story, Saeng is upset about failing her driving test. She has just moved from Vietnam to the United States and is a bit homesick. She sees a familiar plant, buys it for nineteen dollars as it cheers her up, reminding her of the plants in Vietnam. By ending the story like this, we know Saeng hasn't given up and will try to pass the driver's license test again. However, we don't know the outcome of whether she passes or not, making it a cliffhanger. This is why the author ended the story in this manner."
1469	10336	4	2	"Saeng has suffered a tragic family loss and moved to a completely different world. The paragraph symbolizes a fresh start and a new beginning. ""The snows melting"" and ""hibiscus budding"" both represent new life. Saeng is going to adopt a positive outlook on life and accept her situation to make the best of it. The author's statement ""the winter hibiscus was in the ground now"" parallels Saeng's new - found outlook on life. Like the flower, a seed of hope has been planted in Saeng, and she is now ready to thrive."
1470	10337	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by [ORGANIZATION1], the author is highly sentimental about the hibiscus plant as it strongly reminds her of home. The author concludes the story with that statement because it gives the character a goal. She failed once in getting a job, but in [MONTH1] she believes the hibiscus is good luck, so she sets a goal for when to try for the job again. When she saw the plant, happy memories came back to her. In conclusion, certain things can evoke memories, and it's the good memories that make life worth waiting for and hopeful."
1471	10338	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner for several reasons. Firstly, it indicates that the protagonist is beginning to embrace her new life. The open - ended nature of the ending serves multiple purposes. It shows her growing fondness for the new life as evidenced by the statement “She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become… almost familiar now”. This realization occurs when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not as bad as she initially thought. The mention of geese is significant and is referred back to when she vows to take the test. Additionally, it highlights the importance of the hibiscus she just planted to her. Secondly, it leaves room for the reader to envision future outcomes. Although the reader doesn't know if she will pass the test next time, the way she vows to take it gives the impression that she will succeed. Thus, the author ends the story this way to convey the protagonist's feelings about her new life and to allow readers to draw their own conclusions.
1472	10339	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story where the protagonist fails the driving test and then adds that she is going to retake it. The plant she discovered could potentially bring her good luck. After the snow melts and the geese return, it symbolizes a fresh start. It would be a positive turn of events, especially after her discovery of the plant. This conclusion gives hope for a better outcome in the future.
1473	10340	4	2	The author concludes the paragraph in this way because the protagonist wants to make another attempt. The author implies that the hibiscus the protagonist planted on @DATE1 previously did not thrive, and she is now trying again on @DATE1 to grow a hibiscus plant. If she is successful in growing the plant in the spring, it is suggested that she will also pass the test. This is the reason why the author concludes with this particular paragraph, tying together the success of the plant and the test.
1474	10341	4	2	He concludes that when spring arrives, the protagonist will take the test again. This second attempt provides her with another opportunity to pass the test. By taking the test once more, she gets a chance to achieve the right result, rectifying any previous mistakes. This conclusion offers a sense of hope and a new beginning for the protagonist.
1475	10342	4	2	She is going to take the test again @CAPS1 as she feels it is necessary. When the snow melts and the geese return, which indicates the arrival of spring, she wants to take the test. This shows her determination and the symbolic connection she makes between the changing of the seasons and her chance to succeed in the test. Her decision to take the test in spring reflects her hope for a better outcome.
1476	10343	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author presents the line “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” It is my opinion that the recollection of her home will aid Saeng in taking the test. She utilizes the geese and the plant to evoke memories of home, and the presence of these familiar elements makes her feel at ease. This connection to home gives her the comfort and strength needed to face the test once more.
1477	10344	4	2	Just as the hibiscus flower endures the winter, Saeng desires to exhibit the same resilience. Saeng failed a test, which has left her feeling a sense of failure. Despite the challenges she is currently facing, she is determined to persevere. When Saeng utters “I – I failed the test,” it is evident that she is disappointed, as she did not anticipate this outcome given her fighting spirit. The author concludes the passage with Saeng stating “When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This showcases Saeng's tenacity and her resolve to succeed even under difficult circumstances.
1478	10345	4	2	The author places this paragraph at the end to illustrate that Saeng is seeking a fresh start in life. She now has a source of hope to carry her through the upcoming year. She eagerly awaits the return of winter to witness the hibiscus flower bloom once more, and she anticipates many more such blooms in the future. This newfound hope provides Saeng with the motivation and strength to face the challenges ahead.
1479	10346	4	2	In Minfong Ho's “Winter Hibiscus,” I firmly believe the author concludes the story in this manner to demonstrate that despite Saeng's test failure, she will attempt it again in the future. The return of the geese symbolizes this future opportunity. Saeng is sorrowful as she misses her homeland, and the sight of certain plants triggers nostalgic memories. To soothe her longing and remind her of home, she purchases a winter hibiscus. This gesture shows that she is using the familiar to find comfort in a new and perhaps unfamiliar environment.
1480	10347	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of her love for the garden. The story revolves around the characters and their garden, and as the weather turns cold, they are left with little to do until spring. As the text states “In spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” it suggests that the characters have deep - seated feelings for their gardening activities. Saeng wants to take the test to overcome the challenges and prove that she can effectively care for her garden. This conclusion ties together the themes of perseverance and love for the garden in the story.
1481	10348	4	2	At this moment, she resolved to retake the test. She understood that the blooming and withering of flowers were cyclical, but her academic grades were a one - time opportunity. However, she preferred gardening over doing schoolwork.
1482	10349	4	2	The author concludes the story with the given paragraph for two main reasons. Firstly, the winter hibiscus instilled some hope in her. Secondly, her mother was understanding about her test failure. These factors led the author to end the story with that particular paragraph.
1483	10350	4	2	The author concludes the story with an optimistic outlook and hope for the future. She ends the narrative with the line “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” By concluding in this manner, it showcases the hope that the hibiscus plant brought to her after failing the driver's test. The hibiscus also helped Saeng get one step closer to adapting to her new home. As the story states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, were almost familiar to her now.” The way the author ends the story inspires a new beginning and a new season.
1484	10351	4	2	In Minfong Ho's story, @ORGANIZATION1, a girl named Saeng struggles to adjust to a new country. It seems nearly impossible for her. She is stressed about failing the driver's test and realizes that almost everything is different from what she is used to. However, she quickly recognizes one thing: a plant called the “Winter Hibiscus.” This plant makes her think of her old life in Vietnam. It helps her endure difficult times, and she refuses to give up. This is precisely why Minfong Ho ends the last paragraph by stating that Saeng will retry the driving test when the hibiscus is budding. The flower evokes a sense of home in Vietnam for her, motivating her to keep trying. Additionally, the author ends the story this way to convey a theme: “No matter how difficult something may be, you can overcome it. You just have to find the most beneficial way.”
1485	10352	4	2	The author returns to that paragraph because in the story, Saeng is extremely remorseful about not @CAPS1 the test. Now, she is determined to make amends. She vows to herself that she will @CAPS1 the test. Just as when one says they are going to get something done, they should do whatever it takes and not give up when faced with difficulties, @CAPS3. The main idea of the story is to make up for the test and @CAPS1 it, to complete what needs to be done.
1486	10353	4	2	The author includes this story within the paragraph as it continues to discuss Saeng. It portrays her as having a free - spirited mind, much like a trapped butterfly that breaks free. The relationship between Saeng and her mom, as well as the experiences of a teenage girl like me that parallel Saeng's, are the reasons for this inclusion.
1487	10354	4	2	In Minfong Ho's “Winter Hibiscus,” I firmly believe the ending paragraph serves to illustrate that Saeng has not given up. When she says, “When they come back…then I will take that test again,” referring to the hibiscus and the geese which remind her of home, it shows her determination. These reminders of home give her the strength and power to face the test. This clearly demonstrates that despite her failure, she will persevere and try again. In my view, this is precisely the purpose of the paragraph, to show Saeng's unwavering resolve.
1488	10355	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to convey to the reader that after the snow melts, the author intends to plant more plants. The test is to ensure that these plants survive the period around @DATE1. This conclusion ties together the author's plans for plant - growing and the challenge of plant survival.
1489	10356	4	2	In “Winter Hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho, the author shows that Saeng finds happiness and peace around the plant as it evokes childhood memories. For instance, when she mentions “And that rich sweet scent, that was familiar ton,” it's evident she loves the way the plant makes her feel. When a leaf falls and she inhales its scent, it reminds her of her grandmother. It's possible that @CAPS1 had a similar experience. I think @CAPS1 wrote this story because it can resonate with those who have moved from another country and have something that triggers memories. Just as touching or smelling a sweater brings back memories of my grandmother, @CAPS1's personal experience likely inspired this relatable story.
1490	10357	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that some people make silent vows because they are reluctant to express themselves. Perhaps they are also distrustful of others and even themselves. I once experienced this. There was a day when I didn't want to talk to anyone. All I wanted was to sit in my dark room and think about my life and what would happen after death. I wondered if I'd be reborn or if my soul would roam the earth. But then I realized I was young and had a great life ahead. I decided that I'd deal with those thoughts when the time came. So, I started communicating with people again. This personal experience helps me understand why the author might have ended the story this way.
1491	10358	4	2	The author concludes the story with this statement to convey the character's determination. The author aims to express the message of persevering through difficulties and trying again. The character refuses to give up and will overcome the challenging test.
1492	10359	4	2	The author discusses gardening and her aspiration to improve her skills in the spring. Presumably, she believes she is not proficient at gardening because her mother is highly skilled, and she desires to reach the same level of expertise.
1493	10360	4	2	The purpose is to enable the reader to understand Saeng's feelings about gardening. She prays for spring to arrive so she can garden again. She enjoys watching plants grow into edible produce. This is why the author concluded the story with this paragraph.
1494	10361	4	2	The author concludes the story with the last paragraph to convey determination and hope. The geese and the hibiscus symbolize Saeng's determination as they always return regardless of circumstances. Just as the geese come back, Saeng will retake the driver's test. The hibiscus also represents her as it has faced adversity, being moved to new places and having new homes, similar to Saeng, and will endure a harsh winter soon. However, it always manages to return and bloom in spring, which is what Saeng hopes to achieve by taking the driver's test. The author included this paragraph to show the symbolism among Saeng, the geese, and the hibiscus, thus concluding the story in this way.
1495	10362	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as they are essentially saying that everything happens for a reason, and that reason may be related to the seasons. The character believes she would perform better on her test in the spring simply because everything flourishes during that season.
1496	10363	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it demonstrates that the protagonist can overcome obstacles despite having moved from her homeland. Moreover, it shows that she has gained more confidence, which is why the author chose to end the story with this paragraph.
1497	10364	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because it reflects that regardless of what happens in her life, Saeng will retake the test. In the story, it mentions that one of the blossoms had fallen off, and Saeng carefully picked it up and smelled it. This makes me think that they take good care of their garden and try to keep it alive during winter. That's my take on the last paragraph.
1498	10365	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it essentially summarizes the entire story. The phrase “When the snow melts and the geese return” harks back to the beginning of the story when Saeng started planting. This is the reason the author chose this conclusion for the story.
1499	10366	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. Firstly, the test is significant to Saeng as it allows her to prove to herself that she can pass it. Ending with this paragraph also creates suspense for the reader regarding whether Saeng will pass or even take the test again. Lastly, this paragraph reveals Saeng's personality traits, showing that she is persistent, determined, and strong - willed.
1500	10367	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” at the end, the author writes “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, In the spring, when the snow melt and geese return and this hibiscus Is budding, then I will take the test again.” The author does this to convey to readers that if you fall once, there's no harm in getting back up and trying again. Saeng promises to take the driver's test in spring when the birds aren't flying south. After failing the driver's test, Saeng buys a flower at a florist that reminds her of Vietnam, takes it home, and puts it in the garden. When she tells her mother she failed, her mother is understanding and says maybe next time. In conclusion, the author writes the last paragraph as a moral to never give up and keep striving until you achieve your life goals.
1501	10368	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to maintain an air of mystery, leaving readers in a state of curiosity. It is believed that the ending is crafted to imply the character's return, fully prepared for all challenges, including the test. By leaving readers wondering, the author entices them to engage further when the character returns, eager to learn about the events upon her return and the outcome of the test. The vow was made privately, as failing would have disappointed others. This is the rationale behind the author's choice of ending the story.
1502	10369	4	2	The author concludes the story this way as she indicates that the character will be present the following year to retake the test. She expresses the character's desire to witness the growth of plants, particularly the hibiscus. Due to her deep appreciation and love for nature, she wishes to be around to see them thrive. In conclusion, this ending reflects the character's connection to nature and her anticipation for the future.
1503	10370	4	2	The author concludes the story with the final paragraph to emphasize the sentimental value and significance of the plant to Saeng. Saeng will retake the test after winter because the cold is unsuitable for common hibiscus to survive; a winter - hardy variety is needed, as stated in the text. This demonstrates the importance of her finding a hibiscus similar to those from her home. Throughout the story, Saeng shows self - disappointment, but in the last paragraph, she displays courage and determination. Overall, the ending effectively portrays Saeng's emotional journey and her connection to the hibiscus.
1504	10371	4	2	Saeng silently vows that when they return in spring, with the melting snow, the return of geese, and the budding of the hibiscus, she will retake the test. The author concludes the story in a way that prompts readers to ask questions, similar to the modernist approach in “@CAPS1’s @ORGANIZATION1”. In that work, the main character @PERSON1 runs away, leaving only the sound of a slamming door. Similarly, in this story, there are many questions: What test is Saeng referring to? Is she planning to make new friends? Is this a personal resolution? This ending leaves readers craving more of the story, potentially leading them to reread it. In conclusion, the author's ending effectively engages the readers' curiosity.
1505	10372	4	2	“Winter Hibiscus” is a somewhat sad yet hopeful story rich in symbolism. The author concludes the story with a confident ending that satisfies the reader. There are two main reasons for this conclusion. Firstly, it imparts a hopeful tone. Saeng's silent vow gives the ending a positive outlook. After a difficult day, the author ensures she has a goal to look forward to, revealing Saeng's strength. Secondly, it relates the objects she sees to spring. The geese symbolize her new home, and the hibiscus represents her old home. By linking these symbols, the author allows readers to associate them with spring. Overall, the author's conclusion is masterfully done, presenting a hopeful tone and spring - related symbols, ending confidently and leaving the reader content.
1506	10373	4	2	I believe the author concludes the text with this paragraph to convey a message of perseverance. For instance, the author aims to show that one should never give up, regardless of failure. This is the reason why the text ends in such a manner.
1507	10374	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to effectively convey her point and foster an understanding of the passage's complexities. She intended for the reader to deeply experience her message, as if they were present to witness the events. By doing so, the author hoped to leave a lasting impression on the audience.
1508	10375	4	2	The author concluded the story with the given sentence to illustrate that after Saeng found the flower, she gained new hope and a reason to pass the test. The flower served as a source of inspiration, making her reminisce about her home in Vietnam. She was initially too nervous to articulate her feelings about home. When Saeng brought the plant to her new home and planted it in the garden, it was like bringing a piece of Vietnam with her, which comforted her. The overall inspiration and memories associated with the flower made Saeng more at ease in her new home and gave her a reason to start afresh with her driving test.
1509	10376	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that when spring arrives, the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud after winter, she will resume gardening. This conclusion suggests a cycle of renewal and the anticipation of new beginnings.
1510	10377	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the story with the line, ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This creates a mood where Saeng is accepting the changes in her life. Just as nature adapts to climate and location changes, Saeng seems to appreciate her situation and decides to view it positively rather than negatively. Through the main character, Saeng, the author is advocating that when one encounters difficulties, they should try again."
1511	10378	4	2	I am of the opinion that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for numerous reasons. Firstly, the author might conclude the story this way as the protagonist might attempt it again. Secondly, the author perhaps intended to convey that the protagonist wanted to make her mother proud. Thirdly, the protagonist likely felt that she had disappointed herself. In conclusion, when one makes a mistake, trying again may lead to much better results.
1512	10379	4	2	"Minfong Ho ended ""Winter Hibiscus"" with the lines ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" to illustrate that there is always hope for a better future. Saeng became sorrowful as she recalled her home in Vietnam. She yearned for the familiarity of her native land. The memories she missed pained her deeply as she was now far away in a different world. However, the author began to drop hints that Saeng would be accepted in the new place and rediscover some childhood memories there. ""Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and - yes - familiar to Saeng now."" Saeng was already growing accustomed to her surroundings. The hibiscus would preserve her culture, traditions, and memories, while the geese would make her feel happy and at home. By keeping her culture alive through memories, she would lead a successful life and pass her test. This is why Minfong Ho ended ""Winter Hibiscus"" with that particular paragraph."
1513	10380	4	2	"The author concludes the story in ""Winter Hibiscus"" in an interesting way. The concluding sentence ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" effectively concludes the whole story and ties in the characters. The title's element is present in the concluding sentence, which gives it a sense of closure."
1514	10381	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it indicates that the narrator is prepared. The narrator took the driving test once and failed. To lift her spirits, she bought a flower. After a conversation with her mother, she felt better. She became determined to pass the driving test, just as the flower was determined to survive. This determination is what the author wanted to convey through the conclusion.
1515	10382	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it symbolizes Saeng's transformation and other aspects. The snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds when the seasons change. Similarly, Saeng will attempt again when the seasons change, but she will be a different person. Realizing that everything changes on the surface but remains the same at the core, Saeng decides to change too. After seeing the hibiscus and reminiscing about her past, she has developed a greater appreciation for her culture. This is why the author chose to end the story with this paragraph.
1516	10383	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This indicates that Saeng will retake the test, being well - prepared and likely to pass. The author uses this paragraph to end the story as it shows that Saeng has the faith to take the test once more and aims to make her mother proud by passing it. This is the reason for the author's choice of conclusion.
1517	10384	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because spring brings warmer weather and a more enjoyable atmosphere. Moreover, she has the winter to study for the spring test. Additionally, as stated in the story, it aligns with the conclusion where she finally understands what has been going on, and she connects this understanding to the behavior of the geese. This is why the author uses this paragraph to end the story.
1518	10385	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it is what she solemnly promised herself. This self - commitment serves as a fitting end to the story, as it shows the character's resolve and determination. By concluding in this way, the author effectively wraps up the narrative, highlighting the character's inner strength and sense of purpose.
1519	10386	4	2	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The purpose is to demonstrate how the hibiscus and other plants in the store symbolize Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she is overwhelmed by memories of living in Vietnam that she had forgotten. The plants draw her back into her childhood world. She associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees a familiar plant in a pot, she remarks on how strange it is to be confined, which symbolizes how she feels out of her home in Vietnam. At home, she was free - spirited, but abroad, she feels caged. The hibiscus plant, according to her mother, is strong enough to survive the cold months. Saeng identifies with this description. She decides that when the hibiscus has overcome the difficult times and budded, she too will be ready to achieve her goal. Thus, the author's conclusion effectively ties together these symbolic elements.
1520	10387	4	2	The author concluded the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Saeng believes that if the hibiscus can survive tough times, adapt to changes, and thrive, she can too. Moving to the United States has brought differences, but Saeng realizes she is strong enough to endure. Failing the driver's test does not mean she is incapable. Instead, she sees the opportunity to try again with a fresh start, just like the hibiscus. This conclusion shows Saeng's resilience and her positive outlook on the future.
1521	10388	4	2	"The author concludes the story with a specific paragraph to convey that Saeng has not given up. Early in the story, Saeng visits the greenhouse and begins to cry. Upon returning home, she tells her mother, ""I - I failed the test."" Despite this setback, Saeng desires to go back and attempt the test again. This is the reason the author ended the story with that particular paragraph."
1522	10389	4	2	The inclusion of the last paragraph aims to illustrate Saeng and her family's determination and ability to adapt to new circumstances. Initially, Saeng harbored bitterness over failing the test. However, when she recalls her homeland through the flower, she comes to accept the situation. Just as the flower will bloom, she will transform into a new person and eventually pass the test. An instance of her determination is that she makes friends, and even though the food she offered was rejected, she did not yield. Her moment of breakdown occurred when she received the flower. Once she got home, it was over, and she once again embraced the change.
1523	10390	4	2	In my opinion, the author included the last paragraph because Saeng is not one to give up; she will make another attempt. I believe Saeng purchased the flower because it was a familiar sight from her homeland and would offer her comfort. For example, Saeng began to cry as she missed her homeland. This shows that the flower holds significance for her and gives her the strength to persevere.
1524	10391	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he thinks that when the flowers return, they will be better. He likely anticipates that the next test will be more successful. This conclusion implies a sense of hope and the expectation of improvement, which adds a positive outlook to the story.
1525	10392	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with the given paragraph as it further develops the theme of adapting to life's changes. In the story, Saeng has moved from Vietnam to the United States, a significant life - altering event. The plants have also changed. The hibiscus, while reminding Saeng of Vietnam, is different. The mother in the story remarks, ""Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold winter months here, this winter hibiscus."" The hibiscus is relevant to the theme as it can adjust to changes. The final paragraph describes the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. These are all changes that the author uses to tie into the theme, enhancing the reader's understanding of the story's message. Moreover, the hopeful tone of the last paragraph gives the reader a positive feeling and further emphasizes the story's theme."
1526	10393	4	2	The story revolves around a person failing a test. A female individual states that she will make another attempt next year when the geese return.
1527	10394	4	2	In my view, he is suggesting that seasons change and winter will return. I believe this concept represents the test.
1528	10395	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with the given paragraph to illustrate that Saeng is similar to the hibiscus and geese. Both the geese and the hibiscus aim to survive the winter. Geese migrate south to stay warm, which parallels Saeng's move to a new environment where adaptation is necessary. Additionally, Saeng experiences winter alongside the hibiscus. The hibiscus must be strong to overcome winter, showing that Saeng, like her hibiscus, needs to be strong to overcome the test. If the hibiscus can overcome winter, then Saeng can overcome her own challenges.
1529	10396	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author includes the line ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"" to show that the character can adapt to change while still thinking about her old country. For example, the statement ""But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac"" demonstrates that she can enjoy the foods of her old home while trying new things in her new one. Overall, the excerpt shows that the author can blend both cultures and find happiness."
1530	10397	4	2	There are multiple reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, and it can hold various meanings crucial to the narrative. I think the author includes it to imply that when spring arrives, the character will have more motivation to take the driving test. Breaking down the paragraph reveals different interpretations. I see it as indicating a new beginning when spring returns. The melting snow symbolizes the hardships of the previous year. The returning geese and budding hibiscus signify the start of a new year for them as well. This ending shows that Saeng is trying to forget her test failure and is using this time to prepare for the next attempt. She believes that by moving on from the past year's bad experiences, she can pass the test next time. The author concludes the story this way to show how Saeng plans to solve her problems. Different interpretations of the paragraph offer various insights, but I think it portrays a new beginning she will experience in the coming year.
1531	10398	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story with the line “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. This implies that Saeng will be prepared the next time “they” return.
1532	10399	4	2	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” by having Saeng vow to retake the test. This ending is used to convey the story's themes. One theme is perseverance; the winter hibiscus endures the long winter and survives, inspiring Saeng to keep trying. Another theme is overcoming obstacles. The flower faces numerous dangers yet still manages to bloom. Saeng aims to overcome her own obstacles and pass the test. Thus, the story's ending effectively showcases these themes.
1533	10400	4	2	The author concludes this part of the story because it makes the story more distinctive. For instance, when Saeng said what she meant about the plants coming back, it gave the ending a point of focus. Instead of going off - topic by continuously talking about the “v” or geese, this conclusion keeps the reader engaged. Additionally, she also meant when the geese return. Ultimately, this ending enhances the story's overall impact.
1534	10401	4	2	I believe the author finishes the story where the girl sees the plant as a symbol of strength and faith. So, she decides to take the test next year when the plant comes back. She genuinely likes the plant and hopes it will bring her luck. This ending reflects the significance the plant holds for her and her determination to face the test again.
1535	10402	4	2	I believe the author ended the story with that phrase to illustrate the girl's unwavering determination. Despite admitting “I failed the test” earlier in the story, she declares at the end “I will take that test again”, showing she is not ready to accept failure permanently. Moreover, the author's choice of ending makes the reader wonder if she will ever pass the test, adding an element of suspense to the story.
1536	10403	4	2	I believe the author wrote this because the protagonist was previously unprepared for any test she had to take. However, when the geese return and the hibiscus blooms, she will be ready to face the test. Perhaps she lacked mental readiness before. In conclusion, I think that when she mentions the return of the geese and the hibiscus, she implies that she will take the test then, and it's likely she was neither physically nor mentally prepared earlier.
1537	10404	4	2	Authors carefully select their closing paragraphs. The author of this story chose to end with a specific paragraph as all the elements in it hold special significance from the character's perspective. There are valid reasons for this choice of conclusion. The character states, “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The hibiscus symbolizes the ability to overcome obstacles. In the story, it relates to the girl overcoming a failed test and attempting it again. Additionally, the author writes, “when the snow melts and the geese return,” which represents new beginnings and opportunities for the character. This gives her the confidence that she will pass the test next time. The author includes this paragraph to symbolize new starts, chances, and the ability to overcome challenges. Authors always have specific motives for choosing their final paragraphs, and this author is no exception, using it to convey symbolic meanings.
1538	10405	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph due to a concept where during the cold and quiet period, the character is internally intense, but when the snow melts and spring arrives, she becomes more sociable and engages in enjoyable activities. This contrast in her state between different seasons is the reason for the chosen conclusion, highlighting the change and transition in her life.
1539	10406	4	2	I'm of the opinion that the author ended the story with that paragraph because the geese, which fly south in a beautiful formation every season, serve as a significant symbol. The protagonist tells herself that she will retake the test when the geese return and the hibiscus plant starts budding. For instance, she reflects, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Looking at the geese, she is reminded of a somewhat similar past experience. This connection between the natural cycle of the geese and her personal situation is why the author chose this conclusion.
1540	10407	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to emphasize that one can overcome defeat or failure by waiting for the right “season” to try again. The hibiscus, a plant of great significance to the narrator and her mother, was dying, and they dug a hole to aid its growth. When it regrows, it signifies a better - living state. Saeng associates this with her test, seeing it as an opportunity to pass. The paragraph symbolizes a new beginning. It represents a situation where one gets a second chance to obtain what was missed before. The story and the paragraph together emphasize that life is a cyclical process of budding and renewal.
1541	10408	4	2	She eagerly anticipates the snow melting and the return of warmer temperatures so that the flowers can grow again. Additionally, she plans to retake the test she previously failed when the geese return and the flowers bloom.
1542	10409	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that, like the geese and the hibiscus, Saeng will return and retain hope. In the story, Saeng is somewhat depressed as she is in a new country and has just failed her driving test. The hibiscus plant in the florist shop evokes painful emotional memories for her, yet it is also highly comforting. Later, she plants the hibiscus in the garden with her mother. As her mother goes inside, Saeng watches the geese fly overhead. She realizes that many things she once considered strange have, through the repeated cycle of seasons, become almost familiar to her, much like the geese. Saeng knows the geese will return in spring, just as she will retake her driving test. The hibiscus will also bloom again, offering her hope. This is the meaning of the final paragraph in the story ""Winter Hibiscus""."
1543	10410	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's unwavering determination. This determination to succeed can be linked to the plant she brings home. The plant, which grows wild in her former home, is potted in the United States, restricting its growth. Similarly, Saeng finds her new country unfamiliar and feels out of place.
1544	10411	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story with Saeng vowing to retake the test as it ties together the story's overall theme and major events. The theme is that one can adapt to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to one's old home. Saeng remarks that many things she once found strange have become familiar through the passage of seasons, like the geese. In the greenhouse, the plants trigger memories of Vietnam and her grandmother. After moving to @LOCATION2, Saeng struggled to adjust, but she was determined to overcome these difficulties, just as she had dealt with the differences between @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. By referencing the geese, the hibiscus, and the retest, the author shows how Saeng is adapting to her new life. This demonstrates to both Saeng and the reader that she can overcome new challenges. Her self - vow foreshadows her future success and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.
1545	10412	4	2	The author concludes the story with this particular paragraph as it marks the end of one phase and the start of a new beginning. The author incorporates the concept of seasons in the story. The current season is winter, and spring is approaching. Despite failing her test in winter when most things wither, Saeng looks forward to spring to retake the test. The return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus signify the arrival of spring and new life. Saeng, too, will have a new start in her test, aiming to pass and drive. When spring comes, new life will be bestowed upon all.
1546	10413	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it encapsulates the essence of the entire narrative in a concise manner.
1547	10414	4	2	This paragraph serves as an effective conclusion for the story as it is related to the test. The narrator indicates that she will make another attempt in the spring.
1548	10415	4	2	I am of the opinion that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it encapsulates the core of the story. It elaborates on what transpired at the end, much like how the events throughout the story represented the growth and life of a flower.
1549	10416	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with what appears to be an incomplete paragraph. The girl, Saeng, vows to retake her driver's test in the spring. While holding the plant, Saeng felt cold and helpless, similar to the plant, as described by the line ""Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind."" Saeng's mother's reassurance, saying ""I'm glad you got it"" and ""look how root - bound it is, poor thing,"" helps Saeng grow as a person. This also symbolizes Saeng's attachment to her country. Her mother also assures her that the plant will survive. Just as the plant will be strong in spring, so will Saeng, which is why the author ends the story where she does."
1550	10417	4	2	"The author concludes the story by highlighting the girl's connection to the plant and the symbolism of the geese. The ""Winter hibiscus"" represents her link to her homeland. She states that she will retake her driving test when her plant buds and she gains courage, mirroring the plant's growth. The geese flying south symbolize her personal journey. She will take the test when the geese return from their journey, just as she returns from hers."
1551	10418	4	2	The author crafted the ending paragraph in this manner for multiple reasons. The primary one is that she aimed to conclude the story on a more light - hearted note. Throughout the narrative, there was a depressing, nostalgic tone that made readers long for the past. The author emphasized the importance of being strong even if one does not like their current situation. Additionally, the author intended to showcase the strength of the main character, Saeng. Despite failing a test in a new and unfamiliar world, Saeng still desires to persevere. This adds depth to the character, making her less static and more dynamic. Overall, this is an excellent story for those who are homesick and need motivation to move forward.
1552	10420	4	2	The author concludes with that statement as it indicates she requires time. Just as a hibiscus needs to establish roots in new soil, she needs time to adapt to her new home. When at the orchard, she spots the hibiscus, which triggers memories of her old home. These memories make her cry, yet she also experiences a sense of comfort. In conclusion, the hibiscus serves as a powerful symbol of her transition and the complex emotions she is going through.
1553	10421	4	2	I firmly believe the author concludes that passage in the story to demonstrate patience. Saeng is waiting for spring, hoping it will make the place feel more like her hometown. She has a preference for spring over winter as she loves the return of the birds and geese in spring, which leave during winter. This, in my opinion, is the reason the author concludes the passage in this way, highlighting Saeng's hope and longing for a more familiar and pleasant season.
1554	10422	4	2	“When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author has left her home country and moved to a new one, finding herself in an unfamiliar place surrounded by novelty and uncertainty. By ending the story with this quote, it implies that the author still holds hope for adapting to her new home. When she left, she didn't just leave a physical building; she left behind her home, loved ones, and countless memories. At times, she may have felt out of place as she was no longer in her comfort zone. The sight of the hibiscus took her back to her old home, and then reality hit, causing her sadness and a “failed test.” The ending sentence shows her determination to survive in this new place and pass the test of adaptation. In conclusion, this ending reflects her resilience and hope for a better future in the new environment.
1555	10423	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This means Saeng will take the test, hoping to pass and make her mother happy and gain her support. She chose spring because it represents the rebirth of nature, and she wants to retake the test with a clear and fresh mind. In my view, this is why the author chose to place this paragraph at the end of the story, highlighting Saeng's hope and the new beginning she anticipates with the arrival of spring.
1556	10424	4	2	"The author concludes the story with the given paragraph for multiple significant reasons. Throughout the narrative, Saeng grapples with her past and endeavors to overcome it. The paragraph imparts a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus, she tells her mother that she couldn't help herself and was unable to surmount her past. Saeng stated, ""I - I failed the test."" By ""the test,"" she refers to the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph, Saeng expresses her intention to retake the test, saying, ""When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" In summary, the author employs the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and address the emotional hurdles Saeng faces."
1557	10425	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to end it on a hopeful note. For instance, after moving to the United States, the protagonist experiences homesickness. To make matters worse, she fails the driver's test. The quote ""She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again"" enhances the portrayal of the homesick girl. The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate that when spring arrives, the protagonist will start anew and live her life afresh in @LOCATION2."
1558	10426	4	2	The author concludes the story with the mentioned paragraph as Saeng is informing the readers that she will retake the test when the opportune time arrives. When circumstances seem to improve, she will attempt the test again. This is the reason why the author uses that paragraph to conclude the story.
1559	10427	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" written by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator visits a greenhouse filled with numerous flowers, but a particular ""winter"" hibiscus plant catches her attention. This plant evokes memories of her homeland and the events that used to occur there. It also reminds her of her grandmother's long, silky gray hair and how she would watch her dry it in the sun and then help her knot it up into a bun with a bud of this plant in it. The author ends the story in this way as it contradicts the narrator's statement ""I - I failed the test,"" and the end of the passage states ""..., then I will take the test again."
1560	10428	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the girl Saeng fails the driver's test. Saeng says, ""I - I failed the test."" She purchases a hibiscus because the flower reminds her of memories from home and the hibiscus at her house. At the end, she declares that she will retake the test when the geese return, the snow has melted, and the hibiscus is budding. It seems that she does this because she needs time to reflect on things, recall her home, and create a hibiscus garden. In this story, the hibiscus is analogous to Saeng. Both have made mistakes or faced setbacks; Saeng failed the test, and the hibiscus was confined to a pot. However, they are both going to transform these negative situations."
1561	10429	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the paragraph in such a manner to convey the determination and newly - found motivation that Saeng gains from buying the familiar plant. Despite failing her test, the discovery of a plant that reminded her of home and her grandmother instilled in her the motivation to retake the test. She was resolved to make her new life in the new country better, regardless of the circumstances. The author's inclusion of details about the geese, such as ""She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive u was etched against the evening sky..."", represents the concept of moving on. Just as the geese go and return, Saeng failed the test once but was motivated to try again after getting the plant and seeing the birds. The statement ""Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become... familiar to her"" shows that the geese, among other things, had become familiar in her new home. Concluding the story with a mention of the geese indicates that Saeng is gradually learning to adapt to her unfamiliar new home. The plant, being familiar to her, provided comfort. As described, ""Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. 'Dok malik,' Saeng said."" After failing her driver's test, entering the florist's shop and finding the plant made the new place feel more like home. The geese became familiar over time, and the plant offered comfort. This way of concluding the story demonstrates that Saeng is adapting and learning to cope with a difficult situation in a comforting manner."
1562	10430	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with the line ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". The author uses this conclusion to convey that when the year begins anew, Saeng will also start afresh. The return of the geese, the melting of the snow, and the budding of the hibiscus all symbolize a new beginning. Thus, when Saeng takes the test again, it will be in a new year, representing a fresh start for her."
1563	10431	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concludes the story in a way related to Saeng's experience of failing her driving test. Saeng shed tears upon seeing a flower that reminded her of her past. Additionally, her purchase of dok malik seeds indicates the nature of the story's ending. It implies that in the next season, there will be a new development or a fresh start for Saeng."
1564	10432	4	2	The author concludes the story with a paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination. Saeng's declaration that she will take the test again clearly shows her resolve. Even though she failed her driver's test, she is not willing to give up, which further emphasizes her determined nature.
1565	10433	4	2	The author used the sentence because of the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding flowers. These natural phenomena of renewal and new beginnings are likely the reasons for the author's choice of that sentence. Scribed by @ORGANIZATION1.
1566	10434	4	2	"In my view, this was an excellent conclusion to the story. When Saeng says, ""When they come back,"" she refers to the flowers returning to life. The phrase ""In the spring"" indicates the time when the flowers will reappear. ""When the snows melt and the geese return"" implies that after winter (when the snow melts) and when the geese return in spring, the flowers will bloom. ""And this Hibiscus is budding"" further emphasizes that when the flowers bloom again in spring, she will take action. ""Then I will take the test again"" shows that after all these natural phenomena occur, she will retake the test in spring. This demonstrates that Saeng will closely observe these events and count down until spring so she can retake the test. She eagerly anticipates spring, as it will allow her to study, pass the test, and work at the flower @CAPS1. This will be her goal throughout the winter until spring arrives."
1567	10435	4	2	The author chose that ending for the story because in spring, when everything is in bloom, the girl can focus better. During winter with snow on the ground, she would be distracted. When the hibiscus starts budding, it signals the right time for her to retake the test. I believe the author included this because it holds significant meaning for the girl. This ending ties into the natural cycle and the girl's state of mind, suggesting that the renewal of nature will bring about a renewal of her academic efforts.
1568	10436	4	2	"The conclusion of this story offers a glimmer of hope for the future. The girl is disappointed about failing the test, yet she retains optimism for what lies ahead. In the story, the narrator notes, ""She lifted her head."" This quote indicates that she refuses to quit and will persevere until she achieves success. The story's ending leaves readers speculating whether she will redouble her efforts and pass the test on her second attempt. When she says, ""when the snow melts and the geese return,"" she draws a parallel between herself and the geese, as both are embarking on a challenging journey. Similarly, when she mentions ""and this hibiscus budding,"" she implies that when everything comes alive and reaches its peak, she will take the test with maximum confidence. The author concludes the story to convey that there is hope for the future and that the girl will not give up. Despite her disappointment over failing the test, she will undoubtedly be prepared to pass it in spring."
1569	10437	4	2	There are several reasons why the author concludes the story with this particular paragraph. These reasons likely contribute to the overall theme and message the author wishes to convey. The paragraph might serve to summarize the key events, provide closure to the plot, or leave the readers with a thought - provoking idea. By ending the story in this way, the author can effectively wrap up the narrative and ensure that the intended impact is made on the audience.
1570	10438	4	2	Saeng realizes that it will be a long time before she needs to worry about schoolwork again. This realization is the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. It shows that Saeng has a sense of relief and a new perspective on her academic responsibilities. The author uses this ending to highlight Saeng's state of mind and how the natural cycle of time affects her concerns. This conclusion ties the story together, connecting Saeng's personal feelings with the broader context of the passage of time.
1571	10439	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to emphasize that the girl is not entirely dissatisfied with leaving her home. By ending the story in this way, the author aims to show that there is hope for her to learn to love her new home.
1572	10440	4	2	The author ends the story with this sentence because Saeng requires a break before retaking the test. Saeng makes a comparison between seemingly unrelated things: flowers and taking a test. This comparison is significant, which is why the author concludes the story with this sentence.
1573	10441	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate that the girl will be analogous to the hibiscus. When the hibiscus blooms again, the girl will be prepared to take the test, retake it, and pass. The author intends to convey that the girl will not give up and will make another attempt to ensure she passes. By incorporating the hibiscus, the author shows that the girl will achieve success and “bloom” at the same time as the hibiscus, passing the test.
1574	10442	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story with that sentence because perhaps Saeng has a fondness for spring and can focus better when accompanied by her favorite flower, which she believes is connected to her life.
1575	10443	4	2	The author ends the story in that manner to showcase the theme of working hard. Other examples of working hard in the story include the “winter hibiscus” and her vow to pass the test. These instances explain why the author chooses to conclude the story in this way.
1576	10444	4	2	The author concludes the story with this particular paragraph as it mirrors the story's opening. The story commences with Saeng failing her driver's test and then noticing a familiar plant she wishes to purchase. The middle part details her struggle to adapt to her new home. To conclude, the author states that Saeng will retake her driver's test when the flowers start budding and the geese appear. The flower and the geese evoke a sense of home for her, indicating that thoughts of home and the items associated with it comfort her and assist her in overcoming challenges.
1577	10445	4	2	Authors employ various techniques to enhance their stories. Without these techniques, a story may seem dull, ordinary, or unappealing. Author Minfong Ho conveys that Saeng will attempt the test again. Instead of simply stating this fact, he has her make a promise on the geese. By ending the story in this way, the author showcases the strength of her resolve regarding the test.
1578	10446	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it links the hibiscus to Saeng's trials and triumphs. Just as Saeng cannot give up and must retake the test, the winter hibiscus must endure the harsh winter and emerge stronger. The hibiscus symbolize hope, and Saeng views them as her source of hope. Throughout the story, the hibiscus comfort Saeng as they remind her of home. The author includes this element because many can relate to finding hope in certain things. For Saeng, the knowledge that the hibiscus will return each year under difficult conditions assures her that she will be fine in her new environment.
1579	10447	4	2	"In my opinion, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to depict a new beginning. The geese are returning to restart their lives, the hibiscus will be in bloom, and Saeng will retake the test. At the start, Saeng was despondent about leaving her old country and grandmother. She felt ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her."" She recalled how some of these plants grew wild in bushes or between sidewalk cracks. Saeng's statement in the last paragraph demonstrates that she found comfort and confidence in the hibiscus. Memories of the past guided her, and now she is ready to retake her driver's test."
1580	10448	4	2	I believe the author concludes this story with this ending paragraph because the entire story revolves around how Saeng finds comfort in the plants. She wants to wait until the weather improves and the geese return before taking her test. I think she waits so that she can feel more at ease in her surroundings, clear her mind, and perform her best on the test.
1581	10449	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng wishes to retake the test, but only when all that is good and happy returns, similar to the plant and the geese. This is evident as Saeng states, ""When they (geese) come back… and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This demonstrates her maturity and her pursuit of happiness. She is willing to undertake a difficult and perhaps unenjoyable task when everything else is restored and joyful. Just as she arrived in a state of sadness, when the geese and the plant return, she desires to assist them and bring them happiness as well, so that they can all be happy simultaneously."
1582	10450	4	2	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” penned by Minfong Ho, the main character Saeng concludes the narrative by promising herself that in spring, when the geese return and the winter hibiscus begins to bud, she will retake the failed driver's test. Ho employs rich imagery and symbolism throughout the story. The hibiscus from the floral shop serves as a connection for Saeng to her homeland, while the bitter melon, beloved by Saeng but unpalatable to the people in @LOCATION1, represents her struggle to connect with the locals. For Saeng, the budding hibiscus and the returning geese symbolize a new opportunity to pass her driver's test and better integrate into life in @LOCATION1.
1583	10451	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to convey two key messages: Saeng's perseverance and the strength she derives from nature. The conclusion showcases Saeng's determination as it reveals that she plans to retake the test, despite failing it earlier that day. Moreover, it demonstrates that nature empowers Saeng. The text states that Saeng will retake the test when the geese return, the hibiscus buds, and the snow melts in spring. Nature provides her with strength as it reminds her of her former home and her grandmother. In summary, the author chose this conclusion to highlight Saeng's resilience and the confidence she gains from nature.
1584	10452	4	2	In my opinion, the character Saeng endures both internal and external conflicts. She fails her driver's test and continues to miss Vietnam. The ending of the story is an outstanding choice. The flock of @CAPS1 geese symbolizes her transformation. Initially, she felt awkward and out of place, as many things were new to her. However, Saeng realizes that life isn't so bad. The planting of the “winter hibiscus” also represents her change, indicating that she will start anew and live happily. Saeng will “plant a new seed.” The ending is well - selected as it foreshadows Saeng's future. This inspiring story owes much of its impact to the well - crafted ending.
1585	10453	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng draws parallels between the hibiscus' ability to overcome problems and her own. Saeng compares herself to the hibiscus. If the hibiscus can adapt to its environment, she believes she can too. If the hibiscus can survive the winter, she is confident that she can persevere as well, and she will retake the test she previously failed. Additionally, she remarks that things that were once unfamiliar to her, like the geese, now seem familiar. She then sees them flying overhead in a V - formation. Just as the geese adapt to their surroundings by flying to a warmer place, Saeng realizes that she too can adapt.
1586	10454	4	2	The author concludes the story with that sentence as she anticipates the return of spring. She is eager to plant more and witness the blooming and revitalization of the plants.
1587	10455	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it demonstrates Saeng's perseverance. After failing her driver's test, on her way home, Saeng found a hibiscus which reminded her of her old home. She then went to the greenhouse or flower - shop and bought one. Upon returning, she planted the hibiscus. This plant serves as a motivation for her not to give up. When the hibiscus starts budding, Saeng will retake the test.
1588	10456	4	2	The author chose to end the story with that paragraph because it represents the perfect moment for Saeng to rectify her past mistake. Saeng cried, “I - I failed the test!” This shows her disappointment at failing something she thought she was good at. Then, she said, “Here, let me help mother” and took the shovel from her mother. Saeng is improving her gardening skills so that when she retakes the test, she will perform better. Clearly, Saeng wants to pass the test to believe she is as great a gardener as her mother.
1589	10457	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it piques the readers' curiosity to read the next story and find out how she fares on the test. In the story, she initially failed the test. After making changes, she now wants to retake it as she believes she can perform better than before.
1590	10458	4	2	Everything in this paragraph can be found somewhere in the story, so they are closely intertwined. Just as the plant adapts to its new environment, she learns to adapt to her new homeland.
1591	10459	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to maintain consistency and provide the reader with a clear example and understanding of the text.
1592	10460	4	2	The story is included in the paragraph because they share the same topic. The inclusion of the story might be to illustrate the strong bond between the mother and daughter and their ability to engage in activities together, such as traveling to Canada.
1593	10461	4	2	The author chooses to conclude the story with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's strength and confidence. By stating that she will retake the test in the spring, Saeng shows her confidence and anticipation for a new start. After failing the test, Saeng's self - confidence was low. However, after speaking with her understanding mother, she realized she must persevere until she passes the test.
1594	10462	4	2	I believe she will retake the test in the spring and make an effort to pass it. She didn't want to cry in front of her mother. I'm confident she will make amends and succeed in passing the test.
1595	10463	4	2	The author ends the story with that paragraph to convey to readers that although the character was defeated, she will rise again to retake the test. This is an excellent way to conclude the story as it showcases her strong determination to pass the test, her refusal to give up, and her willingness to do whatever it takes to achieve success.
1596	10464	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to demonstrate that the protagonist will not give up and will act when she is prepared. This is evident as she takes the test at a time when she feels comfortable. These factors lead me to believe that the author chose to end the story in this way.
1597	10465	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story in this manner to exemplify perseverance. Saeng remarks, “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This statement reflects her ability to adapt to change. Given time, she will fully adjust to her new home. As long as she perseveres, she will succeed. In the final paragraph, Saeng states, “when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Just as the seasons bring renewal, she will make a comeback. I am convinced that the inclusion of this last paragraph is to convey that everyone should persevere because achieving goals often requires time.
1598	10466	4	2	This statement reveals the author's conclusion about the story and truly embodies its theme. It conveys the message that if one fails, they should try again. The statement indicates that since she failed her tasks, she will attempt to complete them in the spring when the hibiscus blooms anew. It also emphasizes the importance of never giving up. Saeng failed the test and said, “I - I failed the test.” The sad and depressed tone of this statement reflects her emotional state. Despite her sadness, Saeng is determined to attempt the test again next year. Overall, the sentence showcases the author's conclusion and perspective on the story “Winter Hibiscus.”
1599	10467	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” for multiple reasons. Firstly, Saeng decides to be as determined as the hibiscus to pass her driving test. Her mother says the hibiscus is “strong enough to make it through,” and Saeng resolves to be strong like it and pass the test. Secondly, the mention of the geese in the final paragraph indicates that she is getting accustomed to her new location as the geese “sound familiar.” Despite missing her old home, she is adapting. Finally, by referencing the plant, which symbolizes her homeland, and the geese, which symbolize her new home, it can be concluded that while she misses her past, she is starting to adjust to her new country and realizes her place in it. She understands that dwelling on the past will not help her pass the test, and like the plant and the geese, she will return and succeed.
1600	10468	4	2	I believe the author concluded this paragraph in the story to convey a message to the reader. The author is suggesting that if a plant can survive the cold winter, then the protagonist can pass her driver's test. This is the reason I think the author included that paragraph in the story.
1601	10469	4	2	I believe the author concluded the story in this manner as she has a fondness for observing geese and holds a deep love for spring. Additionally, she wishes to take a test and achieve a passing grade, for which she is currently engaged in studying. This approach allows the story to blend her appreciation for nature with her aspirations for academic success.
1602	10470	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph due to the belief that Saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus by her side. The hibiscus is considered unique, and it also evokes memories of the place where Saeng lived before moving to @ORGANIZATION1. Saeng appeared out of place and unsure of what to do. In this way, the author uses the hibiscus to symbolize hope and a connection to Saeng's past, providing a meaningful conclusion to the story.
1603	10471	4	2	The author demonstrates great creativity by concluding the story with the description of the hibiscus growing and the mention that the character, Saeng, will retake the test. Saeng believes she will perform better once the snow has melted. The author chose this ending because Saeng was deeply upset about failing the test, and the presence of the hibiscus offers comfort and the promise of improvement. Moreover, since the climax of the story was Saeng's test failure, this ending provides a resolution regarding her future with the test, showing that there is hope for a better outcome.
1604	10472	4	2	He concludes the story in this way because the test was the central focus of the narrative. By ending with the test - related content, he ties up the main thread of the story and provides a sense of closure. This approach ensures that the key element of the story is addressed in the conclusion, making the story's end more coherent and relevant to the overall plot.
1605	10473	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" at the story's end, the narrator expresses her determination to retake and pass the driver's test she failed earlier that day. She ""vowed silently to herself"" to succeed at a task she had previously failed. This is a significant concluding message as it indicates that the author will overcome future obstacles. Throughout most of the story, the narrator experiences sadness due to her longing for her homeland. Saeng misses her grandmother and the plants of Vietnam, even purchasing a hibiscus plant as a reminder. She is also unhappy in @LOCATION2, having faced failure in her new home. However, the story's end offers a contrast, as Saeng vows to achieve success in the future, suggesting a positive shift in her circumstances and outlook."
1606	10474	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it showcases the significant growth of the main character. The main character, Saeng, has learned that if a delicate hibiscus can endure difficult times, she too can persevere. The struggle for survival in nature parallels Saeng's challenges in a new environment. She realizes that one will gradually adapt to their surroundings, and eventually, it will feel like home. This principle of adaptation is evident throughout the story, whether demonstrated by nature or a child's life. Therefore, the author would concur that the story's conclusion depicts the biological and physical development of Saeng.
1607	10475	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng, who is new to @LOCATION1, misses home. One day, she spots a hibiscus in a flower - shop. After taking the flower home and planting it in her backyard, she decides to retake the driver's test when the hibiscus buds in spring. The author concludes the story in this manner because it draws a parallel between Saeng and the flower. Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1, and the hibiscus is a link to her old home in Vietnam. The ending symbolizes that if the flower can survive the cold winter, she can overcome her difficulties. Taking the driver's test is a sign of her survival and ability to surmount obstacles. The overall theme of the story is that with time, everything will improve. Saeng will adapt to the differences in @LOCATION1, the hibiscus will bloom, and Saeng will pass her driver's test.
1608	10476	4	2	They ended the story this way because the girl is determined not to give up. She will keep attempting the test and won't stop there. She will become more positive and ultimately pass the test. By doing so, she won't disappoint her mother and will be able to relieve the burden of this test. In conclusion, her perseverance will lead to a successful outcome.
1609	10477	4	2	The author concludes the story with the given paragraph to assist the reader in visualizing a new beginning for the girl. It presents a time for her to retake the test, with fresh flowers to behold and the return of geese. The geese are symbolic of her journey to her new home. The combination of melting snow and budding flowers indicates a bright, uncharted future ahead for the girl. The author uses this paragraph at the end to elaborate on what lies ahead, enhance the imagery, and engage the audience. It reveals the girl's spirit, showing that like a flower having trouble taking root in a new environment, she is struggling to adapt to the new lifestyle. However, there will always be a new opportunity to move forward.
1610	10478	4	2	I believe the author includes that paragraph in the story because it might be a good - luck charm or a tradition, making its presence in the story crucial. Additionally, it could be conveying a message, such as the girl only taking tests in spring when the hibiscus starts to bud. In conclusion, this paragraph adds depth and meaning to the story.
1611	10479	4	2	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with a special paragraph. This serves two purposes: to conclude Saeng's longing to be home and to illustrate her learning to overcome obstacles. Saeng yearns for her homeland and frequently refers to it, as she desires to return. For instance, she stumbles while speaking, “I mean, it’s not like the one we had at - at -,” because mentioning home brings her to tears. Moreover, when she mentions the “test,” it leads her to consider a fake test, stating, “It’s - it’s not a real one.” She refuses to buy a real one as it reminds her of the driving test and her existing sadness. The “test” symbolizes both the plant and the driver's test. Saeng ends with a vow, “... and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test.” The emotional trials in both situations will make her stronger. This vow at the story's end demonstrates her determination to be strong and succeed in the end.
1612	10480	4	2	In the story, the author concludes that after she has completed her test and there is nothing left to see, she will continue to grow. This implies that the experience of taking the test, regardless of the outcome, is a catalyst for personal development. The act of undergoing the test is a step in her journey of self - improvement, and even when there are no immediate visible results, it sets the stage for future growth.
1613	10481	4	2	The author concludes the story with this particular paragraph because the girl failed the driving test. Additionally, the author includes detailed descriptions of nature as the girl takes time to care about it. The story primarily revolves around these two elements: the girl's driving test failure and her connection with nature. The inclusion of nature details may serve to provide comfort or a sense of perspective in the face of the test failure.
1614	10482	4	2	I believe the author adds this paragraph to convey to the reader that when all the beauty returns, the character will attempt to adapt to new things once again. This suggests that there is a cycle of change and adaptation in the story. The return of beauty might symbolize a new opportunity or a fresh start, and the character's willingness to get used to new things shows her resilience and ability to move forward.
1615	10483	4	2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with that specific paragraph as it imparts a sense of starting anew for Saeng. The hibiscus acts as a powerful reminder of her home country, giving her the strength to persevere. Saeng compares herself to the geese, noting that through the quiet repetition of seasons, things that once seemed strange have become familiar. In winter, the hibiscus doesn't bloom, and Saeng fails her driver's test. However, the paragraph indicates that come spring, when the hibiscus thrives and the geese return, it will mark a fresh start for both the natural world and Saeng. This conclusion emphasizes the cyclical nature of life and the hope for renewal.
1616	10484	4	2	The author most likely concludes the story with Saeng vowing to retake the test to showcase Saeng's determination. When Saeng informed her mother of failing the test, her mother recognized the difficulty Saeng faced. In the ensuing silence, her mother realized that scolding Saeng about the plant was inappropriate. Saeng compares herself to the plant. She might have thought that if the plant can survive the winter and continue growing, she can overcome the test. Thus, this is likely the reason the author ended the story in this manner.
1617	10485	4	2	"The author ends the story with this paragraph as the protagonist, Saeng, has found new hope and determination. The author clearly holds affection and admiration for the hibiscus, as evidenced by Saeng's mother's statement, ""But it's strong enough to make it through winter."" Saeng desires to confront hardships with the same resilience as the hibiscus. When she tells herself, ""Then I will take the test again,"" she is brimming with a new - found resolve. This is why the author chose to conclude the story in this way."
1618	10486	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story with this particular paragraph because the entire narrative builds up to it. Without this conclusion, the story would lack purpose and coherence. The conclusion serves as the culmination of all the events and themes presented in the story, making it an essential part of the overall work.
1619	10487	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng will adapt to the circumstances of her new life in the United States. The hibiscus typically thrives in warm, tropical climates and usually cannot survive cold weather. Only the winter hibiscus can endure both warm and cold conditions. The hibiscus serves as a symbol for Saeng. She previously lived in Vietnam, where she adored the beautiful flowers and the time spent with her grandmother. However, adjusting to life in the United States has been challenging. The hibiscus, which can adapt well to cold weather, gives her the inspiration to adjust to her new life. When she sees the geese return for spring and summer, she decides to take the driving test, as the geese's return represents a new opportunity for her area to be their seasonal home. This is the reason the author ends the story with this paragraph.
1620	10488	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it describes the melting of snow and the return of greenery, which symbolizes rebirth. This symbolization parallels the protagonist's renewed motivation to retake the test. It also reveals the close connection the protagonist has with nature and the long - term impact that nature has had on him. The author uses this natural imagery to conclude the story, emphasizing the transformative power of nature on the character's mindset.
1621	10489	4	2	In my opinion, the author concluded the story with this paragraph because the entire narrative was charming, painting a vivid and beautiful image in the reader's mind with nearly every sentence. Therefore, it is fitting to end it with a paragraph like, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Undoubtedly, this ending is truly beautiful.
1622	10490	4	2	The author structured the last sentence in the way they did. This implies that by the next spring, they wish to observe how their reactions differ in the face of the same circumstances. They are acquainted with the situation but are now aware of how to respond to the season. In essence, this ending reflects a growth in their understanding and adaptability.
1623	10491	4	2	He employs this line at the story's conclusion as it indicates that she has another opportunity to pass the test. The use of the plant is significant because a plant will always regenerate and bud anew. This serves as an excellent way to end the story, as it demonstrates that in the present, plants can be a source of inspiration, teaching us to look up to something greater. Perhaps this is how she communicates with her mother through the plants, finding solace and connection in nature's cycles.
1624	10492	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with that paragraph because it symbolizes that she is becoming accustomed to the new country. It also conveys the message that one must adapt to new circumstances. This is why I believe the story ends with that particular paragraph, as it encapsulates the character's growth and the theme of resilience.
1625	10493	4	2	The flowers on this bush offer great comfort to Saeng. In the story, she reveals that they evoke memories of her home in Vietnam. The budding of the plant and the arrival of spring symbolize new life. Saeng believes that spring could also mark a fresh start for her. She hopes that in spring, she will perform better and pass the test. However, even if she fails, the blooming flowers will be there to console her, providing a constant source of comfort and hope.
1626	10494	4	2	The author concludes the text because she identifies with the flowers. She has adapted to her environment just as a flower does. Having failed her test, similar to a flower that withers and then blooms again, she intends to retake the test and strive for success.
1627	10495	4	2	I believe the author ends the story with that paragraph because she failed the test. During winter, hibiscus are not available, but come spring when they reappear, she will retake the test in hopes of passing it.
1628	10496	4	2	The author selects this as the final paragraph for two primary reasons. Firstly, the flower is akin to her; initially, the flower was not in bloom. However, when the snow melts and it blossoms, she is like the flower and will attempt to succeed in the test. Secondly, it reminds her of her home, and her mother understands why she values it so highly, so they wish to care for it.
1629	10497	4	2	Minfong Ho, the author of “Winter Hibiscus,” concludes the story with Saeng promising herself to retake and pass her driver's test in spring when the geese return and plants rebud. This ending signifies Saeng's eagerness to start anew. After failing the test, Saeng visits a greenhouse, misses her native Vietnam, and buys a hibiscus. She plants it upon returning home after observing the geese flying south for winter. The plant represents her memories. When she first sees it, it is in bloom. In spring, it will rebud, form another blossom, and grow larger. This mirrors Saeng overcoming her sadness and homesickness, building better memories, and growing stronger. The geese fly south for winter shelter and will return in spring to start afresh, raise goslings, and rebuild their homes. Similarly, Saeng plans to start over, pass the test, drive, and feel more accepted in @LOCATION2. Minfong Ho ends the story with this paragraph to symbolize the character's fresh start and the creation of good memories.
1630	10498	4	2	The author added the last paragraph in “Winter Hibiscus” to convey that the protagonist feels bad for failing the test. She is disappointed as her mother is disappointed in her, knowing she can pass. As she gazes at the hibiscus and the geese in the sky, she realizes she has a chance to pass the test. Now determined, she will take the test at the same time next year and believes she will succeed.
1631	10499	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it reflects the girl's feelings. She believes that in spring, she can perform better than she did previously.
1632	10500	4	2	It indicates that she desires to start anew. It is the girl's comfort zone, and thus, when she is upset, she resorts to this. This is the meaning conveyed by the story and the phase.
1633	10501	4	2	The author concluded with the statement “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to convey to the reader the message of never giving up and persevering. It also communicates that family is always present as one cannot achieve things alone. “It's a beautiful plant, this dok faeng - noi”, she finally said.
1634	10502	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the reader that the character has realized her affection for nature. She is waiting for spring, and as soon as it arrives, she will retake the test. So, I believe the author aims to demonstrate that the character in the story greatly appreciates the beauty of nature.
1635	10503	4	2	The author concludes the story with the sentence “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”. This is because the hibiscus serves as a good - luck charm. When it is absent, things go awry, but when it returns, things improve. Additionally, the hibiscus as a good - luck charm instills more confidence in Saeng. When one speaks with confidence, they are more likely to succeed. Finally, this ending lets the reader know that Saeng believes in something that gives her hope, which will contribute to her well - being.
1636	10504	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner as one of the themes is to overcome obstacles. The hibiscus symbolizes Saeng's perseverance, and the last paragraph provides closure to the introduced conflict. The statement “the hibiscus is strong enough to make it through the cold months here… that is what matters” establishes a connection between the plant and the author's perseverance due to the symbolism. The last paragraph combines this symbolism with closure as she states that she will wait until spring to retake the test. This ending effectively ties together the themes of perseverance and the cycle of challenges and renewal.
1637	10505	4	2	Saeng indicates that she will take the test when the opportunity arises again. The author concludes the story in this way to leave the reader speculating about the outcome of her next test attempt. Additionally, the author uses this approach to convey the message that one should never give up. Just as the flower can survive winter, Saeng can overcome the test. The author also implies that as the seasons change, so do circumstances. Initially, Saeng considered giving up after failing the test, but witnessing the plant's resilience in harsh weather boosted her confidence. Moreover, she values the plant because she and her mother spent quality time with it, and she anticipates seeing it bud. This connection to the plant gives her the motivation to persevere.
1638	10506	4	2	Saeng often discusses her school - work and the garden, consistently drawing parallels between the two. She understands that she must study as the garden grows. She has a desire to water the flowers, yet she realizes that when spring arrives, she will not be available to tend to the garden as she will have to take a test. This shows her awareness of the competing demands in her life and the need to balance her responsibilities.
1639	10507	4	2	The author ended the story in this fashion to demonstrate that Saeng is resolute and will not abandon her task. The author aims to help the reader understand that Saeng is deeply sad and wishes to overcome her homesickness. Saeng shares similarities with the hibiscus plant; she is delicate and beautiful. Saeng declares that she will retake the test when the hibiscus is budding, suggesting that she is growing and developing alongside the plant. This parallel emphasizes her journey of growth and determination.
1640	10508	4	2	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to illustrate that everyone and everything can endure difficult times. The paragraph serves as a final positive message for readers. The text “when they come back... I will take that test again” reveals that Saeng can identify herself with the geese or the budding hibiscus plants. She recognizes that her “winter” is the test, and when she is ready, she will retake it and achieve success. The budding of the hibiscus represents the moment when she will be prepared for the test. Despite her current struggles, she will persevere and make another attempt. This paragraph is placed at the end as it unifies the purpose of the hibiscus. Without it, readers might misunderstand the hibiscus's role as merely a link to Saeng's past. In conclusion, this positive paragraph is included to show that anyone can recover from a difficult situation.
1641	10509	4	2	One possibility is that she can only take the test in the spring. Additionally, the relaxed atmosphere during that period affected her. When she was disappointed and [unclear @CAPS1] about her failing driving grade... In conclusion, these factors seem to play a role in her test - taking situation.
1642	10510	4	2	The author concludes the story with [unclear @CAPS1] as the character deeply cared about the hibiscus. She made the comparison between her test and the hibiscus. She plans to retake the test when the hibiscus starts budding. The hibiscus is of utmost importance to her; it is her good - luck charm. With the hibiscus budding, she aims to start a new life. After failing the test, she was so depressed that she bought the hibiscus to have a positive influence on her life. She decided that in spring, when the hibiscus buds, she will retake the test, demonstrating to herself the significance of the hibiscus. In summary, the hibiscus serves as a symbol of hope and a new beginning for her.
1643	10511	4	2	The author concludes that the story can have unexpected turns. Saeng planted a winter hibiscus, which made her mother angry. Her mother was mad because Saeng spent money on a whole plant instead of planting it more economically. When her mother was angry and in disbelief, Saeng started crying, and her mother forgave her. This incident clearly shows that anything can happen in the story. In conclusion, the events highlight the unpredictability within the narrative.
1644	10512	4	2	The author likely concludes the story with that paragraph to convey to the reader that one should not be stubborn after a failure. Saeng failed her driver's test, but she plans to retake it in the spring when the hibiscus plant starts to bud. She views the budding of the plant as a sign that she will pass the test. In conclusion, the hibiscus acts as a source of motivation for Saeng to overcome her previous failure.
1645	10513	4	2	"The author concludes the story by having Saeng silently vow to herself. This is done to show the reader that she will grow like the hibiscus plant and retake the test with determination to pass. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng hope as it reminds her of her beloved homeland. When the hibiscus starts budding and blooming with beautiful flowers, Saeng believes she will also ""bud"" and obtain her license. In conclusion, the hibiscus symbolizes growth and success for Saeng in her journey to pass the test."
1646	10514	4	2	I believe the passage aims to convey the significance of the sun in spring. In the passage, it states, “In the spring when the snows melt, and only the sun can achieve that, and the geese return, it's hunting season, and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Since it mentions starting in the spring, it must imply the role of the sun during this season.
1647	10515	4	2	The author concludes the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking a test in spring. The words and the way it is presented suggest that Saeng has found peace and accepted living in the U.S. When Saeng says, “and this hibiscus plant is budding,” she is reminded of her native country. When she says, “Then I will take this test again,” she is promising herself to retake the test when she feels at home in her new country. In a way, Saeng is telling herself to accept the move and that she can still be reminded of her homeland through the new hibiscus plant and other things.
1648	10517	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a valid reason. There is a possibility of a sequel. The author might want readers to keep coming back for more or to let them know that when things start anew, so will Saeng. Ending the story this way is effective. The author wants readers to understand that when the plant and geese restart their lives, Saeng will too. She won't give up but will retake the test. The author could be planning a sequel about Saeng's new life and how she'll keep her vow. When spring brings new life, so will Saeng. The author enjoys making readers wonder about what's next, leaving them at home speculating about Saeng's future in the story.
1649	10518	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's determination to overcome obstacles and adapt to her new life. The hibiscus in the ending quote symbolizes Saeng's new hope and resolve to succeed in the United States. For instance, the text states, “… its fine petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.” When Saeng found a plant that connected her past in Vietnam with her future in @LOCATION3, she was deeply affected. The hibiscus represents hope in a seemingly hopeless situation. When it blossoms, a new life awaits her. By the end of the story, readers understand that Saeng has found stability and will eventually succeed. Also, the text says, “it felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center just as she had known it would feel.” The hibiscus, by evoking her past memories, serves as a great source of inspiration. The author ends the story with Saeng's new - found hope to show that she has found something reliable in a new world.
1650	10519	4	2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” chose the final paragraph to show readers that despite Saeng's hardship of leaving her old home, she can build a good life with a new beginning. In the final paragraph, winter represents past difficulties, while spring symbolizes an optimistic future and a fresh start. Although Saeng was mourning her past, she can still find happiness. In the story, she was familiar with hibiscus in her old home and now finds it in her new place, which reminds her of the past. The quote, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,” shows her acceptance of her new home. The final paragraph, “... when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again,” indicates that when familiar things return, Saeng will have the strength to strive for a better life in her new home.
1651	10520	4	2	The author concludes the story with this statement as it conveys the message that one can always have a fresh start and should never give up when truly desiring something. The driver was eager to pass the test, so she worked diligently but unfortunately failed. Similar to a plant in spring, she understands that life offers new beginnings, and one can always change aspects of themselves they dislike. I firmly concur with this statement because without second chances, most people would be considered failures since everyone makes mistakes in life and has the opportunity to correct them. This is the reason I believe the author ends the story with this statement.
1652	10521	4	2	The story concludes with that paragraph because Saeng believes that when her new hibiscus blooms next spring, she will have good fortune to pass her driving test. It is an effective way to end the story as the hibiscus had no role in her life before she took the driver's test. Now, she believes that for her next driving test, she will draw on her past experiences, the ability to overcome obstacles, and find comfort during times of disappointment. Saeng thinks these factors can assist her in passing the test.
1653	10522	4	2	The author may have had multiple reasons for concluding the story with this paragraph. One reason could be to illustrate how she has changed throughout the story. At the start of the story, the author appears discouraged and disappointed about failing her test. However, the final paragraph shows that she has overcome her fear. Additionally, the movement of the geese parallels her own journey. Saeng and her family have moved to the United States, and like the geese, who feel strange during their migration but return annually, Saeng is unique in her new life and must learn to adapt, just as the geese and the flower do. She knows that the flower will bloom and the geese will return in the spring, and this is what she must also do. She will not give up but will try again later in the year, demonstrating her adaptation and change to fit in with her new surroundings.
1654	10523	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to showcase Saeng's determination not only to pass her driving test but also to adapt to her new home. The author uses the word ""vowed"" to convey a positive connotation in the paragraph. The statement ""almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… familiar"" shows that she is adjusting to her new lifestyle. However, the author uses the last paragraph to indicate that she requires a bit more time for full adaptation."
1655	10524	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng promised herself that she would never fail the driving test again. She wanted to hold onto memories of her past and homeland, which is why she bought the flowers. At the end of the story, she vows, ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" She says this because she is ready to move forward and attempt to get accustomed to her new home."
1656	10525	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it effectively brings all the ideas together and demonstrates that Saeng is prepared for what lies ahead. When the flower is mentioned, it emphasizes the flower's significance and its connection to the girl's emotional state, whether happy or sad. Moreover, when she states that she vowed and will take the test again, it indicates her readiness for the future while remaining open - minded to new experiences, enabling her to reflect on her journey. Thus, the author ends with this paragraph to leave a sense of mystery about what happened and to conclude the story.
1657	10526	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way because it is now winter and the flowers have withered. However, during the time when the protagonist was planting, she matured. As the text indicates, things that she once found strange are now becoming familiar, and she is getting accustomed to her circumstances. Since she is learning more, she will be prepared for the test next spring. In conclusion, this ending choice by the author effectively captures the character's growth and her future prospects.
1658	10527	4	2	The author selects this as the ending paragraph of the story because the following year, at the same time, the character will take the 'test of life' once again. This ending implies a cycle of experience and growth, suggesting that the character will continue to face challenges and strive for improvement. It leaves the reader with a sense of the character's perseverance and the ongoing nature of life's trials.
1659	10528	4	2	"The ending of a story is crucial as it helps define the story's meaning. It provides the final closure and is likely to be remembered by the reader. In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concludes with a paragraph full of encouragement. The conclusion urges the reader to persevere, as it mentions that next year when the flower blooms, Saeng will retake the test. This shows encouragement as Saeng has the motivation to try again and succeed. The author ends with this encouraging feeling to inspire the reader. The conclusion is strong and also seems to summarize the story's meaning, as throughout the story, Saeng is often disappointed about the flower, her mother, and her homeland, but they encourage her to move on and try again. Overall, the chosen ending is meaningful and effectively conveys what the author intended."
1660	10529	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the main character faces difficulties as she has moved away from her home. The differences in culture, customs, and even food make it hard for her to adapt to the new environment. The author concludes the story with a statement that shows the character's determination not to stop striving for her goal. She wants to retake the test to see if things have changed over time. The story is highly emotional, expressing a great deal of sorrow, but in the end, the character overcomes it. This ending showcases the character's resilience and the power of hope in the face of adversity."
1661	10530	4	2	The author concluded the story with a specific paragraph about geese to demonstrate that Saeng intends to overcome her obstacles. After being disappointed by her test failure, she found solace in memories of her homeland. She purchased a hibiscus, a flower commonly seen in her homeland, which brought her comfort and affection. This flower also symbolized her ability to surmount obstacles. While planting the hibiscus and seeing the geese flying overhead, she realized she must try again.
1662	10531	4	2	The author states that she will attempt to start her own garden because her previous one did not turn out well. As the book mentions, she required her mother's assistance. In conclusion, her past experience with the garden has led her to make this new attempt.
1663	10532	4	2	The author concludes the paragraph when Saeng realizes that although she can miss her old home, she must adapt to her new surroundings. Saeng is overcome by a deep sense of loss as she recalls memories of her homeland, as described by the quote “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” However, she begins to notice that not everything has changed, and some things remain familiar. For instance, “overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, the faint honks clear and – yes – familiar to Saeng now.” This realization gives her the strength to continue her new life in the new country.
1664	10533	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it is an effective way to end the narrative. At the end, there is talk about how Saeng will return when the snow melts and then retake the test. This ending leaves the reader with a sense of hope and anticipation for Saeng's future attempt.
1665	10534	4	2	When they return in spring, when the snows melt, the geese come back, and the hibiscus begins to bud, Saeng silently vows to herself to retake the test. The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with this paragraph as the story revolves around Saeng, who fails her driver's test and notices a familiar plant, leading her to a florist shop. Learning about this plant encourages her to retake the test, as if symbolizing the change from the snow - covered days to the sunny ones.  Previously, Saeng suffered from homesickness, missing her grandmother and childhood keepsakes. The peak of her homesickness is evident when she returns home and tries to explain the nature of the hibiscus to her mother, saying “She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” She was uncomfortable in the new country and wished to return to Vietnam. However, by the end, her attitude shifts from despair to hope. Despite failing the driver's test, she is determined and hopeful, stating “...then I will take the test again.” The change in her attitude is reflected in the excerpt about the geese in the last paragraph, showing that she has grown and is ready to face new challenges in the new country.
1666	10537	4	2	I believe he included this part to convey that when the snow melts, one should let go of past experiences. When the geese return, it presents a new opportunity. And when the hibiscus begins to bud, it signifies moving past the challenges one has faced. This sequence of natural events symbolizes a cycle of renewal and the ability to look forward with a fresh perspective.
1667	10538	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because both the conversation and the text discuss the cold, weather, and the @CAPS1. The mention of the snow melting is in line with the ongoing theme of weather and the @CAPS1 within the story, tying together these elements to bring the narrative to a close.
1668	10539	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to demonstrate the impact of the story's events on the main character. At the start, we learn that the main character failed her driver's test. Additionally, she spent a significant amount of money on a single plant, which shocked her mother. At this point, readers would expect her to be extremely sad and depressed. However, influenced by her grandmother and her homeland, she surprises readers by adopting a positive outlook. She states that when the flower blooms again, she will retake the test. This connection between the main character and the plant gives the plant a human - like quality, enhancing the story's emotional resonance.
1669	10540	4	2	"I'm of the opinion that the author concluded the story with that particular paragraph to convey the overall theme of the narrative. The paragraph encapsulates the themes of determination and the ability to overcome obstacles. Saeng, who hails from another country, faces challenges not only in the garden but also in her daily life. She has had to adapt to a new environment and remain steadfast in her goals. By stating, ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" she clearly demonstrates her determination and her fearlessness in the face of future obstacles. This conclusion effectively drives home the story's core message."
1670	10541	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way as it allows the main character to focus on the future rather than dwelling on the pain of the past. By looking ahead, she can put the past behind her and strive for better results in the future. This approach of forward - thinking not only provides a sense of hope but also gives the story a positive and inspiring ending.
1671	10542	4	2	The author concludes the story with this part as she described, “a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear.” It seems that she implies that while the geese flew with their heads held high, Saeng did not. When she says, “Next year when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” she means that she will not be down - cast and will be grateful for her new home over time. When she looks at her hibiscus, she will recall memories without feeling sad.
1672	10543	4	2	There are two reasons for the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph. Firstly, Saeng silently picked up a Winter Hibiscus as she aimed to pass the driving test. Secondly, she wants to retake the driving test to pass it and be able to drive once she succeeds. These two reasons make it quite confusing to understand what the author intended to convey in the story with that sentence.
1673	10544	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes this paragraph in the story to show Saeng's longing for the geese. This choice of ending helps to emphasize Saeng's emotional connection with the geese and adds a layer of depth to her character within the story.
1674	10545	4	2	There are multiple possible reasons for the author's way of ending her story, “Winter Hibiscus”. Saeng's mother comments on the flowers Saeng unexpectedly bought, saying, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here…”. The ending nearly repeats this line. When Saeng makes her vow, she is essentially telling herself that she too has the strength to endure the winter and beyond. Additionally, the author states, “…she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar to her now.” This shows that although Saeng still deeply misses her country, she will eventually adapt to her new home and prevail. When Saeng vows to retake her test in the spring, it is evident that subconsciously, she believes she can overcome these hardships with time.
1675	10546	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus”, Saeng says she will take the test again in the spring so she can walk home and see the flower she found. The story also mentions that she saw the same flower in her home country during her childhood. She is disappointed because she paid over nineteen dollars for the test. Her mother was astonished and briefly yelled at her. Saeng started crying, and her mother calmed down to show sympathy. Now, she has the determination to retake the test. This determination shows that despite the set - back, Saeng is ready to face the challenge again and move forward.
1676	10547	4	2	"Minfong Ho, the author of ""Winter Hibiscus"", ended the story with @ORGANIZATION1 contemplating spring to imbue @ORGANIZATION1's future with hope. The character @ORGANIZATION1 appeared despondent and frequently reminisced about her past in Vietnam. Upon seeing the Hibiscus and Jasmine flowers, she ""broke down and wept"", and the scent of Jasmine made her recall her grandmother fixing her hair. Compounding @ORGANIZATION1's distress was her failure in the driving test, a significant letdown for most teenagers. At this juncture in the story, I felt sympathy for @ORGANIZATION1 and wondered if her situation would improve, as she was far from all she knew and loved, with only memories and a winter hibiscus different from those in Vietnam. Then, in the last line, @ORGANIZATION1 suddenly became hopeful about her future, stating, ""when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" This shift in @ORGANIZATION1's outlook suggests that even in the face of adversity, there is always the possibility of hope and a brighter future."
1677	10548	4	2	"The conclusion of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" offers a glimmer of hope for the future. The protagonist, Saeng, has just failed her test and is deeply dejected. Through a sequence of events, her despondency fades, and she begins to feel hopeful. The final sentence, ""Then I will take that test again,"" showcases Saeng's resolve. She was disheartened about leaving her home and failing the test, yet a flower helped her regain her confidence. It is easy to succumb to despair when faced with setbacks. Prior to the final paragraph, the story's tone was bleak. However, the conclusion acts like a beacon of light in a dark tunnel. The author implies that even when circumstances seem insurmountable, there is always something that can lift one's spirits. Every negative situation has a silver lining; one just needs to look for it."
1678	10549	4	2	I suspect that it implies that during winter or spring, it becomes more arduous to cultivate a garden. Perhaps it poses a certain challenge to make the garden thrive during that time of the year. Therefore, I assume this is what it refers to. In essence, the difficulty of growing a garden during specific seasons might symbolize the obstacles we encounter in life. Just as a gardener must persevere through the challenges of the seasons to see their garden flourish, we too must face our difficulties with determination to achieve our goals.
1679	10550	4	2	The author includes the sentence at the end of the story because throughout the narrative, it portrays courage. This explains the character's improvement and her display of bravery in deciding to retake the test and not allowing the initial failure to discourage her. The inclusion of this sentence serves to emphasize the theme of resilience and the importance of not giving up in the face of setbacks. It shows that even when faced with failure, one can find the strength to persevere and achieve success.
1680	10551	4	2	In my opinion, the author concluded the story with this paragraph for several reasons. It could signify a new beginning or a fresh start. For instance, when the geese fly away and return, it indicates a change in the @CAPS1. Therefore, the changing or restarting of the @CAPS1 could represent the character's opportunity to retake the test and get another chance. This conclusion suggests that change can bring about new possibilities and that setbacks are not the end but rather an opportunity for growth and redemption.
1681	10552	4	2	I believe they perceive it as a means to bring them good fortune.
1682	10553	4	2	The author concluded the story with this paragraph as it demonstrates that one can overcome challenges with willpower. Saeng failed her first test. She bought a plant that reminded her of home and planted it despite the cold, hard ground. She came to realize that what was once strange had become part of her daily life. She then decided to retake the test. Saeng understood that even if one fails once, they should keep trying if it's something they believe in. She also recognized that while she'd never forget her home, she could still move forward. Finally, she realized that good can triumph over bad. After failing the test, she bought the flower, and the author's concluding paragraph perfectly summarizes the story.
1683	10554	4	2	The author includes the excerpt at the end for a significant reason related to Saeng. The hibiscus symbolizes her home, her past, and her comfort. Saeng believes that if the flower can bloom, so can she. This belief enables her to adapt to her new home and retake the test. The flower also represents hope, as just as the plant can survive winter and bloom in spring, so can Saeng. The author uses this connection to link Saeng's feelings with the reality of the flower's ability to bloom.
1684	10555	4	2	The author concludes with this statement because geese migrate south in winter and return in spring. Similarly, Saeng failed her test in winter but will retake it when spring arrives. When Saeng fails her driving test and sees the familiar plant, it indicates she will return to take the test. Just as the geese leave and come back with the changing season, both the geese and Saeng have reasons to return or retake the test. The author adds this statement at the end as the geese's actions mirror Saeng's.
1685	10556	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng was not going to give up. Throughout the story, she felt down, from failing the test to missing Vietnam. Many aspects of where she and her mother lived reminded her of Vietnam, like when she “closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair...”. This made her emotional, highlighting how much these things reminded her of home. The author ended the story this way to show how the entire experience affected her.
1686	10557	4	2	The author opts to conclude the story in this manner to instill a sense of determination. Saeng acquires the plant to evoke memories of her homeland and uplift her spirits. Once the plant blossoms, she believes she too will thrive and be prepared for the test.
1687	10558	4	2	In my view, the author concluded the passage with a highly impactful statement: “When the geese come back … in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” This statement clearly demonstrates renewal and persistence. I think the author included this because after realizing that the plant can rejuvenate repeatedly, even after enduring harsh weather, she understood that she could do the same. The girl vowed to herself that when the time comes again, she would renew herself and get back on track. It also conveys persistence. The plant is hardy and doesn't die each season; it always comes back. If the girl can be persistent and retake the test next year, she will be seen as persistent. I believe the girl wants to be like the flower, seeing it as indomitable, renewing, and beautiful. No matter where it is grown, the plant always retains those qualities.
1688	10559	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way to convey to readers that Saeng won't give up just because she fails the test on her first attempt. She aims to achieve success so that her mother can be proud of her and to prove to herself that she is making an effort. The text states that Saeng will retake the test in spring when the snow has melted, the geese have returned, and the hibiscus is budding. The hibiscus is not only significant in the story but also in her life. It helps her move forward and understand how things change, develop, and adapt over time. Although it disappointed her mother, her mother somewhat understood why she brought the plant home, as it might have comforted her. There were likely many factors contributing to her missing the test as she was away from home. She has to adjust and adapt to her current situation.
1689	10560	4	2	In my opinion, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test, and when the same time of year rolls around again, she'll have another chance to pass it. I base this on the fact that the text mentions she paid over @MONEY1 for something, while all the vegetable seeds in the garden didn't even cost that much. This is why I believe the author concluded with that paragraph.
1690	10561	4	2	Next winter, when it's time to plant again, she'll be ready. This time, she'll do a much better job.
1691	10562	4	2	"The author included this passage to indicate that it was winter, a time when the flower was about to bloom and the geese were flying in due to the cold. Additionally, since the story is titled ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" which clearly features a hibiscus that blooms in winter, this is likely the reason the author wrote what she did."
1692	10563	4	2	"The author of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the narrative with a statement that when Saeng's hibiscus first buds in the spring, she will return to take the driver's test. The author might have chosen this conclusion to prompt readers to consider what would happen if the plant died. Would Saeng still go back to take the test? Presumably, the author intended for readers to engage deeply with this thought. In conclusion, the author likely concluded the story in this way to create an element of suspense."
1693	10564	4	2	"The story concludes with this line because Saeng draws strength from the hibiscus. As a result, the next time she takes the driver's test, she will not fail. During the time it takes for the hibiscus to grow, Saeng will also mature as a person and thus be better prepared for the test. As the story states, ""Plants that she had even realized she had known but forgotten drew her back into her childhood world"" (Ho). Saeng had a happy childhood filled with love and support. By encountering these plants again, especially the hibiscus, she can draw strength from those memories. However, these memories also bring deep sadness, as described in the story: ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her"" (Ho). Experiencing this sadness will only make her stronger. Moreover, beyond the sight of the hibiscus, other factors will also prepare her for the test. The story mentions, ""It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet towards the center – just as she had known it would feel"" (Ho). The texture of the hibiscus in that month reminds Saeng of distant memories, such as helping her grandmother with her hair. All these experiences will strengthen Saeng, ensuring that she will pass the test on her next attempt."
1694	10565	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring, after the snow has melted, the protagonist will retake the test. This conclusion ties the character's action to the natural cycle of the seasons, suggesting a renewal and a fresh start for her to succeed in the test.
1695	10566	4	2	The quote above indicates that Saeng is glad to be back. Moreover, Saeng expresses her readiness to repeat the experience if necessary. This shows her positive attitude and resilience, suggesting that she has learned from the past and is willing to face challenges again.
1696	10567	4	2	I believe the author concluded the story in such a way because it was cold outside. Moreover, I think what the author is trying to convey is that when she wrote this letter, the cold weather made her decide not to take the test until it got warmer. As stated, “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this is when the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test over again.” This clearly shows the influence of the cold on the decision.
1697	10568	4	2	The author has multiple reasons for including the line “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Firstly, the girl left everything behind to come to this country and cannot afford to fail. She mentions, “That at last, she could hold on to. But where was the fine - footed come? the hibiscus hedge?” The hibiscus hedge was all she had from her old home, apart from her mother. When the “hibiscus is budding,” it symbolizes a new life and growth, mirroring the girl's journey of moving on and growing in her new life. Overall, these elements contribute to the author's choice of this line.
1698	10569	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because repeating the attempt is likely to yield better results now that they have gained experience. Moreover, if the second attempt is successful and generates sufficient output, they can sell it for profit. This provides an incentive for them to continue the activity for years to come, making the repetition a viable and potentially rewarding option.
1699	10570	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with Saeng's resolution to demonstrate her unwavering determination and refusal to give up. The mention of spring blossoms symbolizes Saeng's fight to overcome hardships, represented by winter. Just as the hibiscus struggles to adapt to a new home, Saeng is grappling with adapting to a new country. The final paragraph resolves Saeng's internal conflict throughout the story by suggesting her success in taking the test. In conclusion, this final paragraph effectively resolves the story's conflict and showcases Saeng's determination to the reader.
1700	10571	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it reveals what Saeng will do and whether she will attend school. Saeng doesn't want to go to school; instead, she will wait for the snow to melt, the geese to return, and the hibiscus to bud. She prefers gardening to school as it reminds her of her homeland. For instance, Saeng dug a hole and carefully placed the winter hibiscus in it. The sounds like the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan, and the pungent smell of bitter melon wafting out all bring back memories of her homeland. Also, when she went to the corner of the vegetable patch and started digging a hole, it shows her care for the garden. All these details explain the author's choice of conclusion.
1701	10572	4	2	The author concludes the story with the quote “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This is because the author aims to show that nature and the plant hold value for Saeng. Saeng, the one who utters the quote, believes the hibiscus will assist her in passing the test. Earlier in the story, it is shown that when she encounters trouble, she rubs the plant leaves in her hands to overcome the problem. The author clearly portrays the idea that the plant helps Saeng deal with obstacles.
1702	10573	4	2	At the end of the story, the girl Saeng vows to herself that she will take the driver's test next year. One reason for this vow is to prove that she can pass the test. Additionally, after she bought and planted the flower, and as she remembered all the good times she had in Vietnam, it gave her the confidence to go out and pursue what she wanted. In conclusion, the flower and her determination play significant roles in her decision to retake the test.
1703	10574	4	2	In my opinion, the author includes this in the paragraph to be sarcastic, indicating that it is nearly impossible for Saeng to retake the test. The author's sarcasm implies that Saeng won't take the test. For instance, if someone told me to take a test and I responded with “whenever @LOCATION1 is president again, then I'll take the test,” it would be a sarcastic way of saying it won't happen and I'm not taking the test, rather than simply saying “No.” By including this, the author makes it clear that the chances of Saeng taking the test are very low.
1704	10575	4	2	The author includes this paragraph to bring an end to the story and to demonstrate that Saeng has not given up. The author wants to show how the plant and the geese symbolize the continuation of Saeng's life in the United States. The geese will return, the hibiscus will bud and flower, and Saeng will retake and hopefully pass her driving test. This paragraph is not just a conclusion but a new beginning for the geese, the winter hibiscus, and Saeng.
1705	10576	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to showcase Saeng's strength and encouragement. When she is willing and capable, she will take the test again with greater confidence. Saeng says this to herself to help her persevere until she can drive. She states that by next spring, she will take her test, be able to drive, and be accustomed to her new home. This paragraph conveys the message that it takes time to achieve things and one should keep trying instead of expecting immediate success.
1706	10577	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was disheartened about failing her driving test. However, upon seeing the flowers, she realized that since coming to @CAPS1, she had forgotten about her hometown. Consequently, she decided to reconnect with nature and postpone taking the test until spring rather than rushing into it.
1707	10578	4	2	I firmly believe that the author concludes the story with that specific paragraph to convey that the character still harbors hope of finding a sense of home and attaining happiness. In her mind, the hibiscus plant serves as a symbol of home and the happy memories she shared with her grandmother. Thus, when the plant buds, she will feel as if she is home again and will be content, and that is when she will take the driving test. Moreover, that paragraph indicates that she is gradually adapting to her new home and lifestyle. As stated, “A flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks dear and—yes—familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, like these geese.” Based on these examples, I am of the opinion that the narrator included that last paragraph to illustrate Saeng's assimilation into her new lifestyle and her acceptance of her circumstances.
1708	10579	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng did not abandon the idea of taking the test. For instance, she declares, “I will take the test again.” This shows her desire to take the test and achieve a passing grade. Saeng intends to wait until spring arrives and the snow melts before retaking the test. At the beginning of the text, it mentions her taking the test, and it concludes with her decision to take it again, highlighting her perseverance.
1709	10580	4	2	"At the conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" author Minfong Ho ends the story by having Saeng vow silently, “when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The author chooses this ending to reveal the hope that awaits Saeng in the future. After failing her driver's test, Saeng returns home dejected and sorrowful. Nevertheless, this final paragraph suggests that her luck is about to change. Readers are left with the implication that Saeng will retake the test and succeed. Additionally, this ending paragraph reflects Saeng's determined nature as she overcomes the many obstacles she faces in @CAPS1. It proves that she will not give up, even after being forced to live in the United States instead of her homeland. Her success in adapting to her new life is evident in the quote, “Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become... almost familiar.” Undoubtedly, Saeng is a tenacious character."
1710	10581	4	2	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is that the entire story revolves around a girl missing her home country. This paragraph implies that by the next @DATE1, the girl will have adapted to her new country. Both the story and the paragraph showcase the girl's strength in overcoming challenges. This is precisely why the author chose to end the story with this paragraph, highlighting the girl's ability to persevere and adapt.
1711	10582	4	2	The author conveys to the readers that they plan to repeat the same actions next year. This will occur after the show has ended, when the geese return, and when the weather is warm enough for the hibiscus flowers to bud and bloom. The author also concludes the passage to indicate that this is the life the young girl has chosen, and she will continue her gardening activities until the next spring.
1712	10584	4	2	Saeng ended the story with that paragraph as it reflects her recent experiences and her belief that she can endure similar situations again. If she fails the driving test once more, she intends to rely on the plants to overcome her difficulties. In fact, she passed the test this time. The unique plants demonstrate that she is stronger than she previously thought, and she now feels at ease with them, as they evoke memories of her childhood.
1713	10585	4	2	She demonstrates her love for her grandmother and the activities they engage in, such as gardening. Her mother cares about her, yet she is quite strict with her. This combination of love from her grandmother and strict care from her mother shapes her family environment.
1714	10586	4	2	The author concluded the story in a manner that broadens the reader's perspective. It reveals to the readers that regardless of what happened in @MONTH1, no matter how dire the situation seems or how hopeless one may feel, there is always a way to improve things. Saeng failed her test, was in an unfamiliar land, and had lost her grandmother, but she still intended to try again. Just as the waves on the shore continuously attempt to wash away the sand by returning, Saeng is willing to persevere, and we should all adopt the same attitude.
1715	10587	4	2	The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph because the current season has come to an end, and a new season is about to commence. This conclusion marks the transition between the two seasons within the story's context.
1716	10588	4	2	The author concludes the story with the line “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. This quote implies that once the flower buds, Saeng will retake the test as she will possess the courage and determination, confident in passing it. The flower serves as a source of motivation and determination for her. Just as everyone has something that drives them in life, Saeng has her plant. The author also provides a hint about the story's direction when the flower buds.
1717	10589	4	2	Saeng is not only disappointed about failing her driver's test; she is also upset and longing for her home in Vietnam. While walking home, she spots a piece of Vietnam in the United States. She buys a beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to remind her of her past. The story's end combines the two different countries, cultures, and almost worlds that make up her life. When she says, “when they come back,” she refers to the geese, which symbolize her life in the new place and how she has adapted to it. The hibiscus symbolizes her life and past in Vietnam, bringing back memories. Buying the plant was like getting a piece of home. When the “hibiscus is budding,” she will attempt the test again. When this piece of home grows, she will try again. When she is more stable in the new culture while still firmly rooted in her own, she will be ready.
1718	10590	4	2	I believe the author ended the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is not a quitter. Saeng can't wait for the hibiscus to come back. When it does, she will retake the test and prove to her mother that she can do it.
1719	10591	4	2	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because when Saeng saw the geese, she knew that when spring returned, she would be ready to seek different flowers. She recalls her homeland, where she could see flowers growing from the ground. Now in the city, she hopes the flowers will blossom like those back home, which she misses greatly. She describes the flowers as her friends and remembers the “Madagascar periwinkle” growing wild from the cracks in brick walls or tiled roofs. Essentially, the author indicates that Saeng is ready to search for other plants she remembers from her homeland.
1720	10592	4	2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the development of Saeng's character. At the story's start, Saeng is disheartened after failing her driver's test. However, the ending paragraph shows the change she undergoes. In the text, Saeng struggles to adapt to the transition from Vietnam to @LOCATION2 and finds comfort in a native Vietnamese flower, the winter hibiscus. By including the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (“...and this hibiscus is budding...”), the author portrays Saeng's change in attitude and her acceptance of @LOCATION2. Saeng believes that, like the hibiscus returning after winter, she will be able to retake and pass the driver's test. Additionally, the concluding paragraph shows Saeng's new adaptation to the creatures of @LOCATION2. Before imagining @LOCATION4, she had no experience with Canada geese. In the concluding statement, her mention of the geese demonstrates her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (“...when the snow melts and the geese return...”). This shows Saeng's development and adjustment to her new environment. Initially, Saeng had difficulty leaving Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, the concluding paragraph summarizes the significant change she experiences. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to highlight Saeng's character development.
1721	10593	4	2	They end the story in this way because winter has passed and spring has arrived. The world will once again be beautiful.
1722	10594	4	2	The author concludes the story with the statement “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again.” As time passes, she will become more accustomed to things. For instance, the author notes that “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This indicates that over time, she will grow more familiar with driving and then retake the test, expecting to pass it.
1723	10595	4	2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” chose to conclude the story in this manner to incorporate the theme of new beginnings. Saeng is new to @LOCATION1 and has struggled to fit in. She yearns for her old home, missing her grandmother and the plants there. After failing her driving test, she feels defeated. However, the hibiscus plant helps her recognize that she has another opportunity. Just as the hibiscus can survive winter and bloom in spring, Saeng realizes she must do the same. The last paragraph states, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Spring symbolizes new beginnings, with geese returning and flowers blooming, and Saeng can retake the driving test. In the last paragraph, Saeng decides she wants a new start in spring. Ultimately, the last paragraph weaves the theme of new beginnings into the story, demonstrating Saeng's new realization and the inspiration from the hibiscus.
1724	10596	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's strong desire to pass the test. We can tell this from the line “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept,” which shows her reluctance to fail. When Saeng got home with the white - budded plant in the pot and was crying, her mother intended to plant it. But Saeng took the shovel and did it herself, which made her realize she can take the test again.
1725	10597	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for multiple reasons. Firstly, when the hibiscus buds in spring, it signifies that the plant is about to bloom. This also implies that Saeng will be prepared to retake the test in spring. Additionally, the last paragraph is placed at the end because if the plant can endure and thrive, then Saeng can pass her driver's test and find happiness.
1726	10598	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because they are suggesting that it will be a significant year or that some change is about to occur. The author feels that they could have performed better than they did and intends to retake the test.
1727	10599	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the new beginning that Saeng seeks. Saeng was extremely disappointed after failing her driver's test, and the hibiscus was what brought her happiness. She needed a fresh start in a new country. The flower, the snow, the geese, and the test all symbolize new beginnings and challenges to overcome. The geese and snow represent a change in season, the budding hibiscus represents new life, and passing the test represents a milestone in Saeng's life. Ending the story with this paragraph makes the reader anticipate something new and exciting happening to Saeng.
1728	10600	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey to the reader that she is not finished with gardening and will return when the plants bloom again. Additionally, she has no intention of stopping. She prefers gardening over going to school. This is the conclusion the author reaches about the story in the last paragraph.
1729	10601	4	2	The author concludes the story with the words “then I will take that test again” to let the readers know that she will not give up on something she failed once. She is determined to persevere until she passes “the test”.
1730	10602	4	2	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story as she understands that one should not fear trying a new life or environment. In the story, the mother says, “It’s flowers aren’t pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months. Here, this winter hibiscus.” This shows that the mother wants Saeng to learn to be strong in difficult times. Another instance is when the narrator states, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season…” This indicates that Saeng realized the new place she is in is similar to their old home. In conclusion, the last paragraph implies that Saeng should face the new reality of the world, be strong, and go with the flow of life.
1731	10603	4	2	The author concluded the story for an internal adjustment. Saeng's memories are conveyed through the one related to the hibiscus. Spring is a season of freshness and new beginnings. As spring arrives, Saeng's hope will be restored and flourish, just like the budding hibiscus. She will then have the ability to attempt the test again with greater strength and inspiration.
1732	10604	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with the main character, Saeng, promising to take the driving test in spring when the hibiscus blooms. This shows readers that even after the story ends, Saeng won't give up. The author incorporates the idea of the blooming hibiscus because it symbolizes strength for Saeng. The hibiscus is common in her home - country, and the one she bought reminds her of what she left behind when she moved from Vietnam to @LOCATION1. Saeng is trying to adapt to her new lifestyle and uses the hibiscus as a coping mechanism during tough times. After buying the flower, she vows to retake the failed driver's test after spring, a symbol of a fresh start. Saeng believes that if the hibiscus can survive the winter in @LOCATION1, so can she. The story's conclusion uses much imagery suggesting that Saeng will be strong and continue her life in @LOCATION1.
1733	10605	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the character fails the test and learns to appreciate nature a little better. This outcome of the character's experience is what prompts the author to end the story in such a way, showing the character's growth through this set - back and newfound appreciation.
1734	10606	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as Saeng will go back to the flowers in spring. This ending implies a continuation of her connection with the flowers and perhaps a renewal of hope or a new chapter in her story. It gives the impression that there is more to come for Saeng, and her relationship with the flowers will play a part in it.
1735	10607	4	2	The author presents this idea based on the principle of perseverance: if you fail once, try again. For instance, when taking a test and failing the first time, retaking it increases the chance of passing. In the story, Saeng couldn't pass a test, and allowing her to retake it could have led to a passing result. Additionally, seeking help or using study materials like books can be beneficial. Studying hard makes it easier to pass a test. This is the meaning I attribute to the author's statement.
1736	10608	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it represents how each year commences and concludes.
1737	10609	4	2	In my view, the author ends the story with this paragraph to convey to the reader that Saeng has found solace in the hibiscus and is ready to retake the driver's test. At the start of the story, Saeng was distraught and frustrated about failing the test, as shown when she told her mother, “the tear - stains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. I - I failed the test.” Clearly, she was disappointed in herself. The author didn't want a sad, unfulfilling ending. By the end, Saeng's attitude changes. She vows, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” I believe this change is due to the memories of her mother country and her mother's comfort. In conclusion, the author ended the story this way to teach the reader that change should be embraced and time can heal.
1738	10610	4	2	In my opinion, the author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with the motivational paragraph to show that Saeng is determined to adapt to her new life and home and overcome challenges like the driver's test. Saeng struggled to cope with her problem, so she bought a hibiscus as it reminded her of home. I think the line “and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” from the last paragraph symbolizes growing up and surmounting obstacles. Overall, the story's conclusion is a heartening ending.
1739	10611	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because when the snow melts and the geese return, she will have more confidence to take and pass the test. After she failed the test, the geese flew away. So, when they return, they will remind her of what happened. Also, when spring comes and the snow melts, the hibiscus flower will bloom again, which gives her hope.
1740	10612	4	2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” spring brings new hopes, comfort, and belief. As Saeng said, “in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The return of the hibiscus brings new hope for her to take the test. Here, the hibiscus symbolizes hope. Secondly, when she said “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” it offers her comfort, which is stronger than hope. Her mother's support also boosts her confidence as it's not easy without her mother's comfort. Finally, when she mentioned “Canada geese flew by, their faint honks dear and yes familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetitions of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,” it means that as the season changes and the hibiscus grows, she will regain the belief and strength needed to take the test. The hibiscus means new hopes, comfort, and belief to her.
1741	10613	4	2	"After failing her driving test, Saeng returns home and finds comfort in a hibiscus flower. The flower, similar to those that grew near her old home, evokes cherished memories of her homeland. The author concludes the story with Saeng silently vowing, ""When they come back, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" By doing so, the author compares Saeng to the hibiscus. Just as the hibiscus must adapt to new surroundings, so must Saeng. Saeng recognizes this connection and is inspired by it, believing that if the hibiscus can survive being moved, then she can too."
1742	10614	4	2	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" serves as an extended metaphor, symbolizing both the connection to a comforting past and the anticipation of the future. Saeng yearns for her homeland but must learn to adapt to her current circumstances and pass her driver's test. The story reaches a satisfying conclusion when Saeng promises herself that come spring, she will retake the test. The hibiscus flower prompts this promise, offering her a sense of closure and alleviating some of her homesickness. Saeng's promise indicates that she is coming to terms with her situation. When she sees the Canada geese flying, she has an epiphany about the seasons. As the text states, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become... almost familiar to her now."" This realization is a significant milestone for Saeng, and the conclusion of the story demonstrates her ability to change."
1743	10615	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng shares a profound emotional bond with the memories and flashbacks triggered by the hibiscus. At one point in the story, she cries in mourning for her grandmother as the hibiscus plants stir up those memories. Later, she takes the plant to her mother. Initially, her mother is upset, but she eventually understands her daughter's actions and feelings. Saeng is disappointed about failing her test, and her mother empathizes with her. I believe the author ends the story this way to show that because the hibiscus is so important to Saeng and reminds her of her past, it will serve as a reason and motivation for her to persevere and achieve her goal of passing the test."
1744	10616	4	2	As winter approaches, the geese are flying south, and the plants are shedding their leaves. Saeng declares that she will take the test again. It appears that the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus will instill hope and confidence in her. The hibiscus, in particular, holds great significance as it reminds her of her homeland and her grandmother. When she first saw the hibiscus and held its leaf, it brought a tear to her eye. When the hibiscus returns next year, it will rejuvenate her spirit and give her the strength to face her challenges.
1745	10617	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she believes it effectively explains what transpired with Saeng. By including this paragraph, the author provides a clear and comprehensive account of the events and Saeng's experiences, allowing the reader to fully understand the story's outcome.
1746	10618	4	2	The author concludes the story with the last paragraph as it reveals the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscuses and conveys the emotions evoked by merely observing them. Additionally, it demonstrates that the hibiscus serves as a motivator for her, as it reminds her of her beloved homeland, akin to possessing a tangible memory of it.
1747	10619	4	2	The author draws a parallel, stating that just as geese return when ready and a flower buds and grows in its own time, she too will take the test when she is prepared. She is emphasizing that, like the geese and flowers, she requires time. Thus, Saeng can be compared to both the geese and the hibiscus, as they all need time to fulfill their respective purposes. In a sense, Saeng has become one with these two entities.
1748	10620	4	2	In my view, the author ends the story with this concluding sentence because it symbolizes the girl's perception of things. The girl believes that when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, it indicates the arrival of warmth. This warmth uplifts her spirit as it reminds her of her homeland. I think being reminded of her homeland will make it easier for her to take the test, as she will be happier. I believe this will enable her to perform better on the test. For instance, the author mentioned in the story that the flower brings her comfort. I firmly believe that being comfortable is the key to success and passing the test. In conclusion, I think the author ends the story in this way to help readers understand the connection between the girl and her homeland and how the flower provides her with comfort.
1749	10621	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it presents an interesting ending that is relevant to the story.
1750	10622	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with that statement because it shows that she is adapting to the new place. Moreover, it indicates that she will not give up. Just as geese do not abandon their annual back - and - forth flights between winter and spring, she perseveres.
1751	10623	4	2	In the short - story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng decides to retake her failed driver's test in spring. The moderate spring weather comforts her as it reminds her of home, to which she is deeply attached. This also makes me recall all the places I've visited and my favorite among them. Similar to Saeng, I purchase items that evoke memories of my old home. Saeng's strong connection to her past home makes me feel less alone when I miss mine.
1752	10624	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng intends to start afresh and perform better the second time. Her motivation stems from not wanting to disappoint herself. This is the reason the author chose to end the story with this particular paragraph.
1753	10625	4	2	I firmly believe the author concludes the story in this way as it symbolizes a new beginning. Spring is a season of renewal; plants regain their vitality, animals reappear, and the sun shines brightly. Just as it is a fresh start for nature, it can be the same for Saeng. It offers her an opportunity to try again. Another factor is Saeng's love for nature. The return of nature around her might instill hope and confidence in her, enabling her to pass the test. In conclusion, these are the reasons why I think the author ended the story as they did.
1754	10626	4	2	The final paragraph of the story reads, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In my view, the author concluded the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's adaptation and her emerging acceptance of change. Throughout the story, she was visibly upset and resistant to change, as evidenced by the line “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” The last paragraph exudes optimism, with references to the blooming flower and returning geese, suggesting that she is starting to embrace the change. In conclusion, I believe the author added this paragraph to show Saeng's growing acceptance and optimism.
1755	10627	4	2	Saeng informed her mother that she had failed the test. She wanted to make amends by helping out in the garden. Her mother welcomed her in and then began preparing dinner. This shows Saeng's attempt to take responsibility for her failure and her mother's normal routine of taking care of the family, suggesting that they are dealing with the situation in their own ways.
1756	10628	4	2	The author decides to take the driving test when the geese return in spring. She believes that by then, she will be better prepared, as this will provide her with more time to learn and study. With a more focused mind, free from distractions of home, she anticipates that completing the test will be easier. Having failed the test previously, she feels remorseful, as if she has let her mother down. The statement “I just stared at the hibiscus” reflects her deep - seated shame, to the point where she couldn't even look at her mother. Thus, in the coming spring, she is determined to pass the test and bring happiness to her mother, confident that she will be fully ready.
1757	10629	4	2	The author selected this paragraph because it symbolizes that when the snow melts and the geese return, the flowers at location @CAPS1 bloom. There is one particular flower that is associated with the tests at @CAPS2. This connection between the natural phenomena of snow melting, geese returning, and flower - blooming and the tests gives the paragraph its significance in the context of the story.
1758	10630	4	2	The author concludes the story with the chosen paragraph to convey the message of perseverance. By doing so, she emphasizes the importance of never giving up. At the end of the story, she realizes that she will eventually be prepared. The line “... Slowly fading into the distance” implies that she has come to terms with the fact that events occur as they may, and one should never halt the pursuit of their goals. Another possible reason she might have used this paragraph is to highlight the support of friends and family during difficult times. The line “... Through the quiet repetition of season upon season” suggests that establishing a routine will enable her to achieve her objectives. In essence, the author's choice of conclusion serves to inspire readers to persevere in the face of challenges.
1759	10631	4	2	The author concludes the story with this sentence to draw a comparison between flowers and the test. Ending the story in this way indicates that she will persist in her efforts, season after season, much like the annual return of geese. This shows her unwavering determination and refusal to give up. It is evident that this girl is resolute and will keep trying until she succeeds. Moreover, the last paragraph encapsulates the essence of the entire story. In my opinion, it also imparts a distinct atmosphere that permeates the whole narrative, making the story more engaging and thought - provoking.
1760	10632	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to prompt the reader to engage in deep thought. By ending the story in such a manner, the author intends for the reader to create their own endings or make predictions. Sometimes, this kind of open - ended conclusion can also hint at the possibility of a sequel. Overall, this style of conclusion enriches the reading experience by leaving room for the reader's imagination and speculation.
1761	10633	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to provide a happy ending. The protagonist does not give up and decides to retake the test. Additionally, she wishes to avoid disappointing her mother, aiming to make her happy by giving the test a second attempt.
1762	10634	4	2	She concludes with that statement to illustrate her readiness to experience spring anew in the new country, now that the hibiscus has comforted her. The test represents adapting to the new country, and she believes she failed because she needed the solace of her native plants. However, she is confident that she will pass the test next year as each repetition of the season enables her to become more accustomed to the new culture. When she says, “when the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” these signs signify a new year and make it easier for her to accept the current situation.
1763	10635	4	2	Saeng realized that things come, go, and change. During certain times of the year, the world around her transformed, and she had no control over it. Moreover, she had to cope with living in a new country. Adapting to a new country was difficult for her. She had to consume new foods, listen to new sounds, and witness things she had never seen before. Failing her driving test was a set - back, and not knowing the language and what was happening around her was tough. The world around her was unfamiliar. She understood that she had to change herself and work harder to achieve her goals.
1764	10636	4	2	The author ended the story with that paragraph to convey to readers that the protagonist did not give up. Throughout the story, it seemed that she had thoughts of quitting, but the memories of her homeland comforted her when she was on the verge of giving up. The last paragraph of the story confirmed her determination not to quit.
1765	10637	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story in this way because the beautiful `@CAPS1 brought her good luck. The @NUM1 time around, she didn't know they were there.
1766	10638	4	2	It seems to me that whoever made that statement must have been going through a great deal. They likely felt as though they were being tested, or perhaps someone they deeply loved had left them, as the text mentions “when they come back”. So, I suspect that someone in @MONTH1 left or something similar happened. Additionally, I believe the person in @MONTH1 felt as if they were being tested because the text states “I will take the test again.”
1767	10639	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way as it demonstrates that she remains uncomfortable. For instance, her breakdown in the flower - shop shows that even though certain things can remind her of home, it is not the same. One has to get used to and adapt to a new place. This also indicates that she believes with more time to adjust to her new home, she will be able to pass the test.
1768	10640	4	2	The author has a purpose for using this conclusion. The cliff - hanger style of the conclusion is employed to maintain the reader's interest and make them eager for more. By stating “I will take that test again”, the author prompts the reader to question whether Saeng will pass the test next time and to wonder what “the test” actually is.
1769	10641	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph possibly because she doesn't want the snow to melt, so that the geese won't return. Moreover, I think it aims to inform the reader about Saeng's thoughts.
1770	10642	4	2	The author concluded the story with that quote for a specific reason. The author intended to illustrate how the plant instilled a new sense of determination in Saeng. Previously, Saeng was upset and tearing the plant apart. However, it appears that she realized how the plant was able to bud against the odds and survive. As a result, she is now determined to face the odds as well and retake the test she failed.
