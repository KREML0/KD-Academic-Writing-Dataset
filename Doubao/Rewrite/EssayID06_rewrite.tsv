1	14834	6	2	The construction workers encountered numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Safety was a significant concern due to the use of highly flammable hydrogen gas in dirigibles. In the densely - populated area of New York, an explosion of a dirigible could cause a large number of casualties. Another problem was keeping the dirigible stable so that passengers could disembark while the wind moved the rear of the airship. The only solution was to tie lead weights at the back of the dirigible, but this posed a danger to the people below. Facing these insurmountable obstacles, the workers abandoned the idea and instead created the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for tourists in the observation area.
2	14835	6	2	From the start, there were numerous problems with allowing dirigibles to dock at a certain height in the air. The Empire State Building was being built in New York City, a densely - populated area. Beneath the mooring mast were other buildings where people lived and worked. An accident during docking could destroy these buildings and endanger the lives of those inside. Moreover, the city streets below were filled with pedestrians. The passage also mentions in paragraphs @NUM2 the stress of a heavy, steel - framed airship mooring at the building's top. The frame needed to be very dense, which the project architects found to be expensive. Other safety issues included high winds that could blow dirigibles off course and the inherent safety risks of dirigibles. The Hindenburg incident is mentioned, and the building owners were worried about such an event occurring over a densely populated area. In conclusion, these multiple problems made it unfeasible to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
3	14836	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders encountered many challenges while attempting to permit dirigibles to dock there. One issue was that the dirigible would be held by a single cable tether, which would put stress on the building's frame. To strengthen the frame, modifications were made to the building's framework, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem was the use of highly flammable hydrogen in dirigibles. Given New York's dense population, this was a major safety hazard. Additionally, the dirigibles needed to be weighted down at the back with lead weights, but this would result in the weights dangling above pedestrians on the street, posing a safety risk. Finally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or approach the area. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned.
4	14837	6	2	In the passage “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in enabling dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, a four - term governor of New York who led the construction efforts after his term, made the tower tall. The building initially stood at 1,250 ft, but after nearly losing the title of the world's tallest tower, he announced that a top or “hat” would be added. The tower was intended for dirigibles that could transport people from New York to New Jersey, and Smith wanted a docking place for them. However, the German dirigible “Hindenburg” was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937. The building owners realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had occurred over New York. In the 1930s, after another dirigible attempted a stunt, the idea was dropped. As a result, the Empire State Building never fulfilled its intended purpose.
5	14838	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders faced multiple obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. Firstly, there was an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas, which made it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building. Secondly, safety was a major concern. Most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. If a dirigible caught fire over the densely populated area of New York, many people could be injured. Finally, “nature itself” presented an obstacle. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. Even when a dirigible was attached to the mooring mast, the back of it would move around dangerously. In the end, these numerous obstacles made it impossible for the workers of the Empire State Building to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock there.
6	14839	6	2	Soon after its conception, the Empire State Building's mooring mast was bound to fail. Initially, early challenges were overcome with relative ease. For instance, the issue of additional stress on the building's frame due to the weight of the moored airship was resolved through structural modifications to the building's frame. This was an expensive yet straightforward procedure. One of the most significant setbacks to the project was the occurrence of the Hindenburg disaster. The Hindenburg disaster was the primary cause of the decline of airships. Airplanes emerged as a safer, faster, and more popular form of transportation. Moreover, it soon became evident that mooring an airship at 800 feet or higher was not practical. Strong winds prevented the airship from maintaining its course, causing it to be blown erratically around the mast. The final factor that led to the failure of the mooring mast was a law that prohibited airship travel over urban areas. These multiple factors effectively eliminated any possibility of successful airship travel in the future.
7	14840	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. The architects recognized that they could not install the mooring mast on top of the building without modifying and strengthening the steel frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would add excessive weight to the framework, potentially leading to its collapse. They strengthened the framework from the building's base to its peak before adding the shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless - steel tower on top. Despite these challenges, the builders successfully achieved their goal. Although the mooring mast is not used as a docking station, it is still regarded as the final element that makes the Empire State Building stand out among all buildings in downtown New York City.
8	14841	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, numerous complications arose during the planning and construction of the attempted docking mast. One hurdle was that dirigibles were too heavy, necessitating modifications to the building's metal frame. After repairing the Empire State Building's framework, two trial runs were conducted by the Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear blimp ""Columbia"". The experiment showed that the wind currents physically prevented the blimp from getting close enough to the building to dock. Additionally, an existing law against airships flying too low over urban cities was an insurmountable obstacle. Within a few years of postponing their efforts, airplanes became popular, and dirigibles as a means of transportation were soon forgotten."
9	14842	6	2	The builders faced significant obstacles. They explained that most dirigibles from outside the city used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. They then informed the city about the Hindenburg disaster in 1937, where a hydrogen - filled airship caught fire. They realized that if such an incident occurred in an urban area, the consequences could be far worse. Another obstacle was the wind. If a dirigible was parked at the mooring mast, the strong wind speeds would cause the blimp to shift, putting stress on the building's steel frame. The most significant obstacle was a passed law stating that no airships could fly too low in urban areas, which prevented blimps from landing there. In the end, these combined obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the intended location.
10	14843	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building had a great idea: to tether dirigibles, or blimps, to the top of the building. However, this idea was fraught with problems. Firstly, blimps were not very sturdy. Strong winds could easily blow dirigibles attempting to dock into the spires of other buildings. Dirigibles also began using hydrogen gas instead of helium. Hydrogen gas is extremely flammable, and even the smallest spark could set the entire blimp on fire. The docking system itself was also problematic. The only way to keep a dirigible level was to hang lead weights off the side. There was a concern that a weight could fall off and land in the densely populated city below, which could have been a disaster. Due to these numerous issues, the plan to tether dirigibles to the Empire State Building was ultimately unfeasible.
11	14844	6	2	The idea of creating a docking zone on the Empire State Building was initially grand and innovative. However, it proved extremely difficult to execute. Al Smith, who led the project, was overly eager to complete it. Insufficient time was dedicated to researching the risks and the structure of the dock. As a result, the plan to install it on top of the Empire State Building was doomed to failure from the start. Even before construction began, problems emerged. The building could not withstand the stress exerted by the @DATE1 - foot - long dirigible. The shock would have transferred significant pressure to the foundation, necessitating a roof reconstruction to ensure structural integrity. After months of work and an expenditure of @NUM1 dollars, the construction of the landing dock could finally commence. But life is valuable, and the landing dock was far too unstable and hazardous to be used. The architects failed to consider that most foreign dirigibles were made with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. In @LOCATION1, the hydrogen - constructed Hindenburg caught fire, killing hundreds. There was even a law prohibiting aircraft from hovering too close to urban areas. The concept was flamboyant, yet due to the rushed nature of the project, necessary precautions were overlooked. The numerous obstacles faced by the docking station were insurmountable, leading to the ultimate abandonment of the plan.
12	14845	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building with the aim of enabling dirigibles to dock, the builders encountered continuous obstacles. Architects were unable to simply place a mooring mast on top of the building as @NUM1 ft dirigibles would add stress to the building's framework. Consequently, the framework had to be modified at an additional cost of @MONEY1. There was uncertainty regarding whether these modifications would be effective. Safety was another major concern. Foreign dirigibles typically used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. For instance, when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized the potential severity of such an accident if it occurred over a densely populated area like downtown New York. The architects also had to contend with @ORGANIZATION2 and the constant shifting of winds caused by violent air currents. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around it. Usually, @CAPS1 dirigibles land in open fields and are weighed down to prevent drifting, but this is impossible in the air. Dirigibles dangling high above pedestrians on the streets pose a significant safety risk. Additionally, there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to a building or approach the area. There were two attempts to dock on the building. One attempt in December 1930 by the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible Los Angeles failed due to high - velocity winds preventing it from getting close enough. By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers faded away as airplanes became the future of transportation.
13	14846	6	2	"The construction of the Empire State Building presented the builders with numerous challenges in their efforts to accommodate dirigible docking. One significant obstacle was ensuring that the stress from the dirigible was transferred to the building's foundation rather than the top or middle, where it could potentially cause the building to collapse. As stated in the text, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" @CAPS1, extensive changes were required to make the building stable enough for dirigible docking. Another challenge was the adverse weather conditions above the building, characterized by strong winds and air currents. This would result in dirigibles ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" and having highly flammable hydrogen floating above millions of people is clearly unsafe. Moreover, a great deal of time and effort was spent learning how to safely install a mooring mast. This involved consulting professionals such as the Navy to determine the proper installation method. In conclusion, the mooring mast on the Empire State Building presented a multitude of obstacles that hindered the goal of dirigible docking."
14	14847	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles while trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. Al Smith, the architect and mastermind behind the Empire State Building, was in competition with the maker of the Chrysler building to construct the world's tallest building. To surpass the Chrysler building, Smith planned to build something that John Tauranac described as ""equipped for an age of transportation that was only the dream of aviation pioneers."" That dream was air travel by blimp, and the Empire State Building was intended to have a mooring mast at its top for airship docking. However, the reality was far from the simple concept. Architects could not simply place a mooring mast on the roof as it would stress the building's frame. The most crucial factor preventing the mast from fulfilling its purpose was safety. As the excerpt notes, ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen,"" which is highly flammable. Additionally, there was a law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas."" After numerous attempts and modifications, the plan was ultimately shelved, indicating that despite the initial vision, practical and safety concerns made the project unfeasible."
15	14848	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced the challenge of a lack of a suitable landing area when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. A mooring mast on top of the building was intended to enable dirigibles to anchor for several hours for refueling, servicing, and passenger boarding and disembarking. An electric winch would haul in a line from the front of the ship and tie it to the mast. The body of the dirigible could sway in the breeze, and passengers could safely get on and off by walking down a gang @CAPS1 to an open observation platform. To address these requirements, the builders of the Empire State Building consulted experts. They took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Although they made efforts to find solutions, the initial obstacle of the lack of a proper landing area remained a significant hurdle in the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
16	14849	6	2	In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's work, The Mooring Mast, the engineers of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles while seeking a new method to dock dirigibles. One significant hurdle was the building's steelwork. The wind pressure and the load of the dirigibles led to costs of @MONEY1 for the company. Additionally, they had to design specific floors for the dirigibles' passengers. One floor was designated for baggage and suitcases, and a special observation deck was constructed for passengers to enter or exit the ship. Moreover, with the building now having 102 floors, it needed to be highly durable, necessitating the use of special materials for its construction. Overall, the engineers of the Empire State Building had to overcome many challenges during the construction of the 1,250 - foot building.
17	14850	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several issues when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. These included wind conditions, the actual docking process, and ensuring the safe disembarkation of passengers. Docking was impractical as connecting the winch was nearly impossible. Wind was the main factor determining the fate of the mast. The wind currents were so strong that it was extremely difficult for pilots to get close enough. The captain of the “Navy dirigible Los Angeles” tried to approach the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up due to the strong winds. Even if the dirigible could tie up, its rear would swing violently. In conclusion, the builders were dealing with an unfeasible task.
18	14851	6	2	There were multiple challenges in enabling dirigibles to dock at the relevant location. Firstly, the body frame needed to be reconstructed to support the mooring mast. Secondly, dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. Thirdly, there was a pre - existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, an issue that should have been recognized from the start. Finally, the wind conditions at that altitude made it impossible for dirigibles to land without their tails swaying in the wind. In summary, these obstacles made the docking of dirigibles an unviable proposition.
19	14852	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced an obstacle when trying to enable dirigibles to dock, namely stress on the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. To handle this new situation, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were required for the building's framework. In conclusion, these challenges in dealing with the building's frame were significant in the attempt to allow dirigible docking.
20	14853	6	2	Marcia Amidon L¸sted's The Mooring Mast presents the well - thought - out yet obstacle - laden concept of attaching a landing dock to the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered various problems. The wind speeds at the dirigibles' landing areas were extremely strong, causing the balloons to be tossed around like rag dolls. Using lead weights was considered, but this raised concerns about the building's foundation as the combined weight of the building and the lead weights might cause the structure to collapse. The gases used for flight, hydrogen and helium, had issues; hydrogen is highly flammable and cannot be used in populated areas. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. All these obstacles meant that the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never able to fulfill its intended purpose.
21	14854	6	2	"The Empire State Building's builders encountered numerous obstacles while trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One significant hurdle was constructing a mooring mast that wouldn't endanger the building's structure. They had to modify and strengthen the building's frame; as the excerpt states, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the framework."" Another major obstacle was safety. Given the Empire State Building's height, it would have been illegal to land a dirigible. At that time, dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, and an explosion would pose a threat to the hundreds of pedestrians on New York City's streets. In conclusion, these obstacles made the task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building extremely challenging."
22	14855	6	2	When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. The strong wind current could cause the dirigible to drag the building, and the combined weight of the dirigible and wind pressure might lead to the building's collapse. Al Smith, realizing he was close to losing the title of the world's tallest building, announced on December 11, 1929, that the Empire State Building would reach a height of 1,250 feet. However, as the building got taller, the stronger wind currents added more stress. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down with lead weights, but this was neither practical nor safe at the Empire State Building, where the weights would dangle above pedestrians. The gases used to make the dirigible lighter than air are highly flammable. These were some of the obstacles the Empire State Building's builders had to overcome.
23	14856	6	2	"In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's The Mooring Mast, the Empire State Building's builders faced an obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were considered the transportation of the future, but ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (@NUM1). This indicates that the dirigible needed a proper landing area and there wasn't enough space. Some dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City (@NUM2), showing the difficulty of fitting them. Architects had to figure out a way to make it work. Thus, the lack of a suitable area was an obstacle the Empire State Building's builders faced. In summary, this shortage of space presented a significant challenge for the docking of dirigibles at the building."
24	14857	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced arduous circumstances and multiple obstacles when designing the building to accommodate a new means of travel by enabling blimp mooring over one thousand feet in the air. The first obstacle was designing a landing area, as the required architecture had never been created or attempted before. The second was ensuring the building could withstand the stress from the blimp. As paragraph @NUM1 states, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" Refurbishing the steel frame at the Empire State Building to address this was time - consuming, labor - intensive, and cost over sixty thousand dollars. ""The greatest obstacles to successful mooring was nature itself,"" with violent wind currents at the building's top making blimps unstable and posing a danger to pedestrians below. Additionally, pre - existing laws regarding airships flying low over urban areas were a problem, as they disallowed blimps even with successful architecture. Planes were also gaining popularity. In conclusion, these obstacles made the goal of blimp mooring at the Empire State Building a difficult one to achieve."
25	14858	6	2	"During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered problems in enabling dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was creating a way for dirigibles to dock at approximately 1,250 feet above the ground. Strong air currents and changing wind directions made it difficult for pilots to steer dirigibles close enough to the mast for docking. A final problem was a law stating ""airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@NUM1). If a dirigible were docked at the Empire State Building, it would be too low over an urban area, which is against the law. In conclusion, these issues made it a complex task for the builders to allow dirigibles to dock at the building."
26	14859	6	2	The concept of mooring dirigibles atop a 1,250 - foot building in downtown New York was captivating, promising to usher New York into a new “age of transportation”. Regrettably, this seemingly excellent plan had flaws. Subsequently, the architects constructing the mooring mast found that their idea could not be realized as it faced numerous insurmountable obstacles. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. In the event of an accident, the consequences would be catastrophic given the densely populated streets below. Moreover, nature presented the greatest challenge. The excessive wind made it impossible to keep the aircraft stable and under control. In conclusion, while the idea of mooring dirigibles sounded appealing, the associated risks were too great to execute the plan.
27	14860	6	2	In “The Mooring @CAPS1” by Marcia Amidon @CAPS2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered difficulties when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building was unable to fulfill this purpose due to multiple reasons and obstacles. One reason was that most non - US dirigibles used flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Additionally, nature was the biggest hurdle. The winds on the building's top constantly shifted because of violent air currents. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, its rear would spin around the mast. Operating dirigibles above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or approach the area. Although two dirigibles attempted to reach the building, the entire idea was eventually abandoned. In summary, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many arduous obstacles that prevented the mooring of dirigibles.
28	14861	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One significant obstacle was the safety issue. As mentioned, most foreign dirigibles used the flammable hydrogen instead of helium, and in a densely populated area like downtown New York, a fire could be extremely deadly. Another challenge was the wind. Violent air currents caused the winds on top of the building to constantly shift, making the untied back of the dirigible thrash around and even swivel around the mooring mast. While dirigibles can be weighted down with lead weights in open fields, doing so above the Empire State Building would be unsafe due to the pedestrians below. The final obstacle was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or approach the area. As a result, the mooring mast for dirigibles in the Empire State Building never served its intended purpose.
29	14862	6	2	According to the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in allowing dirigibles to land. Safety was a major concern. Dirigibles had to get close enough to the building to be tied down, which put them too close to people. There was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, as the builders aimed to prevent a disaster similar to the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey, from occurring in New York. Another problem was that strong natural winds prevented dirigibles from getting close enough to be tied to the mast. In the end, the numerous obstacles made it unfeasible to turn the Empire State Building into a dirigible dock.
30	14863	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building confronted numerous challenges when trying to facilitate dirigible docking. The steel frame of the building required modification and reinforcement to create a docking area for dirigibles, and over sixty thousand dollars' worth of alterations were necessary. Additionally, mooring a thousand - foot dirigible at the building's top would add stress to the building's frame. Building a mooring mast on top of a 1,250 - foot - high building was no easy task, but the architects managed to design the mooring mast. However, despite their efforts, the overall difficulties indicated that making the Empire State Building a dirigible dock was a complex and challenging goal.
31	14864	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building, workers encountered numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. Attaching a dirigible to the mast and the building would impose additional stress. As a result, builders had to carry out reconstructions worth over sixty thousand dollars to reinforce the building's framework. Dirigibles typically dock using a line from the ship's front to the mast. Although plans accounted for the blimp to sway in the wind, it was unrealistic for any ship to attach to the building in high - wind conditions. Other obstacles to dirigible docking included safety hazards. Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used highly flammable hydrogen. Moreover, builders failed to consider the pre - existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie to the building. In conclusion, the task of having dirigibles attach to the Empire State Building was unfeasible from the start.
32	14865	6	2	Architects faced multiple issues when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One problem was that most dirigibles were @NUM1 ft long, and with only a single cable tether, it would add excessive stress to the building's frame. The entire steel frame would need modification and strengthening, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Safety was the most significant reason the mooring mast could not fulfill its purpose. Most U.S. dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Nature also posed a major obstacle. Due to violent air currents, the winds on the building's top were constantly shifting. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel. Dirigibles are designed to land on open fields, and using them at the Empire State Building, dangling high above pedestrians, was unsafe. In summary, the challenges were insurmountable, and the docking of dirigibles on the building was not a practical idea.
33	14866	6	2	The builders faced several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One such obstacle was the use of flammable hydrogen in dirigibles. Additionally, the wind on the building's top was constantly shifting because of violent air currents. Another issue was that the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Lastly, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Considering all these factors, it was clear that the goal of having dirigibles dock on the building was fraught with difficulties and ultimately unachievable.
34	14867	6	2	Builders encountered multiple obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. One major hurdle was the wind. At higher elevations, the wind is significantly more powerful, making it extremely difficult to get the dirigible close to the mast. Another issue was the building's structure. The framework of the Empire State Building was not designed to bear the weight that would be added on top. As a result, builders spent over @MONEY1 on fortifying the framework. These challenges illustrate the difficulties that builders faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, making the task a complex and arduous one.
35	14868	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although they initially thought it was a great idea, they failed to carefully consider the safety hazards and the unrealistic nature of the plan. Safety concerns were a major reason the mooring mast could not fulfill its purpose. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used highly flammable hydrogen. After a dirigible fire in New Jersey, the building's owners realized how much more disastrous such an accident would be over densely - populated downtown New York. There was also a practical issue. As mentioned in paragraph @NUM2, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it impossible for a dirigible to approach the building, let alone tie up. Clearly, the builders of the Empire State Building had to grapple with many problems in this attempt.
36	14869	6	2	The architects of the Empire State Building appear to have overlooked the numerous risks associated with the mooring mast. One significant danger was the strong winds at that altitude. A blimp tethered to the building would swing around, potentially causing damage to either the building or the blimp itself. Additionally, if the blimp was in motion, it would be difficult for passengers to board or disembark. They could fall from the loading dock while getting on or off the blimp, or even be blown off the open floors of the Empire State Building. Another concern was the high population density of New York City; any debris falling from the building could potentially harm pedestrians on the streets. It is reasonable to expect that the architects should have considered these factors before initiating the project.
37	14870	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the construction of the Empire State Building encountered several challenges. One such challenge was that the governor of New York, Al Smith, desired the building to be the tallest in the world. To achieve this, a mast was required to break the record. However, the mast introduced a risk to the entire building due to the strong air currents. Another reason for the project's difficulties was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law was implemented after a German dirigible caught fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. These were just some of the many issues that dirigibles faced when passing by the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these challenges significantly hindered the feasibility of using the Empire State Building for airship docking.
38	14871	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. A one - thousand - foot dirigible attached to a single cable tether would exert stress on the building's frame if placed at the top. To accommodate this, the building's frame needed to be strengthened and modified, which would cost over a certain amount (represented as @MONEY1). Safety was another major concern; dirigibles ran on hydrogen, a flammable gas. Weather conditions also posed an obstacle, as the winds at the top of the Empire State Building shifted due to violent air currents. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Eventually, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building faded away as these obstacles proved insurmountable.
39	14872	6	2	Al Smith had hoped that the mooring mast of the Empire State Building would be both unique and practical. However, builders faced multiple obstacles in enabling dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, to handle the stress that dirigibles would place on the building's frame, the framework had to be modified at a cost of over sixty thousand dollars. Secondly, dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, which was extremely dangerous in a densely - populated area like New York City. Thirdly, the violent winds at the top of the building made docking difficult and could potentially cause a dirigible to collide with the building, leading to a puncture. Finally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to approach or dock at the building. In the end, these obstacles made the plan of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
40	14873	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building confronted numerous difficult obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The most significant obstacle related to the mooring mast was the wind. At the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting because of the violent air currents. These winds would cause the rear of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Moreover, there was a law stating that airships could not fly low in urban areas. This law made it illegal for a dirigible to approach or dock at the Empire State Building. As a result, the attempt to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately thwarted by these insurmountable obstacles.
41	14874	6	2	The construction of the Empire State Building marked the beginning of a series of challenges. The workers should have recognized that, given the wind conditions at high altitudes, the building's size was a concern. When constructing such a large building, ensuring its strength and balance is crucial. The builders also faced other issues. The U.S. proposed a deal to use the building's top as a dock for civilians. However, after a law was passed banning blimps from landing on the dock, a blimp still attempted to land there. These circumstances highlight the complex situation during the building's development.
42	14875	6	2	The builders of the building encountered several obstacles. Installing a mooring at the top would add stress to the structure, necessitating modifications to support it. Safety was another significant concern. Most dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. In the event of a fire in this densely - populated area, a large number of people could be affected. Nature also posed a challenge, as the winds above the building were extremely violent. Additionally, there was an existing law restricting airships from flying low above urban areas. All these factors combined made the construction and use of the mooring at the building's top a difficult task.
43	14876	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the difficulties faced by the Empire State Building's builders in enabling dirigibles to dock are detailed. One major obstacle was the high flammability of most dirigibles. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, “Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.” Given the building's location in a densely - populated area, a fire involving a dirigible could have a wide - reaching impact. The natural winds were also a problem. Paragraph @NUM2 mentions that “... they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe,” indicating that a docked dirigible would swivel too much. An existing law further complicated matters; paragraph @NUM3 states, “The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.” Clearly, the architects had to overcome many hurdles, and it emphasizes the importance of comprehensive planning before implementing an idea.
44	14877	6	2	The builders of the structure had a tough time due to its location and the method of dirigible docking. The building's great height made construction difficult. Moreover, since the blimp would pull on the building, it required reinforcement. The wind conditions and the free - swinging tail end of the blimp were the final factors that made the mast on the Empire State Building a poor choice. All these issues combined to show that the idea of a dirigible - docking mast on the building was not well - thought - out.
45	14878	6	2	According to the excerpt “The Mooring Mast,” the architects of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. Wind was a major hurdle. As the excerpt states, “The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around...”, which means the dirigible would lack stability. To weigh the dirigible down, lead weights were considered, but as the text mentions, it would be “neither practical nor safe” to have them dangling above people in @LOCATION1 on the street. Overall, the architects faced a multitude of obstacles for dirigible docking, most of which were related to practicality and safety.
46	14879	6	2	Allowing dirigibles to land on top of the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges. During the mast - design phase, it was discovered that the weight of the dirigible would place stress on the building's frame. Additionally, dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. Nature also posed an uncontrollable factor; the winds at the building's peak were constantly changing. Moreover, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which was an obstacle to constructing the mast. Due to these issues related to weight, gas, nature, and law, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many difficulties. In conclusion, these multiple factors made it extremely challenging to implement the plan of having dirigibles land on the building.
47	14880	6	2	"An excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted reveals that the original intention of the mast on the Empire State Building was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles (blimps). The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles. One major issue was the significant stress the mast would impose on the building. To address this, they installed a framework around the entire building's structure. Safety was another concern. The strong winds at the top of the building were too powerful for blimps to remain stable in mid - air without being tossed around. There was also the risk of a blimp popping on the spikes or exploding due to hydrogen over New York City. In summary, while the concept of the mast seemed viable on paper, the inclusion of natural elements introduced too many flaws, making it unfeasible."
48	14881	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. First, they had to modify and strengthen the building's frame. It is reported that over @NUM1 thousand dollars' worth of modifications were necessary to accommodate dirigibles. However, after these changes, more severe obstacles emerged. Safety became a major concern following the destruction of the Hindenburg in @LOCATION3, which raised fears in a densely populated area like New York. Nature also presented difficulties, as the strong winds and violent air currents on top of the building made dirigibles neither practical nor safe. An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas was another hurdle, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. The Los Angeles and Columbia dirigibles made a few attempts but were unsuccessful. By the late 1930s, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was abandoned. These were the challenges the builders faced in their attempt to make dirigibles dock at the building.
49	14882	6	2	"According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top. The most significant obstacle was nature. @PERSON1 stated that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it unsafe for dirigibles to dock. The wind would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mast, and it was unsafe for builders to hang lead weights on them as they would dangle above pedestrians. Another obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas or cities. This law made it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or approach it. @PERSON1 mentioned that although two dirigibles attempted to reach the building before the idea was dropped, they failed to get close enough to tie up or deliver cargo safely because of the strong winds and the lack of necessary mooring equipment. Due to these obstacles, dirigibles were never able to moor at the building."
50	14883	6	2	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges when trying to dock dirigibles. The idea of a mooring mast originated when former New York governor Al Smith was determined to make the Empire State Building the tallest in the world. When the Chrysler Building became the tallest, Smith announced that the Empire State would reach 1,250 feet. Despite initial enthusiasm, there were numerous obstacles. Stability was a problem; if a thousand - pound dirigible was connected to the building by one tether, it would add stress to the building's frame, forcing the builders to alter the building's structure. Safety was also a concern, as most foreign dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, posing a risk to people below. However, nature was the greatest obstacle. The wild wind currents above the Empire State Building caused the back of the dirigible to swivel. Since the builders couldn't find practical solutions to these problems, it was decided that for the safety of New York City inhabitants, dirigibles would not be docked there."
51	14884	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” penned by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles that should have been evident prior to constructing the mast. As stated in “The Mooring Mast,” “The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.” At the building's summit, winds were in a constant state of shift due to violent air - currents. Moreover, if dirigibles were tethered, their rear parts would sway while they hovered high above the city with onlookers below, posing risks to many. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or enter such an area. These issues, including nature - related challenges and potential law - breaking, should have been brought to the builders' attention.
52	14885	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. Firstly, they had to devise highly complex plans. They needed to create the appropriate skeletal structure for the mast to integrate with the rest of the building, which required making adjustments to the existing plans. Secondly, blimps and @CAPS2 presented a risk of crashing into the building. Blimps fly at about @NUM1 miles per hour and could approach the mast at a speed that was too high, potentially destroying it. Lastly, the mast was extremely high. Reaching its height would be a difficult feat for blimps. Irving Clavan remarked, “… Such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date for the landing gears.” In summary, the builders of the Empire State Building had to deal with difficult plans, the risk of blimps crashing, and the excessive height of the mast.
53	14886	6	2	Among the obstacles that the Empire State Building's builders faced when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock were primarily related to weather and safety. In paragraph @NUM1, the author notes that “The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.” This implies that the ever - changing wind and air currents made dirigibles difficult to control. Safety was another significant obstacle. The same paragraph states that “Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street...” Having something heavy dangling above people is a dangerous proposition. If the weight were to disconnect from the dirigibles, there is a high probability of severe injury to passers - by. These were the obstacles the builders faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
54	14887	6	2	During the process of trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders encountered multiple obstacles. One obstacle emerged during the actual construction. Since attaching the mast directly to the flat roof would impose excessive stress on the building's frame, the builders had to reconstruct the steel frame to safely place the mast on top. This was a costly and time - consuming project. Another obstacle stemmed from nature. The constantly shifting winds at the building's top caused the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, which was extremely unsafe. Additionally, laws against airships flying too low over urban areas hindered the dirigibles from approaching the area. In conclusion, the builders faced a multitude of challenges during the construction for the dirigibles.
55	14888	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the building's top with a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. This presented a difficult situation for workers on the building, as it would be a challenging working environment. Wind pressure was another obstacle. With a thousand - foot dirigible hanging by a single cable, the strong winds made the situation even more difficult. Moreover, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. This entailed a large amount of work that would take considerable time to complete. Overall, these were the challenging obstacles the builders had to overcome.
56	14889	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, readers discover that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1, it is revealed that architects were concerned about the blimp's load and the wind - pressure transmitted to the building's foundation. To adapt to this new situation, they would have to strengthen and modify the Empire State Building. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, architects also identified issues with foreign dirigibles that used hydrogen instead of helium, as hydrogen is highly flammable. One of the most significant obstacles was the constantly shifting winds on top of the building. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mast, its back would still swivel. Eventually, the architects' idea for a mooring mast was abandoned, and it was then repurposed for observation.
57	14890	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders encountered several obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of these obstacles had straightforward solutions, while others were extremely challenging. One such obstacle was that a dirigible held by a single cable tether on top of the building would stress the building's frame. To address this, modifications costing around six thousand dollars were required. Additionally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to approach or tie up to the building. The most difficult obstacle the architects faced was nature, which was both hard to solve and control. Due to these obstacles, the builders decided to put the plan on hold, hoping that future technological advancements would enable them to realize this dream.
58	14891	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous obstacles. One of their goals was to make the building as high and safe as possible. To achieve the status of the world's tallest building, the architects planned to install a mooring mast on top, which would serve as a dock for dirigibles (blimps). However, this plan was dangerous. At high altitudes, the mast could snap and either plunge to the ground or dangle above the street. As Al Smith, the four - year term governor of New York, said, “The Government people in Washington are figuring on some way of mooring airships to this mast.” Despite its appealing appearance, this was not the safest idea.
59	14892	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, they couldn't simply place a mast on top of the building, as it would likely cause the building to collapse. A thousand - foot dirigible held by a single cable tether at the top would add stress to the building's frame. Modifying the building to address this issue would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Secondly, the builders overlooked the design of modern - day dirigibles. These dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. An explosion during docking in a densely populated area of New York would have been a disaster. Finally, nature presented the greatest obstacle. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, its back would swivel, posing a significant danger to pedestrians on the streets. In conclusion, these three obstacles prevented the Empire State Building from accommodating dirigible docking.
60	14893	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders grappled with challenges such as how to keep dirigibles securely tied to the mast. They were uncertain about preventing the dirigible from swiveling due to air currents. As mentioned, “A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's framework.” Another problem was that the use of hydrogen in dirigibles made them highly flammable. These issues presented significant hurdles to the plan of enabling dirigibles to dock at the building.
61	14894	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous issues that should have been foreseen prior to construction. One significant problem was that many dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. This fact made the building's owners concerned about the safety of downtown New York civilians. Another challenge was the constantly shifting winds caused by violent air currents. In landing fields, blimps could be weighted down with lead weights, but this was not feasible at the Empire State Building. Additionally, many dirigibles could not reach the building due to the winds. Moreover, it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. All these factors led to the abandonment of the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and passengers.
62	14895	6	2	"In Marcia Amidon's short - story ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced an obstacle to overcome. Constructing the top of the building was difficult as the dock part of the tower was unstable, and the building's frame could not support a dirigible. A dirigible moored at the top by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. The designers then created a new tower made of shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel, which would be illuminated from the inside. The winches and controlling machinery would be housed in the base of the shaft. They also added an observation deck to accommodate more passengers waiting for the dirigible. Another issue was the law that prohibited aircraft from getting too close to urban areas. Overall, it was a difficult and costly design process for them."
63	14896	6	2	"Although Al Smith aimed to fulfill the ""dream of aviation pioneers"", the Empire State Building's builders encountered multiple obstacles in enabling dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the stress a dirigible would impose on the building. Mooring a large dirigible to the building via a single cable tether meant the building had to withstand the dirigible's weight and the wind pressure transmitted throughout. As a result, the builders had to spend over @MONEY1 on modifications to strengthen the building's frame. Additionally, most dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with highly flammable hydrogen, posing a significant danger. The destruction of the German dirigible by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, highlighted the risks of such an accident over a densely populated city like New York. Moreover, the strong winds on top of the Empire State Building were also problematic, as the rear of a tethered ship would sway around the mooring mast, endangering the citizens below. Furthermore, an established law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tether to the building. These factors ultimately made it impossible for the builders to allow dirigibles to dock there."
64	14897	6	2	"In @PERSON1's ""The Mooring Mast"" excerpt, the Empire State Building's builders faced many hurdles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock. Dirigibles, though a modern form of transportation, were highly dangerous. As mentioned in the text, most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, and the ""violent air currents"" were risks the builders had to consider. They needed to come up with a safe docking method to ensure no one was hurt. Another obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The excerpt clearly shows the complications the builders had to deal with during construction. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."
65	14898	6	2	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the Empire State Building's builders faced multiple obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. The most significant obstacle was the constantly changing winds due to air currents. Many dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION3 used highly flammable hydrogen. If a dirigible exploded like the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey, more people would be affected. Dirigibles could not use lead weights to weigh down the back of the blimp as it would be dangerous for those below. The sharp spires of other buildings in the area also posed a risk; if a Navy captain was worried about his blimp popping, it was clear that docking was not a good idea. Additionally, there was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. Given these obstacles, the builders were unable to overcome them and allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
66	14899	6	2	The construction of the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges to the builders. Firstly, the building's height was a matter of extensive discussion, especially regarding its top design. The initial vision for the Empire State Building was to be a symbol of the city's future and to serve as a docking point for blimps. However, there were significant issues. There was no effective way to keep the blimps stable enough to attach to the building. Moreover, large aircraft were restricted from flying too close to the building due to the presence of surrounding structures. In conclusion, the builders encountered a multitude of problems during the construction process.
67	14900	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles that made it nearly impossible for the building to serve its original purpose. Safety was a major concern. As noted in a reference, most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. Nature also posed a significant challenge. Violent air currents at the top of the building caused the winds to constantly shift. Even if a dirigible was tethered, the back of the ship would swivel around. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. These combined obstacles severely hindered the Empire State Building from fulfilling its intended function as a docking point for dirigibles.
68	14901	6	2	Nature was the most significant obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. High and violent air currents caused the building to constantly shift. This made the use of the mooring mast neither practical nor safe. In conclusion, these natural conditions effectively precluded the successful implementation of the mooring mast's intended purpose.
69	14902	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were a safety hazard as many non - US ones used extremely flammable hydrogen. A fire in a densely populated area could result in numerous casualties. Nature also presented an issue. The constantly shifting winds at the building's top made the back of the dirigible swivel. Adding weights to the back of the ship, a potential solution, was both impractical and unsafe as the dangling weights above pedestrians could be deadly if they broke. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for ships to tie up to the building. Additionally, strong winds could push the ship onto sharp spires, puncturing it and preventing pilots from using the mooring equipment. These obstacles led to the non - installation of the mooring equipment.
70	14903	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a series of obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. Safety concerns, weather conditions, and government laws undermined the purpose of the mooring mast on the building. Many dirigibles at the time used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, as noted in a reference, and this was deemed unwise given the building's location above a densely populated area. The shifting winds at the top of the building, caused by violent air currents, created a dangerous situation where the dirigible would swing around the mast. A government law also prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, preventing ships from approaching the building. The grand idea that was initially conceived gradually faded. The builders had to contend with these and other challenges in their effort to enable dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
71	14904	6	2	"In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's article ""The Mooring Mast"", numerous obstacles associated with converting the Empire State Building into a docking station for dirigibles are detailed. John Tauranac, the proponent of the plan to dock dirigibles atop the Empire State Building, failed to consider several crucial factors. Firstly, the entire building would require modification as ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Secondly, the safety of the city was a significant concern. Many ""dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2). A disaster similar to the German dirigible Hindenburg incident would have far more severe consequences. Lastly, ""violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM3) presented one of the greatest challenges. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to tie up but was unable to get close enough due to ""forceful wind"" (paragraph @NUM4). The multitude of insurmountable obstacles made the plan of transforming the Empire State Building into a mooring mast unfeasible."
72	14905	6	2	The construction of the Empire State Building presented the builders with numerous obstacles when it came to enabling dirigibles to dock at the top. This was an unprecedented endeavor as no building had ever allowed dirigibles to dock on its roof. Before commencing the construction of the mast, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of framework had to be added. Once the mast was designed and the building had reached the 85th - floor framing, the roof had to be completed before the mast's framing could start. In conclusion, these challenges made the process of facilitating dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a complex and arduous task.
73	14906	6	2	"The builders encountered numerous problems in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. As the author explains in @CAPS1 @NUM1, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would only add stress to the building's frame"". To address this, the builders would have to construct the building to enhance its stability. Additionally, outside the United States, dirigibles often used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and given New York's high population density, it would pose a significant risk to pedestrians. Evidently, what seemed like a simple idea presented the builders with an overwhelming number of problems."
74	14907	6	2	"Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building presented insurmountable obstacles, a fact that should have been evident prior to construction. Safety was a major concern. Most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. After the ""Hindenburg"" accident in Lakehurst, the viability of the idea diminished significantly. The wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building also made docking unfeasible. The strong winds were too powerful for dirigibles to dock safely. Moreover, there was already a law restricting airships from flying too low over urban areas, and a dirigible approaching the building would violate this law. As a result, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building had to be abandoned."
75	14908	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building confronted many challenges in their attempt to make it a suitable docking location for dirigibles. The excerpt in paragraph @NUM1 reveals a major issue, stating that ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of a building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame"". Consequently, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework were necessary. Another setback is described in paragraph @NUM2, which states that ""The greatest obstacle... was nature itself"". Violent air currents caused the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast, and tethering the mast provided little assistance. Using lead weights was not a practical or safe option as ""dangling weights high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe"". These obstacles clearly demonstrated to the architects that the project was unachievable at that time."
76	14909	6	2	The construction of the Empire State Building presented its builders with numerous challenges. As stated in the excerpt, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was bound to be unsuccessful. An often overlooked issue was that most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly unstable gas, instead of helium. In the event of a fire on a dirigible over New York, numerous civilians could be injured or killed. Another hurdle was the constantly shifting winds at the building's peak. These winds made it extremely difficult to anchor a dirigible to the mast. Moreover, lead weights, which could have been used for anchoring, could not be employed as they would hang over the citizens below. In conclusion, these were the significant problems that the builders of the Empire State Building had to confront.
77	14910	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles that were not straightforward to resolve. Firstly, the steel frame of the building required modification and reinforcement to adapt to the ""new situation."" Safety was also a major concern. Given the building's location in a densely populated area, an accident could have catastrophic consequences for many lives. Additionally, the winds added to the overall danger. Finally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. In summary, these various obstacles made the task of the builders of the Empire State Building extremely challenging."
78	14911	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles in their attempt to accommodate dirigibles. One such obstacle was increasing the dirigibles' speed. Another was the landing area. Ensuring the safe embarkation and disembarkation of passengers was also a significant challenge. As mentioned in paragraph six, ""passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank..."". In conclusion, these were the key obstacles that the builders had to deal with when trying to make the Empire State Building suitable for dirigibles."
79	14912	6	2	"Engineers at the Empire State Building faced numerous problems when attempting to dock dirigibles. The high - altitude winds were overpowering; as described in paragraph @NUM1, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigibles themselves were also a problem as they were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable substance. Additionally, air laws stipulated that dirigibles were not allowed to fly too low in urban areas. These problems ultimately led to the failure of Al Smith's idea of using the building to dock airships. In conclusion, these combined issues made it unfeasible to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
80	14913	6	2	"As is common with any public transportation project, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges when trying to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there, as detailed in ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted. Docking dirigibles violated an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, rendering the builders' plan illegal. It was not only dangerous for the citizens of New York City but also for the passengers and workers on the dirigible due to the weather conditions. L¸sted points out that ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This highlights the importance of always checking for safety precautions in any project. In conclusion, these factors made the attempt to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building fraught with difficulties."
81	14914	6	2	Al Smith's aspiration to have airships dock atop the Empire State Building was thwarted by harsh reality. The concept failed partly because docking a large, flamable - gas - filled, @DATE2 - foot balloon to a city building was impractical. The sheer size of the airship was astonishing and led to numerous issues. Firstly, the wind on top of a skyscraper is strong and inconsistent. As seen when the Los Angeles attempted to dock in @DATE1, it was extremely difficult to dock an airship to a building. The balloon couldn't dock due to the potential damage it could cause to itself and the surrounding city. Moreover, blimps were kept afloat by hydrogen, which, due to its chemical properties, is highly flammable. Past blimp explosions, like that of the Hindenburg, were well - known. Engineers were aware that a similar accident at the Empire State Building would cause substantial damage to the city and the building. These impracticalities, along with the increasing use of airplanes instead of blimps, ensured that no blimps would ever dock at the Empire State Building.
82	14915	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. One significant issue was that most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen for buoyancy, making them highly flammable and unsafe. A damaged blimp over New York could endanger many lives. Additionally, natural factors made docking extremely difficult. Strong and unstable winds made blimps hard to control. If a blimp were tied to the mast, the wind could wrap the mooring line around the mast. Another obstacle was the existing law that prohibited aircraft from flying at low altitudes over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to approach the mast. In conclusion, these obstacles collectively prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building.
83	14916	6	2	Al Smith and his building team confronted several hurdles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The steel frame and foundation of the building could not withstand the stress imposed by an attached dirigible. Looking at past dirigible accidents such as the Hindenburg, the builders recognized that a similar incident at the Empire State Building would endanger numerous lives. There were also laws restricting how low dirigibles could fly over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to dock at the building as it would be at too low an altitude. According to the builders, the most significant problem was nature. The high and unpredictably changing winds at the top of the building made a docked dirigible a potential disaster. In summary, these multiple obstacles effectively precluded dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building.
84	14917	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. They were reluctant to install a mooring mast at the top of the building, fearing that a dirigible held by a ""single cable"" would add stress to the building's frame. Given the weight of the dirigible, the force of the wind, and the height of the building, the building's frame would not be strong enough and would need to be ""modified and strengthened."" Wind was another major obstacle. At the high elevation of the building, the wind currents were volatile and ""constantly shifting."" As a result, the back of the dirigibles would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Additionally, since the building was in an urban area with other nearby structures, there was a risk that the dirigible could be pierced, and it would also pose a danger to pedestrians. In conclusion, these obstacles made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to achieve dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
85	14918	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple problems regarding their intended use of the building. The first issue concerned the building's frame. A thousand - foot dirigible held by a single cable at the top of the building would exert excessive stress on the frame. The load of the dirigible and the wind forces would need to be transferred to the foundation, which was too far below. Modifying and strengthening the building to handle this stress would cost over sixty thousand dollars, and the architects made appropriate changes. However, another problem emerged. The mast of the building presented issues that should have been identified well before construction, especially regarding safety. Most non - domestic dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. Given past blimp explosions, an explosion over New York could have catastrophic consequences. In the end, these problems severely limited the feasibility of using the Empire State Building for dirigible docking.
86	14919	6	2	To enable dirigibles to dock on the roof of the Empire State Building, workers needed to undertake a series of tasks, including strengthening the steel frame and designing a robust mast. Insufficient frame strength would lead to the building's collapse, and over sixty thousand dollars was spent on frame restructuring. Additionally, the mast had to be extremely sturdy to withstand high - speed winds; otherwise, the dirigible would not remain stationary. After the Hindenburg disaster, people recognized the high level of danger associated with dirigibles, and the idea of dirigible docking was deemed not only unsafe but also illegal. In conclusion, no blimp has ever docked at the Empire State Building, and it is unlikely that one ever will.
87	14920	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. A thousand - foot dirigible would be attached to the building by a single cable, exerting stress on the building's frame. To address stability concerns, the builders had to modify and strengthen the foundation. They also had to deal with constantly shifting wind pressure at heights over @NUM1 feet. The swinging dirigible would transmit pressure and stress to the building's foundation, which was a major safety concern. This concern was a key factor in the decision that dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State Building. Moreover, there were laws against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to attempt to land on the mooring mast. Due to building weaknesses, safety issues, and legal constraints, it was virtually impossible for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building's mooring mast.
88	14921	6	2	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple hurdles in their attempt to establish a dirigible docking station. Al Smith envisioned adding a ""top"" or a ""hat"" to the building to serve as a docking station, but this dream could not be realized. One of the initial problems was installing the mooring mast on the building. Architects could not simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof. A dirigible would be held by a single cable, and the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transmitted down the building. There were also safety issues. Many dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, and the area around the Empire State Building is very windy. Dirigibles would have to hang sandbags by ropes above the people below. Despite the mooring mast being a good concept, the numerous problems the builders faced led to the project's non - completion."
89	14922	6	2	"Although the concept of a mooring mast for the Empire State Building seemed feasible in theory, in practice, the builders faced numerous obstacles in enabling dirigibles to dock. During the process of adding the mooring mast, a significant problem arose. As the article stated, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ... The steel frame... would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation."" This modification, essential for attaching the mooring mast, cost over @NUM1 thousand dollars and required a great deal of time and effort. Another major obstacle related to safety was ""nature itself."" The strong winds at the building's top would cause tethered dirigibles to spin around the mooring mast. While dirigibles in airfields could be weighted down with lead weights, this was not practical or safe at the Empire State Building, where the weights would dangle above pedestrians. These issues presented substantial challenges for the building's construction team."
90	14923	6	2	In this excerpt, the Empire State Building's builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Weather, height, and the gases used to fuel the dirigibles were among the problems. The weather was a difficult factor to overcome. If dirigibles were to dock at the building, the extreme wind at that height could cause them to swerve. Height was another contributing factor. The excerpt mentioned that there were legal height limits; dirigibles flying too low over urban areas were considered unsafe as they could crash into buildings or pedestrians at any time. The type of gas used was also an obstacle. Hydrogen, which was commonly used, is highly flammable compared to helium, posing a risk to passengers. In conclusion, weather conditions, height restrictions, and the type of gas used were all significant obstacles that the Empire State Building would face in allowing dirigibles to dock.
91	14924	6	2	"The architects of the Empire State Building hypothesized that dirigibles could dock on the building if a mooring mast were installed. Nevertheless, numerous obstacles had to be surmounted for this to become a reality. If a dirigible were to land on the mast, the building would be subjected to significant pressure as the dirigible swayed in the wind. As stated, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored... would add stress to the building's frame."" In addition, natural factors played a crucial role. The wind could cause the dirigible's body to swing, potentially leading to the breakage of the building's frame and subsequent collapse. Another major obstacle was safety. American dirigibles utilized helium, while those from other countries used highly flammable hydrogen. The destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, served as a grim reminder. The architects recognized that if such an explosion were to occur on the Empire State Building, above a densely populated area, the consequences would be far more catastrophic. In conclusion, these challenges ultimately made the idea of dirigible docking on the Empire State Building unfeasible."
92	14925	6	2	"In Marcia Amidon's excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1,"" several issues arose when attempting to add a dock for dirigibles at the building's top. One problem was the safety of the dirigible itself. As noted, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable."" (@NUM1) Nature also presented an obstacle, with ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM2) Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over cities or urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" (@NUM3) These three factors explain why, according to the excerpt, there were significant problems in adding a dirigible dock. In essence, these challenges combined to make the implementation of a dirigible dock a difficult, if not impossible, task."
93	14926	6	2	"From the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, it is clear that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock at the building's summit. One of the engineering challenges was how the Empire State Building could support the weight of these long aircrafts. As the author states in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" To address this, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened"" (@NUM2), and these modifications were estimated to cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another issue was the safety of docking a blimp in a highly populated area. Paragraph @NUM3 reveals that most dirigibles are made of highly flammable hydrogen. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that the accident would have been far more disastrous if it had occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. In conclusion, the builders faced substantial challenges in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, and these challenges likely contributed to the ultimate non - implementation of the docking plan."
94	14927	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building were unable to allow dirigibles to dock due to multiple factors, including the building's structure, wind conditions, and public safety. The building's structure could not withstand the swaying of dirigibles pushed by the wind. As most dirigibles from outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen, docking a large flammable dirigible over a populated area like New York posed significant risks. The quote ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" highlights the potential danger. In summary, these combined factors made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, ensuring the safety of the public and the integrity of the building."
95	14928	6	2	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 explained the reasons behind the landing area on the Empire State Building called the Mooring Mast. The initial obstacle was the lack of landing space on the building's top, which meant dirigibles could not land at all. To solve this, the Mooring Mast was added. It was built with winches to hold the dirigibles, but this placed excessive stress on the building. The workers spent a significant amount of money to reinforce the building so that it could withstand the stress when dirigibles were attached to the Mooring Mast. However, they overlooked the wind factor. The wind was so strong that dirigibles could not maneuver to reach the top of the Empire State Building. Once the workers realized this, they abandoned the project. In conclusion, despite their efforts to create a landing area for dirigibles, the challenges of space, stress on the building, and wind conditions ultimately led to the failure of the docking plan.
96	14929	6	2	The majority of the challenges encountered by the Empire State Building's builders were weather - related. On windy days in New York, the dirigible would exert a pull on the mast. The mast, which is attached to the roof of the building, could potentially impact the building's frames or roof. Additionally, there was a significant risk to all of New York. In the event that a dirigible collided with something or malfunctioned, it could crash on top of New York. Given the high traffic volume in New York, having a burning dirigible fall overhead was an unacceptable risk.
97	14930	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. They couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the roof as it would place additional stress on the building's frame. Hydrogen, which dirigibles used, is highly flammable. If a dirigible caught fire and exploded over downtown New York, legal suits would surely follow. The winds at the top of the building also posed a problem. Shifting winds caused by violent air currents made it extremely difficult for dirigibles to dock. Moreover, there was a law prohibiting aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it a challenging task for the builders to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
98	14931	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building confronted several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was related to the height and altitude of the Zeppelin. Even if it managed to dock, the back of the Zeppelin would be tossed around by the wind. Another significant problem occurred on May 6, 1937, when the Hindenburg burned to the ground after take - off. This incident highlighted the high flammability of dirigibles that used hydrogen instead of helium. All these factors raised safety concerns that required careful consideration.
99	14932	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when trying to permit dirigibles to dock. Dirigibles were quite long, with some reaching up to one thousand feet. They were docked using an electric winch that hauled a line from the front to the back. However, the architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the building's top. A one - thousand - foot dirigible held by just a single winch would be too heavy for the building's frame. Strengthening the framework to accommodate these large dirigibles would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Safety was another major obstacle. Dirigibles from outside the United States often used helium, which made them highly flammable. If an accident similar to the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey occurred over downtown New York, a densely populated area, many more people would be at risk. Considering these obstacles, it was clear that docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was not a good idea.
100	14933	6	2	"The builders faced multiple hurdles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Firstly, they needed to find a way that wouldn't make the building unstable. As noted, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" Secondly, the winds were too strong and unsafe for the dirigible. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Thirdly, having the dirigible on the building was extremely dangerous because the gases inside, such as hydrogen used in most non - US dirigibles, were highly flammable. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen... and Hydrogen is highly flammable."" Finally, there was a law preventing airships from getting too close to the ground in urban areas. In conclusion, while the idea of docking dirigibles seemed good, it was not a practical one due to these numerous obstacles."
101	14934	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building's builders encountered numerous obstacles while trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, they had to redesign the building's original skeleton to accommodate the mooring mast. As the excerpt states, “over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework” (paragraph @NUM1), indicating that the workers had to alter their initial design to meet the mooring mast's requirements. Secondly, the mooring mast was deemed too dangerous to use. The excerpt mentions, “The greatest reason was one of safety... hydrogen is highly flammable” (paragraph @NUM2), highlighting that the gas used in dirigibles outside the United States posed a significant risk of accidents. Lastly, strong winds presented a major challenge. The quote “The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself” (paragraph @NUM3) shows that the winds made the dirigible move excessively, rendering it unsafe for use. In conclusion, the Empire State Building's builders faced a multitude of obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock.
102	14935	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles. For instance, the wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to violent air - currents, preventing them from building the mooring mast. Also, using the Empire State Building for dirigibles, where they would dangle high above pedestrians, was neither practical nor safe as it could easily harm people on the street. Additionally, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it extremely difficult for the builders to achieve their goal of enabling dirigibles to dock.
103	14936	6	2	During the construction of the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered several significant obstacles. The most substantial obstacle was nature. At that height, the winds shifted too frequently, causing the dirigible to be tossed around the mast, making it unsafe for boarding. Another issue was the use of lead weights to weigh down the dirigibles. Having lead weights at such a height was perilous as they could fall onto the people below. A third obstacle was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low in urban areas. This law made it impossible for any dirigible to dock or even approach the Empire State Building. Due to these obstacles, the builders were forced to abandon the mooring mast construction.
104	14937	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They required a precise method to execute the job perfectly. The entire building process was highly complex and demanded the expertise of the best professionals. Al Smith's quote in paragraph @NUM1 strongly supports this point. He said, “one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to the mast,” which shows the significant effort put into this project. In conclusion, this was a complicated job. There was uncertainty about whether the mast could remain stable, and whether the fluids inside would pose a problem.
105	14938	6	2	In the piece “The Mooring MAst” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the true purpose of the mast on the Empire State Building is described. The builders faced many challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to land on the mast. One problem was that a dirigible landing on the roof would add stress to the building's frame. The stress and wind pressure would need to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, meaning the building had to be modified and strengthened. Safety was also a major concern. Since dirigibles used hydrogen, there was a risk of fire and destruction over a densely - populated area. Nature was another obstacle. The constantly shifting winds on top of the building made the back of the ship swivel. Finally, the law against airships flying too low contributed to the lack of success. Before adding all the extra structures to the building, the constructors should have considered all the potential flaws. In conclusion, these various obstacles made it difficult to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the mast.
106	14939	6	2	Al Smith was a highly competitive individual. One of the challenges he faced was competing with another building. He aimed to make his building taller than the Chrysler Building. In @DATE1, if he failed to achieve this, he would lose the title of having the tallest building in New York. This intense competition drove Smith to push the limits of construction to secure the top spot.
107	14940	6	2	The concept of converting the mast at the top of the Empire State Building into a docking area for dirigibles was innovative yet fraught with safety issues. An existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, which rendered the idea unfeasible even before construction commenced. However, the workers overlooked this law. Additionally, mooring dirigibles to the building exerted significant pressure on its base, necessitating an expenditure of @MONEY1 to address the problem. Nature also posed a challenge, as the high - altitude winds made it extremely difficult to maneuver dirigibles in the limited space. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy Dirigible 'Los Angeles' approached the mooring mast but could not dock due to strong winds. Overall, these multiple factors combined to make the idea of using the mast for dirigible docking an unworkable one.
108	14941	6	2	In life, many ideas seem brilliant but are actually flawed. One such idea was using the Empire State Building as a mooring mast for dirigibles. Al Smith, the then - governor of New York, learned this from an excerpt of 'The Mooring Mast' by Marcia Amidon L¸sted. During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders had to confront several serious obstacles for dirigible docking. Many blueprints had to be changed, especially the building's skeleton. The original design would put excessive stress on the top half if dirigibles were to dock, risking breakage. The safety of @LOCATION1 was also a concern, as the highly flammable helium in dirigibles would endanger thousands of lives. Moreover, the violently shifting winds not only stressed the building's frame but also posed a risk of blowing the blimp into the pointed mast. In conclusion, these numerous issues prevented the Mooring Mast from becoming a reality.
109	14942	6	2	The idea of docking dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building was ambitious. It seemed that the era of dirigible transportation was about to take off, but the architects were overly excited and overlooked potential problems. Al Smith's competitive nature drove the building to an unprecedented height of 1,250 ft and proposed a new, fashionable, and effective combination of transportation. This excited the public and architects alike, but also set high expectations. However, Smith did not anticipate the many obstacles ahead. The swaying of the dirigible would stress the building's frame, and although precautions were taken, this was a sign of more problems to come. The destruction of the Hindenburg by fire due to hydrogen gas made people skeptical, as the thought of a dirigible exploding over a crowded New York street was terrifying. Additionally, an existing law against low - flying aircraft over urban areas prohibited the dirigible plans. By the late 1930s, despite the plans being only postponed initially, the idea of dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building faded away due to these insurmountable obstacles.
110	14943	6	2	"According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when trying to enable dirigible docking. They failed to recognize that constructing the mast would create numerous problems and safety risks, and the mooring mast had inherent issues. One of the major obstacles was the constantly shifting winds on top of the building caused by violent air currents. This made it difficult for dirigibles to land properly, potentially causing damage and endangering pedestrians on the streets. The practice of weighting dirigibles down with lead weights, which was used for open landing fields, was not suitable for the Empire State Building. Moreover, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In summary, the builders should have thoroughly considered these factors before attempting to allow dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
111	14944	6	2	According to the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” penned by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the construction team of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, the architects couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. Modifications were necessary to ensure the safety of dirigible landings. The most significant hurdle was nature. As L¸sted stated in paragraph @NUM1, “The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.” Additionally, even if they managed to install the mooring mast, there was a law that prohibited dirigibles from landing there. L¸sted mentioned in paragraph @NUM2, “This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area...” Evidently, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there.
112	14945	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges related to weather and existing laws. The natural elements disrupted the building schedule. The shifting winds were a major issue; even when a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, its rear would spin around. Another problem was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which prevented dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these challenges significantly hindered the builders' efforts to enable dirigible docking at the building.
113	14946	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous difficulties when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring on the building's top. The primary challenge stemmed from nature. The winds above the building were in a constant state of flux, blowing and changing direction. This caused any dirigible attempting to dock to sway and swing in the wind, presenting significant safety risks for passengers boarding and disembarking. Moreover, during the docking process, the dirigible could puncture its frame on nearby buildings, endangering people on the building and on the ground. Attaching a dirigible to the building also compromised its structural stability, necessitating modifications to the building's frame for additional support. Ultimately, the idea was abandoned as it was unfeasible and unrealistic.
114	14947	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when trying to dock dirigibles. One of the main obstacles was nature. At the top of the building, the winds were constantly changing due to violent air - currents. This made a ship swivel around dangerously; even when tethered, the back of the ship would move. As stated, “The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of ship with swivel.” Safety was another major concern. Foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, an extremely flammable gas, and in some cases, lead weights were used for ballasting. An accident involving either hydrogen or lead weights at the height of the Empire State Building, above a highly populated city, would be extremely fatal. “Dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen... is highly flammable.” “Could be weighted down by lead weights, but using these at the Empire State building, where they would be hanging high above pedestrians on the street.” Additionally, a law prohibited ships from flying in low urban areas, so even if the mooring worked, it couldn't be used. These factors led to the abandonment of the idea in the late 1930s.
115	14948	6	2	Throughout the passage, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock. Al Smith proposed the idea of using dirigibles as a new form of transportation. The concept seemed promising, with dirigibles capable of traveling at 75 miles per hour and covering thousands of feet without refueling. However, Al Smith was anxious and uncertain about the project's completion, stating, “it's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now.” The architects couldn't simply place a large mooring mast on the building's flat roof. Violent wind currents also posed a problem. Eventually, the idea of using dirigibles faded as airplanes became a more popular choice among passengers. In the end, the challenges proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the dirigibles - at - the - Empire - State - Building plan.
116	14949	6	2	Based on the excerpt, the @ORGANIZATION1 faced several obstacles. One obstacle was the balloon, which contained helium and was flammable. Another obstacle was the difficulty in controlling the balloon. Additionally, the Empire State Building had a flat roof, which presented a challenge. These were the obstacles that the @ORGANIZATION1 encountered.
117	14950	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. First, they had to modify and strengthen the building's structure to withstand the stress generated when dirigibles landed. After constructing the landing area, further issues arose. The hydrogen in the balloons was highly flammable, posing a threat due to New York's dense population. The dirigibles themselves were easily affected by the wind and could not be weighted down as they would be in a field because of the crowds below. Moreover, airships were prohibited from flying low over urban areas, and the Empire State Building was in such a location. These problems led to the failure of the original plan, leaving the building with a tall post of no practical use.
118	14951	6	2	Dirigibles, also known as blimps today, used to dock at the Empire State Building. The building served as a docking ground for dirigibles, which were large steel - formed balloons filled with hydrogen and helium, making them lighter than air. They could reach a top speed of @NUM1 mph and travel thousands of miles. As stated in the excerpt, Al Smith saw an opportunity for the Empire State Building; adding a mooring mast to the top would allow dirigibles to anchor for refueling, servicing, and passenger boarding and alighting. The dirigibles were docked using an electric winch that secured them to the mast. Al Smith's construction of the mooring mast was successful as it was beneficial for dirigibles.
119	14952	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. One issue was that tying cable tethers would add stress to the building's frame. Additionally, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would need to be modified and strengthened to adapt to the new situation. These challenges made it difficult to implement the plan for dirigibles to dock at the building.
120	14953	6	2	"In ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders faced numerous obstacles when attempting to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. Many of these issues were related to safety. Although the concept of docking dirigibles at the building seemed promising, there were significant risks. The Empire State Building was an enormous structure for its time, but the wind conditions were too hazardous even for highly skilled pilots to maneuver the dirigibles. Moreover, many dirigibles from other countries, like those from @LOCATION2, used hydrogen in their blimps. Despite dirigibles being hailed as the future of transportation, numerous safety precautions were necessary because of New York City's dense population. While dirigibles were a reasonable idea for transportation at the time, the safety of the building, the people below, and the use of German hydrogen - filled blimps over a populated city made the plan unfeasible."
121	14954	6	2	"The construction team of the Empire State Building encountered multiple challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One significant issue was the variable wind currents. Although dirigibles were equipped with steering mechanisms and could be tethered, the wind could overpower these systems, leading to a loss of control and potential crashes. Another concern was the fear of a repeat of the ""Hindenburg"" disaster. On May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg, a dirigible filled with hydrogen (a highly flammable gas), caught fire and burned. While the casualties were mainly those on board, if such an incident occurred above the densely populated New York City, the number of fatalities would increase due to the pedestrians below. These factors made it extremely difficult to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
122	14955	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced safety and natural challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a major concern as most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the 1937 ""Hindenburg"" fire was a clear example of the danger. The owners of the Empire State Building recognized that this posed a risk to the public and the building. Nature also presented an obstacle. The wind currents at the top of the building were constantly changing because of strong air currents. In conclusion, these were the key obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to deal with."
123	14956	6	2	"Despite high hopes for the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous hurdles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, as detailed in the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon. The dream of a mooring mast for new airships was quickly dashed when architects realized the stress a dirigible held by a single cable tether would place on the building. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would be transmitted to the building's foundation nearly eleven hundred feet below, so the building's framework had to be reinforced. Additionally, a law regarding airships became an obstacle. The law stated that airships could not fly too low over populated urban areas, which was a practical reason why dirigibles could not moor atop the building. Moreover, nature was the greatest obstacle. The winds at the building's top were violent, forceful, and unpredictable. Mooring dirigibles to the mast was neither practical nor safe, and the strong winds made it difficult for dirigibles to approach. In December 1930, the captain of the U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" worried that the wind would blow the dirigible into the spires of other buildings, puncturing its shell. As a result, the idea of using the mooring mast to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building faded away."
124	14957	6	2	The top of the Empire State Building serves a purpose beyond being merely ornamental. It is not just a spire, dome, or pyramid added to increase the building's height by a few feet or to conceal something. Instead, it has a more significant function within the overall design and concept of the building. In conclusion, the top of the Empire State Building has a role that goes beyond its visual appearance.
125	14958	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building confronted two main obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. This presented a serious safety risk. Secondly, the wind was a major problem. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This not only made it difficult to dock dirigibles but also posed a threat to the safety of pedestrians below the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these factors made it unfeasible to allow dirigibles to dock at the building.
126	14959	6	2	"In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" the focus is on the Empire State Building, which was constructed to be the tallest building. The builders encountered numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. The excerpt mentions that ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium (hydrogen is more flammable),"" indicating that a fire could potentially destroy the entire Empire State Building. Another point is that ""Dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe,"" highlighting the risk to people on the street and the potential for injury. Finally, it states that ""... blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings,"" proving that if the dirigibles were blown off course, not only the Empire State Building but also surrounding buildings would be in danger. Overall, these factors demonstrate the significant difficulties the builders faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
127	14960	6	2	"The non - fiction article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted details the potential problems related to the mast. It states that ""The steel Frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened,"" showing that initially, the building was not strong enough to bear the weight. Nature also posed a problem; workers had to consider it as wind could harm a dirigible or blimp if it were docked there. There was a law prohibiting aircraft from flying at such low altitudes. Additionally, the building's height had to exceed all others. In December 11, 1929, it was announced that the Empire State Building would reach 1,250 feet, and John Tauranac said, ""Their top they said would serve a higher calling."" The builders had to address height, frame, and law issues, which were complex challenges they needed to resolve."
128	14961	6	2	"In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's novel ""The Mooring Mast,"" the engineering challenges the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock are presented. One problem was that the building was already completed before the idea of dirigible docking emerged. The entire skeletal structure of the building had to be changed to enable dirigibles to dock. There was also the issue of how to keep the airships (dirigibles) next to the building. Making matters worse, it became illegal for dirigibles to be close to buildings, and since dirigibles are flammable, a crash could cause fatalities. These factors made it extremely difficult for the Empire State Building to construct dirigible docks, as described in the novel."
129	14962	6	2	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock. The dirigibles were too heavy, which would put excessive pressure on the building. As the excerpt states, ""The dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which is nearly eleven hundred feet below,"" and this pressure could cause the building to collapse. Another obstacle was the high cost; ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" In New York, where space is limited and people are densely packed, there was not enough space for the dock, as some dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, equivalent to four blocks in New York City. These were the main challenges preventing the Empire State Building from allowing dirigible docking."
130	14963	6	2	"According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The building's frame needed modification because a docked dirigible would add stress to it, and these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Keeping the dirigibles still was also difficult. The excerpt mentions that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which was dangerous for passengers and pedestrians and prevented the dirigible from getting close enough to tie up. There was also an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas due to the high risk. Despite the initial appeal, the numerous obstacles and dangers involved made it unfeasible to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building."
131	14964	6	2	The construction team of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when planning to enable dirigibles to dock there. One prominent issue was that the building is situated in an urban area with a high volume of pedestrians on the streets. Pedestrians were understandably concerned about dirigibles flying in close proximity, as they were uncertain about potential outcomes. Additionally, the tragic destruction of a German dirigible by fire had to be taken into account. Had such an incident occurred while the dirigible was moored to the mast, it could have resulted in loss of life and the complete destruction of the building. Moreover, strengthening the Empire State Building to accommodate a dirigible would have required extensive construction work and a significant financial investment. Due to these unforeseen problems, the mooring mast did not achieve the intended success.
132	14965	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building confronted multiple obstacles in their attempt to facilitate dirigible docking. Firstly, mooring a thousand - foot dirigible at the building's top with a single cable would impose additional stress on the building's frame. Reinforcing the frame to withstand this stress would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Secondly, the combined stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure presented a significant challenge. Finally, safety was a major concern. An accident in downtown New York involving a dirigible would have had catastrophic consequences. In conclusion, these obstacles made it difficult to realize the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
133	14966	6	2	In the excerpt “The @CAPS1 Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. Safety was a primary concern. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, “most dirigibles from outside of the @CAPS2 used hydrogen rather than helium,” and hydrogen is highly flammable. Paragraph @NUM2 also indicates that “if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around,” which is neither practical nor safe; a tied - up ship should have a stable rear. Another obstacle was a law against airships flying too low. Paragraph @NUM3 reveals that “this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.” Despite some ships attempting to reach the building, these obstacles led to the lack of success in dirigible docking.
134	14967	6	2	When the concept of constructing a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building emerged, the builders were unaware of the hurdles they would need to overcome. One significant obstacle was nature. Violent air currents caused the winds on the building's summit to constantly change. If a dirigible were tied up for loading and unloading, it could be freely moved in the sky, endangering passengers on or around it. In 1930, the “U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles” was unable to get close enough to the mooring mast to tie up because of strong winds, exemplifying this danger. Safety was also a major concern as “most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.” Any mishap could have severe consequences for the densely populated downtown of @LOCATION2. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to have dirigibles dock at the top of the Empire State Building was never realized.
135	14968	6	2	Nowadays, it is evident that the idea of having dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building was absurd. However, in the @DATE1's and @NUM1's, people were unaware of the numerous failures and obstacles that the mast's builders would face. One such obstacle was that most dirigibles used hydrogen, an extremely flammable gas, instead of helium, putting the city at risk. Nature also posed a challenge; the strong winds on top of the Empire State Building made it difficult to bring dirigibles near the mast. Moreover, a law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City. Ultimately, these obstacles prevented the idea from being translated into a real - world implementation. With the development of airplanes and airports, there is no longer a need for the mast on the Empire State Building in the context of aviation.
136	14969	6	2	Builders encountered significant obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock. The most prominent issue was the safety risk of having a dirigible dangling over the city and thousands of pedestrians. Dirigibles would be held by a single cable tether, which would place excessive stress on the building's frame. Another major hurdle was nature; the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Moreover, over @MONEY1 would be required to make this docking possible. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made the task of allowing dirigibles to dock extremely challenging.
137	14970	6	2	"Enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building presented numerous obstacles. One such obstacle was that dirigibles outside the @PERSON1 used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, instead of helium. The owners of the Empire State Building were well - aware of the danger, as they realized how much worse the Hindenburg - like accident could have been if it occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Nature also posed a problem; the ""violent"" air currents made it very difficult to control the dirigible. Additionally, it was illegal for dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. As a result, dirigibles could not dock over a heavily populated city like New York. In summary, these many obstacles made docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building a challenging endeavor."
138	14971	6	2	In my view, when building the dirigible docks on the Empire State Building, builders faced a series of problems that should have been easily foreseeable. The hype surrounding the project seemed to have distracted everyone. Outside the United States, many dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. After the Hindenburg disaster, the owners of the Empire State Building recognized how catastrophic an accident could be if it happened above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Winds were also a major obstacle; the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast due to violent air currents, making it impossible for dirigibles to dock properly. There was also a law preventing airships from flying too low in urban areas, which made it illegal for them to tie up to the building or approach the area. Finally, with the passage of time, planes became the preferred mode of air transport, ending the era of dirigibles as the main provider. In conclusion, these multiple factors combined to make the construction of dirigible docks on the Empire State Building an unviable project.
139	14972	6	2	The builders faced several problems when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. As stated, most dirigibles from outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. A hydrogen - filled dirigible catching fire while docked could burn down the Empire State Building and much of the city, causing a large - scale explosion and loss of life. Nature was another significant obstacle; the constantly shifting winds on top of the building, due to violent air currents, made it nearly impossible for a dirigible to reach the mast and dock. Once tied to the mast, the dirigible would swing around violently. There was also a law against aircraft flying low over urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. With these obstacles in place, it was clear that constructing the docking mast faced major challenges. In conclusion, these three problems severely hampered the attempt to enable dirigible docking on the Empire State Building.
140	14973	6	2	"The Empire State Building builders had to confront several difficult obstacles. One was related to ""accommodating passengers"" and establishing new routes. Since new routes were not yet available, they had to bring passengers to existing trans - atlantic routes. To achieve this, the building needed to be taller, so additional structures were added on top. Nature was also a formidable obstacle. The building was affected by ""violent air currents"" that caused it to shift. Dirigibles needed more open fields for mooring, and the State Building was weighted down by lead weights. In conclusion, these challenges related to passenger accommodation, route establishment, and natural factors made the task of enabling dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a complex and difficult one."
141	14974	6	2	When constructing the Empire State Building, the builders encountered several challenges while trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, the wind currents at the docking height changed violently. These erratic winds could move the blimp, potentially causing it to collide with another building and puncture the balloon's side. Secondly, repeatedly docking dirigibles would exert significant stress on the building. This stress could disrupt the building's frame and potentially affect the entire structure. Additionally, most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, as demonstrated by the Hindenburg disaster. Due to these reasons, the mooring mast never had a docked blimp.
142	14975	6	2	As per the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, engineers encountered multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Paragraph nine states that “the stress of the dirigible's load” was a major problem. Transmitting all that weight to the building's foundation would require modifying and strengthening the Empire State Building's steel frame to adapt to the new situation, which was extremely costly. Sixty thousand dollars were necessary for the modifications. Another issue was that the blimps would not remain stationary while docked. The winds would toss them around. A proposed solution was to place weights at the back of the landing fields, but as explained in paragraph @NUM1, these weights would dangle high above pedestrians on the street. These challenges ultimately made it difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
143	14976	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous hurdles in their efforts to enable dirigibles to dock there. First, they had to ensure that the building could support the dirigible. Once this was addressed, safety concerns emerged. Some air balloons were made of flammable hydrogen. Any incident involving these balloons could put New York's population in great danger. The wind was also a significant issue. Its shifty nature would make the back of the dirigble heavy, and having it dangle above New York was extremely dangerous. Additionally, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Due to these law - related, safety, and natural complications, the builders were unable to achieve their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
144	14977	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the construction of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in enabling dirigibles to dock there. The author points out that an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for a ship to approach the area and tie up to the building. Another obstacle was the limited landing area. Expanding the landing space in New York City was a challenge, making it difficult for dirigibles to land. The most significant obstacle was nature. The weather conditions would cause the dirigibles to spin around the mooring mast. As the author states, weighting down the back of dirigibles moored in open landing fields with lead weights, which would dangle high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. These obstacles combined made it nearly impossible to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
145	14978	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders faced numerous difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Designing the mast was one such difficulty. They “could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof...” (∂ @NUM1) because it “would add stress to the building's frame” (∂ @NUM1). Modifying and strengthening the building's frame to accommodate the mast cost @MONEY1. Nature also posed problems. Since dirigibles used “hydrogen instead of helium” (∂ @NUM3), there was a high risk of fire, which was a major concern above New York City. The wind was another issue. The winds on top of the building “constantly shifted due to violent air currents” (∂ @NUM4), and weighing down the back of the ship with lead was not feasible in New York. Existing air laws were also a hurdle. There was a law against airships “flying too low over urban areas” (∂ @NUM5), making it “illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area” (∂ @NUM5). In conclusion, mast design, nature, and existing air - flight laws were some of the main difficulties the builders had to contend with.
146	14979	6	2	Among the challenges encountered during the construction of the Empire State Building was the building's height. Constructing a building of such height and expecting it to serve functions like docking dirigibles presented significant difficulties. The impact of a dirigible against the building could potentially cause it to collapse. As a result, the contractor had to reshape the building's skeleton.
147	14980	6	2	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, numerous conflicts arose when builders attempted to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Safety was a major concern. Dirigibles, unlike regular balloons, were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. Having such a volatile substance above people on the street and the building was a significant risk. Nature also posed a problem; the winds at the intended docking area were extremely strong. As the passage states, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air - currents"" (@NUM1). Additionally, there was a law against aircraft flying too close to neighborhoods. In summary, dirigibles faced multiple obstacles at the Empire State Building."
148	14981	6	2	"Al Smith, a former governor of New York, had a visionary plan to construct the Empire State Building as the world's tallest building. He proposed adding a mooring mast on top to dock dirigibles and allow passengers to disembark. However, this plan had several flaws. As @NUM1 points out, ""The stress of the dirigible's load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" Simply placing the mast on the building would likely lead to self - destruction. Another issue was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen,"" a highly flammable gas that would endanger the city section beneath the zeppelin. Moreover, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low in urban areas. Overall, these factors made the plan unfeasible."
149	14982	6	2	"In the excerpt from ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS2, the construction of the Empire State Building in New York City faced numerous obstacles. Thousands of dollars were spent on futile modifications to the building in an attempt to add a mooring mast for docking dirigibles or blimps. These efforts ultimately failed. Two primary obstacles were safety and nature. After the 1937 dirigible fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much more catastrophic the accident could have been in a densely populated area like downtown New York (@NUM1, @CAPS2). An existing law also prohibited low - flying airships in urban areas. Additionally, the unpredictable winds created a risky and dangerous situation for workers. In the end, despite the builders' efforts, dirigibles were never docked at the building."
150	14983	6	2	The Empire State Building encountered several significant problems when attempting to create a docking station for dirigibles. Firstly, at that time, there was a law that prohibited any kind of airship from landing or docking in a residential area, let alone a densely - populated city. Secondly, even if the mast was built, there were numerous practical issues. Docking and keeping the large airships in place would have been a major challenge. Moreover, dirigibles were often filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas, which added to the danger. In conclusion, these problems made it impossible to establish a successful dirigible docking station at the Empire State Building.
151	14984	6	2	"The Empire State Building's builders encountered multiple reasons that hindered dirigibles from docking there. One factor was the weather; as noted, ""the greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Another was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Additionally, having dirigibles dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. These were among the problems faced in this endeavor."
152	14985	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome several obstacles. Ensuring the safety of passengers boarding the dirigibles was a primary concern, as they needed to eliminate any form of danger. Arranging the dirigibles to board passengers was another challenge. @PERSON1 stated that ""the height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gears"". Moreover, people's reluctance to try using the dirigibles was an obstacle. Al Smith did not want the mooring mast to become just a decoration. As the excerpt indicated, ""The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"", suggesting that the architects did not plan far enough ahead. These were some of the obstacles the builders had to face."
153	14986	6	2	During the construction of a mast to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders confronted numerous obstacles. The most significant one was nature. It was unrealistic to expect a dirigible tied by a single cable tether to remain stable when the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mast, posing a hazard to pedestrians. Since the builders could not alter nature, their plans soon became unfeasible. Another issue was that the dirigible's weight, especially with added wind pressure, would place excessive stress on the building's frame. To address this, they decided to shift the weight to the building's foundation. In conclusion, these obstacles made the construction of a functional docking mast extremely challenging.
154	14987	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One problem was attaching a mooring mast to the building's top. Due to the building's height, they could not simply drop the mast onto the roof as it would interfere with the overall frame. The architects spent thousands of dollars modifying the building's framework to keep the mooring mast on the roof. Another obstacle was ensuring the safety of the public below. Dirigibles were inflated with highly flammable hydrogen, creating a risk of a massive explosion over New York and endangering countless lives. Additionally, the natural conditions were a major hurdle. Violent air currents around the Empire State Building meant that even if a dirigible were tied to the roof, the back of the ship would swivel, posing more danger to the people below. These obstacles prevented the successful construction of a mooring mast for dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
155	14988	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. The building's frame was an issue; as described in @LOCATION1 @NUM1, attaching a dirigible would add stress to the frame, necessitating the modification of the entire frame to a stronger material for the mooring mast to work. Safety was one of the biggest obstacles. Most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen as fuel, posing a significant fire risk when flying over a densely - populated area like New York. The conditions at the top of the building were also a problem, with violent winds causing dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. Moreover, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to fly up to the Empire State Building as per @LOCATION1. Given these numerous obstacles, it is clear why the mooring mast was not used.
156	14989	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. They couldn't simply let dirigibles land on the building's flat roof as the weight would add stress to the building's frame. The plan didn't materialize for several reasons. A major concern was safety. Dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, which was too dangerous to use above New York. The most significant problem was the wind, which constantly changed due to air - currents. Although the dirigible could be tethered, it would float above pedestrians. Ultimately, the plan to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building for dirigibles to dock was a failure.
157	14990	6	2	"During the construction of the Empire State Building, Al Smith thought he had solved the problem of dirigibles having no landing place. However, using the building as a docking site for dirigibles was far more difficult than expected. Firstly, the balloon would put excessive stress on the building's frame. As the author states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Moreover, modifying the frame would require a large investment. The author notes, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Investing in such an uncertain project was too risky. Additionally, the potential danger of accidents over a densely populated area was a major concern. The author explains, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). A mishap could have affected a large part of New York. In conclusion, despite the impressive concept of creating a mast for dirigibles, it was neither financially nor safety - wise logical."
158	14991	6	2	While building the mast, the builders faced numerous obstacles in enabling dirigibles to dock. The building itself was the first hurdle. Adding the mast would place a great deal of stress on the building's frame, necessitating strengthening modifications before its erection. Another issue was properly tethering the blimp. Usually, blimps are landed in wide - open fields where weights can be placed at the front and back for secure anchoring. But when attaching a blimp to a mast, there was no way to secure the back, and thus no safe way to tie it down. Finally, getting the blimp docked was a major problem. High winds on top of the building made docking infeasible except in perfect weather conditions. Due to these problems, the mast could never be used for its intended purpose.
159	14992	6	2	Multiple obstacles hindered the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building. One obstacle was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Additionally, the builders had to reinforce parts of the building to withstand the stress that dirigibles would exert on the frame. Lastly, natural conditions made it impossible to safely dock dirigibles. Violent winds would shift the back of the dirigible, causing it to sway wildly. These obstacles collectively ensured that dirigibles could not be docked at the Empire State Building.
160	14993	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. The dirigibles would add stress to the building's frame, requiring the steel frame of the Empire State Building to be modified and strengthened. Over sixty thousand dollars were needed to make these modifications. The greatest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. These factors presented significant challenges to the builders' attempt to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, ultimately preventing its realization.
161	14994	6	2	"In the short - story ""The Mooring Mast"" penned by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building's builders encountered numerous obstacles during the construction of the mast. Strengthening the entire steel frame of the building was necessary to support the mast's weight. The mast, standing over @NUM1 feet tall, would have put stress on the building's steel frame, weakening its foundation. To hold the mast, modifications worth over sixty thousand dollars had to be made to the building's framework. This required the builders to carefully plan how to prevent the mast from bending the steel frame. A new law also presented an obstacle. It prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York. As a result, it would be illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area, causing the mast to be rarely used. Despite their efforts, significant changes to the Empire State Building's framework were needed to accommodate the mast. However, the new law restricted airship docking, so the mast was not used as frequently as initially planned. Although the mast contributed to the Empire State Building becoming the world's largest building at 1,250 feet, it necessitated strengthening and fixing the building's framework, and its usage fell short of the builders' expectations."
162	14995	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders faced multiple challenges when constructing it for dirigibles to dock. A single - cable tether would add stress to the building, so they decided to modify and strengthen the frame. Obtaining the right equipment was another hurdle. They had to gather information from the @ORGANIZATION2 air station. Additionally, the dirigibles were filled with oxygen instead of helium, making them highly flammable, a crucial safety consideration. In their attempt to make the building suitable for dirigibles, they encountered construction, safety, and danger - related problems. In conclusion, these obstacles combined to make the process of building the Empire State Building for dirigibles a complex and challenging task.
163	14996	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the workers were exploring new methods to @CAPS1 the structure. They suddenly encountered problems, particularly regarding the top of the building. The workers aimed to place dirigibles on the building's top to pick up and drop off passengers, but they faced various issues. In conclusion, these unforeseen problems complicated their efforts to achieve this goal.
164	14997	6	2	The Empire State Building's mast builders had to surmount many obstacles. They needed to address the stress a docked airship would impose on the building. As @CAPS1 noted, the stress would be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, necessitating modifications to the steel frame to handle the load. Weather conditions at that height were also a challenge. Violent air currents caused the winds on top of the building to constantly shift, which would buffet any airship attempting to dock. Safety was another major concern. As @CAPS1 stated, most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. The possibility of a Hindenburg - type accident over a densely populated area worried the builders. In conclusion, these significant obstacles ultimately led to the failure of the project.
165	14998	6	2	The attempt to make the Empire State Building a docking point for dirigibles presented the builders with the most severe problems. Obstacles vary according to the scale of the goal, and since the goal was extremely large, the difficulties were at their peak. The issues included legal, natural, safety, and docking - related aspects. The location was the primary problem. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transferred to the foundation nearly eleven hundred feet below. This could have not only destroyed the entire building but also sent it crashing onto pedestrians within an eleven - hundred - foot radius in the direction of the pull. Dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant safety risk, especially over a densely populated urban area like New York. The building's height meant it was exposed to stronger and constantly shifting winds due to violent air currents. This could have made the dirigibles strain against the building or hit the mooring point. Moreover, laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Despite the Empire State Building's height, it was still too close to the public. Overall, the builders' over - ambition created obstacles for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Although the original purpose might have been a failure, the Empire State Building remains the tallest constructed building.
166	14999	6	2	The architects of the Empire State Building had to overcome numerous obstacles to enable the docking of dirigibles. One such obstacle was the building's frame. If a thousand - foot dirigible were moored on the building's top with a single cable tether, the load of the dirigible and wind pressure would exert tremendous stress on the building's foundation. Safety was another significant obstacle. Since dirigibles in the relevant location used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, there was a high risk of explosion, which would endanger the dense population of downtown New York City. High winds also posed a major challenge. The winds on top of the Empire State Building constantly shifted due to violent air currents. Even if lead weights were used to control the docked dirigible, they would dangle unsafely above the pedestrians on the streets below. These were the obstacles the architects faced in their attempt to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
167	15000	6	2	"In Marcia Amidon @CAPS1's ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was constructing a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. As a single - cable - tethered, thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top would add stress to the building's frame, the structure could not support the combined stress of the dirigible and wind pressure. Safety became a concern as well. After learning that most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, the building's owners recognized the danger of having a flammable object fly over a densely populated area, a risk highlighted by the fire that destroyed a German dirigible in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Nature also presented an issue. The winds on the building's top caused the dirigible's back end to swivel around the mooring mast, and weights could not be used to stabilize it as they would dangle above street pedestrians. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to be tied to the building or approach the area. Given these reasons, it is clear that the builders faced many hurdles in their attempt to enable dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
168	15001	6	2	The concept of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was ambitious but ultimately doomed from the start. The engineers and builders of the mooring mast confronted multiple obstacles that could impede safe docking. The first major challenge was tethering the dirigible to the dock. As described in paragraph @NUM1, a single - cable - tethered, thousand - foot dirigible moored at the building's top would add stress to the building's frame, necessitating modifications to the entire structure. Another obstacle was stabilizing the tethered dirigible. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, the constantly shifting winds on the building's top, caused by violent air currents, would make it extremely difficult for passengers and crew to embark or disembark. These challenges perplexed the engineers and builders of the Empire State Building until the project was ultimately abandoned.
169	15002	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigible docking, and ultimately, it was not possible. One obstacle was the need to modify the building's foundation. As the story indicates, the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the nearly eleven - hundred - foot - below foundation. Due to the building's height, the dock would be moved around by the winds. Moreover, the blimp could not attach to the dock because of the strong winds. In conclusion, the docking project was fraught with problems for both the builders and the architects, and it was not meant to succeed.
170	15003	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced several obstacles when creating docks for dirigibles at the Empire State Building. Many people would struggle with this task. One major obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City, as stated: ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Another potential issue was that dirigibles might take too long to fuel up, causing congestion with other dirigibles. Despite these significant obstacles, the builders managed to find a way to use the dirigibles without major problems."
171	15004	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon, the author describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building encountered when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Three primary obstacles were a lack of a suitable landing area, the need to reconstruct the building's framework, and a law prohibiting such activities. Dirigibles are large steel - framed balloons with cotton - fabric envelopes, filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter and more buoyant. Due to their large size, some exceeding one thousand feet, there was no proper landing space. As stated, “The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof, it would add too much stress to the building's frame.” Additionally, over sixty thousand dollars would be required to reconstruct the framework to support the dirigibles. Moreover, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Even if a landing area was built and the framework was reconstructed, the law would prevent the use of the docking facilities. In conclusion, despite the appealing idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building, the obstacles, including the lack of a suitable landing area, framework reconstruction, and the restrictive law, were insurmountable for the builders.
172	15005	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One practical obstacle was a law that prohibited airships from flying too close over urban areas such as New York. This law made it illegal for a dirigible to approach the building. Another significant concern was safety. Since dirigibles often used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, there was a risk of explosion that could harm people below if a ship attempted to dock. The most challenging obstacle was the constantly shifting winds caused by air currents. Even if a dirigible was tethered, it could swivel around the tower and become tangled. In conclusion, although some ships attempted to dock, the difficulties were too great, and the idea of dirigibles regularly docking at the Empire State Building had to be abandoned.
173	15006	6	2	I've visited the Empire State Building and gone all the way to the top. Even though the top was closed, several windows were open, and I vividly remember how incredibly windy it was up there. The thought of parking a blimp on top of the building is as absurd as trying to park a car in a flood. I kept waiting for this factor to be mentioned in the story, and it finally was. As stated, “The winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents.” Besides the parking issue, passengers would have to disembark on a swaying gang - plank, which wouldn't be pleasant. Another problem was the law. There was “an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.” I believe that before spending a significant amount of money on such an unrealistic project, they should have at least ensured legal clearance. After reading the essay, it's clear to me that the project was doomed from the start.
174	15007	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith proposed installing a mooring mast at the top of the building, which would allow dirigibles to dock for a few hours for refueling, servicing, and passenger boarding and disembarking. However, another issue was how the dirigible would be moored. A single - cable tether would hold the dirigible, adding stress to the building's frame. The stress from the load and wind pressure would need to be transferred to the building's foundation, about eleven hundred feet below. Additionally, the choice of using hydrogen or helium presented a problem. Hydrogen is highly flammable, as evidenced by the destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire. These are the main obstacles the builders had to face when trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
175	15008	6	2	In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the author discusses the construction of the Empire State Building, also known as the Mooring Mast, and its original purposes. During the building's construction, the builders faced several issues in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, including architectural problems, gas - related concerns, and legal restrictions. Architecturally, the flat rooftop was a problem. As stated, “the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof,” because the heavy dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. Gas was another issue. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. This meant that there was a risk of the building and downtown New York catching fire. Finally, there was a law, “an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,” which made it illegal to tie a dirigible to the building. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
176	15009	6	2	The excerpt “The Mooring Mast” penned by Marcia Amidon L¸sted elucidates the construction of the Empire State Building in New York. It details the building - construction steps along with the obstacles and challenges confronted by the builders. The architects of the Empire State Building, in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock there, failed to consider the potential problems associated with such a large - scale project. Al Smith was the mastermind behind the plan to build a docking mast on the Empire State Building. His enthusiasm for the mast led him to overlook the complications of his so - called “master” plan. Due to the stress from the dirigible’s load and wind pressure, strengthening the building’s frame became necessary, incurring a cost of over sixty thousand dollars. The most significant hurdle for the builders was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. An accident involving a hydrogen - filled dirigible over a densely populated area like downtown New York would have been catastrophic. Another obstacle was nature; the winds atop the building were in a constant state of shift due to violent air currents. Additionally, there was an existing law restricting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This excerpt serves as a reminder that one should thoroughly assess potential obstacles before embarking on a large - scale challenge.
177	15010	6	2	When the builders of the Empire State Building aimed to allow dirigibles to dock there, they encountered numerous obstacles. Among these were the risk of accidents occurring over densely populated areas and the issue of violent air currents that caused the wind direction to constantly change. These challenges presented significant difficulties in making the dirigible - docking plan a reality.
178	15011	6	2	At first glance, the idea of installing a mast on top of the Empire State Building seemed brilliant. People considered it a great concept to dock dirigibles on the mast, especially given the dearth of suitable landing areas in New York City. However, it is easy to understand why the mooring mast would never be capable of docking dirigibles. One key reason is that most of these dirigibles contained hydrogen, a highly flammable substance. The destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, made the Empire State Building’s management realize how much worse such an accident could be if it happened over a highly populated area; countless people would lose their lives. Another factor is the existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Even if all the docking arrangements were set up properly, operating dirigibles so close to the city would be a violation of the law. The most obvious deterrent, though, is the unpredictable weather above the Empire State Building. The winds on the building’s rooftop are in a constant state of flux due to violent air currents, making the mooring mast an extremely unstable place to dock dirigibles.
179	15012	6	2	When architects attempted to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, they were confronted with multiple problems. One of the issues pertained to the building’s frame. Modification and strengthening of the frame were required to support the new mast. Safety was another major obstacle. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, “hydrogen is highly flammable.” In the event of a dirigible catching fire, not only would the passengers be at risk, but also the people on the crowded streets below. The high - altitude winds also posed a threat. Paragraph @NUM2 explains that the violent air currents would cause the back of the dirigible to swing erratically, making it difficult for passengers to disembark. These were just a few of the many challenges that the builders faced while trying to enable dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
180	15013	6	2	In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building had the aspiration of having dirigibles dock at the building’s top. However, they discovered that this was unfeasible. The winds were a major hindrance as they would push the dirigibles in various directions. Moreover, there was a law stipulating that aircraft must maintain a certain altitude in the air. These factors effectively precluded the possibility of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building.
181	15014	6	2	When the Empire State Building was initially conceptualized, it was intended to become the world's tallest structure, surpassing even the newly - constructed Chrysler Building located at 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue in New York. The top of the Empire State Building was to be more than just an ornament, not merely a spire, dome, or pyramid. This was the era of dirigibles, and in the United States, the navy was at the forefront of dirigibles' research and development. As a result, architects couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. Once they designed the mooring mast, they also had to make adjustments to the existing plans for the building's skeleton.
182	15015	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered significant obstacles. They couldn't just place a mooring mast on the flat roof. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure needed to be transferred to the building's foundation. Thus, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to handle this new situation. Safety was the most crucial factor. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. The winds on the building's top were constantly changing due to strong air currents, causing the back of the ship to spin around the mooring mast. Additionally, there were existing laws against airships flying too low. Considering all these factors, the project faced multiple challenges that had to be carefully addressed.
183	15016	6	2	The construction of the Empire State Building presented several obstacles to the builders. High - altitude winds were a significant issue, as they could affect the stability of airships. There were also laws restricting airships from being too close to urban areas. The safety of passengers on the airships and pedestrians below was of utmost concern. These factors combined made the task of building the Empire State Building with the intention of airship docking a complex and challenging endeavor.
184	15017	6	2	The building was large and aesthetically pleasing. Its grand size commanded attention, while its beauty added to its allure. Overall, it was a remarkable structure that left a lasting impression.
185	15018	6	2	Engineers' notion of having dirigibles dock on the building was both unrealistic and unsafe. One key issue was that the dirigible would impose additional stress on the building's frame. The weight of the dirigible and wind pressure would pose problems for the foundation. Moreover, dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. An explosion would have been a catastrophic event for downtown New York. In conclusion, this idea lacks both practicality and safety, making it an unfeasible concept.
186	15019	6	2	According to the excerpt “The Mooring @CAPS1” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building's builders encountered specific challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. These included violent air - currents and pedestrian safety. Violent air - currents were a significant obstacle. The excerpt indicates that the winds on the building's top were in a constant state of shift. If a dirigible got caught in these conditions, it would dangle high above pedestrians. As stated, “the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring @CAPS1, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.” (@NUM1) Pedestrian safety was another concern. After learning about the German dirigible Hindenburg's fiery destruction in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the building owners recognized that such an accident in a densely populated area like New York would have been far worse. As noted, “owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.” In conclusion, as described in the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building's builders faced obstacles such as violent air - currents and pedestrian safety when trying to allow dirigibles to dock.
187	15020	6	2	The Empire State Building had numerous hurdles when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock. Given its great height, large and sudden wind shifts were a persistent concern. Wind shifts occur when the wind's direction changes abruptly; it could be blowing from @LOCATION1 one minute and from @LOCATION2 the next. On May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg caught fire. People then wondered what would have happened if such an incident had occurred over the Empire State Building in New York City, a highly populated area. It would have been chaotic. Additionally, airships were not permitted to fly at low altitudes anyway. In conclusion, these factors made it extremely difficult for the Empire State Building to accommodate dirigible docking.
188	15021	6	2	It was no surprise that the task of enabling dirigibles to dock 1,250 feet above the ground in New York City presented several challenges to the Empire State Building's builders. Before dirigibles could even attempt to dock on the mast, the builders had to modify the entire building to withstand the stress and pressure exerted by the dirigibles. These modifications cost over sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the building. Once the modifications were completed, a new set of obstacles emerged. Most non - US dirigibles were filled with flammable hydrogen. The German dirigible @CAPS1 was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION3, New Jersey, which worried @CAPS2. The shifting winds and air currents also made it difficult to dock dirigibles. Moreover, there were laws against airships flying too close to the ground. Due to these unforeseen challenges, the idea of docking dirigibles on top of the building was abandoned.
189	15022	6	2	Based on the excerpt, the Empire State Building's builders faced multiple insurmountable obstacles. These included wind currents, anchoring problems, fire risks, sharp spires, and legal issues. The wind currents were an unanticipated problem. Since dirigibles are essentially large propelled balloons, the wind at 1,250 feet, with little to slow or block it, could easily push them around. Another oversight was that hydrogen, a key gas for lifting dirigibles, is highly flammable. If a dirigible caught fire in @CAPS2, dozens or even hundreds of people below would be in danger. The sharp spires on nearby buildings were also a concern. If a pilot lost control of the blimp, it could cause @MONEY1 worth of damage to the city. Finally, a new law was in the legislative process, which prohibited air travel below a certain altitude in residential areas. In conclusion, these various obstacles made it impossible for the Empire State Building's builders to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock.
190	15023	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders faced numerous challenges when attempting to facilitate dirigible docking. Safety was a major concern. Most dirigibles from outside the [@LOCATION2] used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. The building owners quickly realized the potential danger of an accident occurring above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Nature also posed a significant obstacle. The building's top was subject to constantly shifting winds due to violent air currents. Mooring a thousand - foot dirigible on the building would place an enormous amount of stress on its frame. In the end, these two obstacles were insurmountable. With the changing times and the rise of airplanes in modern travel, the dirigible and the mooring mast concept for the Empire State Building were ultimately doomed.
191	15024	6	2	The construction of the Empire State Building with provisions for dirigible docking encountered numerous challenges. Firstly, the top of the building had to be modified into a mooring mast, and the steel frame required adjustment to accommodate the dirigible. A docking and ticketing area also had to be created, incurring additional costs. There were safety concerns as well, such as the risk of the dirigible hitting objects or catching fire due to its hydrogen gas. Nature presented a significant hurdle, with violent winds near the building. Moreover, a law prohibited dirigibles or airships from flying too low over urban areas, and a broken dirigible shell could endanger many people. Considering all these factors, the plan to use the building for dirigible docking faced insurmountable obstacles.
192	15025	6	2	Building a large - scale structure like the Empire State Building and enabling it to dock a dirigible at its top presents several challenges. To allow for docking, the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure must be transferred to the building's foundation. This requires modifications to the building, which in turn implies additional expenses. All these issues need to be carefully considered before proceeding with such a project. In conclusion, the complexity and cost associated with these requirements make this a difficult undertaking.
193	15026	6	2	When the builders of the Empire State Building aimed to allow dirigibles to dock, they had noble intentions but faced multiple obstacles. It was far from an easy task. If a thousand - foot dirigible were moored at the building's top with a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame. All this stress would be transmitted to the foundation, necessitating the modification and strengthening of the steel at a cost of over @MONEY1. Nature was the biggest challenge, with constantly shifting winds at the top, posing a safety risk. There was also a law against airships flying too low, which hindered docking. Additionally, since some dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, there was a high fire risk. Given these numerous unsafe outcomes, the project was too risky to pursue, and safety concerns ultimately prevented its construction.
194	15027	6	2	One of the challenges faced by the Empire State Building's builders was that constructing the mooring mast would add stress to the building because of its height. To address this, the architects designed a special type of stainless steel that could be internally illuminated and provide support. Another issue was that dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Having an airship with flammable gas near populated areas was deemed unreasonable, leading to the passage of a law banning dirigibles from approaching the public. Nature also posed a problem, as high - speed winds, along with lead weights on the dirigibles, created a safety hazard. Due to these issues, the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was never put to use.
195	15028	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when trying to enable dirigible docking. They were aware that the mooring mast had flaws, and the primary concern was safety. The hydrogen in dirigibles is highly flammable, and after the 1937 accident in New Jersey, they realized the potential danger of a similar incident occurring in New York. As a result, they abandoned the idea and shifted the focus of transportation to airplanes. In summary, safety concerns were the deciding factor in scrapping the dirigible - docking plan.
196	15029	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. One significant issue was the additional stress on the building's frame when a dirigible was attached at the top. As stated, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This meant the frame had to be rearranged. Ultimately, the workers were unable to achieve the goal. Safety was also a major factor in the failure to dock dirigibles. Dirigibles were highly flammable, which could have led to a serious accident. Moreover, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Strong air currents above the building would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around"" when attached to the mooring mast. There was also an existing law that prohibited planes from flying low over city areas, making it impossible for dirigibles to reach the building. Due to these obstacles, the goal of docking dirigibles was not realized."
197	15030	6	2	"The builders faced obstacles related to the safety of those below and on the dirigible. One problem was that if a dirigible had an incident similar to the Hindenburg, pedestrians below could be injured if the zeppelin crashed. For passengers, crashing was a risk in a city environment. For example, the ""Los Angeles"" couldn't get close enough because strong high - altitude winds could have knocked it into another building. Other obstacles were nature and the law. High - altitude wind currents are strong and changeable. If a dirigible were tethered, the wind would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. The final obstacle was the law; existing laws prohibited dirigibles from flying low in urban areas. If ships were to tether to the building, they would be doing so illegally. In conclusion, these obstacles made it difficult for the builders to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock."
198	15031	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mooring mast was intended to put New York at the forefront of modern travel, but they had to overcome several issues. Firstly, the building needed to be strengthened to support ""a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top."" As a result, the frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and reinforced. According to the excerpt, @MONEY1 worth of changes were required to the building's framework. Another problem was the stress of wind pressure, which had to be transmitted to the building's foundation. They thought they could solve this by making changes to the building's skeleton. Lastly, the building needed a space for passengers arriving from the ""blimps."" To address this, they built a shaft to bring passengers down to the @NUM1 floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. In summary, the builders had to tackle many problems before even attempting to build a mast for dirigibles to dock."
199	15032	6	2	"In this excerpt, various obstacles arose in the construction of the mooring mast. What started as a dream became more of an attempt to set a record for the world's tallest building. The most significant obstacle was safety. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This meant there was a risk of the dirigible being destroyed by fire while docking on the Empire State Building, which would cause extensive damage in New York. The builders also faced the force of nature. Violent air currents at high altitudes would make the dirigible swerve around the mooring mast. There was also a legal issue; as mentioned in paragraph @NUM2, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" meant dirigibles were never going to be allowed to fly close to the Empire State Building. These were the main obstacles the builders had to confront."
200	15033	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. As stated in paragraph nine, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" This was a major hurdle as over sixty thousand dollars worth of work would be needed to the building to accommodate the new station. Another significant obstacle was an existing law. As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Nature also posed a problem. As described in paragraph @NUM2, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could be extremely dangerous, especially if the back of the ship dangled over the surrounding streets, creating many safety hazards. In conclusion, these were the main obstacles the builders had to overcome if the Empire State Building was to serve as a landing dock."
201	15034	6	2	"According to the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there, including safety, nature, and legislation. Firstly, ensuring the safe docking of foreign dirigibles was a challenge. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This indicates that fire safety was a significant obstacle. Secondly, air currents posed difficulties for the safe docking of dirigibles. The air near the building's top was affected by air currents, making it hard for pilots to land. Additionally, ""using [lead weights] at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Since there was no way to deal with the uncertainty of the wind, nature became an obstacle. Finally, there were laws regarding aircraft flying too close to the city. Paragraph @NUM2 mentions, ""[There] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" As the very purpose of the moor would be illegal, it was nearly impossible for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges regarding the moor, and as a result, its opening for dirigible docking was never successful."
202	15035	6	2	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was the lack of space. As it was stated, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area,"" indicating the difficulty of finding a landing spot. However, safety was also a major concern. The excerpt mentions that ""the mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service and to let passengers off and on,"" which implies that landing and refueling would take a long time. Another obstacle was the testing of dirigibles on the mast. In conclusion, these various obstacles made it challenging for the builders to achieve successful dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
203	15036	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. The most significant obstacle was finding a safe method for docking. New York City is a densely - populated area, and any accident would have been catastrophic. As noted in @CAPS2 @NUM1, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as @CAPS1."" Another obstacle was nature. The wind at the top of the building was too strong. As described in @CAPS2 @NUM2, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast."" Clearly, safety was the primary concern for the builders. In conclusion, these obstacles made it extremely difficult to implement dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
204	15037	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles due to a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building, as there was a fear that the wind might blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which could damage the dirigible's shell. Later, when another dirigible attempted a publicity stunt by tying up and delivering a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building, the idea of mooring dirigibles was shelved. The unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it unfeasible. As a result, the highest open observatory dock, intended for disembarking passengers, has never been opened to the public. In conclusion, the combination of legal and practical obstacles prevented the successful implementation of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
205	15038	6	2	"The builder's main issue was safety. Most blimps not made in @LOCATION1 are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If a disaster similar to the Hindenburg accident occurred while the blimp was moving towards the tethers at the Empire State Building, the consequences would have been far more disastrous. Another obstacle was the winds. As the excerpt states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" A final obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" In conclusion, the builders faced numerous challenges when attempting to allow blimps to dock at the Empire State Building, and these obstacles made the implementation of blimp docking a difficult task."
206	15039	6	2	"The Empire State Building's builders encountered obstacles when aiming to enable dirigibles to dock there. As stated in the excerpt, ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on."" This indicates that the builders had to construct a mooring mast to provide time for refueling or servicing and to ensure the safe embarkation and disembarkation of passengers. Another excerpt mentions, ""The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform."" This shows that the builders built a gangplank to allow people to safely move to and from the dirigible. Overall, the builders faced challenges in creating the necessary infrastructure for dirigible docking."
207	15040	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building confronted numerous obstacles. The building is one of the tallest in the world, so a single misstep in the construction plan could be disastrous for those below. When they began constructing the mooring mast, they were aware of some risks but did not fully consider them. The idea was introduced because Al Smith wanted the Empire State Building to be the largest. However, they did not thoroughly investigate the implications. If a blimp were to land on the mooring mast, they would need to consider weather, wind, and the strength of the building's foundation. Additionally, dirigibles at that time were filled with hydrogen. If something went wrong and a blimp caught a spark over downtown New York, it could burn four city - blocks. In conclusion, the lack of comprehensive planning led to significant potential hazards in the attempt to enable blimp docking.
208	15041	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous problems when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some blimps are filled with highly flammable hydrogen. If a hydrogen - filled blimp were to explode over New York City, it would be disastrous for the people there, potentially resulting in loss of life. An incident in New Jersey, where a hydrogen - filled blimp exploded, made the builders think carefully about the docking station. As a result, they decided to only allow blimps filled with helium to dock there. In summary, safety concerns related to hydrogen - filled blimps led to restrictions on the types of dirigibles that could use the docking facility.
209	15042	6	2	The concept of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was fraught with problems, including natural impediments and pre - existing laws. During the era of frequent dirigible travel, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey due to a fire - related complication. This event revealed a previously overlooked issue: most foreign dirigibles were inflated with flammable hydrogen gas. The thought of a similar catastrophe occurring over one of the world's most densely populated cities made the idea unfeasible. The project workers also failed to consider laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Despite the Empire State Building being expected to be the world's tallest, the planned mooring mast would still be too close to the city's millions of inhabitants. After test runs of the new mooring system, it was found that strong winds prevented dirigibles from getting close to the mast. The fear of the winds blowing the dirigible into another building's spire also contributed to the decision. Ultimately, the combination of these problems led to the abandonment of the idea of using a mooring mast on the Empire State Building.
210	15043	6	2	"Al Smith and the Empire State Building's builders faced multiple obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The first was designing strengthening beams for the frame and foundation to handle the extra stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure. Second, the gases used in some dirigibles were unsafe. As Løsted (@NUM1) noted, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Inefficient gases and violent air currents could cause the dirigible to spin or require lead weights that would dangle above pedestrians (Løsted, @NUM2). Moreover, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas (Løsted, @NUM3). Thus, allowing dirigibles to dock was not only unsafe and impractical but also illegal. In conclusion, these obstacles made the plan unviable."
211	15044	6	2	"The construction team of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when endeavoring to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. Firstly, a ""thousand - foot dirigible... would add stress to the building's frame"", which necessitated strengthening the frame. Secondly, there was a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", making it illegal to dock an airship on the building as it would be at a low altitude. Finally, the most arduous obstacle was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This was unsafe and impractical as the dirigibles would be above street pedestrians. Due to all these complications and challenges, the project to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was never completed."
212	15045	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the issue of safety. Dirigibles used more hydrogen than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant risk. The excerpt also indicates that nature was the greatest obstacle. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting, causing the back of the airship to swivel. Additionally, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These were the obstacles that the Empire State Building's builders had to confront, ultimately preventing the successful implementation of the dirigible - docking plan."
213	15046	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous problems when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock. One major issue was the legality; as stated, ""there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". Mother nature also posed a significant challenge, with ""the winds on top of the building constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Despite these difficulties, some dirigibles attempted to dock. In 1930, the U.S. Navy's Los Angeles tried to dock but failed due to severe winds. New York was a densely populated area, and having explosive hydrogen floating low over the city was a huge threat, as demonstrated by the destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Moreover, the builders had to make the building strong enough, which involved modifying the frame and designing a custom mooring device. In conclusion, the builders faced both legal and safety problems when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
214	15047	6	2	"The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted details the plans to add a mast to the top of the Empire State Building for anchoring blimps. This concept was complex, yet architects in the @DATE1's believed it was achievable. However, they underestimated the numerous problems and obstacles that would impede the mast's success. A minor setback was that the mast and the attached blimp would add significant stress to the building's frame, which was resolved by modifying and strengthening the foundation and frame. The most substantial obstacle was the heavy, constantly - shifting winds at the top of the building, caused by violent air currents. The greatest issue, though, was public safety. Most foreign blimps at the time were filled with highly flammable gas, which ultimately led to the mooring mast's lack of success."
215	15048	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many hurdles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. The author of the excerpt states that ""dirigibles were being hailed as the transport of the future"", which motivated the builders to work harder and find solutions. Architects and engineers consulted experts about the equipment needed for building dirigibles and asked people to test them. They also had to work on the mooring mast to make the dirigible function properly, but this was extremely difficult. As mentioned in the text, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". By the 1930s, the idea of using dirigibles at the Empire State Building was essentially abandoned due to these persistent challenges."
216	15049	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the structure. One significant issue was the weight and pressure exerted by a dirigible on a single tether at the building's apex. All the stress from the rope would transfer through the building, reaching the base a thousand feet below. Additionally, nature presented a major hurdle. High - speed, constantly shifting winds at the building meant that if a dirigible were tethered at the front by just one rope, its rear would be free to move in the wind, risking collisions with the building. In conclusion, the builders had to overcome multiple obstacles to pursue this project.
217	15050	6	2	In the excerpt “THE MOORING MAST” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the workers faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. They couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the building's top. When thousand - foot dirigibles were moored there with a single cable tether, it added stress to the building's frame. The most substantial obstacle was the mooring mast on the building, considering the winds shifting due to violent air currents. Another problem was that dirigibles were usually moored in open fields and weighted at the back, and here they would dangle high above street pedestrians. These were the challenges the workers had to confront.
218	15051	6	2	In “The Mooring Mask” by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building's builders had to deal with nature, safety, and the law as obstacles. Al Smith, @CAPS1 of New York and the one who oversaw the construction of the Empire State Building, was set on making it the tallest building. A mooring mast, which would be a docking station for dirigibles, was essential for this goal. However, building the mooring mast brought obstacles. Nature was one; the high - speed winds at the building's top would make the dirigible sway. Usually, lead weights were used to prevent swaying, but here they would dangle @NUM1 ft above pedestrians. Safety was another concern as many dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and an ignition in New York City could cause a large - scale disaster. The law also posed an obstacle; it prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making the mooring mast's intended use illegal. Today, the mooring mast serves only as decoration.
219	15052	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. The mooring mast was doomed to never serve its purpose, and the reasons should have been clear before construction began. Safety was the primary factor. There was a risk of fire since most dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. The potential damage in a densely - populated area like downtown New York was too great. Nature was another obstacle; the wind on the building's top constantly shifted due to violent air currents. Moreover, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to or approach the building. Instead of becoming a future mode of transportation, the idea faded away as the obstacles were insurmountable.
220	15053	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before construction ever took place. The main reason for this was safety. First, there was a chance that it could catch on fire. For example, most dirigibles are made of hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. They relized how much damage it could do if it caught on fire in a densely populated area, such as downtown New York. Secondly, they had another obstacle to the successful use of the mooring that was nature itself. For example, the wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Lastly dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because they was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it. Instead of becoming the transportation of the future the idea had disappeared. They faced to many obstacles that could not be overcome."
221	15054	6	2	When constructing this, they encountered several issues. They later realized that it was neither intelligent nor safe to have a dirigible suspended from a 102 - story building by just one cable tether. Another problem was their inability to control nature. On very windy days, it would be difficult to keep the dirigible steady. Moreover, if the building frames lacked sufficient support, the building could potentially collapse.
222	15055	6	2	The construction team of the Empire State Building confronted multiple potential issues when considering allowing dirigibles to dock there. High - altitude strong winds above the city streets could cause the dirigible to sway sideways and potentially puncture against the tops of other buildings. Additionally, many dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, rendering them highly flammable. Also, the additional stress of a moored dirigible on the Empire State Building could easily lead to cracks or even the collapse of the building and its foundation. Fortunately, the builders and engineers of the mooring mast had the good sense to halt its production, as the mast was seemingly just a guise for the competitive nature of the building's designers.
223	15056	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in enabling dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. The lack of a suitable landing area was a significant hurdle. It is illegal for airships to fly at low altitudes over urban areas. Having a dirigible dangling high above people was not safe. Dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium to stay airborne, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. Establishing a dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building would be unsafe, and the builders would need to devise a new plan. Thus, there were numerous obstacles to overcome.
224	15057	6	2	In the [date]'s, technology and engineering were not as advanced. So, it is reasonable to say that the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles. One of the main issues was that they had no idea how to safely dock the dirigible and keep it stable. Back then, they did not possess the knowledge or technology required for such a task.
225	15058	6	2	There were numerous obstacles preventing dirigibles from docking on the Empire State Building. One significant problem was that dirigibles globally were mostly filled with flammable hydrogen. This was exemplified by the May 6, 1937 incident where a dirigible was destroyed by fire. The owners of the Empire State Building recognized “how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place in a densely populated area” (CAPS1 NUM1). Another potential issue was the strong wind currents atop the building, as described in CAPS1 NUM2. These strong currents could prevent a dirigible from docking and might blow it into another building, puncturing the dirigible's material and causing a terrifying accident. The final obstacle was the legal prohibition. The law stated that “airships flying too low over urban areas” was forbidden. In conclusion, there were many insurmountable obstacles that stopped dirigibles from docking on the Empire State Building.
226	15059	6	2	In “The Mooring Mast” by the builder of the Empire State Building, @ORGANIZATION1, numerous challenges were encountered during the building's construction regarding the docking of dirigibles. The primary obstacle was the wind. Due to the building's great height, the upper levels experienced strong air currents and winds, which made it difficult to land or drop off dirigibles. A dirigible, similar to a balloon or blimp, can be controlled by propellers. Another issue was the lack of appropriate equipment for docking dirigibles. As a result, the decision was made to prohibit dirigibles from docking there. Additionally, safety concerns were a major factor. With hundreds of civilians below, a malfunctioning balloon could pose a significant threat. These are the reasons why @ORGANIZATION1 faced problems with balloon docking in “The Mooring Mast”.
227	15060	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. Firstly, most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The building's owners recognized the potential disaster if an accident involving hydrogen - filled dirigibles occurred over a densely populated area like downtown New York. Realizing the flammability of hydrogen, the builders had to reevaluate the construction plans as a fire in a populated area would be extremely dangerous and increase the likelihood of civilian casualties. Secondly, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or approach the area, presenting a major hurdle and a significant safety risk. In conclusion, these obstacles made it infeasible to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
228	15061	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. One of the problems was the highly variable winds at the top of the building, caused by air currents. These winds made the end of the dirigible swivel around the building's peak. Another issue was related to the people walking on the streets of New York below. To stop a dirigible, heavy lead weights were required, but there was a risk that one of these weights could come loose and cause harm. Moreover, if a dirigible were to be stationed at the Empire State Building, it would violate the law against airships lingering too low over a city. In summary, these obstacles made it difficult to implement the plan of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
229	15062	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous hurdles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the structure. Safety was a major concern, as an idea is unlikely to succeed when human lives are at stake. Most foreign dirigibles use hydrogen, which is “highly flammable” and poses a threat not only to passengers but also to those at the docking station. Violent winds at the top of the building were another obstacle. These winds caused the rear of the dirigible to sway freely. Even the proposed solution of using lead weights to hold down the rear of the dirigible was dangerous, as the weights would dangle above pedestrians. Additionally, there was a pre - existing law that prohibited airships from flying “too low over urban areas,” making landing illegal even with a safe docking station. In conclusion, the plan of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was neither safe nor practical.
230	15063	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Initially, people were optimistic, believing it would lead to the “transportation of the future.” However, a large dirigible moored to the roof would exert stress on the building's frame. The load of the dirigible and wind pressure would need to be transferred to the foundation, and the builders would have to spend @MONEY1 to address this issue. Safety was also a significant concern. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. Even if the dirigible was tethered, strong winds would make the back of the ship spin around the mooring mast. Weighing down the back with lead was unsafe as the lead would hang above pedestrians. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Nature added to the problems, with winds potentially blowing the dirigible onto the spires of other buildings. As these numerous issues became evident after the building's completion, the idea of dirigibles as the “future of transportation” was abandoned.
231	15064	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders encountered numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock. Irving Clavan stated, “the as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone,” indicating that the height presented many unresolved issues, making the task more difficult. Additionally, most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Given that a mishap could result in a crash over one of America's most populated cities, this was a significant concern. These were the obstacles the builders had to face.
232	15065	6	2	When building the Empire State Building, the builders aimed to allow dirigibles to dock but faced multiple obstacles. They realized hydrogen was extremely flammable; for instance, a German dirigible caught fire, and they considered how much worse it would be over a densely - populated area. The use of the mooring mast was also problematic. The harsh winds at the building's top made landing difficult, and there was a law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas. As a result, the builders decided not to use the mooring mast for dirigibles.
233	15066	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building confronted many hurdles in their attempt to permit dirigibles to dock. One issue was that mooring a thousand - foot dirigible at the building's top with a single cable tether would stress the building's frame. Another was that most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. However, the most significant obstacle was nature. Violent air currents caused the winds on the building's top to constantly shift. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around it. These were the challenges they faced when trying to dock dirigibles on the building.
234	15067	6	2	During the planning of the dirigibles dock, numerous problems emerged. The natural structure of the Empire State Building could not bear the weight, so architects constructed a stainless - steel tower. After its construction, they discovered the high flammability of helium and hydrogen. Moreover, the airwaves at the building's top were extremely turbulent. Due to the potential for accidents, the idea of the dirigibles dock was ultimately abandoned.
235	15068	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in constructing a mooring mast for dirigibles to dock. The building's framework was inadequate as adding a mooring mast would impose significant stress, and over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were required, presenting a cost issue. Building a mooring mast over densely populated New York City was extremely unsafe since foreign dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. After the Hindenburg disaster of 1937, any fire above New York City would have catastrophic consequences. The constantly shifting winds due to violent air currents were the most severe obstacle. Mooring a thousand - foot dirigible at the top was dangerous as the winds would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mast. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would prevent the use of the mast even if it was successfully built. These obstacles ultimately led to the failure of the mooring mast project.
236	15069	6	2	When architects and engineers planned to construct a mooring dock for blimps on the Empire State Building, they failed to anticipate all the potential problems. One significant issue was a major safety concern. At that time, most blimps used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If a blimp were to catch fire while docked on the Empire State Building, it would result in a disaster. Another obstacle was nature. The wind was unpredictable, causing dirigibles to swing wildly. If the wind became too strong, it could exert excessive stress on the building, potentially leading to its collapse. The final reason was a legal regulation. The law stipulated that it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. Given these factors, the mooring dock on the building would never have been a viable solution.
237	15070	6	2	In the attempt to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous obstacles. The majority of dirigibles in use at that time were from countries other than @LOCATION1 and utilized hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and if a fire were to break out, the dirigible would crash in a densely - populated area. Additionally, at the height of the building, the wind was strong and turbulent. When a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the wind would catch the rear end, causing it to swing around the mast. The last hurdle was a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, making it impossible for a dirigible to approach the building. Due to these obstacles, the plan for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was unfeasible.
238	15071	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles was a safety issue. Most blimps outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another challenge came from nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly changing because of dangerous air currents. These winds would cause the rear of the blimp to rotate around the mooring mast. The third obstacle was a law that prohibited aircraft from flying too low over areas filled with pedestrians. This law made it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the building.
239	15072	6	2	"When the builders of the Empire State Building aimed to allow dirigibles to dock, they faced multiple obstacles related to nature, safety, and the law. Their initial concern was the building's structure. When a dirigible was moored, it ""would add stress to the building."" To handle this additional weight, the building required modification and strengthening. After a German dirigible was destroyed in a fire, safety became a major worry. The gas used to keep dirigibles airborne is highly flammable, and considering the dense population in downtown New York, this posed a significant danger. The most challenging obstacle was the strong winds on the building's top, which ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With the dirigible tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin in the wind. Lead weights, used in open landing fields, were neither safe nor practical when hanging above pedestrians on the streets. Moreover, there was a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, preventing dirigibles from approaching the building. The combination of these obstacles made it unachievable for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
240	15073	6	2	The construction of the Empire State Building with the intention of allowing dirigibles to dock presented the builders with a series of formidable obstacles. Firstly, the structural integrity of the building was a pressing concern. A moored dirigible would impose additional stress on the building, necessitating modifications and strengthening of its framework. This was a costly and complex undertaking. Safety was another major issue. The destruction of a German dirigible in a fire served as a stark reminder. Most dirigibles used highly flammable gas to stay aloft, and with the high - density population of downtown New York, a fire on the building could have catastrophic consequences. The natural element of wind was also a significant hurdle. The winds at the building's height were erratic, constantly shifting due to violent air currents. When a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be buffeted by the wind, swinging wildly. Using lead weights, a common solution in open landing areas, was not practical or safe above the streets filled with pedestrians. Finally, a legal constraint made it impossible for dirigibles to approach the building. The law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. In summary, these combined obstacles effectively precluded dirigibles from ever docking at the Empire State Building.
241	15074	6	2	In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. The most significant problem with using the building as a mooring site was safety. Paragraph @NUM1 mentions that the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey. This incident raised concerns about a similar occurrence at the Empire State Building. Given the high population density of New York City, a fire on a dirigible attached to the building would likely result in a high death toll. Another obstacle was preventing the dirigibles from swiveling around the mooring mast. Paragraph @NUM2 points out that using lead weights at the back of the ship would be extremely dangerous due to the large number of pedestrians on the street below. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas (paragraph @NUM3), making it illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the building, let alone approach it closely. All these reasons are compounded by the fact that the strong winds at the top of the building made it impossible to carry out any operations safely without the risk of injury.
242	15075	6	2	The obstacles the builders faced were reasonable, but there are certain factors that should be considered first, such as people's safety, aircraft height limits, and wind. They also thought about how to dock the dirigibles and how to safely transport passengers to the landing area. What they did develop was intelligent; they had an electric winch to connect the dirigibles to the dock, as well as a baggage and ticket area. Their ideas were smart, but these other factors should have been prioritized. In conclusion, while their efforts showed some ingenuity, the initial consideration of key safety and regulatory factors was lacking.
243	15076	6	2	To make New York City the most modern travel destination, Al Smith attempted to install a dirigible dock on top of the Empire State Building. The builders faced numerous challenges during this process. They managed to construct the mooring mast, but had to strengthen the steel frame of the building because the stress of passengers boarding the dirigible could damage the original framework. After its completion, there were @NUM1 attempts to board passengers onto the blimps, both of which ended in failure. The builders were unable to overcome the obstacles presented by severe winds and existing laws. Strong winds could blow the blimp into another building, and if a hydrogen - filled dirigible was used, its high flammability could lead to a fatal accident. Moreover, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying close to urban areas. In the end, the architects of the mooring mast were unable to surmount these challenges, and the plan to use the building for dirigible docking did not succeed.
244	15077	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The major hurdle to the expanded use of dirigibles in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity in the Empire State Building. A group of engineers and government officials in Washington were seeking a safe way to moor airships to the mast. However, the greatest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These elements, among others, made it extremely difficult for the Empire State Building to serve as a docking site for dirigibles. Overall, the combination of environmental and logistical challenges proved insurmountable for the initial plans of dirigible docking at the building.
245	15078	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles. They were concerned about the high flammability of hydrogen and helium, especially in light of the disaster at The Lakehurst Fire in New Jersey. They also worried about the back weight of the ship. Additionally, they feared that the wind could blow the dirigible into the spires of the building, which would puncture the blimp shell. These concerns collectively made it very challenging for the builders to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the combination of safety - related and environmental factors presented significant barriers to the successful implementation of dirigible docking at the building.
246	15079	6	2	When constructing the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous obstacles while attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. They prioritized practicality over theory to choose the safest docking approach. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the builders recognized the high risk of allowing dirigibles in a densely populated area like New York. Additionally, nature presented the greatest challenge for safe docking. Violent air currents caused the winds atop the Empire State Building to shift constantly, making the dirigible sway around the mooring, which was extremely dangerous. To safeguard the people of downtown New York City, the mooring project was halted in the late 1930s.
247	15080	6	2	The builders faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Firstly, most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. A fire caused by hydrogen could destroy both the Empire State Building and downtown New York. Secondly, it was against the law. There was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, which posed a danger to the citizens of downtown New York. Due to these significant obstacles, allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a complex and risky proposition.
248	15081	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many challenges in the concept of docking dirigibles at such a tall building. Most dirigibles outside the US were filled with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is an extremely flammable gas, and having dirigibles filled with it over a densely populated area like downtown New York was a major safety concern. The Hindenburg accident in New Jersey was a clear example of the potential disaster, and the builders did not want to take such a risk. Docking a lightweight airship was also extremely difficult. Strong winds would cause the back end of the airship to swing wildly after the tether cable was attached, making it hard for the aviator to control. Moreover, there was a law stating that aircrafts could not fly too low over buildings, especially after the Hindenburg incident. A blimp could potentially hit the spire of another building. In conclusion, the reality of docking these lightweight aircrafts presented significant safety and operational difficulties for the Empire State Building's builders.
249	15082	6	2	The initial plan for the Empire State Building was to make it the tallest building in the world, reaching @NUM1 feet. Construction was progressing smoothly until the competition emerged. The Chrysler Building threatened to take the title. When Al Smith announced the addition of a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, it altered the architects' original designs. The architects then designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower, illuminated from within, with a stepped - back design mirroring the overall shape of the building. The rocket - shaped mast would have four wings at its corners and rise to a conical roof housing the mooring arm. Two months after workers began implementing the new plan, they celebrated as they completed framing the entire building. However, as stated by L¸sted, the Empire State Building was doomed never to fulfill its purpose, mainly due to safety concerns that should have been obvious before construction began.
250	15083	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when considering allowing dirigibles to dock there. One issue was that the building's frame was not prepared for it. As mentioned, a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top with a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame, and over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications would have been required to address this. Another problem was that most countries outside the US used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, to make their dirigibles fly. The builders were aware that an accident similar to the Hindenburg disaster over a densely populated area like New York would be catastrophic. The most significant obstacle was the constantly shifting winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents. When the dirigible was tethered to the mast, its back end would spin in circles. Using lead weights to stabilize the zeppelin was not an option as it was not feasible to dangle heavy weights over New York City. From the start, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was clearly unfeasible.
251	15084	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles while attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, they had to modify and strengthen the building's steel frame. This was necessary because the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure needed to be transferred to the building's foundation. Secondly, they had to add more floors to the building, bringing the total to 102 floors. The 101st floor was a glass - enclosed observation area, and the 102nd floor had an open observation platform. These modifications were essential for the dirigible docking plan, but they presented significant challenges to the builders.
252	15085	6	2	The builders aiming to construct a dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. Dirigibles resembled huge balloons, composed of hydrogen and helium. As an expert noted, “Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.” If a dirigible caught fire near the Empire State Building, it could set the building ablaze, endangering employees and passengers. Moreover, tying down a dirigible to a building was illegal. The expert stated, “The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.” Disobeying this law would result in punishment, creating an additional hurdle for the builders. Finally, docking airships to a building was extremely unsafe. “The @CAPS2 Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted explained that there was a fear of the wind blowing dirigibles onto the sharp spires of nearby buildings, which could puncture the dirigible's shell. In the event of a disaster, many lives would be lost or severely injured. Convincing high - level government officials to allow airships to dock at the Empire State Building would be extremely difficult, as the risks far outweighed the benefits.
253	15086	6	2	Coming up with an idea for a building that can accommodate dirigible docking presents numerous obstacles. The building's structure must be able to withstand high winds. Additionally, the top of the building needs to be safe enough for dirigibles to dock without harming people or the building itself. These requirements make the building design and construction process much more challenging.
254	15087	6	2	In “The Mooring Mask” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area, as they had to create space for the large dirigibles to land. Another was the need to add stress to the building's frame, which meant strengthening the building's structure to prevent it from breaking. Finally, the constantly shifting winds on top of the building were a problem. To make the docking work, they needed to find a way to calm the wind near the tower. Overall, these obstacles made it difficult for the builders to achieve their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
255	15088	6	2	In the passage “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building when trying to allow dirigibles to dock are highlighted. The author points out that “The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.” At the height of the building, the climate and winds were constantly changing, causing the back of the dirigibles to swivel, which was a significant safety risk. Additionally, the builders had to consider that “most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable.” Since the Empire State Building is located in the highly populated state of New York, an explosion of a dirigible at the top of the building would be extremely dangerous and could result in a large number of casualties. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many challenges to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock.
256	15089	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building with the intention of allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock, workers encountered multiple problems. The first obstacle was the building's framework. The structure needed to be robust enough to withstand the harsh winds that constantly pushed the blimp in various directions while it docked. Without an appropriate framework, docking would be extremely perilous. The second issue was the hydrogen gas powering the dirigibles. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and there had been previous accidents involving hydrogen - filled blimps. Workers recognized that an explosion of a blimp in such a densely populated area would be catastrophic. The final challenge was the strong wind currents at that altitude. The winds were so powerful that blimps couldn't even get close enough to dock. Workers proposed weighting down the blimp with lead weights, but this was neither practical nor safe as the weights would dangle high above pedestrians on the street. Although allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building initially seemed like a good concept, as time passed, the obstacles became insurmountable, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the idea.
257	15090	6	2	From the excerpt, it's evident that the builders of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building faced two significant obstacles: the safety of people in the dirigibles and those below, and the forces of nature. Safety was of utmost importance because any unsafe option would not be implemented. Numerous hazards existed, such as a blimp hitting a spire and endangering people below. However, the greatest challenge was nature. If a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, it could get wrapped around the building. Moreover, reaching the mooring due to the wind was difficult. In conclusion, the mooring mast was an impractical idea. It was conceived as a competitive measure against another building without thoroughly considering safety aspects.
258	15091	6	2	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the structure. One major concern was the mooring mast. As per @ORGANIZATION2, the architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. Another issue was the dirigible's load. The stress from the dirigible's weight and wind pressure had to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation. Additionally, the building's frame was a crucial factor that the architects failed to adequately consider. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would need to be modified and strengthened to handle this new situation. In summary, the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was fraught with difficulties due to these various obstacles.
259	15092	6	2	According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several hurdles in their attempt to permit dirigibles to dock. One significant obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles could be up to one thousand feet long, equivalent to four blocks in New York City. Another problem was the weight of the mooring mast. Modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the Empire State Building to bear the mast's weight would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Safety was also a major concern. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. A fire in a densely populated area like downtown New York would have dire consequences. Furthermore, the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents, causing the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast when docked. In conclusion, these numerous obstacles made it very challenging to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
260	15093	6	2	In the 1920s, using dirigibles as a new mode of transportation was being considered. However, having a mooring dock on top of the Empire State Building presented many problems. One of the most critical was the flammability of the helium and hydrogen gases that lifted the dirigibles. A single spark could cause the entire dirigible to burst into flames in an instant. The Hindenburg, a German zeppelin, exploded in New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The potential for a similar disaster in a more densely populated area like downtown New York was terrifying. Wind was another significant issue. Strong air currents would make a docked dirigible swivel around the mooring mast. Also, using lead weights to weigh down the dirigible was unsafe when it was over pedestrians. In conclusion, the numerous safety and practical issues made the idea of using the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking station unfeasible.
261	15094	6	2	"According to the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Løsted, the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges. Firstly, a law prohibited airships from flying too low over city areas, and the mooring mast would directly violate this law when airships docked. Secondly, the dirigibles used for docking were like giant balloons and could burst if they hit a sharp object. The Empire State Building was surrounded by other tall buildings with long spires, increasing the risk of a dirigible popping upon impact. A potential explosion in New York City could have caused significant casualties, both on the airship and on the ground. During the construction period, the Hindenburg crashed in a field, killing all its passengers. Considering the potential consequences of a similar incident in the city, the builders finally abandoned their plan due to the multitude of problems."
262	15095	6	2	In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. The fabric used for dirigibles is extremely light, typically consisting of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. There are also implications suggesting that the architects did not exert sufficient effort to solve these problems. As a result, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was doomed to never serve its intended purpose.
263	15096	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when attempting to establish a docking facility for dirigibles. Firstly, constructing the dock would violate existing laws. Secondly, it would pose a danger to the people below. Additionally, it would place a significant amount of stress on the building's frame. Due to these insurmountable issues, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building had to be abandoned.
264	15097	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon Løsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when trying to permit dirigibles to dock. One major obstacle was the severe winds. The excerpt describes the intensity of the winds, and the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles was unable to approach the building for docking due to the strong winds. The captain was concerned that the wind might blow the dirigible into a sharp spire on a nearby building, puncturing its shell. Another obstacle was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or even approach it. The final obstacle was the fear of crashes. Since many foreign blimps used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, there was a significant risk. After the blimp fire in New Jersey, the builders realized the potential catastrophic consequences of a similar accident in a densely - populated area like downtown New York City. These obstacles, including the strong winds, the law, and the risk of crashes, ultimately made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
265	15098	6	2	During the construction of a building, workers often encounter difficult challenges, especially when it comes to the Empire State Building. Al Smith and other architectural builders faced multiple problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, there was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it impossible for dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building. Additionally, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. These two obstacles led to the failure of the mooring mast. In conclusion, the builders were unsuccessful in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
266	15099	6	2	"The construction team of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. One issue pertained to the dirigibles' material. They were essentially large steel - framed balloons with cotton - fabric envelopes filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. This material could be damaged if the dirigibles flew into sharp parts of the building, and the ""violent air currents"" exacerbated the problem. Since the dirigibles couldn't be properly weighted at the Empire State Building, having them ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street"" was a significant safety hazard. Another major obstacle was the presence of hydrogen in dirigibles. While U.S. dirigibles used a combination of hydrogen and helium, most non - U.S. dirigibles relied on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Due to these obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building did not succeed in practice."
267	15100	6	2	"Despite spending thousands of dollars and countless hours on the Mooring Mast, several obstacles precluded dirigibles from docking atop the Empire State Building for safety reasons. Firstly, dirigibles were unsafe to fly over populated areas. Some contained the highly flammable gas hydrogen, and the tragic incident of the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" bursting into flames in New Jersey was a stark reminder of the risks. As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, the owners of the Empire State Building recognized that the accident could have been far more disastrous if it had occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Additionally, the winds at the peak of the Empire State Building were extremely violent. Paragraph fourteen states that ""The winds on top the building were constantly shifting."" Considering these factors, it was evident that docking a dirigible on the Empire State Building was not a safe option."
268	15101	6	2	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their goal of enabling dirigibles to dock there. They couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof because the pressure exerted on the structure would cause damage, as noted in paragraph @NUM1. Safety was another major concern. Past events, such as the Hindenburg disaster caused by the use of highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, made the owners of the Empire State Building realize how much worse the accident could have been. Nature also posed a problem. For example, when the U.S. Navy dirigible, Los Angeles, approached the mooring mast, it couldn't get close enough to tie up due to strong winds. Moreover, there were legal issues; existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
269	15102	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building grappled with the problem of preventing the back end of the blimp from swaying in the wind. As described in paragraph @NUM1, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around the mast. Another issue was a law that restricted dirigibles from flying too low over populated areas. Paragraph @NUM2 provides evidence, stating that an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas was a practical reason why dirigibles couldn't moor at the Empire State Building. Additionally, it was difficult for pilots to dock their dirigibles at the mooring. The incident where the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up because of strong winds, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM2, is a clear example. These challenges made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
270	15103	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple hurdles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. The first was related to the framework. Strengthening it to support the mast and a blimp cost @MONEY1, but this obstacle was relatively surmountable. Safety was the second challenge. On May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire because of the highly flammable hydrogen used in dirigibles. The owners of the Empire State Building understood that such an accident could have had far - reaching consequences if it had happened above a densely populated area like New York. Nature presented the third obstacle. The violent air currents on top of the building made it almost impossible to dock a dirigible to the mast. Using lead weights to weigh down the back of the blimp was neither practical nor safe when hanging above pedestrians. The final hurdle was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal to attempt docking at the mast. In conclusion, these combined obstacles made the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building unworkable.
271	15104	6	2	When the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock on its mooring mast, it encountered numerous obstacles. One significant issue was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and it led to the destruction of a dirigible by fire. Additionally, the winds atop the building were constantly changing due to strong air - currents. This made it difficult to stop a dirigible from swiveling, posing a safety risk to pedestrians below. Moreover, it was illegal for any aircraft to fly at low altitudes over urban areas. Initially, the concept of the mooring mast was well - received, but ultimately, the numerous problems made it an impractical idea.
272	15105	6	2	In the 1930s, the world was evolving, and new technologies were emerging. One such technology was the dirigible, and some people considered expanding its use. One of the ideas was to install a mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Although it was a great idea, several factors made it unfeasible. Safety was a major concern, considering the mast was 1,250 feet high. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If a dirigible caught fire, everyone inside would either burn to death or crash to the ground, endangering people below. Another significant problem was the wind. Violent air - currents caused the winds on top of the building to shift constantly, making it impossible for dirigibles to dock. Also, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Despite the mooring mast being a fantastic concept, the many obstacles in its way made it unworkable.
273	15106	6	2	"The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted details the complex obstacles faced by the Empire State Building's builders when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was competition. The Empire State Building was planned to be the world's tallest building, taller than the new Chrysler Building. Al Smith realized he was close to losing the title of the world's tallest building, indicating a competition between the two structures. Another obstacle related to safety and dirigibles. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the Empire State Building's owners recognized that an accident above a densely populated area like downtown New York would have been far worse. They did not want to risk an accident that could cost lives and damage their reputation. These obstacles were a positive thing for the builders as they made them more cautious and opened their eyes to potential risks."
274	15107	6	2	Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building presented many obstacles. Firstly, nature was a major hurdle. The strong winds on top of the building would cause a tethered dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Secondly, there was an existing law. This law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach the area. Clearly, it was a waste of time to think that ships could moor at the Empire State Building due to these insurmountable obstacles. However, it is common for any project to face such challenges.
275	15108	6	2	"According to the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, three main obstacles prevented the Mooring Mast on the Empire State Building from being used as intended. The first was safety. Dirigibles using hydrogen are highly flammable, and a fire in New York City would be a tragedy. The second obstacle was nature. The mooring was designed to attach to dirigibles with an electric winch, enabling them to move freely. But when the winds blew, the dirigibles would ""swivel around & around the mast"", creating tension on the building's frame and an unsafe environment. The last reason was a law. For safety reasons, it was illegal for a ship to fly too close to urban areas, rendering the entire Mooring Mast unusable."
276	15109	6	2	When attempting to build a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building, the builders encountered several obstacles. Firstly, Al Smith aimed to make the building taller than the Chrysler Building, which led to the idea of adding a mooring mast. However, during the mast - design phase, architects realized that simply placing the mast on top of the building was not feasible. They had to modify the building's foundation. After altering the building's structural skeleton, construction continued as planned. Two months later, the mast was completed. Unfortunately, the architects overlooked that most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. As a result, the mooring mast was never used, and all the work done was in vain.
277	15110	6	2	Trying something innovative always comes with challenges. These include getting approval, gaining support, and ensuring structural integrity. In the 1920s, dirigibles were seen as the future of travel. Al Smith and the architects wanted to dock a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building. Apart from convincing people to support the plan, they faced other significant problems. At that altitude, the wind is extremely strong. Dirigibles were not supposed to fly close to the city as it was dangerous, and some were highly flammable. In conclusion, there were too many insurmountable obstacles to overcome for the dirigible - docking plan.
278	15111	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Since dirigibles ran on hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, a fire on a dirigible would put the pedestrians below in grave danger. Nature also posed a major challenge. With the dirigible docked at a great height and having little backward control, the fierce and constantly - shifting winds due to violent air currents were a huge problem. Additionally, docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building would violate an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Clearly, the builders had to deal with far more than just architectural issues when it came to dirigible docking.
279	15112	6	2	The builders trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building had multiple obstacles. They needed to construct a taller building, which was a significant challenge. Moreover, the construction process faced difficulties, causing the workers to postpone the completion dates. Another major hurdle was the mooring mast. As it turned out, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never going to fulfill its intended purpose. The workers had not anticipated facing so many problems; they simply wanted to complete the job.
280	15113	6	2	One of the main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was ensuring the building's stability and preventing it from collapsing. This was a crucial consideration throughout the construction process. By taking appropriate measures to address this issue, they aimed to create a safe and long - lasting structure. In the end, ensuring the building's non - collapse was a fundamental part of the overall construction challenge.
281	15114	6	2	When constructing the mast on the building's top, the builders encountered several problems. They couldn't simply place the mast on the flat roof because if blimps were to hang there, the wind would exert stress on the frame. To install the mast, the building's steel frame had to be modified and strengthened. Additionally, the cost of these modifications was another issue for the builders.
282	15115	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles while trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. The primary hurdle was that they couldn't install the mooring mast on the building due to its flat roof. The mooring mast would exert pressure on the building's frame. To overcome this, the architects had to modify and strengthen the frame, which cost over sixty thousand dollars. However, the greatest obstacle was nature. The violent air - currents caused the winds on the building's top to constantly change direction. In open fields, dirigibles could be weighted down at the back with lead weights, but this was neither practical nor safe with pedestrians around. Without proper weighting, the dirigibles would swivel. These challenges ultimately limited the viability of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building.
283	15116	6	2	"During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced multiple challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One significant obstacle was the need for modifications. As stated, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation."" To address this, contractors had to reinforce the frame and the foundation. Another obstacle was that, as the excerpt mentions, ""most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, which is flammable."" Given that hydrogen is flammable, it would be extremely dangerous if a dirigible were to explode over the streets of New York. These were the main obstacles that contractors had to deal with during the construction of the Empire State Building."
284	15117	6	2	"In the excerpt, it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. The root cause was that ""architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" For instance, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This stress would cause the building's frame to bend and weaken. This is just one of the many obstacles the builders had to confront during the construction process. The presence of such challenges made the construction of the Empire State Building a complex and demanding project."
285	15118	6	2	The construction of the Empire State Building presented the builders with many obstacles. One such obstacle stemmed from Al Smith's competition with the Chrysler Building, which was forty - six feet taller. This led Smith to make the Empire State Building reach a height of 1,250 feet. Subsequently, he wanted to add a mooring mast at the top for docking new airships. However, this plan failed due to the lack of landing space. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable tether would stress the building's frame. In summary, these were the key obstacles faced during the construction of the Empire State Building, which influenced its design and functionality.
286	15119	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building, architects encountered numerous challenges when the plan was to utilize the building for talking, loading, and refueling dirigibles. One of the most significant concerns was how to dock a dirigible to the side of the building. However, an even greater worry was the amount of stress this would impose on the structure. The most formidable obstacle to this project was the wind, a force of nature. There was a fear that the wind could blow the dirigible into a neighboring building, and tethering the dirigible was not a viable option due to safety reasons. Due to the architects' inability to overcome these challenges, the Empire State Building was never used for its original intended purpose.
287	15120	6	2	The initial hurdle to the expanded use of dirigibles in New York City was the lack of suitable landing areas. Some dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, equivalent to the length of four blocks in New York City. Another issue was that dirigibles contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable. There was an understanding that an accident involving a dirigible in New York, a densely - populated area, could have been far worse. Additionally, the winds on top of the buildings were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. As a result, those involved had to re - evaluate their plans.
288	15121	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant challenges in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock there. The most substantial obstacle was nature itself. Strong winds made it impossible for dirigibles to get close enough to the building to land, which was a major problem for the mooring masts. Secondly, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Given the high population density in downtown New York, it was too dangerous for dirigibles and other aircraft to fly at low altitudes. Lastly, many out - of - state dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. After the fire accident involving the German Hindenburg, it became clear that risking a similar accident above thousands of pedestrians in New York was a bad idea. These obstacles, which were recognized too late, before the construction, are the reason why dirigibles are not allowed to land on the Empire State Building to this day.
289	15122	6	2	"Creating a docking platform on top of what was to be announced as ""The tallest building"" presented numerous challenges that needed to be overcome. To bring this idea to fruition, the first step was consulting with experts. They visited the @ORGANIZATION1 in New Jersey to tour the equipment and mooring operations. When construction began, the stress the building would endure from the mass of the dirigibles became an issue. To address this, they modified the building's frame. They also designed a stainless - steel tower with a stepped - back design that mimicked the overall shape of the building. Over sixty thousand dollars was spent on modifications to achieve the goal of ""The Mooring Mast""."
290	15123	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Many dirigibles outside of @LOCATION4 used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the building's owners realized that such an accident would have been far more disastrous if it had occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York City. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which could have swept the dirigibles away. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles prevented the successful implementation of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
291	15124	6	2	The excerpt “The Mooring Mast” reveals that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous hurdles when trying to enable dirigible docking. The primary issue was the absence of a proper landing area, as dirigibles require a large expanse to land. Al Smith proposed adding a mooring mast on top of the building, which would allow dirigibles to land for a few hours, during which they could receive “refueling or service, and let passengers on and off.” Passengers could safely embark and disembark by using a gangplank to reach the open platform. However, architects struggled to install the mooring mast on the building's flat roof, fearing the transmission of the dirigible's load and wind pressure. Safety was also a concern, as most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Moreover, nature posed the greatest challenge, with strong winds caused by violent air - currents making it unsafe for dirigibles. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low, which was a practical reason for not allowing dirigibles to moor. Eventually, the idea of using dirigibles was abandoned in favor of airplanes, and the obstacles faced by the builders in enabling dirigible docking were resolved.
292	15125	6	2	According to the excerpt, the workers encountered significant obstacles when attempting to permit dirigible docking. In paragraph @NUM1, the architects stated that “they could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building.” This was because the roof was held together by only one cable tether, and landing a heavy dirigible would stress the building's frame. To accommodate dirigibles, they would need to strengthen and modify the building's framework, which would cost at least over @MONEY1. Instead, the architects designed a glass, chrome, and stainless - steel tower that was @CAPS1 from inside. As described in paragraph @NUM2, this tower would “rise a conical roof that would house the mooring arm,” and elevators inside would assist passengers in boarding the dirigibles.
293	15126	6	2	In the text, it is mentioned that the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was doomed to never serve its intended purpose, and the reasons should have been evident before construction. These reasons include the use of flammable gases, the influence of nature, and an existing law. As stated, most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Given the high flammability of hydrogen, it was not suitable to have it above a densely populated area. The winds on top of the building were constantly changing, making the dirigible unstable. There was also an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal to tie up to the building or approach the area. As a result, there was never a possibility for a dirigible to dock there.
294	15127	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building confronted multiple challenges when trying to enable dirigible docking. Safety was a major concern. Many non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, which could pose a risk of a large - scale fire and endanger the city. Nature also presented problems; there were strong air currents above the building, endangering local pedestrians. Additionally, there was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to allow dirigibles in the vicinity of the building. Due to these numerous issues, the idea of using dirigibles gradually faded away.
295	15128	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles such as how to construct the mooring mast and how to attach it to the building's frame. These challenges needed to be addressed to make the mooring mast functional and safe. Although the text does not elaborate on how these problems were resolved, it is clear that these were important aspects in the overall construction and design process related to the mooring mast.
296	15129	6	2	The construction of the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges to its builders. One significant hurdle was the inability to dock dirigibles due to the absence of a mooring mast. The architects and engineers designed the building with a flat roof, precluding the installation of the mooring mast. To address this, they determined that the building's frame needed modification and reinforcement. Additionally, using a rope to support the mooring mast was unfeasible as dirigibles could not hold it up. These were among the obstacles the architects had to overcome during the construction process.
297	15130	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when attempting to enable dirigible docking. High - altitude winds were constantly changing, making it difficult to land dirigibles. Dirigibles were also highly flammable as they used hydrogen instead of helium. Violent air currents caused the winds on top of the building to shift continuously. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Despite these challenges, they made an attempt in December 1930. The dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but was unable to get close enough to tie up because of strong winds. In conclusion, it was clear from the start that this project was ill - conceived, and the building was not suitable for dirigible docking.
298	15131	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous unpredictable obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. Multiple variables contributed to these challenges, including climate, surrounding buildings, and the dirigibles themselves. As previously mentioned, the climate presented dangerous and uncontrollable winds, a consequence of the building's design. Urban areas around the building had sharp spires that, combined with the winds, made hull breaches much more likely. Moreover, dirigibles were constructed with a steel frame wrapped in cotton and filled with highly flammable hydrogen to achieve buoyancy. Given these factors, it was evident that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was fraught with difficulties.
299	15132	6	2	To enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, extensive changes were necessary, and both the builders and planners faced a series of obstacles. Initially, they had to “consult with experts,” which involved taking tours and conducting research to find a “safe way of mooring airships to this mast.” As stated in paragraph @NUM1, docking a dirigible would exert “stress” on the building's frame, necessitating its “modification and strengthening.” Another challenge was the tower design. Eventually, the builders settled on a rocket - shaped mast with four corner wings to house the mooring arm and the machinery for winching the dirigible. In the end, the builders had to make significant changes and incur high costs, yet the result was still an unsafe solution.
300	15133	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building's top, the builders faced substantial challenges. The architects could not simply place a mooring mast on the building's roof. A thousand - foot dirigible held by a single cable at the top of the building would place excessive stress on the building's frame. Maintaining the dirigible in place would also come at a cost. As the article quotes, “The stress of the dirigibles' load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened... sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications.” The technical and financial difficulties ultimately made it extremely difficult for the architects to construct a mooring mast on the building's roof.
301	15134	6	2	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building's builders encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock. The architects had to make many accommodations at the mooring mast. For instance, the steel - frame of the Empire State Building needed modification and strengthening, as stated in @CAPS1 @NUM1. Additionally, according to @CAPS1 @NUM2, nature presented the greatest obstacle; the winds on the building's top constantly shifted due to violent air currents. These factors, among others, led to the mooring mast never being put to use because of safety concerns and laws."
302	15135	6	2	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced multiple obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Safety was a significant concern. Paragraph @NUM1 reveals that most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. An accident on the mast above a densely populated area like downtown New York could have severe consequences. Nature also posed a problem. Paragraph @NUM2 indicates that the winds on the building's top shifted constantly due to violent air currents, creating a safety risk as dirigibles would dangle above pedestrians. Moreover, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These were the main obstacles the builders faced."
303	15136	6	2	"The Empire State Building's builders encountered obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was determining if the dirigibles were suitable for docking. Another was related to the mast. As the author states in @CAPS1 thirteen, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" @CAPS1 five mentions that dirigibles were large steel - framed balloons with cotton fabric envelopes filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter. @CAPS1 six notes that some were up to a thousand feet long, raising the question of how such a large blimp could land on the building. @CAPS1 nine points out that a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable would stress the building's frame, and the stress would be transmitted to the nearly eleven - hundred - foot - below foundation. As @CAPS1 @NUM1 says, the mast was neither practical nor safe. The architects overlooked the potential problems, and in the end, the mast was an attempt that ended in failure."
304	15137	6	2	"The architect of the new building faced three major issues when considering allowing dirigibles to moor at the top. The harsh wind at that height made docking extremely difficult. As described, ""Fearing that the wind would blow the Dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the levers."" Secondly, the back of the dirigible could not be tied down. The constantly shifting winds on the building's top, due to violent air currents, would cause the back of the tethered dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. This not only created safety hazards for passengers disembarking but also made take - off challenging and dangerous. Lastly, it was illegal to fly aircraft so low over the city, eliminating the possibility of dirigibles mooring on top. Overall, this idea was poorly thought out and rushed in an attempt to make the building the world's first with a dirigible mooring mast."
305	15138	6	2	The builders had several problems when trying to let dirigibles dock. As stated on page @NUM1, one issue was that most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Also, lead weights were used to lower the dirigibles, but this could pose risks to people, as also mentioned on page @NUM1. These problems made it difficult for the dirigibles to dock at the intended location.
306	15139	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the construction of the Empire State Building for dirigible docking presented numerous challenges. The architects and engineers had to contend with the fact that most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, which posed a significant safety risk. Additionally, the winds at the building's summit were in a constant state of flux due to strong air currents. Even when a dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, its rear would spin around the mast. Moreover, the wind could blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of nearby buildings, potentially puncturing its shell. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Even without this law, attempting to dock a dirigible at the building would endanger people below and the building itself. Overall, these obstacles made the endeavor of using the Empire State Building for dirigible docking extremely difficult.
307	15140	6	2	The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building faced significant challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One major concern was the safety of the people below. As stated in the relevant source, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Another crucial factor was the violent and shifting wind currents, which added to the complexity of the docking operation. In conclusion, these issues collectively made the task of facilitating dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a formidable one.
308	15141	6	2	The construction of the Empire State Building with the intention of allowing dirigibles to dock encountered several obstacles. The dirigibles' balloons were made of flammable material, which presented a significant fire hazard. Additionally, the wind was a major problem as it would blow the dirigible around. These factors combined made it very difficult to use the building for dirigible docking. In conclusion, the flammable materials and the unpredictable wind were substantial barriers to the successful implementation of the dirigible - docking plan.
309	15142	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mask” by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many hurdles in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock there. The architects and engineers were highly competitive, aiming for a very tall building, but they lacked a well - thought - out plan. They desired a building with an impressive top that was also useful, hence the idea of having dirigibles dock there. However, upon researching the history of accidents, they realized it was not a good idea. Given the large population in New York, any accident would be a major incident. The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents, causing the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast. For multiple reasons, they deemed it unsafe. In conclusion, these factors explain why the builders had to overcome so many obstacles in this endeavor.
310	15143	6	2	According to the @CAPS1, both the @CAPS2 and the architects encountered several obstacles when building an area for blimps to land, rendering this @CAPS3 unfeasible. One of the key reasons was the air laws that made it illegal for airships to fly too low in urban areas. Another issue was that the @CAPS6 winds could push the blimp's tail onto the sharp spires of neighboring buildings, which would burst the dirigible just like a balloon. In conclusion, these legal and environmental factors combined to make the construction of a blimp - landing area at the site a non - viable option.
311	15144	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", it was observed that the architects of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. After the building was erected, the architects decided to renovate it and construct a dock for dirigibles. To achieve this, they had to strengthen the building's frame, install winches and control machinery for dirigible mooring, and set up housed elevators and stairs to transport passengers to and from the base floor. Once the renovations were completed, the Empire State Building had 102 floors. However, the building owners later discovered that allowing dirigibles to dock was not feasible as it would violate the law regarding airships flying too low in urban areas. Thus, despite the completion of the building, it could not be used for dirigible docking."
312	15145	6	2	On December 11, 1929, Al Smith announced that the Empire State Building would reach a new height of 1,250 ft. His plan involved building a mooring mast at the top of the building to make it suitable for modern travel. During the process of enabling dirigibles to dock there, the builders faced three major obstacles. The first was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the area used highly flammable hydrogen. After the Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire, the owners of the Empire State Building became concerned that a more severe accident could occur in New York. The second and most significant obstacle was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting, causing the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mast. The proposed solution of using lead weights was neither practical nor safe. The final obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building. In conclusion, the safety issues, natural conditions, and legal restrictions were the main obstacles that prevented the successful docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
313	15146	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, there was insufficient space for dirigibles to land, as their length was equivalent to four blocks in New York City. Additionally, the builders had to consult experts, tour the equipment, and conduct numerous experiments and tests on dirigibles. Landing dirigibles at the building was also dangerous. The use of highly flammable hydrogen in dirigibles was environmentally harmful. Moreover, the lack of stability made it unsafe for people. Due to these factors, dirigibles cannot dock at the Empire State Building.
314	15147	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One such challenge was installing the mooring mast on top of the building. As stated, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible mounted at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects addressed this issue by modifying the building's framework. Another significant problem was the wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With only one wire connected to the front, the back of the dirigible, exposed to the winds, would cause it to spin around. This wind - related problem remained unsolved. In summary, while the builders managed to overcome some of the obstacles, others persisted, ultimately leading to the failure of the mooring mast project."
315	15148	6	2	Al Smith had a creative idea of establishing a dirigible station on top of the world's tallest building, aiming to utilize the building to its full potential. However, this idea faced several problems. One issue was the urban area below. Since many people lived in downtown New York City, it was against the law to have zeppelins flying above the populated area. Another crucial problem was the intense and harsh winds, which made it extremely difficult for dirigibles to dock on the building. These numerous obstacles hindered the fulfillment of Al Smith's dream to have the Empire State Building serve as a docking site for dirigibles on its top.
316	15149	6	2	"The challenges they encountered included safety hazards. For instance, in @CAPS1 @NUM1, when the Hindenburg was destroyed, it was stated that ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had occurred over New York."" Another hurdle they faced, as mentioned in @CAPS1 @NUM2, was ""Nature itself."" The winds would cause an airship to @CAPS3 erratically. The final issue was the law that prohibited airships from flying @CAPS3 that low above urban cities. In conclusion, these were the significant challenges they had to deal with regarding airship operations."
317	15150	6	2	"In the @DATE1, dirigibles were regarded as the future of transportation. With the aim of making New York the leader in modern travel, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building eagerly took on the task of constructing a mooring mast. However, they failed to anticipate the obstacles ahead. As the architects designed the mast, they soon discovered that the building's frame was not capable of bearing the weight on its flat roof. Making the necessary adjustments cost the builders more time and New York City more money. Additionally, the workers did not take wind currents into account. The excerpt mentions that ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" Clearly, the workers should have considered potential obstacles before embarking on such a large - scale project as a mooring mast. In conclusion, this oversight led to avoidable difficulties in the construction of the mooring mast."
318	15151	6	2	"Al Smith, a four - term governor of New York and a key figure in the Empire State Building's construction, had a vision. He wanted to build a two - hundred fifty - foot mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building. This would not only make it the world's tallest building but also enable the docking of passengers and the delivery of goods using dirigibles or blimps. Unfortunately, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges regarding the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast. The main concerns were the materials of dirigibles, natural elements, and airship laws. The first challenge was related to the materials of dirigibles. According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... highly flammable."" The builders recognized this as a major safety risk, especially over a densely populated city. The second challenge was nature. The article states that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... neither practical nor @NUM1."" Construction workers understood that having passengers move on and off the mast in harsh weather could be extremely dangerous. The final challenge was an overlooked airship law. The story says, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@ORGANIZATION2). The workers realized that it was illegal to tie up an airship to a building. In conclusion, these three factors - the materials of dirigibles, nature, and airship laws - were the main challenges the builders faced in allowing dirigibles to dock on the mast."
319	15152	6	2	"The project of constructing a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building faced several problems. The purpose of the mooring mast was to dock dirigibles at the top of the building and allow passengers to get on and off between the dirigible and the building. The major problem was the high - altitude wind speeds. At nearly @NUM1 feet in the air, the wind could whip around even a large, steel - made, docked dirigible. When New York governor Al Smith proposed the idea of building this mast, no one realized until later that it was a rather absurd task. Paragraph @NUM2 states, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" After it was determined to be impossible, people began to realize that they had been overly caught up in the idea of new - age modern travel and had not faced reality. In conclusion, the unrealistic nature of the project led to its failure to achieve its intended purpose."
320	15153	6	2	"The excerpt discusses the attempt to make the Empire State Building the tallest in New York. It held the title of the tallest building until architects constructed the Chrysler Building, which stood at 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the Empire State Building. Al Smith realized he would lose the title of having the tallest building. So, he came up with the idea of adding a top or a ""hat"" to the building, specifically a landing spot for blimps or dirigibles. Al Smith knew it wouldn't be easy, so he considered possible reasons for failure. He had to design a structure that could support the weight of the blimps. He also had to think about how passengers would board and disembark from the blimp. Moreover, he remembered that most blimps used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. For example, the German blimp Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst. In conclusion, while Al Smith's idea was innovative, the numerous challenges, especially the safety issue related to hydrogen, made it a difficult concept to implement."
321	15154	6	2	When constructing the Empire State Building to enable dirigibles to dock, the builders encountered multiple challenges. One was strengthening the building's frame. Given that the additional pressure from the dirigible's load and wind had to be transferred to the foundation, the existing building skeleton required modification. These modifications cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another challenge was constructing the mast. Architects used glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel to give the tower a unique appearance. The machinery had to be placed at the tower's base, and the builders had to ensure passengers, along with their luggage, could move to and from the aircraft. Although the mast is currently unused, the building's design has made it one of the world's most well - known structures.
322	15155	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to make it possible for dirigibles to dock there. Harsh winds were a significant problem. Due to the building's great height, the winds were fast and their direction constantly changed because of violent air currents, making it extremely difficult to dock dirigibles. Pedestrians and surrounding buildings also posed an issue. Most dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. In the event of a fire or crash, substantial damage would be inflicted on the city and its inhabitants. The building's structure was at risk as well, as the large dirigibles could potentially cause its failure. Additionally, there was a law that prohibited ships from tying to buildings or flying at low altitudes in urban areas. Despite a few attempts, the Empire State Building was never able to serve as a docking site for dirigibles.
323	15156	6	2	In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. As stated in @CAPS1 @NUM1, a dirigible held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame, and wind pressure would exacerbate the situation. Another problem, as mentioned in @CAPS1 @NUM2, was that most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. The owners of the Empire State Building recognized that an accident above a densely populated area like downtown New York could have severe consequences. These were the main problems the builders had to deal with.
324	15157	6	2	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building had plans to create a successful landing dock for dirigibles. They had everything well - planned, but the tests failed. One reason for the lack of success was that dirigibles couldn't get close enough to the building to attach. For a dirigible to be anchored, a rope needed to be tied to something, but the pointed top of the building made it difficult. If a dirigible got too close, the point could puncture the balloon, causing the gas that kept it afloat to escape and the balloon to fall. Another major reason was the wind. The wild winds made the back of the blimp sway, endangering passengers. Using weights to stabilize the blimp was also dangerous for pedestrians below. These were the major reasons why the plan to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building didn't work.
325	15158	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock. First, there was a shortage of a suitable landing area. In a crowded city like New York, it was difficult to find a place where large dirigibles could land. Second, they had to figure out a safe way to install the mooring mast on top of the building. Simply placing the mast on the roof would add stress to the building's frame, which was dangerous. Finally, and most critically, nature presented a problem. Violent air currents at the top of the building caused constantly shifting winds. These winds made dirigibles move and shake, and using lead weights to counteract the wind would put pedestrians on the street at risk. In conclusion, allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building presented the builders with a multitude of challenges.
326	15159	6	2	"According to the excerpt, the construction of a docking facility for dirigibles at the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges. Safety was a major concern. During that period, most dirigibles were powered by hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. In the event of a malfunction such as a fire, not only would the dirigible catch fire, but the Empire State Building could also be at risk. Mother nature was another significant obstacle. As stated in paragraph @NUM1 of the reading, the location of the Empire State Building experiences ""violent air currents"" with shifting winds, which would prevent the dirigible from remaining stable. Although solutions like hanging lead weights from the back of the dirigible were proposed, they led to additional problems. If a lead weight were to fall, it could land on the streets of @ORGANIZATION2, potentially harming pedestrians. A law also posed an obstacle. As per the reading, airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas. Consequently, all the plans for the ""Dirigible dock"" had to be abandoned due to this government regulation. In conclusion, the construction plans for the dirigible dock faced multiple problems, ultimately leading to their demise."
327	15160	6	2	The architects of the Empire State Building encountered difficulties when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. They could not simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building by a single cable tether would subject the building's frame to stress. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were required to the framework. The most significant obstacle regarding the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents, causing the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast. In conclusion, the challenges presented by the stress on the building's structure and the unpredictable winds made it extremely difficult to implement a dirigible - docking solution at the Empire State Building.
328	15161	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, the stress caused by ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether"" was a major issue. As a result, the steel frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened to support the dirigibles. Secondly, dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and after the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much more disastrous the accident could have been if it had occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Moreover, the winds at the top of the building, which changed due to violent air currents, were the greatest obstacle. Mooring a dirigible weighted down with lead weights above pedestrians could lead to a disaster. In conclusion, the builders came to the realization that too many obstacles stood in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, making it an unfeasible plan."
329	15162	6	2	"In the excerpt ""the Mooring Mast"", the author @ORGANIZATION2 details some of the challenges the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building. Dirigibles were large and heavy, requiring ample space to land. @ORGANIZATION2 noted that ""some were... the same length as four blocks in New York City."" To accommodate dirigibles on top of the building, a large landing platform would need to be constructed. Additionally, the architects determined that landing dirigibles on a flat roof was not feasible and decided to use a cable tether. As the author stated, ""the architects could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the... flat roof."" They recognized that the weight of the dirigible would deform the building's structure, and strong winds could cause damage all the way down to the building's foundation. In conclusion, the workers faced a multitude of obstacles in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, making it a very challenging endeavor."
330	15163	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles while trying to construct a dock for dirigibles. Safety was a prominent problem. American dirigibles used helium, but dirigibles from other countries were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. An ignition in a densely populated area like New York City could have deadly consequences. Nature also posed challenges for the mooring mast. The winds above the building were strong and constantly changing, potentially destroying the dirigibles. Furthermore, federal laws prohibited aircraft from docking too close to a building. These three factors combined made it impossible for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the combination of safety concerns, natural elements, and legal restrictions effectively precluded the possibility of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building.
331	15164	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building with the intention of allowing dirigibles to dock, numerous complications arose. Initially, simply installing a mooring mast on the building's flat roof was not feasible. A dirigible docking on the flat - roofed building would exert stress on it, and modifying the building framework to accommodate this would cost over @MONEY1. Additionally, most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Given hydrogen's high flammability, having these dirigibles dock at the building would pose a significant safety risk. Nature also presented a problem. At the top of the Empire State Building, violent air currents caused the winds to constantly shift. Even if the mooring mast was tethered, the back of the dirigible would spin around it. With people on the streets of @CAPS2, this was neither a viable nor a safe option. Moreover, there was an existing law against flying airships too low over urban areas. All these factors led to the failure of the dirigible - docking plan, but they also paved the way for the increased use of airplanes.
332	15165	6	2	The construction team of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles while trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, many countries outside the United States used hydrogen in dirigibles instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and if a dirigible filled with it caught fire above a city, the consequences would be disastrous. Secondly, at the height of the Empire State Building, strong winds would cause the back of the dirigible to sway. Lastly, there was a law stipulating that airships could not fly below a certain height over cities. The combination of these obstacles made the project of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building both impractical and impossible.
333	15166	6	2	In the @NUM1's and @NUM2's, New York City was a bustling hub that needed to adapt to modern travel methods. The blimp, or dirigible, was a new and fashionable form of travel. However, these @ORGANIZATION2 balloons had no docking places in the @ORGANIZATION2, and finding a solution was more difficult than anticipated. Al Smith, the architect of the Empire State Building, decided to use the top of the tower as a mooring mast for dirigibles. After making adaptations to the entire building, Smith faced several problems. The first issue emerged when a German dirigible exploded in New Jersey. This incident made Smith realize that allowing @CAPS1 blimps near the building was a bad idea, as most non - American dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen, which could lead to a catastrophe. Another problem was the shifting winds on top of the building due to air currents. These winds would cause the dirigibles to sway freely and dangerously, potentially crashing into towers and dangling above pedestrians. Additionally, there was a pre - existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made any dirigible activity at the Empire State Building illegal. Overall, these challenges made the plan of using the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking site unworkable.
334	15167	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when constructing a mooring mast for airships to dock at the top. The stress and pressure exerted by a thousand - foot dirigible docked at the top were too great for the building's original framework to support. As a result, they had to reinforce and strengthen the framework and base so that the pressure could be transmitted to the building's foundation. Another obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is much more flammable, as demonstrated by the destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg in a fire. The builders did not want a similar incident to occur over New York's population. The final obstacle was the violent and shifting air currents over the building. Even if the front of the dirigible, or the ""mast,"" was tied to the mooring mast, the back would swivel around it. Due to these numerous unseen obstacles, the mooring mast was an impractical docking point for dirigibles. In the 1930s, after airplanes became more prevalent and dirigibles declined, the ticketing and bagging rooms were converted into areas for tourists and sightseers."
335	15168	6	2	"When constructing the docking station for the Empire State Building, the builders faced many challenges. One of these challenges was the air currents at the top of the building. As stated in the article, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These air currents made it impossible for the dirigible to stay still and safely disembark passengers. Another obstacle was the law. A law prohibited airships from flying low in populated areas. As described in paragraph fifteen of the article, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."". Moreover, docking dirigibles in a populated area or near a building became extremely dangerous because of the risk of them bursting into flame, as seen in the case of the dirigible Hindenburg in 1937. The article also mentions that the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been. These challenges severely hampered the construction of the docks, ultimately making the dirigible - docking plan unfeasible."
336	15169	6	2	The construction of a dirigible mooring mast on the Empire State Building was beset with numerous challenges. The primary purpose of this mast was to enable dirigibles, or blimps, to dock. However, many of the issues stemmed from the nature of the dirigibles themselves. As noted in paragraph thirteen, line @NUM1, most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Location also posed a significant obstacle. It was deemed extremely unsafe as a fire on a blimp would result in it crashing in the heart of New York City, rather than a remote area. Additionally, the high - altitude winds changed frequently. Docking dirigibles in such an area was unwise as they would be buffeted around the building. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made the plan for a dirigible mooring mast on the Empire State Building unfeasible.
337	15170	6	2	Al Smith, a determined individual, conceived the idea of constructing the world's tallest building and remained steadfast in his pursuit. On December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State Building's target height would reach 1,250 feet and also envisioned incorporating transportation. The builders faced the challenge of a lack of landing area when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Smith proposed adding a mooring mast to the building's top, where dirigibles could anchor for a few hours for refueling, servicing, and passenger embarkation and disembarkation. One of the most significant hurdles was the weather. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down, but when hovering high above street - level pedestrians, this presented risks. Moreover, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. In conclusion, these factors combined to make the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building extremely difficult to achieve.
338	15171	6	2	"Throughout life, many individuals aspire to create or build remarkable objects, often having to overcome extraordinary challenges. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, @ORGANIZATION1 aimed to construct the world's tallest building, the Empire State Building, which was announced as such on December 11, 1929. The construction of this massive building was fraught with obstacles, particularly regarding allowing dirigibles to dock. As stated, ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" indicating the potential safety risks. Another obstacle was the law, as ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" made it potentially illegal to allow dirigibles to dock. In life, while we strive to overcome great challenges, some obstacles may prove insurmountable. In conclusion, the attempts to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were thwarted by these significant hurdles."
339	15172	6	2	"The text ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted details the challenges the Empire State Building's builders encountered when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. Safety was a major concern as most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Nature also presented a significant obstacle. The winds on the building's top were in constant flux due to violent air currents. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, its rear would spin around the mast. Dirigibles moored in open fields could be weighted down at the back, which was dangerous for pedestrians. Additionally, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. In conclusion, these obstacles collectively made it very difficult for the builders to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
340	15173	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building confronted a multitude of obstacles while trying to facilitate dirigible docking. Safety was a paramount issue. Since most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, instead of helium, it posed a significant risk. The natural environment also proved to be a major hindrance. The winds on the building's summit were constantly changing because of strong air currents. Even when a dirigible was attached to the mooring mast, the rear part of the vessel would rotate around the mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields with lead weights at the back could endanger pedestrians. Moreover, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or get close to it. In conclusion, these challenges made it extremely arduous for the builders to realize the plan of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
341	15174	6	2	The Empire State Building encountered significant challenges when attempting to serve as a docking site for dirigibles. Firstly, its location in a densely - populated urban area was a major drawback. At that time, most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is far more flammable than helium, and if it were to ignite, a catastrophic fire could occur, with consequences as devastating as the Hindenburg disaster on May 6, 1937, over Lakehurst, New Jersey. This incident forced architects and engineers to seek safer alternatives. In addition to the flammable gas issue, the top of the Empire State Building was constantly buffeted by strong, gusty winds. These winds could easily blow a docking dirigible off - course, leading to a deadly outcome. Moreover, if the dirigibles caught fire or were blown off - course during docking, pedestrians on the ground could be seriously injured. Due to these numerous and severe obstacles, the plan to use the Empire State Building for dirigible docking was ultimately unfeasible.
342	15175	6	2	"Dirigibles, also known as blimps, were once regarded as the future of transportation. To increase the height of the Empire State Building while also serving a practical purpose, its architects decided to construct a mooring mast on the building to accommodate ""aviation pioneers."" Although the mast was built and gave the building the desired height, it never fulfilled its intended function as a docking station for dirigibles. The obstacles faced by the builders included the building's height, wind speeds, and civilian safety. Standing at 1,250 feet, the building experienced violent shifts in air currents, causing the winds at the top to be constantly changing. Even when dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around the mast. Dirigibles used hydrogen for fuel and lead weights for ballast, but these posed safety hazards to civilians below. In the end, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigible docking created too many problems and was never realized."
343	15176	6	2	Allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building presented numerous obstacles. One issue was that a dirigible hanging by a single cable tether would place stress on the building's frame, potentially causing the foundation to crack. To address this, architects had to strengthen the foundation, incurring over sixty thousand dollars in modification costs. Another challenge was the need to create an additional floor for passengers. Elevators would bring passengers to the eighty - sixth floor, where their baggage and ticket areas would be located. The observation areas on this floor were also intended to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Before the framing for the mooring mast could begin, the roof had to be completed. Nature also posed a significant obstacle. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting, and dirigibles, which typically land in open fields, could not use lead weights at the Empire State Building as they would hang over pedestrians on the streets. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to tie up or approach the building. Due to these many obstacles, the idea of using dirigibles and the mooring mast at the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned.
344	15177	6	2	"The builders' attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a futile effort. They tried numerous approaches to realize this idea. Al Smith and John Tauranac had different theories on the best way to develop the Mooring Mast and how the entire structure would turn out. The architects designed a new glass and chrome - nickel stainless - steel tower that spanned from the bottom to the top of the Empire State Building. This structure was meant to support the mooring area where dirigibles would be docked. However, the fate of the mast was not promising. As the statement ""The Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building was Never destined to fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"" accurately indicates, the architects' work was not fully planned, and they overlooked factors necessary for the mast to be durable. In conclusion, the effort to use the Empire State Building for dirigible docking was ill - fated from the start."
345	15178	6	2	According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant hurdle was the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City. However, the most substantial obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds at the top of the building were in a constant state of change due to violent air currents. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around and around the mast, rendering the docking process extremely difficult, if not impossible. In light of these challenges, it became clear that the attempt to use the Empire State Building for dirigible docking was fraught with difficulties and unlikely to succeed.
346	15179	6	2	In the 1930s, the installation of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building would have elevated the significance of both the building and New York City in modern travel. Unfortunately, numerous challenging obstacles prevented the mast from being completed. Firstly, strengthening and reinforcing the building's frame to support the mast was a painstaking and costly process. Secondly, the risk of blimps exploding had to be addressed. Nature also posed an obstacle, as the constantly shifting, violent winds at the building's peak would cause the zeppelin to sway and swivel around the mast, making passenger unloading difficult and dangerous. In high winds, the zeppelin could even detach from its mooring and crash onto the city below, potentially causing hundreds of fatalities. Lastly, the builders overlooked the law that prohibited dirigibles from flying too close to urban areas, making it illegal for blimps to approach, let alone dock on, the Empire State Building. Although the concept of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a remarkable idea, it was doomed to fail from the start.
347	15180	6	2	"The work by @ORGANIZATION2, ""The Mooring Mast,"" details the efforts of builders and architects to install a mooring mast on the Empire State Building in New York. Initially, the purpose of the mooring mast was to enable dirigibles to dock and transfer passengers. The architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof of @ORGANIZATION1 because a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the building's top, held by a single cable tether, would stress the building's frame. The load of the dirigible and wind pressure needed to be transmitted to the building's foundation. One reason the plan didn't succeed was safety concerns. The hydrogen used in dirigibles is highly flammable, which could lead to a serious fire. On windy days, dirigibles could be pushed around by the wind. While lead weights could be used to stabilize them, this was not feasible due to the presence of people and other buildings. Additionally, dirigibles were restricted from flying too low over such areas. Although the plan didn't work out, prioritizing safety was the right decision."
348	15181	6	2	Builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the building, both during and after construction. When creating the mooring mast, architects had to determine how to place it on the building's top. The stress from the load and wind pressure would add stress to the building's frame, so they had to transmit the load and pressure to the foundation, which involved modifying and strengthening the building's steel frame. The builders also aimed to make the mast aesthetically pleasing, constructing a tower of shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel that rose to a conical roof and was illuminated from within. After the mooring mast was created, further difficulties emerged. Safety was a major concern as hydrogen - using blimps outside the U.S. were highly flammable, as demonstrated by the German dirigible Hindenburg, which caught fire. The winds at the building's peak, caused by violent air currents, also created danger as dirigibles would swivel around the mooring mast. Another obstacle was the law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even fly close to the area.
349	15182	6	2	"The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 reveals the many problems associated with docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building. Al Smith, the architect working on the Empire State Building, initially believed that installing the mooring mast would be problem - free. However, architects soon realized that the mooring mast would add stress to the building's framework and require @MONEY1 in modifications. After the incident of the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" in Lakehurst, architects recognized that having dirigibles filled with highly flammable hydrogen over densely populated New York City was a bad idea. Nature also presented an insurmountable challenge. The violent air currents at the 1,050 - foot altitude of @ORGANIZATION1 made it clear that the idea couldn't be realized. The dirigible would swivel around because it couldn't be weighed down as it could in open landing fields, and using weights over pedestrians' heads was neither practical nor safe. Moreover, there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building. Ultimately, the idea of dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building as a new form of modern transportation was abandoned."
350	15183	6	2	When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders faced several obstacles. One major issue was the limited landing space in New York City, which complicated the process. They were also compelled to invest more work into the building by strengthening and modifying its steel frame to adapt to the new situation. These renovations were costly, exceeding sixty thousand dollars, and were primarily aimed at reducing stress on the building's frame. Despite these challenges, the builders managed to complete the work and overcome these difficult obstacles.
351	15184	6	2	Al Smith conceived an ambitious plan to construct the Empire State Building in New York and envisioned it as a dirigible port and future transport hub. However, technical limitations proved insurmountable. Dirigibles faced challenges when docking in an urban area. Typically, they dropped lead weights to secure landings, but this was impractical with people on the streets below. Wind was also a major issue as it made blimps difficult to stabilize in the air. In a city setting, if a dirigible hit a building, it would puncture and fall onto New York City. Two dirigibles attempting to moor failed due to wind and surrounding buildings. Despite the allure of landing in the middle of @LOCATION1, safety problems could not be resolved, and the high population density made it too risky.
352	15185	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when planning to construct a mast for dirigibles. During the initial construction attempts, they discovered that the Empire State Building's structure could not support both the mast and the dirigibles. After careful consideration, they determined that there was no feasible way to achieve this. This was one of the significant challenges they faced in their project.
353	15186	6	2	"Prior to initiating any architectural project, it is essential to thoroughly consider potential consequences. In ""The Mooring Mast,"" the Empire State Building's builders faced numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles contain dangerous chemicals; most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. A fire could lead to the destruction of the building and even the city. However, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The building's great height exposes it to strong winds. If a blimp were tied to the mast, the back of the ship would constantly swivel, damaging the aircraft's fabric. Given New York's large population and crowded area, a mooring mast was not a viable option. These serious obstacles led the architects to abandon the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
354	15187	6	2	"As stated in the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles, mainly related to safety and availability. The concept of docking a dirigible at a building in a densely populated city like New York was extremely unsafe. The explosive nature of hydrogen and the uncontrollable winds created a hazardous situation. The winds would cause the dirigible to move around the mast continuously, endangering everyone. Availability was also a concern. In paragraph fifteen, @ORGANIZATION2 mentioned that the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles @CAPS1 could not dock due to the lack of a safe entry route. This unavailability made travel to the mooring mast nearly impossible. In conclusion, safety and availability were the key obstacles in establishing the mooring mast."
355	15188	6	2	There are numerous obstacles to the docking of dirigibles. As the text mentions, if an accident occurred over @CAPS1, the consequences would be far more severe because New York is a densely populated city. Another significant obstacle is the building's height. At such a height, various unforeseen events could occur. These factors, including population density and height - related risks, present substantial challenges to the docking of dirigibles.
356	15189	6	2	"In an attempt to make the Empire State Building the tallest building, @ORGANIZATION1 in the article ""The Mooring Mast"" set out to achieve this goal. To surpass the Chrysler Building in height, Smith proposed creating a ""mooring mast"" for dirigibles to land, envisioning them as the ""transportation of the future."" However, dirigibles never landed on the Empire State Building due to numerous obstacles. Many non - US dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Given that the Empire State Building is in densely - populated New York City, it would be extremely hazardous for a hydrogen - filled dirigible to land there. Additionally, the weather at the top of the building is a major issue. The winds are much stronger than at street level, and if a dirigible managed to land, the strong winds would blow it out of control. Finally, it is illegal for airships to fly too low to the ground and near people. Having a dirigible land on the mast would violate this law. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, Al Smith's idea could not become a reality."
357	15190	6	2	The construction of a dock for dirigibles at the Empire State Building presented multiple challenges. Simply placing a mooring mast on the flat roof was not a viable option. A thousand - foot dirigible held by a single cable would render the frame unstable. The weight of the dirigible and wind pressure would need to be transmitted to the foundation, located eleven hundred feet below. Strengthening the frame to withstand this stress would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Ultimately, the mooring mast was never built because of safety concerns, the unpredictable nature of the situation, and legal restrictions. The use of highly flammable dirigibles in a densely populated area was unsafe. The constantly shifting and violent winds made dirigible control difficult. Moreover, the law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, preventing ships from tying up to the building or approaching the area. In conclusion, the numerous obstacles made it impossible for engineers to build the mooring mast.
358	15191	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several significant obstacles when attempting to enable dirigible landings. The most challenging among them were the urban location, financial constraints, and the weather. The urban location posed a problem as there are laws against airships flying too low over densely populated areas. Also, unlike on the ground, weights cannot be used to stabilize the airship over a city as they would dangle over urban areas. Financially, the cost of modifying the structure to make the mooring mast a reality was escalating. The weather was the most perilous obstacle, as wind and various storms could control the airship, making docking at the Empire State Building difficult. In summary, the combination of the urban location, high costs, and adverse weather conditions made it almost impossible to construct the mooring mast.
359	15192	6	2	There were obvious reasons why dirigibles could not dock on the mast of the Empire State Building. During the construction of the mast, the workers did not initially realize the danger of having dirigibles land on the building's top. Later, they became aware of several concerns. Firstly, if a dirigible caught fire, similar to the incident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, a large number of people in the populous city would be at risk. Secondly, the high swirling winds made it too dangerous for dirigibles to land. If they attempted to land but were thwarted by the violent winds, it would be extremely unsafe. In this way, the workers of the Empire State Building faced insurmountable obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there.
360	15193	6	2	"There are concerning aspects regarding dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building. One such issue is that ""the dirigibles would sway in the wind as passengers walked down a gangplank."" This is an unsafe situation because as the dirigible sways, it could knock passengers off the plank, causing them to fall. Due to this significant safety risk, dirigibles docking at this location is a matter of great concern."
361	15194	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered significant challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. The most substantial obstacle to the effective use of the mooring mast was nature. Violent air - currents caused the winds on the building's top to constantly shift. Even when a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the vessel would swivel around it. Additionally, the United States dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, further complicating the docking process. These difficulties ultimately hindered the successful implementation of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building.
362	15195	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced an issue where the expanded use of dirigibles in the area was hampered by the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith recognized an opportunity for the Empire State Building. By adding a mooring mast to the building's top, dirigibles could anchor there for a few hours for refueling, servicing, and to allow passengers to embark and disembark. Dirigibles were docked using an electric winch that pulled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to the mast. This solution aimed to address the landing - area problem but also came with its own set of challenges.
363	15196	6	2	Safety was the primary obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building's Mooring Mast. Most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The building's owners were aware that an accident involving a dirigible above downtown New York could have been extremely catastrophic, putting hundreds of lives at risk. This made the idea of dirigible docking both impractical and unsafe. Another significant obstacle was nature. The violent air currents caused the winds on the building's top to constantly shift, making the back of the dirigible swivel around the mast. Using lead weights was considered, but it was neither practical nor safe as they would dangle above pedestrians. Due to these factors, dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was not a feasible option.
364	15197	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. One issue was that non - US dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, line four, hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant risk. The greatest obstacle, however, was nature. Dirigibles moored in open fields could be weighted down with lead weights at the back, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would dangle above pedestrians, was neither practical nor safe. These challenges made it difficult for the builders to achieve their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
365	15198	6	2	According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The lack of land area in New York, as mentioned in @CAPS1 6, was one such obstacle. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, it was noted that they couldn't simply land on the flat roof. Also, the cable at the top of the building added stress to the structure 1100 feet below, and some of the associated work cost over sixty thousand dollars. Safety was a major concern. Having lead weights dangling above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. Moreover, as stated in @CAPS1 @NUM2, the hydrogen in the dirigibles was highly flammable, posing a great risk. There was also an existing law against flying airships above urban areas, as mentioned in ∂ @NUM3. All these factors combined made it extremely difficult to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
366	15199	6	2	"The Empire State Building is an impressive structure, even without the concept of allowing dirigibles to dock. However, the addition of a mooring mast introduced numerous challenges, particularly regarding public safety. L¸sted notes that ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This indicates that if a dirigible were to catch fire, similar to the incident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the lives of New York citizens would be in jeopardy. This safety risk is one of the issues faced by the builders. The architects also encountered difficulties related to nature. L¸sted states that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This is extremely perilous as dirigibles can move around the building while docked, leading to hazardous maneuvers and endangering pedestrians. In conclusion, the mooring mast idea is too dangerous for the public and the city of New York."
367	15200	6	2	During the construction of the dirigible dock, builders encountered several obstacles. Firstly, there was a lack of a suitable landing area. Without an appropriate space to land, there was no purpose or means to build the dock. Moreover, the builders would have had to renovate the entire building. After the building was framed up to the 85th floor, they couldn't construct the mast until the roof was completed, which further prolonged the process. The most significant obstacle was nature itself. The winds on the building's top were constantly changing due to strong air - currents, making it impossible for a dirigible to land or stay in place without the risk of crashing. Additionally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to tie up or even approach the building. In summary, there were multiple obstacles, and the mast ultimately proved to be of little use. While it was a good idea in theory, in my view, it was a waste of time and money.
368	15201	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. One challenge was the high wind conditions, which made it difficult for dirigibles to connect to the docking gear. Another issue was the high flammability of dirigibles. Since many used hydrogen, they posed a significant danger to the city if they caught fire. Additionally, there was a legal restriction; it was illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. In conclusion, these obstacles collectively made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to establish a successful docking system for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
369	15202	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock. Safety was a major concern as dirigibles outside the U.S. often used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. Nature presented the greatest hurdle to the effective use of the mooring mast. Violent air currents caused the winds on the building's top to shift constantly, making it difficult for dirigibles to land or remain stationary. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to approach or tie up to the building. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles severely limited the feasibility of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
370	15203	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to create a docking facility for dirigibles. One major concern was the fire risk. As @ORGANIZATION1 states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). Building a loading dock could inadvertently lead to a fire in densely - populated downtown New York, potentially harming the area. Nature also posed a significant obstacle. Builders reported that ""The wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). Even if they tried to tie down the dirigibles, there was a risk of movement. Alternatives like lead weights were considered, but they would be a hazard to pedestrians. Finally, there was a law preventing airships from flying too low. The article states that ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3), making the builders' task extremely difficult. The overall goal of having airships land on the building became an even greater challenge due to these obstacles. In the end, the idea of a dock had to be abandoned as the risks were too high. The excerpt effectively describes the arduous challenges faced by the builders."
371	15204	6	2	The attempt to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles. Firstly, it was not feasible to place fuel on top of the building. Installing a mooring mast on the roof would render the structure unstable and exert excessive pressure on it. To address this, the roof's structure had to be modified, which cost over @MONEY1. After successfully completing the construction, another challenge emerged. They struggled to find a way to prevent the dirigibles from moving due to strong wind - currents. Unable to solve this issue, the idea of using the Empire State Building for dirigible docking was ultimately abandoned.
372	15205	6	2	According to the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The project was fraught with potential problems in terms of design and cost. For instance, a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. Changing the building's material to accommodate this could cost “over sixty thousand dollars!”. Safety was also a major concern during the construction of the mooring mast. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and New York is a densely populated area. Additionally, there were restrictions on airships flying too close to cities, as there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Unfortunately, many builders were unaware of these potential problems, leading to the project's lack of success.
373	15206	6	2	One of the challenges they encountered was the strong winds. The violent air currents caused the winds to constantly shift, making the dirigible move around continuously. They couldn't weigh the dirigible down because there were people below, and objects could fall on them. Another obstacle was the existing laws. There were laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over the city, making it illegal for airships to enter the city. These two obstacles prevented the use of the dock for dirigibles.
374	15207	6	2	As stated in the article “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. These included strong wind currents, the high flammability of dirigibles, and the difficulty of keeping these large vessels still. Paragraph @NUM1 indicates that the use of hydrogen instead of helium should have halted the project. Paragraph @NUM2 points out that nature itself was the biggest obstacle. In conclusion, these factors were among the significant obstacles that the builders had to confront in their attempt to enable dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
375	15208	6	2	When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, builders faced numerous obstacles. One issue was the building's structural integrity. A large dirigible moored at the top by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. Nature also posed a major challenge. The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, which was dangerous. Moreover, there was a law in the United States against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the Empire State Building or approach the area. Despite facing many such obstacles, the workers persevered in their efforts.
376	15209	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Nature posed the most significant hurdle to the effective use of the mooring mast. The winds at the building's summit were in a constant state of flux due to powerful air currents, causing the dirigible's rear to pivot around the mooring mast. Additionally, most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. The explosion of the Hindenburg served as a stark reminder; if a blimp were to explode over downtown New York, countless lives would be lost, making the mooring mast a high - risk proposition. There was also an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, which legally prevented dirigibles from docking at the mooring mast. These combined obstacles meant that the mooring mast was ultimately used only for show, despite being part of the world's tallest building at the time.
377	15210	6	2	In the excerpt, the proponents of a certain theory faced multiple problems. It took a considerable amount of time for people to recognize the reality. For instance, there was a law restricting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Moreover, they realized that wind would have a negative impact. Wind would cause the airship to swing around when docked. They considered weighing down the rear of the ship, but soon understood that it was unsafe with many people below. They had heard about an airship in New Jersey that was destroyed by fire due to its hydrogen content, which also made it unsafe in New York with a large population. In the end, they began to understand the safety issues and the impracticality of the whole plan.
378	15211	6	2	"The concept of permitting dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was unrealistic as the plan failed to identify potential flaws. As a novel form of transportation, dirigibles were not safe, as demonstrated by the explosion of the German dirigible, the ""Hindenburg"", in 1937. Another major unaddressed obstacle during the planning stage was the location. In the crowded streets of New York City, suspending flammable dirigibles over a large population was a safety hazard. The location also presented an issue because of the equipment required for landing, namely lead weights. Using lead weights to stabilize dirigibles could create dangerous situations. The creators of this idea designed the docking system on the Empire State Building mainly to incorporate a futuristic mode of transportation and make the building stand out. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, as the concept far exceeded the capabilities of their era."
379	15212	6	2	Some of the challenges the Empire State Building builders faced when considering dirigible docking were related to the nature of dirigibles. Dirigibles use hydrogen to float, and hydrogen is a highly flammable gas. If ignited, it could cause extensive property damage. Additionally, at a height of 1,250 feet, there is a significant amount of wind. The dirigible would be blown around the building, subjecting the structure to unnatural stress. Given these factors, it would be extremely difficult to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
380	15213	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. In designing the mast, the steel frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened to adapt to this new situation. Modifications worth @MONEY1 were made to the building's framework. Instead of constructing a plain, utilitarian mast, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless - steel tower. It would be illuminated from within and had a stepped - back design that mimicked the overall shape of the building. However, the mooring mast was not successful. Most dirigibles from outside the @ORGANIZATION2 used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Weather conditions, particularly violent air currents, were the most significant barrier to the successful use of the mast.
381	15214	6	2	The construction of the Empire State Building presented challenges to its builders, especially regarding the design for dirigibles. The architects planned to place a thousand - foot dirigible at the building's top, held by a cable tether. However, the dirigible would face wind pressure about eleven hundred feet below. This required the building's frame to be strong, and over sixty thousand dollars was spent on modifying the framework. Despite these difficulties, the architects adapted the design, but the task of making the building suitable for dirigibles remained a tough obstacle.
382	15215	6	2	When constructing the dirigible dock at the Empire State Building, architects and builders encountered numerous obstacles. Before installing the mooring mast at the building's top, it was found that “the stress of the dirigible's load... would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation” (paragraph @NUM1). This necessitated changes to the framework to support the weight. Additionally, safety, weather, and legal issues arose. Dirigibles filled with flammable gas posed a fire risk, and in an urban area, the damage could be catastrophic. The winds at the building's top were dangerous as well; air currents were “violent,” and “even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around” (paragraph @NUM2). Usually, ships are weighted down, but this was not feasible in a city. Builders also faced the law “against airships flying too low over urban areas” (paragraph @NUM3). Despite the law, two dirigibles attempted to dock, both unsuccessfully. Clearly, the Empire State Building could not serve as a dirigible landing site.
383	15216	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock. Firstly, the original building frame could not support the weight of a dirigible on top, so the framework had to be reframed. Secondly, safety was a major concern as dirigibles contained flammable gas. An accident in a highly - populated urban area would lead to extremely severe damage. Thirdly, the wind was a significant problem. The constantly - shifting winds at the building's top, due to violent air currents, made the dirigible unstable and swivel around, rendering the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building impractical and unsafe.
384	15217	6	2	Dirigibles faced issues when attempting to dock. Firstly, flying an airship at a low altitude over an urban area is illegal. Despite this, they still attempted to dock and encountered further problems, such as strong winds. During one docking attempt, the strong winds prevented the dirigible from docking successfully. In conclusion, the combination of legal restrictions and adverse weather conditions made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock in this urban location.
385	15218	6	2	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building faced problems when looking for a way to allow dirigibles to dock. They knew they couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the @ORGANIZATION1 roof as the building couldn't support it. They also realized that attaching the dirigible to the mooring mast with a single cable tether would only add stress to the frame. To address this, the @ORGANIZATION1 steel frame needed to be modified and strengthened to support the mooring mast and the dirigible.
386	15219	6	2	According to the excerpt, dirigibles were never able to dock atop the Empire State Building due to safety concerns. The passage indicates that most dirigibles from outside the United States are filled with flammable hydrogen. This led to the German - made Hindenburg bursting into flames in New Jersey. Had such an accident occurred in densely populated New York City, the consequences would have been far more severe. Moreover, the winds on the building's top would blow the dirigible around. Lastly, there is a law that prohibits airships from flying in low - altitude urban areas, preventing them from operating in New York City. In conclusion, multiple safety - related and legal factors precluded dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building.
387	15220	6	2	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the author details the numerous obstacles builders encountered when trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. One obstacle was the challenge of dropping the mast onto the building's flat roof. Using a single cable to lower the mast would place excessive stress on the building's frame, complicating this task. Another issue was nature; the violent winds would make the dirigible swivel around the mast. Safety was the most significant obstacle. Many blimps outside of the @LOCATION2 use highly flammable helium instead of hydrogen, increasing the likelihood of an explosion and endangering the lives of New Yorkers. Additionally, existing laws in New York restricted the balloons from docking as airships were flying dangerously close over urban areas. As described in the article, these multifaceted obstacles made it extremely difficult to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
388	15221	6	2	The concept of dirigibles docking at such a high altitude was ill - conceived from the start. First, attempting to tether a thousand - foot dirigible to a building with a single cable places an enormous amount of stress on the building's frame. Although this problem could be fixed, the builders were unable to overcome the forces of nature. At that altitude, the wind speed is extremely high, causing the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast. In essence, this project was destined to fail due to these insurmountable challenges.
389	15222	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building confronted a variety of obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major hurdle was nature. The text mentions that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These winds made it difficult for the dirigible to approach the mooring mast for docking and, even after docking, caused it to move around the mast, preventing passengers from disembarking. Another obstacle was a pre - existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The text states, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Safety was perhaps the most significant obstacle. The excerpt reveals that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This posed risks to the passengers, crew, and the densely populated downtown New York area below. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
390	15223	6	2	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there are described. Building the Empire State Building was already a challenging feat, and on top of that, they had to construct a mooring mast at the top. Four - term New York governor Al Smith aptly stated, ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring out some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" Another problem was that mooring a thousand - foot dirigible at the building's top with a single cable tether was unsafe. As a result, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would need to be modified and strengthened, with modifications costing over sixty thousand dollars. Regardless of their construction methods, the builders also had to contend with nature. These examples illustrate the difficulties the builders faced in their efforts to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
391	15224	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, numerous obstacles arose when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. These included poor design, the challenges posed by nature, and a lack of landing area. The sub - optimal design by Al Smith led to concerns about where to land dirigibles during the Age of Dirigibles. Nature was a significant hurdle as well; the winds on top of the building were in a constant state of shift due to violent air currents, making it difficult for dirigibles to land. Additionally, there was insufficient landing area for these large balloons. Once Al Smith saw the opportunity to land dirigibles on the Empire State Building, he seized it. However, these multiple obstacles made the realization of this docking plan extremely challenging.
392	15225	6	2	Enabling dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building presented architects with challenging scenarios. Adding a thousand - foot dirigible on top of the building would place stress on the frame, and a single cable tethered to the blimp would not alleviate this stress. As L¸sted stated, “The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation.” Thus, the building's frame would need modification to accommodate this new situation. The primary reason the docking system was never fully constructed was safety. Most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. The destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire made the owners of the Empire State Building realize how much worse the accident could have been if it had occurred above a densely populated area. This also made traveling outside @LOCATION1 with dirigibles more difficult. Nature was a major obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. The back of the ship would swivel around the mast due to the shifting winds caused by violent air currents, which was neither practical nor safe. These obstacles left builders with unrealized challenges to overcome.
393	15226	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when attempting to dock dirigibles. One such obstacle was the building's framework. As evidence shows, “Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework,” indicating the extensive work required on the building's structure. Another hardship was that most dirigibles outside the United States were filled with highly flammable hydrogen rather than helium. The destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire in Lakehurst on May 6, 1937, made the owners of the Empire State Building aware of how much more catastrophic the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, highlighting the danger of hydrogen. Additionally, dirigibles could be weighed down by lead weights, and using them at the Empire State Building, where they would dangle over pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe as a dropped lead weight could kill someone. In conclusion, docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building presented numerous hardships.
394	15227	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple challenges when adding a mast to the building for dirigibles. They had to consult experts and learn about how dirigibles functioned. Engineers in New York and government workers in Washington collaborated to devise a plan. Simply adding the mast was not enough. Tethering the dirigible with one cable would place a great deal of stress on the framework, so the entire steel frame needed strengthening. Resources were also spent on making the mast visually appealing. However, all the plans ultimately failed. Nature was the biggest problem. Violent air currents around the mast would cause the blimp to swing dangerously. If a ship crashed, hundreds of people in urban New York could be crushed. As a result, the project was scrapped, and the mast became a purely decorative addition.
395	15228	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. As the author pointed out, the Empire State Building was “destined to never fulfill its purpose [as a dock for dirigibles], for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed.” There were several issues with this idea, including safety, strong winds, and laws. Safety was a major concern as dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen; the destruction of the Hindenburg by fire demonstrated the potential danger. If a dirigible caught fire near the Empire State Building, it would endanger the many people in the surrounding city. Strong winds were another problem. Due to the building's height, the winds at the mooring station were violent and unpredictable, making it difficult to land and causing the back end of the dirigible to be blown around if it did manage to attach. Finally, there was a law prohibiting aircraft from being within a certain distance of a city to prevent crashes into urban areas. Given these problems, it is clear that the plan to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building could never have worked effectively.
396	15229	6	2	The construction team tasked with enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building encountered multiple challenges. Firstly, attaching a mast to the building and having a large dirigible moor on it would exert stress on the structure. This stress could potentially rip the mast off, causing the dirigible to plummet and resulting in death and destruction to people and buildings below. Secondly, proper timing of the construction was crucial. They couldn't have the mast completed when the building was only at floor @NUM1 out of 102. In conclusion, these difficulties made the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building a highly challenging endeavor.
397	15230	6	2	Inventing new future transportation methods is no easy feat, as Al Smith discovered when he hired a team to install landing docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building. The team faced numerous setbacks. The weight of the dirigible would add stress to the building's steel - reinforced frame. Safety was also a major concern, as non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Nature presented another hurdle; wind made maneuvering difficult and violent currents could be fatal to passengers and pedestrians, and dirigibles couldn't fly close to the ground in populated urban areas. Despite the innovative idea of using the Empire State Building as an airdock, it was neither practical nor well - thought - out.
398	15231	6	2	When builders tried to make it possible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, they faced several obstacles. One was the lack of a suitable landing area. New York City has many buildings and limited flat ground for a dirigible to land. Secondly, they struggled to find a way to place the mooring mast on top of the building. They would need to strengthen the building's frame to ensure the mast could be safely placed without adding stress. Nature was also a significant problem. The wind at the top of the building was unpredictable and strong, causing the back of the dirigible to move even when tied to the building. Additionally, there was a law preventing dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. As a result, dirigibles were unable to dock at the Empire State Building.
399	15232	6	2	According to the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. This would likely damage the foundation. So, the builders had to find a way to avoid ruining it. Another issue was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened. If the mast were to be installed, the entire building would need reinforcement to prevent problems with the mast. In conclusion, these challenges made the task of enabling dirigible docking a complex one.
400	15233	6	2	As described in the excerpt “The Mooring Mast,” the construction of the Empire State Building presented many obstacles for the builders. Practical issues included the law against airships flying low, incomplete dirigible mooring equipment, and the influence of nature. The law against low - flying airships over urban areas meant dirigibles couldn't even attempt to reach the building. In December 1930, a dirigible approached the mast but couldn't get close due to fear of hitting the sharp spires from the forceful winds. The lack of installed mooring equipment meant newspapers had to be caught by dangling ropes, which was tiring. Nature was the greatest obstacle; strong winds at the top of the building, caused by violent wind currents, made the dirigible move even when tied to the mast. Overall, the weather - related nature was the most significant hurdle in the attempt to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building.
401	15234	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders encountered multiple challenges when aiming to enable dirigible docking. Situated in the densely - populated New York City, having a dirigible hovering above the people would pose significant safety risks. Additionally, nature presented a major hurdle. The building's top experiences violent winds that constantly shift due to air currents, causing dirigibles to swivel around the mast. Moreover, a law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to approach or dock at the building. In conclusion, these combined factors effectively prevented the realization of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
402	15235	6	2	During the construction of the mast for the Empire State Building, the builders encountered several obstacles. The high wind speeds and the large size of dirigibles would exert substantial pressure and stress on the building if a dirigible were to dock. To accommodate this pressure, the designers had to spend over sixty thousand dollars on modifications to the building's framework. Another significant obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which prohibited dirigibles from getting close to the building, let alone docking. Along with other safety concerns, such as the highly - flammable hydrogen inside the blimp, these obstacles led to the abandonment of the idea. In summary, these challenges made the concept of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
403	15236	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their attempt to dock dirigibles there. One of the difficulties was ensuring the building's structural integrity if a [@NUM1] - foot dirigible were to dock on top. They had to invest approximately [@NUM2] dollars in modifying the building's frame to support a [@CAPS2]. Another obstacle was how to dock a dirigible at the building's top without endangering the densely - populated downtown New York area. Since most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, this added to the risk. Ultimately, due to the [@CAPS3], it was impossible to achieve the goal of docking a [@CAPS2]. In conclusion, these various challenges made the plan of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building an unworkable idea.
404	15237	6	2	The builders of the [@CAPS1] had to overcome several obstacles. The extra pressure on the building's frame was a major concern when considering dirigible docking. The docking process itself was difficult, and the high - speed winds made it almost impossible to dock a dirigible. In the end, these combined obstacles proved insurmountable, preventing the successful docking of dirigibles at the [@CAPS1].
405	15238	6	2	When the builders of the Empire State Building aimed to allow dirigibles to dock, they faced numerous obstacles. First, people's safety was a prime concern. Most dirigibles outside the US used highly - flammable hydrogen. The 1937 Hindenburg disaster in Lakehurst, New Jersey, showed that if such an accident occurred over a densely - populated area like downtown New York, the consequences would be far worse. Second, violent air currents made landing difficult. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, its back would swivel around the mast. Third, it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas, meaning a dirigible couldn't legally tie up to the building or approach it. These three obstacles, among others, prevented the Empire State Building's builders from achieving dirigible docking. In conclusion, these challenges were too great to overcome, and the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was not realized.
406	15239	6	2	"According to an article by @PERSON1 titled ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. Their aspiration to position New York at the forefront of modern travel remained unfulfilled. Firstly, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were necessary for the building's framework due to the stress imposed by the dirigible's load and wind pressure, which would add additional stress to the frame. However, one of the most significant challenges the builders faced was safety. Most dirigibles utilized hydrogen, which is highly flammable and extremely dangerous, particularly in densely populated areas like New York. Moreover, the strong winds at the top of the building made it impossible to keep the dirigibles stable and prevent them from swirling around the mast. Although lead weights could be used to anchor dirigibles moored in open fields, this method was unsafe when used on a building. Finally, the idea violated a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. All these obstacles contributed to the failure of the builders' dream of using the mooring mast for dirigibles."
407	15240	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast, builders faced several challenges related to the structure. They had to figure out how to build the mast and ensure that it could physically hold a blimp without being torn off. One particular problem was determining how to reinforce the mast so that the load would transfer to the foundation rather than ripping off the top half of the building. In conclusion, these structural challenges were significant hurdles that the builders needed to overcome during the construction of the mooring mast.
408	15241	6	2	The concept of a docking mast for the Empire State Building failed for multiple reasons. Firstly, it was located directly above the densely - populated downtown area of New York City. After the Hindenburg fire in New Jersey, the owners recognized that the accident could have been far more disastrous if it had occurred over a densely populated area. Secondly, controlling a dirigible in the often - violent winds at the top of the tower was a major obstacle. At that time, it was common practice to control the back of the dirigible with lead weights, but this was neither practical nor safe over a civilian area. Another important factor was the existing law that prohibited low - flying aircraft over cities. Despite two dirigibles approaching the mooring mast, neither was able to allow passengers to disembark, and the idea was appropriately abandoned. The numerous obstacles made it impossible for the concept to succeed.
409	15242	6	2	Initially, I thought the idea of the builders of the Empire State Building creating a mast for dirigible docking was great. However, I later realized there were significant obstacles. As Løsted pointed out, most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and a fire in New York could harm or kill thousands of people. The wind was the most significant obstacle. The wind conditions changed constantly, and even if the dirigible was properly attached, its rear would keep moving, posing a danger to pedestrians below. Additionally, there was a legal issue. It was illegal to fly a dirigible too low over urban areas, preventing the dirigible from getting low enough to land on the building. Two attempts were made, and both were unsuccessful. The constructors were initially unaware of these problems but later recognized them. In conclusion, due to non - US dirigibles using hydrogen, the variable wind conditions, and the legal restrictions, the Empire State Building could not be used for dirigible landings.
410	15243	6	2	The architects of the mooring mast confronted several problems during its construction. One issue was that most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, to make the blimps buoyant instead of helium. If a blimp were to catch fire like the German dirigible Hindenburg in New Jersey, it would endanger many citizens. A densely populated area like New York would be at a much higher risk compared to a rural area in New Jersey. The final problem was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. Since foreign dirigibles could not dock and refuel due to the type of gas they used, and domestic dirigibles were restricted by the law, the idea of a mooring mast quickly faded from the public's imagination, and people turned to modern transportation options such as airplanes.
411	15244	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered significant challenges when considering the docking of dirigibles. Smith harbored a dream of achieving this, yet several insurmountable obstacles stood in the way. Firstly, installing a mooring mast on the Empire State Building would cost over @MONEY1 and place excessive stress on the building's frame. Additionally, there were @NUM1 major concerns. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, most dirigibles are highly flammable since they use hydrogen instead of helium, as exemplified by the tragic fate of the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. Docking dirigibles was also extremely dangerous because the wind would cause them to @CAPS1, unlike when they are docked on the ground and weighted down. Moreover, it was illegal; paragraph @NUM4 mentions an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and dirigibles docking on the building would not meet the legal height requirement, posing a high risk to pedestrians below. In conclusion, these multiple factors collectively made it impossible for Smith to pursue his dream of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
412	15245	6	2	"The construction team of the Empire State Building encountered difficulties when attempting to enable dirigible docking. As indicated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This was due to the wind, which shifted because of violent air - current activity. The wind's instability presented a significant challenge to the safe docking of dirigibles. In summary, the natural element of wind and its erratic behavior was a major hurdle that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in their attempt to facilitate dirigible docking."
413	15246	6	2	"According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building's builders encountered numerous challenges while trying to allow dirigibles to dock. A mooring mast was essential for docking, but simply installing it on the building was not feasible as it would add stress to the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would require substantial modifications to the frame, with costs exceeding sixty thousand dollars. Safety was a primary concern. After the Hindenburg's combustion, the building's owners recognized the potential for a disaster if a similar incident occurred in New York. Nature also posed an obstacle, as constantly changing violent air currents could move the dirigible, which couldn't be anchored as it could in a field. This was a risk not worth taking. Additionally, an earlier - passed law prohibited dirigibles from approaching buildings at such elevations over urban areas. In conclusion, these various challenges collectively prevented the successful implementation of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
414	15247	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple issues when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. As the passage states, ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof,"" meaning the architects had to modify and strengthen the building for a ""thousand - foot dirigible"" to land. Over @MONEY1 worth of changes were necessary. Safety was another critical problem. Many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Given hydrogen's high flammability, a fire on a dirigible in downtown New York could have led to a large - scale conflagration. Nature also presented difficulties, with ""winds on top of the building constantly shifting,"" causing the dirigible to swivel dangerously. In conclusion, the architects had to grapple with a complex set of problems that made dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a daunting task."
415	15248	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. If they installed a mooring mast on the building, they would need to strengthen the frame due to wind pressure and the pressure from the single cable. Most out - of - state dirigibles were highly flammable because they used hydrogen instead of helium. New York's high population density meant that the risk of objects falling from the building onto citizens below was unacceptable. Nature was the greatest obstacle; violent winds constantly shifted due to turbulent air currents. Even if the dirigibles could be tied down, their rear parts would still be at the mercy of the wind. Suggestions to use lead weights to hold them down were also risky, as falling weights would endanger pedestrians. Finally, there was a law restricting airships from flying too low over urban areas. In conclusion, these combined obstacles made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to achieve dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
416	15249	6	2	When the builders of the @ORGANIZATION2 undertook the challenging task of constructing a mooring mast at the top of the structure for dirigibles to dock, they encountered numerous obstacles that hindered the implementation of their plan. Firstly, they could not simply install a long mooring mast on the building's flat roof. A single - cable - tethered huge dirigible would impose an enormous amount of stress on the building's frame and foundation. To address this, the builders constructed a stronger frame for the building. The primary issue the builders faced when enabling dirigibles to dock at the top of the structure was safety. Most dirigibles, except those from @LOCATION1, used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, significantly increasing the risk of fire. Given that the blimps would be hovering above thousands of city pedestrians, the risk of a blimp catching fire was unacceptably high. Additionally, the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the blimp to rotate around the mooring mast. Despite Al Smith's grand vision of having blimps dock at the top of his building, the reality was that it was an unfeasible idea, as the builders were confronted with too many insurmountable obstacles.
417	15250	6	2	When builders tried to create a landing area for dirigibles on the Empire State Building, they encountered multiple problems. Al @CAPS1's idea seemed unrealistic, but with sufficient motivation, they were determined to make it a reality. After extensive renovation, hard work, and brainstorming, they finally recognized all the potential problems. As the construction progressed, these problems became evident. The main reason the dock was never used was the realization that a dirigible could catch fire, similar to the incident in New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State Building understood that if such an accident occurred above a densely populated area, the consequences would be far more severe. Moreover, they warned about the strong winds on top of the tower. They were concerned that the winds would continuously blow the dirigible around without a way to stabilize it. Another factor was that it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. In conclusion, the builders faced numerous challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
418	15251	6	2	The obstacles the builders faced were extremely perilous and unsafe, and they determined the success or failure of their project. One of the problems was the violent air currents. As described, the winds near the top of the building were constantly shifting, which could easily cause the dirigible to swivel. If this happened, landing would be impossible. Another obstacle was the issue of hovering over pedestrians. Ensuring the safety of pedestrians made this an unviable option. Additionally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or even approach the area. In summary, attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was simply too dangerous.
419	15252	6	2	"Many of the obstacles the Empire State Building's builders faced when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there were issues that should have been considered before construction began. At that height, there were whirlwind - related problems that could push the dirigible in unwanted directions. As @CAPS1 @NUM1 stated, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current."" After the Hindenburg explosion, there were significant safety concerns about a similar incident occurring. The owners of the Empire State Building were aware that if such an accident happened above a densely populated area like downtown New York, the consequences would be far more catastrophic, as mentioned in @CAPS1 @NUM2 Line 6. In conclusion, these pre - construction oversights and post - explosion safety concerns made it extremely difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking."
420	15253	6	2	Several factors prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building. Firstly, if a dirigible were moored at the top of the building with a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame, as the existing framework was not strong enough to withstand it. However, the main deterrent was safety. It was well - known that most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. An incident in a populated area like New York could have disastrous consequences. Additionally, the shifting winds caused the ship to swivel, and for safety reasons, lead could not be used to weigh it down. Finally, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for any dirigible to approach the building. All these factors combined contributed to the numerous obstacles associated with docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
421	15254	6	2	Outside the United States, most dirigibles utilized hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. On May 6, 1937, when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building recognized how much more catastrophic the accident could have been if it had occurred over a densely populated area like downtown New York. This realization made them acutely aware of the potential risks associated with dirigibles operating in populated regions.
422	15255	6	2	According to the story “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders encountered significant challenges when attempting to make it possible for dirigibles to land. A major issue was the high - altitude winds. As described, “The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.” The builders not only had to find a way to secure the dirigibles and prevent them from swaying but also needed to support the weight of the dirigibles given the already heavy building. These were just some of the formidable problems the builders had to address in their project.
423	15256	6	2	After reading the excerpt from “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2, it becomes evident that this project confronts numerous hurdles. The builders of the Empire State Building have a substantial workload to enable dirigibles to dock. For instance, they must modify and strengthen the @ORGANIZATION1 frame and construct a mast for the dirigibles to dock to. If a thousand - foot dirigible were moored at the top of the building with a single cable tether, it would impose an enormous amount of stress on the entire structure. This is the reason why over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Additionally, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower, illuminated from the inside, with a step - back design mimicking the building's overall shape. The idea of adding a mast for dirigibles to the Empire State Building significantly increases the builders' workload, clearly demonstrating the obstacles they must overcome.
424	15257	6	2	Multiple issues arose during the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. Firstly, as stated by @CAPS1 @NUM1, having a dirigible dock on the building “would add stress to the building's frame.” Moreover, dirigibles are highly flammable, and having them over a densely populated area like New York City poses a great danger. The winds at the building's top were “constantly shifting due to violent air currents.” As @CAPS2 @NUM2 mentioned, even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around it. Using lead weights was also a problem as they could fall from the dirigible and endanger civilians. The most significant obstacle was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. While it seemed like a good concept on paper, it proved to be unrealistic in practice.
425	15258	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the main challenges to the expanded use of dirigibles in New York City was the lack of suitable landing areas. To address this problem, Al Smith constructed a mooring mast. This mast would enable dirigibles to anchor there for several hours to refuel, thus providing a potential solution to the landing issue.
426	15259	6	2	The construction team of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when enabling dirigibles to dock at the building. One of the issues was mast installation. Simply attaching the mast to the building's top with cable tethers was not feasible, as the combined pressure of the dirigibles' load and wind would add stress to the building's frame. To address this, the team strengthened and modified the building's steel frame to transfer the pressure to the ground. Another problem was transporting people and luggage between the building and the airborne dirigible. Since dirigibles were tethered only at the front and the passenger - carrying gondola was underneath, a gangplank to an open observation platform had to be constructed, and a special elevator was needed to move people and luggage from a certain floor. Despite efforts to build the mast, the most significant concern should have been the danger and impracticality of docking dirigibles high above New York City.
427	15260	6	2	Dirigibles faced multiple problems during docking. One major issue was the lack of appropriate landing space. Additionally, winds posed a significant challenge. Strong winds could prevent successful docking. They could cause the dirigible to spin around the building, potentially injuring people on board or damaging the dirigible itself. If the dirigible swung and hit the building, it could lead to structural damage. Moreover, if a spark was generated upon impact, the dirigible could catch fire and explode, similar to the tragic fate of the Hindenburg. In conclusion, these risks made docking dirigibles a highly challenging and dangerous task.
428	15261	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building confronted numerous obstacles when trying to facilitate dirigible docking. To install the mooring mast, they had to modify the existing plans for the building's structural framework. The steel frame of the building was adjusted and reinforced to ensure the mast could be properly installed and remain stable and safe. Another hurdle was designing a docking mechanism. Tying the front of the dirigible to the building did not work effectively. As described, even when tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would continuously swivel around it. Overall, the builders faced a multitude of difficulties in their attempt to enable dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
429	15262	6	2	"In my opinion, the builders of the Empire State Building took on far too many risks when trying to allow dirigibles (Blimps) to dock there. The mast was extremely dangerous. Firstly, the dirigibles would fly at a relatively low altitude. Secondly, if it caught fire or was struck by lightning, it would explode, causing serious harm to people. Additionally, the mast could break off. As @PERSON1 pointed out, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" What @PERSON1 Clavan means is that there are so many issues with mooring airships to this ""mast"" that it is currently unsafe to proceed. In conclusion, the risks associated with the mast are too great to ignore."
430	15263	6	2	Al Smith and the architects faced several obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast atop the Empire State Building. They couldn't simply place the mast on the building's flat roof because the mast itself would add stress to the building's frame. The load of the dirigibles and the wind would further exacerbate this stress. Safety was also a major concern. Most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, and the winds at the building's top had violent and shifting currents, which could cause the back of the dirigible to move unpredictably. Additionally, there was a law prohibiting aircraft from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to tie to the mast. In summary, these factors combined made it extremely difficult to achieve dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
431	15264	6	2	"In an excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building's builders encountered hurdles in enabling dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, the project's expectations were unrealistic as an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, meaning that even if a safe landing method was found, it would be illegal. Secondly, there were violent air - currents. When attempting to dock a dirigible on the building, the wind prevented it from getting close enough to land. Finally, it was a major safety hazard. Most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and in a densely - populated area, the building's owners recognized the potential severity of an accident. Consequently, dirigibles never met the expectations of being the future of transportation and did not dock on the Empire State Building."
432	15265	6	2	Based on the excerpt, the Empire State Building's builders faced challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. They needed to figure out a way for a mooring mast to land on the building's roof because a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable would add stress to the building's frame. The building's frame had to be modified and strengthened, and over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were required, which was a substantial expense for just the building's frame. Safety was also a significant hurdle. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. In my opinion, safety was the greatest obstacle. If a hydrogen - filled dirigible were to explode on top of the Empire State Building, considering that New York is a bustling city with people constantly on the streets, a large number of people could be injured. All these factors made the plan to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
433	15266	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders had to surmount numerous obstacles. For instance, there was a lack of suitable landing areas. Dirigibles were very large, some spanning @NUM1 feet, and in a city full of buildings, there were few appropriate spots for them to land. Another challenge was that the city did not permit dirigibles to be close to rural areas. However, perhaps the most significant obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, as stated on page @NUM2, paragraph @NUM3. Overall, the idea of landing dirigibles at this location was overly unrealistic.
434	15267	6	2	The plan to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building faced problems from its inception to its conclusion. The initial issue was the building's original design, which did not include a dirigible docking station. When plans for the station were introduced, the building was not strong enough to support the heavy load of a spire and a dirigible. An additional @MONEY1 was spent to ensure the building's structural integrity during a dirigible docking. After the Hindenburg's fire, another problem emerged: a hydrogen - filled dirigible catching fire at the Empire State Building would cause significant damage. Since many dirigibles used hydrogen, the safety risk was substantial. Wind was also an obstacle. The force of a dirigible being buffeted by strong winds could exceed the building's structural capacity. Additionally, with dirigibles docking a thousand feet above the ground, there was no way to anchor them properly. The tall spires on the @LOCATION1 skyline posed a danger to any docking dirigible. Finally, a major problem was that the law prohibited low - flying aircraft in urban areas. All these problems made the plan to build a dirigible docking station on the Empire State Building unworkable.
435	15268	6	2	The building faced problems that it could not solve regarding mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a great height. Given these insurmountable issues, it was deemed advisable to postpone the installation of the landing gear to a later date.
436	15269	6	2	The architects of the Empire State Building designed a tower featuring shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel. The builders had to ensure the building was sturdy enough to withstand the wind at its upper levels. Additionally, they faced challenges when attempting to create a dock for dirigibles. In the long run, they also had to comply with the law. These were the main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building encountered.
437	15270	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building had plans for dirigibles to tie to the mast, but faced significant obstacles. Due to the building's great height, dirigibles could not maintain stability while unloading. For instance, as stated in paragraph @NUM1, the Goodyear blimp Columbia attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers. However, since the complete dirigible mooring equipment was never installed, a worker on top of the mooring mast had to catch the bundle of newspapers on a rope dangling from the blimp. Another obstacle was that dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. These issues made it difficult for the builders to achieve their goal of a functional dirigible dock at the Empire State Building.
438	15271	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced two practical obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One was a natural obstacle; even when a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around it. The other was a legal issue, as it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. Although two dirigibles made attempts that ended in failure, by the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had gradually faded away.
439	15272	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles while trying to establish a dirigible docking station. One problem was the stress on the building's frame, which required over sixty thousand dollars in modifications. Another issue was that the back end of the dirigible would swing freely in strong winds. Usually, this is fixed by attaching a lead weight at normal landing sites, but doing so over a city is extremely dangerous. There was also a law prohibiting aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. Moreover, dirigibles never gained popularity. In conclusion, the builders faced many challenges in their attempt to create a dirigible docking station at the Empire State Building.
440	15273	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock. Firstly, the architects couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top with a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. To address this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building needed to be modified and strengthened. Secondly, most dirigibles from outside @LOCATION3 used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. The owners were aware that if a hydrogen - filled dirigible caught fire, like the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, @LOCATION4, the consequences would be far worse in a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The most significant obstacle was the violent air currents when the dirigible was tethered. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast due to the wind, and using lead weights dangling above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. In the end, it was clear that the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was unlikely to fulfill its intended purpose, and these issues should have been considered before construction.
441	15274	6	2	When attempting to enable dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous obstacles. One significant challenge was the necessity of redesigning the building. A thousand - foot dirigible, moored at the building's top with a single cable tether, would impose additional stress on the building's frame. As a result, modifications costing over @MONEY1 were required. Another issue was that most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The greatest obstacle, however, was nature itself. The winds on the building's top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if a dirigible managed to park, the winds would shake its tail excessively, posing a safety risk. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made the task of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building extremely difficult.
442	15275	6	2	According to the excerpt, the architects had to overcome many obstacles to enable dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First, they had to redesign the building's frameworks because the weight of the dirigible would stress the structure. Subsequently, they added two more floors at the top of the building to serve as the boarding area for passengers. Two months after reframing the building, they placed the American flag on top of the mooring mast. Soon after, they realized that proceeding with these designs was unwise as it was both unsafe and impractical. In summary, these were the obstacles the architects faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building.
443	15276	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. One major issue was related to docking dirigibles on the building's top. Due to its great height, there were harsh winds that made it difficult to control the dirigibles. When the Los Angeles attempted to dock, it couldn't get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. The pilot couldn't even take his hands off the control levers, as the dirigible might bump into other buildings. Another obstacle was that New York was densely populated, and the mooring mast was surrounded by other buildings. If a dirigible caught fire like the Hindenburg, it would be a huge problem, especially considering how much worse the accident could have been in a densely populated area. Additionally, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that dirigibles couldn't get close enough to tie up. Given these many apparent obstacles and flaws in the plan, the builders should have recognized them earlier and not built the mooring mast above the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the impracticality of the docking plan was evident from these multiple challenges.
444	15277	6	2	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders faced several problems in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One major issue was that most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If a dirigible burst into flames, fire could rain down on a densely populated area like downtown New York. The wind was another obstacle. Due to violent air currents, the winds were constantly shifting. To deal with this, dirigibles would need to be weighted down with lead weights, which would dangle high above pedestrians on the street. This was neither practical nor safe as the weights could fall and cause harm. The final obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or approach the area. These problems should have been apparent before the mooring mast was constructed. In conclusion, the many issues faced by the builders highlight the poor planning of the mooring mast project."
445	15278	6	2	The builders encountered several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. Docking a dirigible to the roof would add excessive stress to the building's frame. Having flammable gases above a highly populated area also posed a significant risk. Moreover, there was already a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. Additionally, the constantly changing wind direction would make the dirigible unstable. In conclusion, these combined obstacles made it extremely challenging, if not impossible, to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock.
446	15279	6	2	The excerpt reveals that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith recognized an opportunity by installing a mooring mast on the building's top, which would allow dirigibles to anchor for a few hours for refueling, servicing, and passenger embarkation and disembarkation. To implement this idea, the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted experts. They toured the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station. Additionally, the architects met with the president of a newly - formed airship transport company planning to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. Evidently, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in making dirigible docking possible.
447	15280	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a significant amount of work when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The task was not only difficult but also costly. They spent over sixty thousand dollars on modifications to the building framework, as stated in paragraph @NUM1. A substantial amount of money was also spent on the mooring mast. Moreover, ensuring everything functioned properly was no easy feat. There were numerous concerns, especially regarding safety. The architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the building's flat roof, as noted in the same paragraph. Clearly, the builders struggled to make the mooring mast a success, highlighting the complexity and challenges of this endeavor.
448	15281	6	2	When workers attempted to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, they encountered multiple obstacles. Safety was a major concern. When a dirigible, or zeppelin, was docked, its body would sway in the breeze, raising questions about the safety of passengers boarding and alighting. There was also no safe way to weigh down the dirigible, as weights would hang over pedestrians. Another obstacle was the law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to dock or approach the area. The most significant obstacle was nature. The strong and shifting winds at the top of the Empire State Building would cause the dirigible to sway, making docking an extremely complicated task. Ultimately, these challenges made it impossible to realize the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building.
449	15282	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. Safety was a primary concern. As the reading states, dirigibles outside @LOCATION1 used highly flammable hydrogen. A fire on top of the building could cause extensive damage. There were also laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Since the Empire State Building is in downtown, a malfunctioning dirigible could endanger many people. Nature also posed a threat. The constantly shifting winds on top of the building, due to violent air currents, put dirigibles at risk of colliding with the building or other structures. Additionally, the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed. Even if legal and safety issues were resolved, there was no way to land a dirigible without the necessary equipment. These obstacles arose because the builders failed to thoroughly review their plan.
450	15283	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced two main obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock: the weather and the building frame. The wind was a major issue as the air currents at the top of the building caused the winds to constantly shift. A strong gust of wind could blow building materials or even workers off the building. The building frame was another obstacle. The large dirigible, held by a single cable at the top of the building, would add stress to the frame, making the building unsteady. These examples illustrate the difficulties the builders faced in enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
451	15284	6	2	The mooring mast was flawed from its inception. The builders and architects were overly focused on maximizing construction rather than anticipating the problems. When workers attempted to enable dirigibles to land, the first major issue was constructing a mast on top of the world's tallest building. Subsequently, modifications to the building's framework were necessary to support the zeppelins' weight, as the structure would be stressed by winds at a height of 1,250 feet above the ground. Safety was perhaps the most crucial aspect of bringing large zeppelins over densely populated areas. Had the plan been implemented, safety for pedestrians below would have been virtually non - existent. For instance, some zeppelins used hydrogen to stay aloft, and if a hydrogen - filled blimp combusted over a city, it was highly likely that people below would be harmed. Overall, this project presented far too many obstacles for architects to overcome just for docking a single blimp.
452	15285	6	2	"The ""Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 details the challenges faced by the Empire State Building's builders in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. At the time, the Empire State Building was in competition with the Chrysler Building to be the tallest. Al Smith, the then - governor of New York, didn't want to be outdone. As governor, he added more floors to the building with the vision of developing it into a dirigible dock. As time passed, the building encountered more problems. Tying a thousand - foot dirigible to the building would stress its frame. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. The existing frame was not durable enough to hold a ""blimp""; in fact, the building could collapse and take other buildings down with it. Sixty - thousand dollars were spent on refining the frame, but ultimately, the endeavor failed. After the frame was made stable, more issues arose. Safety was a major concern as dirigibles used hydrogen, which is flammable. Additionally, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Once Al Smith realized that even the law prohibited this, all plans ceased, and the Empire State Building remained unchanged."
453	15286	6	2	"When the Empire State Building was constructed, it was intended to serve as a ""pit stop"" for dirigibles, which are known as blimps today. It was envisioned as a modern mode of travel, but numerous problems emerged, altering the plans. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a major safety hazard. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If something went wrong with the ship, many people would be at risk. The strong winds in the area presented the risk of the blimp being punctured against buildings, endangering the people below. Due to these significant problems, the original plan of using the Empire State Building as a dirigible stop could not be realized."
454	15287	6	2	The builders faced several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, namely safety, nature, and U.S. law. Safety was a significant hurdle because most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Nature also presented an obstacle. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The final obstacle was U.S. law. There was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
455	15288	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon Løsted, the @CAPS1 encountered numerous obstacles. One such obstacle was that the back of the ship would spin around the mooring mast. Another was that the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. These challenges significantly hindered the @CAPS1's efforts. In summary, these obstacles made the task of dealing with the mooring mast highly difficult for the @CAPS1."
456	15289	6	2	"When constructing the Empire State Building with the intention of enabling dirigibles to dock there, the builders encountered numerous obstacles. As stated in paragraph fourteen, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" During the planning phase of the mast, the builders failed to consider the high - velocity winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Safety concerns were the primary reason the mooring mast of the Empire State Building never served its intended purpose. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" On May 6, 1937, the German Zeppelin, Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State Building then realized that if a similar incident were to occur in New York, a greater number of lives would be lost. Evidently, the builders of the Empire State Building did not recognize the potential dangers associated with the mooring mast."
457	15290	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles while trying to make it possible for dirigibles to dock. As mentioned in an excerpt in paragraph @NUM1, one of the issues was the stress caused by the dirigibles' load. Another challenge was that they had to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building. This modification was necessary to accommodate the new situation of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these obstacles were significant hurdles that the builders had to face in their attempt to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock.
458	15291	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" those attempting to establish dirigible docks faced substantial obstacles. Prior to installing the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, workers had to modify the frame because ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The viability of the mooring mast goal was severely undermined by an unforeseen problem: safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen instead of oxygen. For example, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, as hydrogen is highly flammable. The realization that ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" added to the concerns. ""Nature itself"" was also the greatest obstacle. Shifting winds would cause the dirigible to swivel around, even if it reached the mooring mast. Although dirigibles could use weights, using them at the Empire State Building, ""while they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" In summary, these multiple obstacles made it extremely difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
459	15292	6	2	The individuals attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at @CAPS1 faced several obstacles. They needed a cable that was @CAPS3 enough to hold the blimp, the passengers, and any @CAPS5 weight. Additionally, they had to figure out how to manage this with the powerful wind at that high altitude. Another concern was the presence of pedestrians at the @CAPS9 if @CAPS7 @CAPS8. Moreover, the building @CAPS10 would have to @CAPS4 UP. In conclusion, these various obstacles presented significant challenges to the goal of enabling dirigibles to dock at @CAPS1.
460	15293	6	2	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. One major obstacle was that mooring a thousand - foot dirigible at the top of the building would put stress on the building's frame, forcing the builders to modify it. Safety was another significant hurdle. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flammable,"" which posed a great threat to the people of New York. The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles, and safety and the need for reconstruction were just a couple of the prominent ones. In conclusion, these challenges made it very difficult for the builders to achieve their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
461	15294	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders encountered numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to land there. The most significant hurdle was natural in nature: the ever - changing wind direction made it impossible for dirigibles to land safely. The architects considered adding heavy weights to the blimps' ends, but they soon recognized that this would endanger pedestrians below. Additionally, the building needed to reach a certain height to circumvent airship height regulations. If an explosion occurred, the densely populated city of New York would be at great risk. In theory, the dirigibles' mast was an innovative concept, but in practice, it was unfeasible.
462	15295	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. One issue was that architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Another challenge was making the mooring mast serve its purpose. The successful use of the mooring mast was hampered by nature itself. Paragraph @NUM2 mentions that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These factors explain why the builders encountered so many difficulties in enabling dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
463	15296	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it details the numerous obstacles the Empire State Building's builders had to overcome to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the constant change in nature and its impact on dirigibles. The winds on top of the building, constantly shifting due to violent air currents, would make the dirigibles ""swivel around,"" posing a danger to pedestrians below as the moving and unstable ship was positioned overhead. Safety was another concern. Outside the US, dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" meaning foreign ships could catch fire in the US and endanger people. Also, the loading dock was over 1,250 feet high, and the winds could make loading and unloading unstable. The final obstacle was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which made it illegal to safely bring dirigibles close to the building. These obstacles made the workers and planners realize that this idea couldn't be realized without endangering people."
464	15297	6	2	"The obstacles faced by the Empire State Building's builders for dirigibles can be described as follows. The main obstacle was related to the nature of the mast. As described, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM1). Secondly, the dangling dirigibles on top of the building posed a risk to pedestrians. Finally, there was a law restricting airships from flying too low or too high. These factors comprehensively explain the challenges the Empire State Building presented for dirigibles."
465	15298	6	2	When the architects and builders were planning to install the mast on the Empire State Building, they encountered several obstacles. For instance, they had to construct the mast in a way that it wouldn't fall off when a dirigible docked. They couldn't use a cable tether to secure the mast because it would place excessive stress on the building's frame and foundation. Another problem the builders faced was strengthening the Empire State Building's frame. Making the frame strong enough to hold the mast would cost over sixty thousand dollars. These are some of the challenges the builders had to deal with.
466	15299	6	2	The construction competition in @ORGANIZATION1 was intense. The builder aimed to construct the largest building in New York City. During the construction, they planned to add a top or hat so that the mast could directly drop people into the building. However, they had to seek approval for this. Irving informed Al that due to the mast, the building would not be completed on time. These were the challenges faced during the construction of the Empire State Building.
467	15300	6	2	During the design and construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast, builders and engineers encountered multiple issues. These included building - stress distribution, fire hazards, and the constant shifting caused by winds. When planning, engineers faced the problem of alleviating stress on the building's frame. They found that having a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable tether would add stress to the frame. According to them, redesigning and modifying the building's foundation and framework would cost over sixty thousand dollars. After the mooring mast was completed, they faced unanticipated fire hazards. American dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, as seen in the Lakehurst, New Jersey dirigible fire. Additionally, New York's violent air currents could make the rear of dirigibles swivel. Weighing down the back with lead blocks was neither practical nor safe. In conclusion, the builders and engineers of the Empire State Building had to deal with many problems, often with no rational solutions.
468	15301	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One issue was that if a dirigible was moored with a single tether, the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would be transferred to the building's foundation nearly eleven hundred feet below. Another problem was that most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. After the Hindenburg disaster, the builders realized how much more severe such an accident could be in densely - populated New York City. Moreover, New York's violent wind currents could cause the rear of dirigibles to swivel. Weighing down the back was not a practical or safe solution. These significant obstacles led to the mast on top of the Empire State Building never being used for docking blimps.
469	15302	6	2	According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. Safety was a major concern. For instance, most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. After the Hindenburg caught fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, in May 1937, the building owners recognized how much worse it could have been in a densely - populated area like downtown New York. Nature also posed a great challenge. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the back end of dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. Additionally, there was a law preventing airships from flying low over urban areas. These multiple obstacles ultimately dashed the hopes of achieving the building's intended purpose.
470	15303	6	2	Constructing any building is difficult, but building the world's tallest building with the ability to dock dirigibles is even more so. The workers modifying the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. One uncontrollable obstacle was nature. The excerpt mentioned that the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making docking difficult and dangerous. The building itself was also a problem. The structure needed modification as a dirigible would add stress to the frame, and the constructors had to make the building support this stress. Safety was another concern as some dirigibles were filled with extremely flammable hydrogen, posing a risk to the large population on the ground. These were just some of the many challenges faced during the modification of the Empire State Building.
471	15304	6	2	The Empire State Building has long held the status of being the tallest building ever constructed. To achieve this distinction, architects designed the Mooring Mast. During the construction of the mast, numerous obstacles had to be surmounted, yet it was ultimately completed. The Mooring Mast was essential as without it, the Empire State Building would not have claimed the title of the world's tallest. To make the Mooring Mast functional, builders faced challenges. One significant obstacle was the need to attach steel from the mast all the way down to the foundation. Another was the necessity to modify the original building plans after designing the mast. In conclusion, despite the difficulties, the addition of the Mooring Mast contributed to the Empire State Building's iconic stature.
472	15305	6	2	Builders encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Factors such as cost, safety, and nature made this idea unfeasible. Safety was a major concern as most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is more flammable than helium. A fire on a dirigible over New York City could have had catastrophic consequences, burning the area and causing thousands of casualties. Nature also posed a significant problem. The winds atop the Empire State Building were constantly shifting, causing the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles typically moored in fields and used black lead weights, which were dangerous when dangling above people. Building the mooring mast was both dangerous and impractical. Due to safety concerns, it was never used for its intended purpose and now serves as a tea and soda area for sightseers. In summary, the combination of safety and natural challenges made the dirigible - docking idea unworkable.
473	15306	6	2	On @DATE1, it was announced that the Empire State Building would reach a height of 1,250 feet. Al Smith, the building's architect, stated that the top would be more than just ornamental. It was envisioned as a dream come true for aviation pioneers, with a mooring mast at the top for docking dirigibles (also known as blimps). However, things did not go as planned. Before construction, several issues should have been more apparent. Most foreign blimps used hydrogen, which is more flammable than helium. The constantly shifting winds on top of the building would cause the dirigible to swivel, and any accident could be disastrous for New York City and its pedestrians. There was also a law regarding how close airships could be to the building. As a result, while the Empire State Building reached 1,250 feet, the original goal of the mooring mast for dirigibles was never achieved. In conclusion, a combination of safety and legal factors thwarted the initial vision for the building's top.
474	15307	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles. For the building to reach @NUM1 ft, it required a very strong base to support its weight, and the base had to be reinforced to mount the mooring mast on top. They also had to deal with the strong air currents above New York. These high - velocity air currents prevented dirigibles from docking. Additionally, the mooring mast placed stress on the building's frame. As the statement “A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame” shows, the construction of the Empire State Building was fraught with difficulties. In conclusion, the challenges related to the base, air currents, and mast stress made the building's construction a complex task.
475	15308	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced hurdles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles are large steel - framed balloons capable of traveling at seventy miles per hour for extended periods. Although dirigibles seemed like an attractive option for modern travel, there were no suitable landing areas. To accommodate dirigibles, many changes to the building needed to be considered. The load from the dirigible and wind pressure would add stress to the building frame. Modifying the building to suit the dirigibles would cost @MONEY1. Scientifically, there were multiple reasons why dirigibles could not dock. Safety was a major issue due to the highly flammable hydrogen gas used in dirigibles in a densely populated area like New York. Nature also presented an obstacle with the strong winds at high altitudes. There was also a law restricting airships from flying too low. As Al Smith said, “One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast.” However, the obstacles made using the mooring mast for dirigibles on the Empire State Building an impractical idea. In conclusion, a combination of safety, natural, and legal factors made the dirigibles - docking plan unworkable.
476	15309	6	2	"The Empire State Building's builders encountered multiple obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock on its mast. Safety was a significant concern. Some dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which, as the article states, is ""highly flammable."" A dirigible catching fire over a densely populated area would pose a great danger. Nature also played a role. ""Violent air currents"" made it difficult to maneuver a dirigible close enough to the mast for docking. Even if these challenging conditions did not exist, it would still have been impossible for a dirigible to moor on the mast because of a law. The law prohibited ""airships [from] flying too low over urban areas,"" which included dirigibles. These obstacles were overlooked in the Empire State Building's construction plans. Overall, these issues made the idea of dirigibles docking on the mast unfeasible."
477	15310	6	2	"The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 highlights the challenges the Empire State Building's builders faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there. An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area, thwarting the original purpose of the mast. Some dirigibles attempted docking, but wind and safety concerns led to the idea being abandoned. Safety for all was a key consideration in the construction. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the Empire State Building's owners realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had occurred above a densely - populated area. Also, when dealing with other countries, one must consider that they may not use the safest materials. Mother Nature added to the difficulties, as the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, making it hard for a ship to land. In conclusion, when embarking on construction projects, one must always be prepared for such obstacles."
478	15311	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders faced several obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock on it. The architects couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the top, as doing so would require changing the entire building's foundation. Nature was a major factor in halting the project. The wind currents were constantly changing, causing the blimp to swirl around. Safety was the most crucial reason for stopping the project. Hydrogen, which many blimps used, is highly flammable. If a blimp over New York were to catch fire, many people would be killed. In summary, these obstacles led the builders to abandon the project of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
479	15312	6	2	The Empire State Building had numerous issues in allowing dirigibles to dock. The safety of the people was the most important concern. Most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, instead of helium. Over a densely - populated area like downtown New York, the death toll in case of an accident would be astronomical. Nature also presented an obstacle. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting, and having a dirigible dangling above pedestrians was unsafe. Additionally, there was an existing law in the U.S. at the time of the building's construction that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Thus, the dirigible was too close to the ground and not allowed to dock. While the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building is remarkable, there are too many obstacles preventing it.
480	15313	6	2	"When the Empire State Building's builders planned to have dirigibles moor at the top, there were critical flaws. A thousand - foot dirigible moored to a small focal point, with wind pressure and its own load, would exert enormous pressure on the building's frame (p. @NUM1). This strain could potentially lead to the building's collapse. At high altitudes, the wind is violent, swaying the back of the dirigible over thousands of pedestrians below, which is neither ""practical nor safe"" (p. @NUM2). In case of an accident, the dirigible could damage another building or even fall. There was also a legal obstacle: a law against airships over cities. A dirigible mooring to a mast, even at that height, was illegal (p. @NUM3). Given these many obstacles, using the Empire State Building as a high - altitude dock was deemed impractical."
481	15314	6	2	There are numerous issues associated with attempting to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building. Firstly, the German dirigible Hindenburg caught fire due to its use of hydrogen. If a similar incident were to occur over densely - populated New York, it would lead to a significant loss of life. Secondly, the wind at a height of 1,250 feet is both strong and unpredictable. There is no guarantee that dirigibles could dock successfully or be controlled once docked. Lastly, there is a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas. It would almost certainly be illegal for a dirigible to be so close to a building filled with many people. Given that these problems could result in fatalities, the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was abandoned.
482	15315	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. Initially, they thought it would be a great concept to allow dirigibles (also known as blimps) to dock. However, they failed to consider the challenges that awaited them. They did not account for the wind pressure and the impact of the blimp's load on the building. The stress from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would need to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. This was a major problem for the architects, and over a significant amount of money (more than @MONEY1) had to be spent on modifying the building's framework. Safety was another crucial issue. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. A fire over a densely populated area like downtown New York could have been catastrophic. The winds also posed a problem. Even if the blimp was tied to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swing around, potentially resulting in a dangerous accident. There were also laws against low - flying ships. In conclusion, the architects of the Empire State Building should have thought the plan through more thoroughly.
483	15316	6	2	For dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders had to meet various requirements and ensure everything was in order. However, they faced multiple obstacles. One such obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City. Additionally, most dirigibles from outside the US used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the builders realized the potential disastrous consequences, especially over a densely populated area like downtown New York. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. Violent air currents at the building's height caused the winds to constantly shift. Considering all these obstacles, the builders came to the realization that this docking plan would not be feasible.
484	15317	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building had several problems when it came to docking dirigibles to the mooring mast. I'm not entirely sure about some aspects, but I'll continue. Regarding the dirigible, I've never learned about certain features of a zeppelin, but I do have a question about how passengers get out, whether it's from the front or the sides. The mooring mast was a failure from the start. There are so many things that could go wrong. It could potentially cause issues for the building (@ORGANIZATION1), and it could fall off unless something extraordinary is done for a building of this height. Overall, over time, these problems, along with several others I've forgotten to mention, are the reasons why we don't use zeppelins as frequently anymore.
485	15318	6	2	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 details that safety, laws, and nature were the three primary obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the most significant factor preventing dirigible docking in @ORGANIZATION2. The main safety hazard was that many countries outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen in their dirigibles instead of helium. A German dirigible was recently destroyed in a fire in New Jersey because, as stated, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). The Empire State Building builders recognized that the accident would have been far more severe if it had occurred ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1), and docking dirigibles there carried this risk. Nature also presented a major obstacle to the success of the mooring mast. Violent air currents at the top of the building constantly changed the wind direction. Since only the front of the dirigibles was tethered to the mooring mast, ""the back of the ship would swivel around"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). Using lead weights to stabilize the back, as done in open fields, was neither practical nor safe above pedestrians on the street. Nature was a major hurdle as it could not be altered, and there was no easy solution to the problems it created. The final obstacle was an existing law that prohibited airships from ""flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1, @NUM5). This law made it illegal for the ship to approach the area and tie up to the building, an insurmountable obstacle. In conclusion, the challenges of safety, laws, and nature made it impossible for the Empire State Building builders to dock dirigibles to the mooring mast."
486	15319	6	2	The building's structure had a steel frame up to a certain number of floors, and glass windows extended to the 102nd floor. Additionally, the building needed to be upgraded due to the stress exerted by blimps.
487	15320	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building's builders encountered multiple obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. The initial hurdle was designing a mooring mast capable of withstanding the dirigible's load stress. As the author wrote in stanza @NUM1, “A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.” Consequently, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to address this issue. The next significant obstacle was the strong winds on the building's top. Stanza @NUM2 stated, “Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.” This was a major problem as architects couldn't weigh down the back of the ship due to the risk to pedestrians. Finally, stanza @NUM3 mentioned “an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.” As a result, it would be illegal for dirigibles to tie up at or even approach the Empire State Building. Due to these three obstacles, the plan of using a mooring mast became obsolete.
488	15321	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders faced numerous obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was installing a mooring mast on the building's top. Simply placing a mooring mast would cause stress that could spread to the foundation, so the building's steel frame had to be modified to withstand the mast. Then, the builders discovered that many non - US dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. This was demonstrated on May 6, 1937, in Lakehurst, New Jersey, when a German dirigible caught fire and was destroyed. Considering New York's high population, the builders realized the potential harm to civilians. The greatest obstacle was the natural conditions. Strong winds around the mooring mast would force dirigibles to swivel in all directions. While dirigibles in open fields were weighed down with lead weights, doing so on the Empire State Building would pose a great risk to the public as they would dangle above pedestrians. In conclusion, these obstacles made it extremely difficult to implement the plan of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
489	15322	6	2	The excerpt of “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted shows that the architects of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles. The construction of the building was not only a competitive endeavor but also had unrealistic expectations. The concept of this architectural masterpiece presented many potential problems, and the architects were not very competitive in dealing with them. As the Chrysler building's construction progressed, the Empire State Building aimed to be taller. To achieve greater heights, the architects proposed adding a mooring mast, which would not only make the building the tallest but also serve an additional purpose. However, adding a mooring mast required extensive planning. If a large steel - framed balloon were to dock on the building as it was, it could dangerously shake the building's foundation, so the building's frame had to be rebuilt to be much stronger. Moreover, the architects failed to recognize the danger of docking dirigibles. Dirigibles, or blimps, were fueled by hydrogen, which is highly flammable and posed a threat to the thousands of people living below. In summary, these issues made the plan of adding a mooring mast for dirigibles a challenging one.
490	15323	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION1, the Empire State Building's builders faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles (also known as blimps) to dock there. One obstacle was that the architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, attaching a thousand - foot dirigible to the building's frame “would add stress to the building's frame.” The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, nearly @NUM2 feet below. Allowing highly flammable dirigibles to hover over a densely populated area was also very unsafe. Lastly, the article noted that “the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.” The ship would “swivel” around the mooring mast. Dirigibles are meant to land in open fields, not dangle above pedestrians. In conclusion, these obstacles made it unfeasible to use the mooring mast for dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
491	15324	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple challenges when aiming to enable dirigibles to dock on the structure. One significant hurdle was the stress that a large - size dirigible would impose on the building's frame. Landing an enormous dirigible on an eleven - hundred - foot building would subject the frame to substantial stress, and distributing this stress across the building was an unprecedented task. To make the building capable of withstanding the weight of the dirigibles, it would cost over sixty thousand dollars, which was a considerable expense considering all the other works they were undertaking. In conclusion, these difficulties made it extremely challenging to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
492	15325	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Installing a mooring mast was not straightforward; it would require extensive modifications that would cost over sixty thousand dollars. They couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof because the stress from a thousand - foot dirigible on the building's frame would be excessive. As a result, they needed to strengthen and modify the steel frame of the building to hold the dirigibles as intended. In summary, these challenges made the task of enabling dirigible docking quite arduous.
493	15326	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. The idea was not practical mainly due to safety concerns. Having an up - to @NUM1 - foot blimp filled with flammable nitrogen hovering over a densely populated area was extremely dangerous. A single accident could cost many lives, especially after the crash of the German blimp Hindenburg. Workers were aware that a similar incident in New York would result in a high death toll. Additionally, nature posed difficulties. The winds atop the building were constantly changing, and the air currents were too violent, presenting many threats. Even when the dirigible was anchored, the back of the ship would swivel. Although lead tools could be used to weigh down the blimp, it was not a safe option when hanging above a large number of people. In conclusion, the idea of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building was neither safe nor worth the potential losses.
494	15327	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building confronted many challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was the design of the mooring and the necessary building modifications. Due to wind pressure and the dirigible's load, the building's structure had to be strengthened. The mast also had to withstand the stress of holding the dirigible with just one cable tether, which would put a large amount of stress on both the mast and the building. Another problem was that most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen in their balloons instead of helium, making them more flammable and dangerous. A fire in a dirigible above New York City would be catastrophic. Moreover, there was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to or approach the Empire State Building. In summary, the challenges the builders faced were too great to overcome for the purpose of allowing dirigible docking on the building's spire.
495	15328	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in this project. One was the competition with the Chrysler Building. The architect of the Chrysler Building made it 46 ft taller, forcing the builder of the Empire State Building to make their building taller. They resorted to using something ""as mundane as a water tank"" (@NUM1 ∂ Al Smith). Another obstacle was trying to make the building a stop for dirigibles. These dirigibles could travel up to @NUM2 miles per hour and were as long as 1000 ft, taking up @NUM3 blocks in New York City. They also lacked a proper landing area. A third challenge was nature. The constant wind and the danger of hanging dirigibles over a city full of innocent people made the task very risky. In conclusion, these obstacles made the construction and the plan for dirigible docking a difficult endeavor."
496	15329	6	2	During the planning of this architectural masterpiece, the builders encountered numerous obstacles. The plan to install a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building failed to meet expectations. The first major issue was the substantial stress exerted on the building's framework when zeppelins were moored at the top, and the pulling force would also affect the foundation. The second problem was the cost of modifying the skyscraper to prevent stress on the framework. Safety was a significant concern as well; most blimps were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. An explosion while floating over one of the country's largest cities would be catastrophic. Due to the geographical location of New York, strong ocean winds with constantly shifting directions could cause zeppelins to crash into the building. The final obstacle was the law prohibiting airships from flying too low over densely populated urban areas. In conclusion, these challenges made it unfeasible for the mooring mast plan to succeed.
497	15330	6	2	Four main obstacles precluded dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building. A much more complex mooring mast than those in open - field docking areas would need to be installed on top of the building. When a dirigible docked on the mast, it would place great stress on the building's frame, a problem that could be addressed by strengthening the steel frame. Another issue was that dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which was highly flammable and could easily catch fire and explode. Engineers recognized the significant problems this would pose over a densely populated area like New York City. After the mast was built, a new problem emerged. Even if a dirigible could dock, intense winds could make the back end of the dirigible move violently or prevent docking altogether, as seen in the incident with the Los Angeles. Using lead weights to weigh down the balloon was not an option as it would endanger civilians. Lastly, existing laws against airships flying too low over urban areas would have prevented docking. Although two ships came close, these reasons ultimately made it impossible for a ship to moor on top of the Empire State Building.
498	15331	6	2	"The excerpt focuses on ""The Mooring Mast"" and its construction. One of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. This means the dirigibles were a significant danger to people's lives. If a dirigible caught fire while in the sky, it could cause loss of life. Another obstacle was that it was against the law. Existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Even though the Empire State Building is the tallest in New York, it was still considered too low for airships under the law, as low - flying airships could cause accidents. Additionally, the building is over 1,250 feet tall, and the strong winds at the top made it difficult for dirigibles to approach and stop. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles could not get close enough to the mooring mast to tie up due to the forceful wind. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it extremely challenging for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
499	15332	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. As stated in a paragraph, a significant amount of modification to the building's framework was required. Another issue was that most countries outside the United States used hydrogen in dirigibles instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, making it unsafe for dirigibles to stop in a densely populated area like downtown New York, as mentioned in another paragraph. Existing laws against airships flying too low over urban areas also posed an obstacle, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. These challenges were substantial and ultimately hindered the builders' efforts to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
500	15333	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced difficulties in enabling dirigibles to dock there. Wind was a major problem during docking. As stated, ""The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze."" This swinging would cause pulling on the building that the current frame could not support. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. To address this, the builders had to strengthen and modify the building's frame to withstand the stress of the dirigibles' loads. Another obstacle was the framing of the mast. The roof had to be completed before the mast's framing could start. Due to Al Smith's idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the building, workers had to work for another two months after the building was already finished. Despite their hard work to adapt the building for dirigible docking, unfortunately, their efforts were in vain."
501	15334	6	2	"The endeavor to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges for its builders. Some of these challenges remained undiscovered until the actual attempt to dock dirigibles. The initial problem for the builders was preparing the building to withstand the additional stress that would occur when dirigibles attempted to dock. They invested @MONEY1 in modifications to strengthen the building's framework. Instead of constructing a plain, utilitarian mast, the architects designed a tower made of shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel. This not only created unnecessary work for the workers but also introduced obstacles. There was also a significant amount of danger associated with docking dirigibles that the builders had to address. The erratic and violent air currents required them to make the mast as sturdy as possible and account for the movement of the dirigibles. Eventually, the builders discovered the most significant obstacle: it was illegal for airships to fly at such low altitudes over urban areas. In hindsight, it is evident that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."
502	15335	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Violent wind currents were one such obstacle. The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong air currents. Even when a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel. Another obstacle was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, rendering the mast almost useless. A third obstacle was that foreign dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. After the destruction of the dirigible ""The Hindenburg,"" the owners realized how much more disastrous the accident could have been if it had happened above a densely populated area like New York. These were the challenges that the Empire State Building's builders faced in their attempt to enable dirigible docking."
503	15336	6	2	"According to the excerpt ""The mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there were fire, wind, and laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Allowing dirigibles to dock would pose a risk of the dirigibles catching fire because non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Wind was another obstacle. The winds shifted due to violent air currents, causing the back of the dirigible to swivel. Placing weights on the back of the dirigible would not be safe for pedestrians on the street. The final obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to tie to the building. These were the challenges they faced."
504	15337	6	2	"There were high expectations for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. However, the men who constructed the massive structure should have recognized that these expectations were unrealistic. Al Smith had planned for dirigibles to refuel and transport passengers while docked at the Empire State Building. These plans could never come to fruition because dirigibles were powered by highly flammable hydrogen, which could lead to disaster; the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were extremely strong; and there was a law restricting aircraft from flying at low altitudes over urban areas. In one incident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. The owners of the Empire State Building realized ""How much worse that accident could have been [in New York City]."" ""The greatest obstacle to use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" because the strong wind prevented dirigibles from getting close enough to dock. Additionally, the law regarding airship altitude prohibited dirigibles from approaching the Empire State Building. Clearly, the plans for the Empire State Building's dirigible - docking capabilities were never realistic and could never be fulfilled."
505	15338	6	2	The wind was a major problem during the construction of the Empire State Building. Since the building is so tall, the top part is not as stable. If dirigibles were to be used on the Empire State Building, it would be extremely dangerous because the weights would dangle high above the heads of pedestrians. This plan was neither intelligent nor safe. The only reason for building the Empire State Building to such a great height was to make it the tallest building; there were no other practical or valid reasons. In conclusion, the idea of using dirigibles on the building was ill - conceived, and the excessive height of the building lacked a proper purpose.
506	15339	6	2	The elders involved in the Empire State Building project encountered numerous complications. Safety was a paramount concern. Dealing with the harsh winds presented a significant problem. When the concept of the mast was conceived, few grasped the practical implications. Attaching an extremely heavy object to just a tether was not a sufficiently safe solution. The presence of combustible gases also put downtown New York at risk. Landing on the small roof was difficult due to the strong winds, and guiding the dirigible to a delicate landing in such conditions was hazardous. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges when constructing the mooring mast.
507	15340	6	2	"In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, the building had a flat roof, and mooring a dirigible to the top with only a single cable tether would impose stress on the building's frame. Modifying the building would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Safety was another major issue. Some dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, and an accident in New York would be disastrous. Nature itself posed the greatest obstacle. The constantly shifting winds meant that even when tethered to the mooring mast, the ship would not be secure, which was also very unsafe. Ultimately, the Empire State Building failed to achieve its intended purpose."
508	15341	6	2	"The primary problem in the original design of the mooring mast was that the architects could not simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Another obstacle was exemplified by the German dirigible ""Hindenburg."" Since some dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, another ""Hindenburg accident"" in a highly populated area like downtown New York could be fatal. Perhaps the greatest obstacle was nature itself. The high - force winds on top of the Empire State Building would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Even if the dirigibles could be weighted down, the weights hanging over pedestrians were neither practical nor safe. In summary, these issues made the construction of the mooring mast extremely challenging."
509	15342	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was related to the area. There was a lack of a suitable landing area in New York City for their project. Another significant obstacle was the mooring mast. The greatest hurdle to the success of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around it. Additionally, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If a ship tied up to the building or approached the area, it would be illegal. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it very difficult for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
510	15343	6	2	The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was doomed to never fulfill its intended purpose, and the reasons should have been obvious even before its construction. The most significant reason was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This high - flammability risk meant that the mooring mast could not be used safely, and thus it was unable to achieve its purpose.
511	15344	6	2	"In the 1930s, the concept of installing a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's top for dirigibles to dock was a well - received theory. Nevertheless, the building's constructors encountered numerous challenges. These included existing airship - related laws, the use of flammable hydrogen in dirigibles, strong winds, and the additional stress a moored dirigible would impose on the building's frame. Current ""air traffic laws"" prohibited a ship from tying up to the Empire State Building or flying close to it as airships were not allowed to fly too low over urban areas. The destruction of the hydrogen - filled Hindenburg made the Empire State Building's owners aware of the extreme danger of dirigibles, especially if they were to combust over downtown New York City. Strong winds were also perilous for dirigibles moored to the building since these aircrafts couldn't be firmly fixed in the air. Moreover, the building's steel frame would need modification to handle the stress of a moored dirigible. In conclusion, it was highly unrealistic and unsafe to moor dirigibles to the Empire State Building."
512	15345	6	2	When trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the mast, builders confronted multiple obstacles such as safety, natural factors, flammability, and laws. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was fated to never serve its intended purpose. Dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. The German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. The Empire State Building's owners realized that the situation could have been far worse if such an incident occurred over a densely populated area like New York. Violent air currents also had an impact, causing the back of the ship to spin. When dirigibles were moored in landing fields, they were weighted down with lead weights, which posed a danger to pedestrians on the street. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Considering all these factors, it was impossible for dirigibles to dock at the mast.
513	15346	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building in New York encountered numerous obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One challenge was ensuring that the Empire State Building had sufficient strength to hold a dirigible swaying in the wind without toppling. The weight of the dirigible needed to be transferred to the building's base, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. However, the most significant hurdle was keeping the dirigible stationary while docked on top of the building. The winds were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", causing the dirigible to fly erratically around the building's top. Due to the risks and difficulties associated with the mooring mast and dirigibles, the building would never be used for its intended transportation purpose."
514	15347	6	2	During the design and construction of the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the engineers seemingly overlooked some valuable information. Just like any vehicle in the air or at sea, wind can be either an ally or an adversary. The engineers should have given more thought to the fact that changing wind speeds and directions at 1,250 feet in the air pose significant threats. A dirigible would struggle to get close enough to the mast for mooring, let alone stay stable enough for passengers to safely enter and exit. Moreover, if the law prohibited airships from flying at such low altitudes, the idea was unfeasible. It's senseless to pursue something illegal. Although the concept of landing a blimp in this way seems futuristic and cool, too many factors prevented it from becoming a reality.
515	15348	6	2	The owner of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles. One problem was the lack of space for the dirigible to land. To address this, the architect added a mooring mast to increase the building's height. Another issue was that the steel frame of the building needed to be expanded to accommodate the additional height, which would cost over @MONEY1. The primary concern, however, was safety. The dirigible was flammable, and the owner had to ensure its safety. Wind and natural elements also played a crucial role in the decision - making process. Strong winds would cause the dirigible to swing and shift constantly, putting people on the streets of New York at risk. In summary, the idea of landing dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building was neither safe nor practical, and there were too many challenges for such a plan to succeed.
516	15349	6	2	The construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges to the builders. Firstly, the building's structure was initially insufficient to bear the weight of dirigibles. As a result, the entire framework of the building had to be strengthened, incurring modifications worth sixty thousand dollars. Additionally, the dirigibles lacked the appropriate docking tools for the newly - built mooring mast. Moreover, when docked, the back of the dirigibles could swing back and forth, posing an issue during docking. Another concern was that most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, which was unacceptable to have near the building. In conclusion, these multiple challenges made the process of enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building extremely difficult.
517	15350	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered difficulties when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. The primary reason was the load of the dirigibles, which would cause stress. Wind pressure was also a significant factor, as it needed to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Dirigibles were docked using an electric winch, but the fact that the dirigible could swing in the breeze was a safety concern. In summary, these issues combined to prevent successful dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
518	15351	6	2	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building's builders faced hurdles in facilitating dirigible docking. Safety was a major concern. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, which could harm buildings and people in the densely populated business district. The constantly shifting winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents, put lives at risk and could lead to expensive damage. Additionally, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These obstacles led to the abandonment of the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building, making the building's top safer for other purposes."
519	15352	6	2	Designing the dirigible docking system had several problems. Practically, the violent winds created by city updrafts made blimp landings too risky, as the winds on the building's top constantly shifted due to air currents. Structurally, the Empire State Building was not originally designed for blimp mooring, and modifying it was costly, amounting to over @NUM1 dollars. There were also laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over buildings. These impracticalities proved to be challenging obstacles that hindered the success of the dirigible docking system.
520	15353	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building aimed to make New York a leader in modern travel by building a mooring mast for dirigible docking. However, unexpected difficulties arose, preventing this goal from being achieved. To add the mast, the entire support structure of the building had to be redesigned due to the pressure from a docked dirigible. Even after this was resolved, other issues emerged. The architects failed to anticipate that most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, which was too risky over a densely populated city. The unpredictable high winds at the top of the mast also made docking dangerous. Once these obstacles became apparent, it was clear that the Empire State Building would never dock a dirigible.
521	15354	6	2	"According to Marcia Amidon L¸sted's article ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles during construction, especially regarding the docking of dirigibles or blimps. The most significant challenges were natural forces like wind and gravity. As the article notes, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making it unsafe for both dirigible passengers and pedestrians below near the blimp and the turbulent air. Additionally, the flammability of the hydrogen in the blimp was a major issue. Having a potential fire - hazard that was @NUM1 feet long floating over a densely populated area like New York City was extremely unsafe. Moreover, laws prohibited airships from flying too close over urban areas, preventing dirigibles from approaching the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. A test run with the U.S. navy dirigible Los Angeles demonstrated that it was too dangerous and impractical, as the dirigible couldn't even get close enough to tie up. In conclusion, while the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was ingenious, the multitude of obstacles made its implementation unfeasible."
522	15355	6	2	Architects encountered multiple problems when trying to enable dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Firstly, adding a mooring mast was a complex task. They couldn't simply install it; instead, they had to reinforce the entire building's structural skeleton. Secondly, there was the risk of a dirigible failing like the Hindenburg. If such an incident occurred, the dirigible would plunge in a ball of fire onto the densely populated city below. The most significant challenge was nature itself. Violent winds were constantly present. If a dirigible were tethered, it would move violently and potentially endanger pedestrians below. This risk was too great for the architects to take. In summary, the difficulties faced in enabling dirigible docking on the Empire State Building were insurmountable.
523	15356	6	2	When adding a mooring mast to the Empire State Building, the construction team encountered several impediments. Initially, they had to consider the size of a dirigible. A large dirigible at the building's top would warp the frame. To address this, they spent over sixty thousand dollars to modify the original framework to a more suitable one. Another issue was the sharp edges on the building, which could damage a dirigible attempting to dock. Additionally, the mast was located above a large urban area. In the event of an accident, severe consequences would ensue. There was also a law restricting aircraft from flying too low over a city. In conclusion, due to these multiple obstacles, the establishment of a dirigible mooring dock on the Empire State Building was not feasible.
524	15357	6	2	The Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in its attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. Dirigibles were docked using an electric winch. The most significant obstacle for the mooring mast was nature. Violent air currents caused the winds on top of the building to shift. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around it. Although dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down with lead weights in the back, this was neither practical nor safe in New York City. The lack of a suitable landing area was a major hindrance. A mooring mast on the building's top could have allowed dirigibles to anchor for refueling, servicing, and passenger embarkation and disembarkation. However, considering all the obstacles, the realization of this docking facility remained a challenge.
525	15358	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a variety of obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock. An existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, preventing dirigibles from tying up to the building or approaching the area. Another problem was ensuring the mast was strong enough to support a dirigible. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame,"" indicating the need for mast improvements. One of the most critical issues was the dirigibles being filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. The building's owners recalled the 1937 destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire and recognized that a similar accident in a densely populated area would have been far more catastrophic. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it extremely difficult to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
526	15359	6	2	The construction of the Empire State Building faced several challenges when it came to enabling dirigibles to dock there. A dirigible is a type of blimp, essentially large steel balloons filled with hydrogen and helium. In New York, dirigibles lacked a suitable landing area. Al Smith, a four - term governor of New York, proposed adding a mooring mast to the Empire State Building. This would allow dirigibles to anchor, refuel, and enable passengers to embark and disembark safely. The architects and builders had to seek advice from experts. They consulted workers at the @ORGANIZATION2, tested the mass, and met with the president of a newly formed airship transport company. After overcoming all these obstacles, they were finally able to build the mooring mast.
527	15360	6	2	"The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted chronicles the construction of the mast on the Empire State Building. Initially, the mast was added to increase the height of the thousand - foot building. However, Al Smith, one of the builders, envisioned the mast serving a greater purpose: providing a docking station for dirigibles. This concept presented significant challenges. First, the builders had to modify the tower's structure to ensure it could withstand the weight of a dirigible swaying in the wind. L¸sted notes that ""The stress of the dirigible's load... Would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" Once the mast was completed, the builders encountered the issue of dirigibles hovering high above pedestrians on the street. A fall could result in hundreds of casualties. Additionally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Docking at the Empire State Building would violate this law. Despite being a good idea, ""The Mooring Mast"" demonstrates that it was not feasible for dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building."
528	15361	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the primary concern at every stage. The recent explosion of the Hindenburg highlighted potential problems associated with docking these aircraft. An explosion of a blimp in downtown New York could be catastrophic. Another challenge was nature. The wind conditions at the top of the building were constantly changing. The unpredictable winds made the idea of mooring a zeppelin highly impractical. Moreover, laws against low - flying airships in urban areas were emerging, which would make docking the airships illegal. While the concept of using the Empire State Building as a mooring post was an engineering achievement, its practical application was not viable.
529	15362	6	2	The builders faced significant obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would exert stress on the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transmitted to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. To accommodate this, the steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened, at a cost of over sixty thousand dollars.
530	15363	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered extremely difficult obstacles. The workers had to ensure that the building did not become so tall that it would tilt. They also faced competition. They were determined to make their building the tallest. They did not give up until the Empire State Building became the tallest building in @CAPS1.
531	15364	6	2	Builders aiming to enable dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building encountered numerous issues. The weight of the dirigibles and wind pressure would exert stress on the building, with this stress being transmitted over a significant distance down to the building's foundation. Construction was not the sole problem. Most hydrogen - filled dirigibles, which are highly flammable, posed a severe safety risk. If a fire occurred over the busy and crowded New York streets, many lives could be lost. Additionally, wind currents had the potential to push dirigibles into nearby buildings, causing them to rupture. There was also an existing regulation that prohibited low - flying aircraft. These problems related to nature, regulations, safety, and construction ultimately led to the abandonment of the mooring system.
532	15365	6	2	The construction team of the Empire State Building encountered substantial challenges when planning to allow dirigibles to dock. Firstly, financial resources were a major concern. Any addition on top of such a large building required foundation reinforcement for balance. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, “over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework.” Another significant hurdle was dealing with the strong wind currents at the @DATE1 - foot height of the building. Even if the front of the dirigible was secured to the mooring, the rear would sway in the wind. An accident or damage to a dirigible over a densely populated area like downtown New York would have catastrophic consequences. In summary, the potential risks of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building far exceeded the benefits. As dirigible travel became less practical, the plan was completely abandoned.
533	15366	6	2	Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a complex and challenging process. Workers couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the roof. A one - thousand - foot dirigible, moored at the top of the building by a single cable tether, added stress to the building's frame. The architects also had to construct a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless - steel tower that was illuminated from within and had a stepped - back design mimicking the building's overall shape. Eventually, it was realized that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building. One reason was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In conclusion, architects faced numerous obstacles in building the masts for dirigible docking, which ultimately led to the non - implementation of the plan.
534	15367	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some extremely tricky and life - threatening problems. As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, if a dirigible caught fire during docking, there would be severe damage to the people on the streets below. Another major obstacle, as described in paragraph @NUM2, was the “greatest obstacle” of the wind at the top of the tower. The wind would whip the dirigible around while it was held by just a cable to the mooring mast, endangering those around the building and inside the blimp. Moreover, as stated in paragraph @NUM3, there was a regulation preventing airships from flying low in the area. These problems were significant challenges that the builders had to confront if they wanted to enable dirigible docking at the building.
535	15368	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Løsted, the past construction of the Empire State Building, which made it the tallest in the United States, is described. Builder Al Smith faced many obstacles, with one of the most difficult being allowing dirigibles to dock. One challenge was enabling dirigibles to anchor for several hours for refueling, servicing, and passenger boarding and alighting. Another was providing a place for dirigibles to tie up to a mast. As Løsted (@NUM1) stated, “Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast.” This could be problematic as the mast body could swing in strong winds. Despite these difficulties, Al Smith showed courage and worked around the obstacles to complete the Empire State Building.
536	15369	6	2	"In an excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", @ORGANIZATION2 details the architectural, chemical, and legal hurdles that precluded the construction of a mooring dock for dirigibles atop the Empire State Building. Despite then- @CAPS1 Al Smith publicly announcing the plan and John Tauranac stating that the building's top ""would serve a higher calling [than] to add a desired few feet"", @ORGANIZATION2 argues that the mast's failure ""should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"". The article notes that the mast and a moored dirigible ""would add stress to the building's frame"", and over sixty thousand dollars was spent to handle the pressure. Additionally, foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, which is more flammable than the helium used in American dirigibles, and an explosion above the building would be catastrophic for the city. An existing law also prohibited dirigibles from ""even approach[ing]"" the building. Based on these factors, @ORGANIZATION2 demonstrates the unrealistic nature of the mooring mast."
537	15370	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered significant challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One major hurdle was the need to modify and strengthen the building, which came at a high cost. As the excerpt stated, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation; over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Safety concerns also prevented the plan from fully materializing. The risk of fire and harm to people on the streets was too great. Moreover, it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. These obstacles ultimately made the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible."
538	15371	6	2	The architects of the project faced notable issues. As mentioned in @LOCATION1, the stress from the dirigibles' load was excessive for the building. They would incur over sixty thousand dollars in modifications. Apart from that, they also had to redesign and implement the necessary changes. Overall, these challenges presented significant difficulties for the project's success.
539	15372	6	2	"In the short - story ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One problem was the dirigible's load and wind pressure on the building's foundation. As stated, ""The stress of the dirigible's load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This was a major hurdle for the dirigibles' landing process. Another issue was that dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. As the story mentioned, ""The Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building was destined never to fulfill its purpose. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" A fire on the dirigible could endanger many lives in the populated city. In conclusion, the Mooring Mast failed to work due to multiple reasons, with safety and the impact of the dirigible's load and wind pressure on the building's foundation being two significant obstacles to dirigible docking."
540	15373	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. The main challenges included the danger posed by dirigibles, natural factors, and an existing law. The reading indicates that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is considered highly flammable"", highlighting the risk. The German dirigible Hindenburg's destruction by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, further emphasized this danger. Nature also presented a major obstacle as ""the winds on top of the building"" constantly shifted due to violent air currents, making it nearly impossible to dock a dirigible without it moving erratically. An existing law made it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach the area, and without its revocation, the mooring mast could not function. When designing the mast, the builders also had to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building because ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"", resulting in over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications. These combined obstacles made the implementation of the dirigible - docking plan at the Empire State Building extremely difficult, if not impossible."
541	15374	6	2	"During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. The reading selection ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted details many of these difficulties. For example, one major hurdle was the scarcity of a suitable landing area in New York City. Another challenge was making the dirigibles globally viable, which led to a meeting with the president of a formed airship transport company that intended to use the dirigibles' service across the Pacific Ocean. The architects also held discussions with the government regarding safe methods of mooring airships to the mast. Despite the builders' efforts to overcome these challenges, it ultimately was not sufficient to implement the plan."
542	15375	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle was ensuring the safety of the docking process. As the reading states, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Nature also posed a significant challenge. The sentence ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" at the beginning of paragraph @NUM1 indicates that docking dirigibles at the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was unsafe. Additionally, it was illegal for dirigibles to dock. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which made it illegal for dirigibles to even approach the area. Consequently, it was impossible for a ship to land there."
543	15376	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, they had to take into account the Hindenburg incident that occurred on May 6, 1937. As the author mentions, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" highlighting that the safety of the people must be the top priority. Another obstacle faced by Al Smith and the builders was docking the dirigible with people below. The author states in paragraph @NUM2 that ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Usually, dirigibles are docked in open fields where weights can be safely used to hold down the back of the ship. However, this was not an option above a highly - populated area as lead weights dangling above pedestrians are a safety violation. In conclusion, the builders faced many challenges in designing the use of the mooring mast."
544	15377	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A thousand - foot dirigible on top of the building would add excessive stress to the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible was too great for the existing frame to bear, and the frame would have to be modified and strengthened to support the dirigible. Landing a dirigible atop the Empire State Building entailed many risks, which made the endeavor extremely challenging for the builders.
545	15378	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that a thousand - foot dirigible held by a single cable tether would place stress on the building's frame. To address this, they needed to strengthen the frame. Paragraph @NUM1 describes the steps taken to make the building stronger, stating that ""the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower"" and ""The rocket - shaped mast would have four wings at its corners."" Other challenges included ensuring that the mooring mast was tall enough. In paragraph @NUM2, Smith mentions that ""people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" Overall, the builders had to overcome multiple obstacles to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
546	15379	6	2	"Builders attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the location described in the excerpt encountered numerous challenges. Firstly, the entire structure of the Empire State Building would require alteration. Attaching a dirigible to a mooring mast on top of the building would exert significant stress on the building's frame. Modifying the stainless - steel in the frame to enhance its strength, though necessary, is extremely costly. As the excerpt states, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". Secondly, the builders had to deal with existing laws. The government prohibited aircraft from flying too low over buildings. The excerpt mentions, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas"". This law also made it illegal for an aircraft to tie up to a building or even approach it. In conclusion, these challenges made the task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building extremely difficult."
547	15380	6	2	"There were three major obstacles in constructing a dirigible dock on top of the Empire State Building. Safety was the first concern. Most non - U.S. dirigibles were flammable as they ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". After the destruction of the Hindenburg, it became clear that such an incident over a densely populated city would have been far more disastrous. Nature presented another problem. The winds ""constantly shifted due to violent air currents"", causing the back of the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"". The third obstacle was a pre - existing law. As L¸sted says, ""[there] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". For the ships to even approach, the building would need to be much taller. In summary, these factors combined to prevent the successful construction of a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building."
548	15381	6	2	Building a large - scale project is no easy feat. One must address all the negative aspects and ensure everything is done correctly. Sometimes, parts need to be torn down to complete the hard work properly. It is essential to review what has been done right to prevent problems. When building, numerous challenges may arise. In the case of the Empire State Building, attempts to dock dirigibles faced issues when the docking was not carried out or constructed properly. Even though there were efforts like swinging to climb on as build - up pressure, building is difficult. It brings both beauty and hardship, and it serves as a reminder of well - done work. In conclusion, the process of building, especially in the context of the Empire State Building's dirigible docking, is a complex one with its own set of rewards and difficulties.
549	15382	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple problems when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. The most obvious issues stemmed from the materials of the dirigibles, weather conditions, and existing laws regarding airships flying over urban areas. Dirigibles were not constructed with the safest materials; most were made with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. This would make the docking station unsafe in case of a fire. Given that the station would be above a densely populated area, a fire on a dirigible would lead to a very severe accident. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". Violent air currents on top of the Empire State Building would cause the ship to swivel around the mooring mast, making docking unsafe. An incident involving the dirigible would endanger the many pedestrians below. The last reason for the non - construction of the docking station, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM2, is ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law makes it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the docking station. The law exists due to high winds, as there is a fear that they could blow the dirigible onto other buildings. In conclusion, safety concerns and existing laws prevented the construction of the docking station."
550	15383	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of challenges as they tried to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most significant problems were related to safety and the actual process of mooring the dirigible. The hydrogen used in dirigibles is highly flammable, posing a great safety risk. In the event of a fire, especially over a densely populated area like New York City, many people could be harmed. Moreover, mooring the dirigible was a difficult task. Dirigibles are typically anchored with heavy lead weights, but using these weights above city streets could potentially injure pedestrians below. Allowing the dirigible to dock also presented a problem: when tethered to the mast on top of the Empire State Building, the dirigible would swing around the mast due to the wind. Ultimately, the builders were unable to overcome these issues, and the Empire State Building is now mainly used as an observation deck and a regular building. In conclusion, the safety and mooring challenges were insurmountable for the builders, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible - docking plan.
551	15384	6	2	Docking a dirigible on the Empire State Building's top is an achievement that is highly unlikely to be realized. The primary concern regarding this endeavor is safety. In the work by @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author mentions the well - known destruction of the Hindenburg. The architects recognized that if such an accident had occurred over a city like New York, the consequences would have been far more disastrous. Nature also presented challenges to making the mast functional. The winds atop the building were in a constant state of change due to strong air currents, as stated in @CAPS1 @NUM2. The author further details how the dirigible would swing around the mast. Attempting to weigh it down was neither practical nor safe, as per @CAPS1 @NUM2. Finally, a law was passed that prohibited dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, which meant that a dirigible could not legally approach the mast. The architects had few favorable factors and numerous obstacles working against them, ultimately making the docking of dirigibles on the Empire State Building an unfeasible task.
552	15385	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring @CAPS1” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building had a daunting task. They were constructing the world's tallest building, and when Al Smith, the construction project's head, demanded it be made taller, the situation became even more challenging. This was mainly because they intended to use the building's height as a docking point for dirigibles. However, they soon discovered that it was not as simple as tying a blimp to a building. They faced multiple obstacles. The architects needed to modify the building since mooring a thousand - foot dirigible would add stress to its structure. Dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, and a fire in downtown New York would be catastrophic. Nature also posed a threat; the winds on the building's top would cause the dirigible to swivel. Additionally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low in urban areas. In the end, the plan to use the building as a dirigible dock failed due to these insurmountable challenges.
553	15386	6	2	There were significant problems with people discussing airships on @CAPS3 @CAPS4 in relation to @ORGANIZATION1. The nature of these problems is not fully elaborated in the given context, but it is clear that there was a notable issue. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the exact cause and solution of this problem. However, it is evident that the situation regarding the airships and @ORGANIZATION1 requires further investigation and attention to resolve the associated problems.
554	15387	6	2	Al Smith and the engineers encountered numerous obstacles while trying to enable dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One major obstacle was that most dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable chemical. A hydrogen - related fire could have led to the destruction of the Empire State Building and caused the loss of millions of lives. Another challenge was nature. At a height of 1,250 feet, there were extremely strong winds. These unpredictable winds could blow the dirigible into the building, resulting in a fatal outcome. Finally, the law prohibited dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, making the docking operation illegal. Although the building overcame some of these obstacles, in the end, it was extremely unsafe to proceed with the mast for dirigible docking, and thus, the plan was not viable.
555	15388	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced difficulties when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects could not simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. They initially planned to attach a single cable tether, but this would have added stress to the building's frame. As a result, they designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside to strengthen the building's structure. However, when they attempted the docking, the wind was too strong. The wind was constantly changing due to violent air currents, causing the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Moreover, there was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Due to these insurmountable challenges, the plan to use the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking site was ultimately abandoned.
556	15389	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when considering allowing dirigibles to dock there. One issue was that if a single cable tether was used to connect the building and the blimp, it would place stress on the building's frame. The stress from the blimp's load and wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way to the building's base, which was @DATE1 ft. below. Subsequently, another problem emerged. Blimps outside the United States were often filled with hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. After the German blimp, the Hindenburg, caught fire and exploded over @CAPS1, New Jersey, architects became concerned that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building would be a bad idea, as a similar incident in @LOCATION3 city would endanger many more lives. Additionally, natural factors posed an obstacle. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong wind currents. Even if the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, its rear end would move erratically. As a result, blimps now dock on the ground and are held down by weights on @NUM1 sides. Another reason is that docking a blimp at the Empire State Building would be illegal because it would be flying too low to the ground, and this law prohibits blimps from docking on the building. In conclusion, these various obstacles made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
557	15390	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome numerous obstacles. One significant obstacle was that the steel frame of the building needed modification. The load of the dirigible and wind pressure would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. To address this, they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars on modifying the building's framework. In conclusion, these costly modifications were necessary to ensure the building's stability in the face of the potential stress from dirigible docking.
558	15391	6	2	"According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges to enable dirigibles to dock there. They needed to find a way for dirigibles to attach to the building for purposes such as ""refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off"" (∂ 6). Additionally, they had to figure out how to securely attach the mooring mast to the building's top. As the text indicates, attaching a dirigible to the building with just a single wire would add more stress to the building's frame, so they couldn't simply place the mooring mast on top. Due to this, the builders had to modify the foundation to prevent the building from collapsing if a dirigible was attached. Finally, they had to contend with natural factors. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting, and since the building is in a densely - populated city, any mishap could harm many people. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it extremely difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
559	15392	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced extremely difficult obstacles, and in my opinion, their attempt was not successful. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted experts from the @PERSON1 air station, and the navy leader offered a dirigible for testing the mast. However, architects couldn't just place a mooring mast on the building because it would cause stress to the building's frame. Moreover, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was doomed not to fulfill its purpose. It was not safe enough, especially considering that dirigibles from outside @LOCATION2 often used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and having it in the @CAPS1 of downtown New York was a bad idea. In conclusion, these issues made it impossible for the mooring mast to serve its intended function."
560	15393	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced numerous obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. Although the idea was ultimately unsuccessful, it took them a long time to understand the causes and effects of dirigible docking. They spent over sixty thousand dollars on modifying the building. After fixing the building's structure, they discovered that the weather was a hindrance. High winds caused the dirigibles to constantly shift, and there was no safe way to control this shifting. There was also a law against airships flying too low over populated cities. Additionally, dirigibles were very dangerous and highly flammable. In conclusion, building a mooring mast at the Empire State Building was not a viable idea due to these multiple challenges."
561	15394	6	2	In the late 1920s and 1930s, New York architects aimed to revolutionize air travel and position New York as a leader in modern transportation. Their ambitious plans, however, did not align with reality. In an effort to surpass the Chrysler Building, architect Al Smith added an unstable mast to the Empire State Building. This mast was intended as a docking and refueling point for blimps or dirigibles, yet it was more of a publicity stunt than a well - studied project. The primary challenge the builders faced was safety. Most non - US blimps used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. If the German blimp “Hindenburg” had exploded over a densely populated area like New York rather than New Jersey, the consequences would have been far more catastrophic. As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, even if the mast had been successful, weather conditions would have been a major issue. A tethered airship would still swivel around. The US Navy attempted to dock near the mast before a law was passed prohibiting low - flying aircraft, but the wind made their efforts fruitless. Although the architects of the 1920s and 1930s had grand visions, some obstacles were insurmountable.
562	15395	6	2	When the concept of creating a mooring post for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building emerged, engineers failed to recognize several problems. Firstly, dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. The Hindenburg accident demonstrated the horror of a hydrogen - filled dirigible explosion, and the situation would have been far worse if it had occurred @NUM1 stories above the ground. Secondly, violent wind gusts would have made it impossible to dock a dirigible on the building's roof. Using the typical lead weights was neither safe nor practical. Lastly, a pre - existing law made it illegal for airships to fly at such low altitudes over urban areas. Due to these overlooked issues, the plan to create a mooring post for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was unfeasible.
563	15396	6	2	From the excerpt “The Mooring Mast,” it is evident that the architects were oblivious to the problems associated with the mast. Driven by the desire to build the tallest building, Al Smith was blinded to potential risks. The public's eagerness to advance transportation at that time led to a lack of comprehensive analysis of future complications. During the mast's design, paragraph nine noted that “a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of a building... would add stress to the building's frame.” Even in the early stages, it was clear that the mast might not work. Two months later, the building was reframed and the mast was added. On May 6, 1937, the building's owners realized that if an accident similar to the destruction of the 'Hindenburg' happened atop the building, it would be a disaster over densely populated Downtown New York (paragraph @NUM1). Another challenge, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, was nature. High - altitude winds were often unpredictable, posing a great danger to a tethered dirigible that would swivel around the mast. Ultimately, the mooring mast on the Empire State Building did not fulfill its intended purpose. Instead, it has become a tourist attraction. By the end of the 1930s, the idea of dirigibles as future transportation was replaced by airplanes.
564	15397	6	2	The designers and builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when considering allowing dirigibles to dock at the top. The first and most obvious issue was the building's frame. As the article states, “the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof” (@NUM1). A thousand - foot tower would add extra stress to the building's structure. Safety was also a major concern. Most international dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly dangerous gas that could cause a massive explosion if ignited, as demonstrated by the German dirigible Hindenburg. If a similar accident occurred over New York City, many pedestrians could be injured or killed. Wind was another significant obstacle. The winds “were constantly shifting due to violent air currents” (@NUM2), causing the back of the dirigible to “swivel around and around the mooring mast,” which was extremely unsafe. Finally, there was a law that prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas. Combined, these obstacles led to the failure of the idea of using the building as a docking tower.
565	15398	6	2	If the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 had decided to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there, they would have faced numerous obstacles. “Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.” On @DATE1, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION3, New Jersey. The building's owners realized that the situation would have been much worse if it had happened in a place like New York City. Nature itself would have been a major challenge. “The winds on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.” If a dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would move around, making it difficult for passengers to board and disembark. Using a lead weight to stabilize it would mean having a heavy piece of lead hanging over New York City's pedestrians. The final obstacle was “an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.” This law would have prohibited dirigibles from docking on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 and even from approaching it. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the @ORGANIZATION1.
566	15399	6	2	"The Empire State Building stands as one of the tallest structures ever constructed. Owing to its great height, it was unfeasible for a blimp to dock on the mooring mast. An article by @ORGANIZATION1, titled ""The Mooring Mast"", effectively outlines the potential problems blimps might have encountered. It states that ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Indeed, if a blimp attempted to moor there, it would merely spin around the mooring mast. It could also collide with other buildings or damage the mooring mast. Evidently, the builders failed to conduct comprehensive research. Overall, the impracticality of blimp docking at the Empire State Building was a result of these overlooked factors."
567	15400	6	2	When the builders of the Empire State Building aimed to enable dirigibles to dock on the large building, they confronted several obstacles. The first was safety. Most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. As the author noted, nature also presented a formidable and hard - to - avoid obstacle. The wind currents at the building's summit were erratic, posing a significant problem for dirigibles trying to dock. Moreover, a major issue the builders never recognized was that it was illegal. The Empire State Building's height was too low for any aircraft to dock, which could endanger the urban areas below. These were the primary factors that led to the failure of the mooring mast. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles combined to make the dirigible - docking plan unworkable.
568	15401	6	2	The builders lacked a suitable landing area for the dirigible. If the dirigible were to land on the Empire State Building's flat roof, it would exert additional stress on the structure. Financial constraints were also a major hurdle for the builders. As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, nature was the greatest obstacle. The strong winds on top of the building shifted due to violent air currents. This would cause the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast, endangering the safety of people. Additionally, there was a legal obstacle, as flying too low over urban areas was prohibited. In summary, these various challenges made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
569	15402	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced the challenge of constructing a structure with a sufficiently stable top to support a dirigible. However, once the Chrysler Building surpassed the Empire State Building in height, the concept of dirigibles docking there gradually faded into obscurity. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1, Al Smith proposed adding a top or ""hat"" to the building to increase its height. The issue was that instead of dirigibles docking, they would only be positioned next to the building's tip. If Smith had not been so competitive, blimps could have had a proper platform for docking. In the end, Smith's competitiveness and the change in the building's relative height contributed to the demise of the dirigible - docking plan."
570	15403	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building had to engage in extensive deliberation when constructing the building to make it suitable for dirigible docking. First, they needed to assess the building's load - bearing capacity to prevent it from collapsing. Then, they had to ensure the safety of passengers and pedestrians and devise a safe and convenient way for them to enter and exit. Despite the builders' efforts to bring Al Smith's idea to fruition, the plan was not realistic in the eyes of the public, and it had to be abandoned. Nevertheless, this experience serves as a valuable learning opportunity for constructors. In conclusion, although the dirigible - docking plan failed, it offers important lessons for future construction projects.
571	15404	6	2	"According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was the lack of a suitable landing area. As stated, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of suitable landing area."" This was a significant issue as it hindered the modernization of travel with dirigibles. The second problem was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. This posed a threat to the safety of the people, making it unlikely that the risk would be taken to allow foreign dirigibles to visit. The third problem was related to nature and the weather. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the blimps to have unsteady landings as they were thrashed around. This was extremely unsafe and thus became an obstacle for the builders. In conclusion, these multiple challenges made it difficult for the Empire State Building to serve as a docking site for dirigibles."
572	15405	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the possible danger of objects falling on the building. Additionally, the high flammability of hydrogen meant that the dirigible could explode, endangering anyone in the vicinity. Moreover, the Empire State Building might not be strong enough to withstand the movement caused by the dirigibles. The back - side movement due to dangerous winds could potentially cause the dirigible to pull off part of the building, endangering nearby pedestrians. In conclusion, these risks and structural concerns made it a challenging task to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
573	15406	6	2	When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned to be a prominent structure in the world. However, during its planning phase, the new Chrysler Building was being constructed at Forty - Second Street and an unnamed avenue in New York. Before the Empire State Building's construction began, Al Smith was determined to outdo it. The Empire State Building was intended to have a mooring mast at its top for docking dirigibles or zeppelins. But the builders faced obstacles in making this a reality. In conclusion, the pre - construction competition and the complexity of incorporating a mooring mast presented challenges for the Empire State Building's builders in allowing dirigibles to dock.
574	15407	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One such obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City. Another issue was that the architects were unable to install a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's flat roof. A dirigible moored at the top of the building with a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. However, the most significant obstacle was nature. The wind on top of the building constantly shifted due to violent air currents, causing the back of the tethered dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. In conclusion, these various obstacles made it very difficult for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
575	15408	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many challenges in enabling dirigibles to dock. When a dirigible was attached to the building by a single cable, the combination of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure atop the massive structure added excessive stress to the building's framework. To address this, the builders had to spend over sixty thousand dollars on modifying the building's frame. Safety was another major concern. Many dirigibles from outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, which made the owners realize the potential severity of an accident, similar to the Hindenburg disaster, over a densely populated area. High wind speeds also posed a problem. Even when docked to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would swing violently due to the strong winds at a significant height. Usually, dirigibles could be weighted down with lead weights in a field, but this was neither practical nor safe at the Empire State Building as the weights would dangle above pedestrians. Additionally, there was already a law against airships at certain heights in urban areas, and docking a dirigible at the building would violate it. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there.
576	15409	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @PERSON1, the @ORGANIZATION1 builders faced obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles, or blimps, to dock at the location. Firstly, a suitable landing area, a Mooring Mast, was required. However, prior to constructing the mast, “The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.” Workers framed the building up to the 85th floor, but the roof had to be completed before mast - framing could occur. Before moving to the next project stage, the architects suddenly recognized the potential danger and disaster of the endeavor. The “Hindenburg” incident demonstrated why the plan couldn't proceed. The area around the building was densely populated, and considering the violent air currents, a dirigible docking there had a high probability of causing a disaster over New York City. Although the project was a great idea for future transportation, it was simply too risky.
577	15410	6	2	According to the excerpt, the Empire State Building builders encountered numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Safety was the main issue. When the front of the dirigible was masted to the building, the back would move around. Another significant problem was that dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. Additionally, it was illegal for airships to fly so low over urban areas. Moreover, wind prevented dirigibles from getting close enough to the building. In conclusion, these obstacles made it very difficult for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
578	15411	6	2	When attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders were confronted with major obstacles. The first issue pertained to the structure. They discovered that “the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted... to the building's foundation.” As a result, the builders spent over @MONEY1 on modifying the building. Although they managed to rectify the building's framework, subsequent obstacles proved insurmountable. After the 1937 Hindenburg accident, “the owners of the Empire @CAPS1 Building realized how much worse that accident could have been” if the dirigible had exploded over New York City. The safety of the city became a concern, and until blimps were less flammable, it was not reasonable to take the risk of housing them in densely - populated areas. The final obstacle to the success of the mooring mast was “nature itself.” The violent winds around the 101st and 102nd floors would spin dirigibles around the mooring mast, which was “neither practical nor safe.” Overall, these obstacles led to the failure of the mooring mast project.
579	15412	6	2	Architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's roof as it would add stress to the building's frames. Therefore, they had to modify and strengthen the frames. Most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, which could endanger the population of New York. The greatest obstacle was nature. The constantly shifting winds made the back of the dirigible swivel around the mooring mast, posing a risk to pedestrians below. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In conclusion, these factors combined made it impossible for dirigibles to moor at the building.
580	15413	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the @CAPS1 faced significant obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. “The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.” The reason is that “winds atop the building were always changing due to the violent air currents.” Even if a dirigible were tethered, it would swivel around, dangling high above street pedestrians. This was neither practical nor safe. Proceeding with docking dirigibles atop the building would be extremely dangerous. In summary, these were the obstacles the builders had to face.
581	15414	6	2	In the excerpt, the Empire State Building's builders encountered numerous obstacles when aiming to enable dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a building with a mooring mast on top, attached by a single cable to a dirigible, would place additional stress on the building's frame. Another was the need to modify the building's structure to support the mast. In conclusion, these challenges made it difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
582	15415	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2, the author recounted the hurdles the Empire State Building's builders faced while trying to make dirigible docking possible. Al Smith, a four - term governor of New York, led the construction efforts after his tenure. He envisioned the building's top as having a “higher Calling,” suitable for an era of transportation that was then just a dream of aviation pioneers. However, obstacles emerged. The first was the lack of suitable space in New York City; they would have to clear about four blocks in the busy city. Architects and engineers consulted experts, but it didn't go well. Sixty thousand dollars was spent on modifying the building's framework. The building ended up with 102 floors, including a glassed - in observation area on the 101st floor. Ultimately, nature proved to be the greatest obstacle, bringing an end to the ambitious plan.
583	15416	6	2	In 1929, the idea of docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building didn't seem far - fetched. But when they tried to place a mooring mast on the thousand - foot building, problems arose quickly. The construction of the building was the first problem. The Empire State Building was not built to hold a thousand - foot dirigible; the added weight would stress the building's frame. Al Smith, the four - term governor of New York, invested sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the building's support as a “quick fix.” Even so, safety remained a major concern. Dirigibles used hydrogen for weight reduction, and hydrogen is highly flammable, unlike helium. The risk of a dirigible explosion putting thousands of lives at stake was not worth it, as the people of New York didn't want a repeat of the Hindenburg disaster. Nature was another major issue. Air currents at a thousand feet are uncontrollable, causing a tethered dirigible to swivel too much to be safe. In the end, the idea was unfeasible. The mast on the Empire State Building and the 102nd floor exist but are out of use due to safety risks to the public.
584	15417	6	2	When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced multiple obstacles. As often happens, the plan seemed easier in theory than in practice. The building's steel frame needed to be modified and strengthened because it was not originally built to support a thousand - foot dirigible; the added weight would stress the frame. Al Smith, the four - term governor of New York, spent sixty thousand dollars on this. Safety was still a major concern. Most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, unlike helium. The risk of a repeat of the Hindenburg disaster over New York City was unacceptable. Nature also posed a problem; air currents at a thousand feet are uncontrollable, making a dirigible swivel too much even when tethered. In conclusion, these factors made the plan unsafe and ultimately led to the features of the mast and the 102nd floor remaining unused.
585	15418	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when trying to construct a mast for docking dirigibles. Safety was a primary reason the mast was never built. Most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, and the builders didn't want to risk a Hindenburg - like accident in densely populated New York City. Nature also presented a challenge, as the constantly changing winds on top of the building due to violent air currents were a threat. Additionally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. In the end, constructing a dirigible mast was neither practical nor safe, so the project was abandoned.
586	15419	6	2	Mooring dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building would be highly unfeasible. One reason is that most dirigibles arriving at this potential dock from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and after the Hindenburg explosion, having hydrogen - filled dirigibles in a densely populated area like New York City was far too dangerous. Another significant issue was the climate. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. When the winds changed rapidly, the back of the dirigible would swing freely, potentially hitting nearby buildings or swinging out of control and breaking loose from the mooring. Lastly, docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building would violate the law. Existing regulations prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, and docking at the building would place the dirigible at an impermissibly low altitude. In conclusion, these multiple factors made it impossible for the Empire State Building to have a dock for dirigibles.
587	15420	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered substantial obstacles when considering adding a mooring mast. They could not simply install a mooring mast on top of the building due to the framework. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure needed to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. To accommodate this new situation, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened. The cost of these modifications to the building's framework was over sixty thousand dollars. The architects designed a tower made of shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel that would be illuminated from the sides, with a stepped - back design that mimicked the overall shape of the building. The capital rocket - shape mast would have four shiny - aluminum wings at its corners and rise to a conical roof housing the mooring arm. In conclusion, the challenges and costs associated with these modifications were significant hurdles for the builders.
588	15421	6	2	"In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles while trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. The author states that ""The greatest reason was one of safety."" Dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, and it was too risky to have them in a densely populated area. Wind and nature also presented an obstacle. The excerpt mentions that ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" creating a safety problem. The wind would sway the dirigible back and forth, and using weights to stabilize the back would be dangerous for pedestrians below. The author explains that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose"" because it was neither practical nor safe. In conclusion, these safety and environmental factors ultimately made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
589	15422	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems when attempting to build a mooring system for dirigibles. Firstly, tying the dirigible to the mast with a single cable tether would ""stress the building's frame."" As the author states in paragraph @NUM1, the current foundation could not support the wind pressure and the weight of the dirigible, so the frame had to be strengthened and modified. Another problem occurred when ""Columbia"" delivered newspapers to the Empire State Building. The mooring equipment was not installed due to previous issues with the design, laws, and common - sense considerations during construction. Additionally, there was a lack of awareness of the practical realities regarding the building's effectiveness. In conclusion, these various problems collectively hindered the successful implementation of a dirigible mooring system at the Empire State Building."
590	15423	6	2	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Løsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles. One major obstacle was safety. They were planning to build a mooring mast on the top of the building for blimps to stop and refuel. However, as Marcia Løsted writes, ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S.A used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" An explosion in New York would endanger many lives. Another obstacle was related to strength. Since the mooring mast was intended for blimps, ""a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress from the blimps' load required the steel frame of the Empire State Building to be modified and strengthened. In conclusion, these safety and structural challenges made the construction of the mooring mast a difficult task for the builders."
591	15424	6	2	The creators of the Mooring mast encountered numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock. These challenges included safety concerns, the forces of nature, and pre - existing laws. Most dirigibles from outside the United States utilized hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. The most significant obstacle was nature. The ever - changing winds at the top could cause dirigibles to crash into the mast. An existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban cities. Despite all the effort put into the mast, it was never able to reach its full potential.
592	15425	6	2	The Empire State Building was not a suitable location for attaching a blimp. One factor contributing to its unsuitability was safety. In countries other than the @PERSON1, dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. Given that hydrogen is extremely flammable, it is ill - advised to fly it over densely populated areas. Another hurdle the architects had to overcome was the wind speed at that altitude. The constantly changing winds meant that the blimp would need to be tied down at both the front and back. Additionally, they had to ensure that the mooring mast was tall enough to comply with the law against low - flying over urban areas. The most significant problem was that the plans were never completed. Even after spending @NUM1 dollars on modifications, the building remained unfinished.
593	15426	6	2	The challenge that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there was that they could not attach a single piece to the top of the building. Instead, they had to assemble it piece by piece. Otherwise, the building would be under so much stress that it might collapse.
594	15427	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building confronted multiple obstacles while trying to make it possible for dirigibles to dock on the mast. For instance, when they decided to construct the mast, they were aware that it could not simply be placed on the roof. It had to be attached to the building's foundation because the dirigible would impose stress on the building's frame. Moreover, after the Hindenburg disaster, the builders recognized that the hydrogen inside the dirigible is highly flammable. An explosion of a dirigible over New York City would endanger not only those on the dirigible but also people on the ground. Finally, the most formidable obstacle was nature itself. The strong winds at the top of the building would have made the dirigible swivel around the mast. Due to these many obstacles, no dirigibles were ever able to land at the Empire State Building.
595	15428	6	2	Undertaking a large - scale construction project like the Empire State Building involves facing numerous obstacles, especially when it comes to enabling the docking of dirigibles or blimps. Safety was a major concern. The builders had to ensure that it was safe for blimps to dock and take off, as well as safe for them to fly. Since most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen, which is highly flammable, a blimp that could explode at any moment would put people at risk. Another challenge was building the mooring mast for docking. The violent air currents on top of the building caused the winds to shift constantly. As a result, the blimp could not hold properly to the mast and would move around excessively, making it neither safe nor practical. Although these are common obstacles faced by many builders, the ones of the Empire State Building managed to overcome them effectively.
596	15429	6	2	The designers of the Empire State Building intended to install a mooring mast on its summit. However, their design overlooked potential issues. A significant problem was safety. After the German dirigible Hindenburg exploded in New Jersey, they recognized that a similar incident over New York would have been far more disastrous. Additionally, natural factors presented challenges. Air currents could cause the dirigible to sway violently on top of the building. Moreover, attempting this was illegal as existing laws prohibited ships from flying too low over urban areas. All these factors made it extremely difficult to install a mast on the Empire State Building.
597	15430	6	2	"The Empire State Building's builders encountered hurdles related to construction, safety, and nature that prevented dirigibles from docking there. Dirigibles, or blimps, were large passenger - carrying balloons that required extensive landing areas. To use dirigibles for transportation, architects had to design a proper mooring mast. But the weight and pressure of a blimp on a mast would stress the building's frame. The Empire State Building's builders had to make ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to the framework. Besides being labor - intensive and costly, there were safety concerns. As seen with the German blimp ""Hindenburg,"" hydrogen - powered dirigibles are ""highly flammable."" An incident involving a dirigible over the Empire State Building in New York would endanger the large local population. Flying too low over the city was also unsafe and illegal according to the law, making blimp docking unfeasible. Lastly, nature was an obstacle. ""Forceful winds"" could cause the back of the ship to swivel, potentially puncturing it on the sharp spires. Lead weights dangling over pedestrians were also unsafe. These challenges made it difficult to create docking gear for dirigibles on the building."
598	15431	6	2	"According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the Empire State Building's builders faced many challenges while aiming to create the world's tallest building. They added hundreds of feet to the building to enable dirigible docking. In competition with the Chrysler Building, Al Smith announced that the Empire State Building would reach 1,250 feet, surpassing the Chrysler Building by @NUM1 feet. Al Smith was eager to build the world's tallest building and even planned a landing spot for dirigibles. However, @ORGANIZATION2's idea didn't go as planned. Instead, the @CAPS1 meant for dirigible passengers became the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden."
599	15432	6	2	"The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 details the obstacles and attempts of builders trying to enable dirigible docking at the top of the Empire State Building. Al Smith, a four - term governor of New York, planned the Empire State Building after leaving office. He was competitive and knew the building was close to being the world's tallest. In 1929, he announced the building would be 1,250 feet, adding a distinctive top or ""hat."" The plan was to add a mooring mast and observation decks to dock dirigibles or blimps. Later, architects found that a thousand - foot dirigible moored by one cable at the top would stress the building's frame. The load of a dirigible and wind pressure would reach the building's foundation. The efforts on the framework and observation decks failed as dirigible docking was neither practical nor safe. By the late 1930s, the idea was abandoned, but the Empire State Building's observation deck remains a popular New York attraction."
600	15433	6	2	During the Empire State Building's rise to fame for its height, its @CAPS1, Al Smith, faced multiple obstacles in completing the mooring mast. From the start of construction, the mooring mast design was flawed. Al Smith recognized this even before finalizing the building process. After completing the mooring mast, there were problems. Dirigibles had trouble docking due to wind and weather conditions, and they struggled to stay stationary once docked. Fuel was another issue; after the Hindenburg crash, dirigibles had to use helium instead of the more flammable hydrogen. Laws banning airships from flying low over urban areas also contributed to the mooring mast's failure. Eventually, airplanes replaced dirigibles, and the mooring mast was retired. Due to these obstacles, Al Smith gave up on the mooring mast but still helped the Empire State Building set the record for the highest building.
601	15434	6	2	The construction of dirigibles' mooring facilities on the Empire State Building encountered multiple significant challenges. One major issue was the strong wind at high altitudes. Given the large size of dirigibles, the wind generated substantial resistance, causing them to sway from the rear. Another critical problem was that dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. In the event of an accident, especially considering the large number of people on the ground nearby, the consequences could be disastrous. Due to these formidable obstacles, the intended use of the mooring facilities faced great difficulties.
602	15435	6	2	"When constructing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the builders confronted several obstacles. They couldn't simply place the mooring mast on the building; instead, they had to modify and strengthen the building's steel frame to support it, as the steel frame needed adjustment to accommodate the new addition. As one source stated, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation."" Another issue was the potential danger in case of an accident similar to the Hindenburg. With more people in the vicinity, the risk of injury from a fire was much higher. ""The greatest obstacle of the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" according to a source. The wind currents above the building changed due to ""violent air currents."" Dirigibles require weights at the back, but at the Empire State Building, these weights would dangle above pedestrians, which was neither practical nor safe. Additionally, blimps, like the Los Angeles, couldn't get close to the mast because of the wind. As a result, the mooring mast has remained unused since then."
603	15436	6	2	"The construction workers of the Empire State Building aimed to build a dirigible dock on the world - tallest building at that time, yet numerous problems emerged during the process. To support the dirigible dock, the building's structure had to bear its weight. As mentioned, ""The steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this situation. over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" The 102 - story building was initially expected to mark the new age of aviation travel. However, workers also realized that dirigibles outside a certain area were highly flammable as they contained hydrogen. A fire on top of the building in New York City would be catastrophic. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" There are strong and violent winds at the building's top, and a blimp out of control due to the wind would pose a hazard to hundreds of pedestrians in New York City. Moreover, there is a law prohibiting low - flying aircraft over populated areas. Although the idea of a mooring dock was good, it was neither practical nor safe, and many potential disasters could have occurred if it had been in use."
604	15437	6	2	The builders faced numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirgibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Firstly, a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the building's top with a single cable tether would exert excessive stress on the building's frame. Thus, major adjustments were necessary before the mooring mast could be installed. Secondly, they had to design and construct a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower. This tower was to be illuminated from within and have a stepped - back design that mimicked the overall shape of the building. Finally, the mast, with a steel skeleton and clad in stainless steel and glass windows, needed to be built and erected. These challenges made the task of installing a mooring mast on the Empire State Building extremely difficult.
605	15438	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. These included docking difficulties, natural factors, and the construction of dirigibles, along with an existing law against airships. Docking dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building would impose a large amount of stress on the building, and the builders had to spend sixty thousand dollars on modifications. The construction of dirigibles, especially those from outside the United States, was a safety concern as they used highly flammable hydrogen. The Hindenburg accident on May 6, 1937, demonstrated the potential risk in a densely populated area like New York. Nature was the greatest obstacle; violent air currents would cause the back of the airship to spin around the mooring mast during docking. Additionally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas. Due to these combined obstacles, the plan to use the Empire State Building for dirigible docking faced insurmountable challenges.
606	15439	6	2	When constructing the Empire State Building, the developers aimed to maintain its status as the tallest building in New York. They made modifications to ensure it would not be surpassed by the Chrysler Building. Initially, the building was not intended to have a mooring mast. Subsequently, the Empire State Building had to be reframed. Then, the government prohibited low - flying aircraft, and commercial airliners came to dominate the aviation industry. It was too dangerous for dirigibles to dock because strong air currents could blow them off - course, leading to accidents similar to the Hindenburg disaster.
607	15440	6	2	In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's excerpt, “The Mooring Mast,” the builders encountered numerous obstacles while constructing a dirigible dock on top of the Empire State Building. One significant obstacle was the building's height. The increased height meant more extensive framework, greater material requirements, and heightened safety hazards. Another challenge was @ORGANIZATION3 safety. After constructing a relatively secure building, the workers recognized that a densely populated area like downtown New York would be a risky location in case of an accident. Nature was the most formidable obstacle. It was unpredictable, and the winds would whip the rear of the dirigible, making it unsafe and unstable for passengers. These were the key obstacles the builders faced when constructing the famous mooring mast.
608	15441	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered several obstacles to achieve their goal of enabling dirigibles to land and board at the building. One obstacle was the limited use of dirigibles in New York City and the shortage of suitable landing areas. However, the use of dirigibles for the mooring mast was successful. Despite the challenges, they managed to reach a point where this aspect of the building's functionality was achievable.
609	15442	6	2	According to the article “The Mooring Mast,” the builders of the Empire State Building confronted multiple challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One challenge was the lack of a suitable landing area. As stated, “The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area.” Since dirigibles require space for landing and maneuvering, this was a significant hurdle for the builders. Another challenge was creating a practical docking arrangement. The statement “one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement” indicates that a practical solution had not yet been found. Finally, safety was a major concern. The mention “... are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast” shows that ensuring the safety of docking dirigibles remained a challenge. In summary, the builders faced difficulties related to landing areas, practicality, and safety.
610	15443	6	2	Although the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building seems appealing, it is unfeasible due to numerous obstacles. As described, “a @DATE1 ft dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.” Violent winds, caused by ever - changing air currents, are also a major obstacle. Moreover, having a dirigible dangling above street pedestrians poses a significant safety risk. The most critical obstacle is the legal restriction on airships flying low over urban areas, which makes it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach it. While it could potentially attract more tourists, the numerous obstacles make this idea unrealistic.
611	15444	6	2	"As per ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building's builders encountered three significant obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock. Public - safety concerns were the first hurdle. Dirigibles from outside the United States utilized hydrogen, a highly flammable substance. A mishap in a densely - populated area such as New York could lead to a catastrophe. The second obstacle was the violent winds on the building's summit. Employing lead weights to secure dirigibles was impractical as they would dangle above street pedestrians. A mistake could send these heavy weights crashing down, causing destruction. The third obstacle was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law rendered the concept of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building illegal and unfeasible."
612	15445	6	2	"According to the excerpt, the Empire State Building's builders faced numerous challenges in enabling dirigibles to dock. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""the greatest reason was safety."" The primary issue was that blimps used highly flammable hydrogen. An accident in the heavily - populated downtown @CAPS1 would have been tragic. Nature also posed a major obstacle, as ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Additionally, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which further complicated the situation. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
613	15446	6	2	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building's builders confronted many obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the destruction of the German dirigible in New Jersey made the architects of the Empire State Building aware of the associated risks. Another challenge was the weather. The winds on the building's top constantly shifted due to violent air currents, affecting the use of the mooring mast. A practical hindrance was the law against airships. The law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. These were some of the numerous obstacles that prevented the effective use of the mooring mast at the Empire State Building."
614	15447	6	2	"In theory, constructing a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a great concept, but in reality, it did not succeed. There are multiple reasons why dirigibles could not be docked there. For instance, ""Most dirgibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of Helium"" (paragraph @NUM1). Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and an accident in a densely - populated city like New York could be catastrophic. The climate around the Empire State Building was perhaps the most dangerous obstacle. There are constant, powerful, and shifting winds due to the different air currents the building generates. Even if a dirigible could dock, it would be blown around. Usually, dirigibles moored in open fields are weighted with lead weights at the back, but this is too dangerous over a crowded city. Lastly, ""there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" (paragraph @NUM2). In conclusion, these factors combined made dirigible docking at the Empire State Building unworkable."
615	15448	6	2	"The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was doomed to fail in fulfilling its intended purpose. In the short excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, several obstacles were clearly identified as to why the mast was a flawed idea. The construction of the mast was rushed. Al Smith, realizing he was close to losing the title of the world's tallest building, quickly conceived the idea of the mast. Problems emerged rapidly. The first problem was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith claimed passengers could safely swing in the breeze, but this issue was overlooked. As the mast's construction continued, other problems arose. The most significant problem, which should have been considered beforehand, was nature. The winds at the building's height were terrible, and architects soon realized landing would be a major challenge. The mast was still under consideration, and architects and engineers did their best to make it work until they encountered a law. It is illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law marked the end of Al Smith's idea, and by the late 1930s, the notion of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly faded away."
616	15449	6	2	"The Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. One major hurdle was its size. The Empire State Building was in intense competition with the Chrysler Building. Some viewpoints held that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, as the reasons should have been obvious before its construction."" Additionally, the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City hindered the expanded use of dirigibles. A mooring mast was added, but the construction of the Empire State Building was fraught with many trials and tribulations. In the end, these difficulties prevented dirigibles from effectively docking at the building."
617	15450	6	2	"The construction team of the Empire State Building grappled with multiple obstacles that precluded dirigibles from docking. One significant issue was the building's original design. It had to be completely overhauled to accommodate dirigible landings. As stated, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel - frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to handle this new situation"" (@NUM1). Over sixty thousand dollars was spent on renovating the redesigned, chrome - nickel stainless steel tower. Another challenge was safety. A dirigible accident in New York City could have cost thousands of lives. The incident of the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, made the building's owners realize the potential disaster if it had occurred over a densely populated area like downtown New York (@NUM2). The most formidable obstacle was the weather. Dirigibles were highly susceptible to bad weather. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast"" (@NUM3). This was extremely unsafe given New York City's dense population. A dirigible's excessive swiveling could lead to it hitting another building or crashing. Due to these many difficulties, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never put to use."
618	15451	6	2	"During the construction of the Empire State Building, architects and engineers faced several problems. One problem was the need to reconstruct the building's framework. To allow dirigibles to land, a complete redesign was necessary. As noted, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel - frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Another issue was the wind currents. The wind at the building's tip was so strong that if a dirigible were docked to the mooring mast, it would rotate according to the wind. The final problem was a law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areas. These were some of the many challenges the building team of the Empire State Building had to confront, ultimately making it difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking."
619	15452	6	2	In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles. They failed to consider the potential risks to dirigibles and the implications of the building's height. One obstacle was the risk associated with dirigibles. For instance, dirigibles could be highly flammable like the Hindenburg. The second obstacle was the building's height, which caused strong wind currents. The builders tried to overcome these obstacles, but there were too many. In conclusion, these numerous challenges prevented the successful docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
620	15453	6	2	The efforts of the Empire State Building's builders to allow dirigibles to dock were fraught with consequences. One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City. Architects couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof because a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable would add stress to the building's frame. The most significant obstacle was nature. Violent air currents caused the winds on top of the building to constantly shift. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up due to strong winds. In summary, these obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building.
621	15454	6	2	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. Issues included the building's structure, wind and weather conditions, and passenger safety. The steel frame of the 102 - floor Empire State Building, which had a stainless - steel skeleton, would need modification and strengthening to accommodate the new docking function. The winds on the building's top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the back of the dirigible to swivel. Lead weights were required to hold the dirigible down, but this was deemed unsafe. Additionally, the safety of passengers was at risk as the complete dirigible mooring equipment was never installed, and there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Due to these many obstacles, dirigibles never moored on the Empire State Building.
622	15455	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building had the idea of docking dirigibles on its top, but they faced several problems. One significant impediment was the laws regarding aircraft. There was a law that restricted aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. Another problem was the safety risks associated with docking dirigibles. Dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, an extremely flammable gas. After the explosion of the German dirigible Hindenburg, the builders recognized the high risk of accidents. Mother nature presented the biggest obstacle. The height of the Empire State Building led to high - speed winds that would toss the end of any dirigible around the mooring. Realizing all these risks, the builders abandoned the idea of docking dirigibles.
623	15456	6	2	"The Empire State Building was designed to be the world's tallest building. Governor Al Smith believed it should be more than just an ornamental structure, as he stated in his comments in paragraph three. He envisioned the building being equipped for the age of transportation and creating a new attraction by allowing dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith saw a great opportunity in this idea. When asked about the Mooring Mast idea, he said, ""It's on the Level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now."" However, little did they know that the builders would face numerous obstacles. As explained in paragraph thirteen, the Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building was ultimately unable to fulfill its intended purpose."
624	15457	6	2	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Løsted, the author details the many challenges architects faced when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock. These new challenges often seemed nearly insurmountable. The height of the building, the weight of the dirigible against the structure, and the high flammability of dirigibles were among the numerous obstacles. The building's height was a major issue. Pilots found it extremely difficult to safely maneuver around buildings, especially in a city with many structures. Unpredictable winds meant dirigibles could be blown into buildings at any time, and there was a law stating that it would be illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. Another problem was the high flammability of dirigibles. Most dirigibles from other countries were made with hydrogen instead of helium. After another dirigible caught fire, people realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. The most significant problem was the weight of the dirigibles on the tall building. Architects recognized that the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, which was unsafe for passengers unloading and people in the building. Overall, the challenges were too great for the architects to overcome."
625	15458	6	2	The engineers and constructors of the Empire State Building faced substantial and overwhelming complications when designing the building to allow dirigible or blimp dockings. Initially, from their original plan, they had to modify the building because they discovered that another building was taller. They had to quickly come up with a solution. Secondly, after the Hindenburg disaster, authorities realized the danger of zeppelins flying over urban areas and enacted a law against it, effectively scrapping the docking idea. To make matters worse, the violent gusts of air and updrafts made docking on the Empire State Building unsafe for passengers. Due to these challenges, the plan to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building was not feasible.
626	15459	6	2	"The construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast for dirigibles was fraught with difficulties. Architect Al Smith, during the 1920s when building the world's tallest structure, encountered numerous problems as detailed in ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted. Safety was a primary concern. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. An explosion of a dirigible high above the densely - populated area would result in significant casualties. ""Nature itself"" was another major obstacle. Violent air currents caused the winds on top of the building to constantly shift, making it extremely difficult for dirigibles to land on the mooring mast as the ship would be shifted by the winds. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. By the late 1930s, the entire idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was abandoned, as the builders faced insurmountable obstacles in creating the mooring mast."
627	15460	6	2	When @CAPS1 attempted to construct a mooring mast, they encountered multiple problems. Safety was the primary concern. Since most blimps outside @LOCATION1 used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium, there were significant risks. After the Hindenburg blimp was destroyed by fire, people in @CAPS1 worried that a similar incident could occur near the Empire State Building. There was also a legal issue; at that time, it was illegal to fly an airship too low over urban areas. During tests, heavy winds prevented some blimps from getting close enough to the mooring mast. This made it impossible to tie the blimps up and disembark passengers. Moreover, there was a fear that the wind could blow the blimp onto sharp parts of other buildings, puncturing it. Although the idea of a blimp docking station and mooring mast was good, the numerous obstacles made it unfeasible for a successful implementation.
628	15461	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One significant issue was the violent air currents at the building's top. Even if a dirigible managed to dock successfully, the wind would cause the back end of the dirigible to thrash around. In the event that the blimp became uncontrollable, it could crash into another building and fall onto the downtown New @CAPS1 streets below. Adding weights to the end of the blimp could potentially address this problem, but as @CAPS2 pointed out, while dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down with lead weights, doing so at the Empire State Building, where the weights would dangle above pedestrians, was neither practical nor safe. Another major concern was the high flammability of dirigibles. The destruction of the German blimp, the Hindenburg, served as a harsh reminder, leading the builders to realize that their plan might not be viable. In conclusion, these obstacles made the prospect of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building extremely difficult.
629	15462	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Dirigibles were essentially large steel - framed balloons with cotton fabric envelopes filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. As the builders tried to install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof, they discovered that a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable tether would add stress to the building frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way to the nearly eleven - hundred - foot - deep foundation. Even though the dirigible is as light as air, it could still damage the building's frame. Another significant obstacle was the destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire in @LOCATION1, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937. The owner of the Empire State Building recognized that if such an accident occurred in a populated area like downtown New York, the consequences would be far more severe. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen. Despite not being able to install moors on the building, the Empire State Building still became the world's tallest building."
630	15463	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One of the main challenges was nature. Violent air currents caused the winds at the top of the building to constantly shift. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around due to the wind. Another obstacle was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach it. In conclusion, these obstacles made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to implement the plan of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
631	15464	6	2	An analysis of the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2 reveals that the construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was fraught with challenges. Firstly, the builders had to determine how to transfer the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressures to the building's foundation. Additionally, they needed to modify and strengthen the building's steel frame to support the mooring mast. After making these modifications and installing the mast, further issues emerged. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, posing a significant fire risk above New York. The constantly shifting winds were also a major hurdle. They made it difficult for dirigibles to approach the mast, and even if they could reach it, the back of the dirigibles would swivel around. In open fields, dirigibles could be weighted down with lead weights, but at the Empire State Building, this would be dangerous as they would dangle above pedestrians. Due to these numerous obstacles, the mooring mast was never used.
632	15465	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building aimed to allow dirigibles to dock there, but the building's location presented insurmountable problems. Dirigibles would dock 1,250 feet above one of the world's busiest cities, leading to three significant issues. First, dirigibles used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. An explosion above downtown New York would cause many casualties, so few people would support dirigible docking. Had the building not been in a densely populated area, this problem might not have arisen. Second, the high - altitude winds in New York City are violent and constantly changing. These winds make it difficult for conductors to dock dirigibles and could cause the dirigibles to collide with objects and burst, endangering the people below. A location with more stable wind currents would have been more suitable. Third, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Even if the other problems were resolved, this law prohibited the docking plan. As the author noted, the Empire State Building was thus doomed to never serve its intended purpose for dirigible docking.
633	15466	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple challenges when trying to enable dirigible docking. Success would have made the building a major aviation accommodation for trans - Atlantic and future routes. To achieve this, a mooring mast had to be constructed on top of the building. This was no simple task; the building's frame needed modification to withstand the stress from the dirigible on the mast. Over sixty thousand dollars were spent on adjusting the framework. After the framework adjustment, architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless - steel tower, illuminated from within, to serve as the mast. Before mast construction, the building's roof had to be completed. Once the roof was built, the mooring mast with its own steel skeleton was added. However, upon project completion, the building's owners realized that dirigible docking would be far too dangerous. Despite all the arduous work on the mooring mast, it became evident that it would never be used for its original purpose.
634	15467	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One issue was that most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. This was a significant concern, as docking these dirigibles in a densely populated area like downtown New York would be extremely dangerous. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would cause dirigibles to swivel, and using lead weights to stabilize them high above pedestrians on the street was both impractical and unsafe. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or approach the area. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up because of strong winds. This direct observation likely eroded confidence in the plan. Overall, these various obstacles made it clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building would have been a very difficult task.
635	15468	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges when trying to enable dirigible docking. A major obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles were quite large; some were as long as one thousand feet, equivalent to four blocks in New York City. This size made it difficult for the builders to determine where to place the dirigibles. The absence of an appropriate landing space presented a significant hurdle in their plan to allow dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
636	15469	6	2	According to the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, multiple factors hindered dirigibles from docking at the mooring mast. When the German dirigible “Hindenburg” caught fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building recognized how much more disastrous the accident could have been if it had occurred over a densely - populated area like downtown New York (paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle was the existing law prohibiting low - flying airships in urban areas, which made it “illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area” (paragraph @NUM2). The most significant obstacle, however, was nature. The high - altitude winds “constantly shifted due to violent air currents,” causing the back of the ship to swivel and posing a risk to passengers and pedestrians below. All these factors led to the project's non - fulfillment in New York.
637	15470	6	2	In a competition with the architects building the Chrysler Building, Al Smith aimed to construct a taller building with a specific purpose: to dock dirigibles on a mooring mast. This idea seemed promising as it involved integrating a new and popular mode of transportation into New York City. Initially, the architects were aware that “A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.” They assumed they had fixed the problem within the given time. But upon completion, they knew that “The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to fulfill its purpose...” Most problems did not stem from the building itself but from the practicality of having a dirigible land in a large, crowded city. For instance, most dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and the proximity of other buildings to the blimps could cause them to burn. Overall, while the idea was good in theory, it could never be executed. Only two dirigibles ever docked there, and it has remained unused since.
638	15471	6	2	Despite the builders' earnest efforts to turn their dream into reality, several obstacles prevented this. The primary obstacles they faced were weather, the law, and safety concerns. The weather at the building's top was extremely windy, and strong winds would create major problems for dirigibles attempting to land. “Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.” Another issue was a law that restricted aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. Since New York is an urban area, dirigibles were not allowed to fly anywhere near the Empire State Building. Safety was also a major concern. Many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. A potential explosion over New York could lead to a catastrophe, as evidenced by the accident where “the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937...” These obstacles were significant and could not be ignored, ultimately preventing the intended use of the mooring mast.
639	15472	6	2	The Empire State Building builders encountered several obstacles. One was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, as stated in @CAPS1 @NUM1. Another was nature. The winds on top of the building constantly shifted due to violent air currents. Mooring a dirigible at the top of the building with a cable tether would have added stress to the building, necessitating a stronger building structure. These challenges had to be considered by the builders and affected the feasibility of their plans.
640	15473	6	2	The builders faced challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. They could not simply install a mooring mast on top of the building because it would have added excessive stress to the building's frame, potentially leading to its collapse over time. As the excerpt stated, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be “modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.” After the builders completed framing the building up to the eighty - fifth floor, they began framing the rooftop to create an area for the mooring mast. Once the rooftop framing was finished, they built the mooring mast on it. Then, they faced the challenge of framing the mooring mast, which they did using a steel skeleton. These challenges were part of the builders' efforts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
641	15474	6	2	The construction team of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when aiming to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. Firstly, mooring dirigibles, which could be up to a thousand feet long, on the building's top would impose additional stress on the building's frame. As a result, the steel frame had to be strengthened and modified at a cost exceeding sixty thousand dollars. After the building's completion, another issue emerged: it was unsafe to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This meant that an accident similar to the Hindenburg disaster could occur over the densely populated downtown area of New York. Additionally, the shifting winds on the building's top were too strong for the dirigibles, causing them to swivel around the mooring mast. Along with an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, these challenges led to only one dirigible ever being moored at the Empire State Building.
642	15475	6	2	Implementing radical ideas often comes with challenges. When the builders of the Empire State Building undertook the task of allowing dirigibles, or zeppelins, to dock atop the building, they faced issues typical of new concepts. The high - altitude winds at the Empire State Building made the situation dangerous for blimps and people on the ground. As stated, “Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast”. Another obstacle was the US government's laws. An existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, as mentioned: “The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.” These were the difficulties the builders encountered during the construction of the Empire State Building's mast.
643	15476	6	2	According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the danger of dirigibles when not handled properly. Given that the building was in a densely populated area, many people could lose their lives in case of an accident. As the author states in paragraph @NUM1, “Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.” Wind was also a problem. The wind at that height was very strong, as described in paragraph @NUM2: “Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.” Another obstacle was the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Paragraph @NUM3 states, “This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even a produced area...” In the end, all these obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
644	15477	6	2	The builders of the mooring mast planned the construction meticulously but failed to consider the potential risks. Safety issues were a major factor in sealing the mast's fate. Most dirigibles, or blimps, used hydrogen instead of helium. If a blimp were to fall from the sky, it could kill many people on the ground, as New York has a large number of pedestrians. The builders also overlooked the violent and constantly shifting winds at high altitudes. These winds could blow dirigibles around, making it difficult to keep them stationary for passenger boarding and refueling. They could even blow the blimps onto the spires of the Empire State Building, causing them to burst and fall. Moreover, there is a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. In my opinion, Al Smith was more concerned with maintaining the height record than the potential dangers of the mast.
645	15478	6	2	In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building is well - known worldwide, yet few are aware that the original purpose of its mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, or blimps. The builders faced several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, which ultimately led to the shelving of the idea. One obstacle was the risk associated with foreign dirigibles. If a foreign dirigible were to dock and have an accident involving heat or a spark, it could explode due to the use of hydrogen, which is highly flammable. As stated, “Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.” Another obstacle was the violent winds on the building's top. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, knocking the dirigibles around. In conclusion, these obstacles led the builders to abandon the plan of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
646	15479	6	2	During the story, construction workers encountered a problem. The concept of having a dirigible dock on top of the Empire State Building was coming to an end. When conceiving this idea, the architects did not consider legal pressures, as aircraft are prohibited from flying at low altitudes in urban areas. Additionally, the strong winds around the building made it difficult to control the aircraft. There were also risks to civilians. If not properly secured, the aircraft could break loose and crash into urban areas, or, like the German dirigible, catch fire and explode. Despite having a working prototype, they discontinued the project, and airplanes became the preferred mode of air travel.
647	15480	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when trying to enable blimps to dock there. The most significant hurdle was nature. The winds atop the building were constantly changing due to strong air - currents. Another practical reason blimps could not moor at the Empire State Building was the pre - existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. In conclusion, these factors combined to prevent blimp docking at the Empire State Building.
648	15481	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building confronted numerous obstacles while attempting to permit dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. The most substantial obstacle was nature. The violently changing winds and climate made it extremely challenging to secure dirigibles to the mooring mast. Another major reason was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas; mooring dirigibles would break this law. Safety was also a crucial factor. Dirigibles outside of @LOCATION2 used hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable. People were concerned that if a dirigible caught fire over a busy city like New York, it would cause a disaster. These were some of the difficulties faced by the Empire State Building's builders, ultimately preventing dirigibles from mooring there.
649	15482	6	2	In the article “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the architects of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, safety was an obvious concern. A dirigible hovering over New York City did not seem safe. Moreover, it was not a reasonable construction project. The Empire State Building was already very tall, and building a mast that would likely see little use was not justifiable. In conclusion, these issues made the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
650	15483	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. They intended to add a mooring mast on top of the building to enable dirigibles to anchor for refueling or servicing for several hours. However, they were unable to do so because “a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame.” Also, Al Smith was unable to allow dirigibles to land on the building due to the narrowness of the top. In summary, these factors prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building.
651	15484	6	2	In an attempt to revolutionize travel, the concept of mooring airships to a new mast atop the Empire State Building was not thoroughly considered. Multiple problems and obstacles emerged with this idea. One significant issue was the stress added to the building when an airship was tethered. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation. Safety was also a major concern. Non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Nature posed another obstacle. Due to violent air currents, the high and shifting winds would cause a tethered dirigible to spin around the Empire State Building. The only proposed solution of tying lead weights to the rear end was not safe as the massive weights would dangle over a thousand feet above the public. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. These obstacles should have been carefully considered before the construction of the mooring mast began.
652	15485	6	2	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, several factors made a functional mooring mast impossible. There were natural and mechanical factors, as well as considerations regarding time and safety. Nature was a crucial element in this project. The building's location led to constantly shifting winds around it. When two blimps attempted to approach for testing, one was too unstable to dock, and the other tossed paper down a rope. After this incident, the idea of the mooring mast was abandoned. Over time, @CAPS1 replaced the blimps, and blimps were flammable and dangerous. Moreover, flying at that altitude was illegal. All these aspects contributed to the infeasibility of the mooring mast project."
653	15486	6	2	As the builders neared the point of installing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, significant problems became evident, complicating the docking of dirigibles. Legally, dirigibles could not fly at low altitudes above the city because of the risk of accidentally crashing into buildings and falling onto the crowds below. The air currents around tall buildings, especially the 1,250 - foot - high Empire State Building, were another concern. Even when a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the strong winds could rock it violently, potentially causing it to crash against the building and fall to the streets. A further issue arose after the Hindenburg dirigible caught fire due to the hydrogen it carried on May 6, 1937, while flying over New Jersey. No one wanted to take the risk of a similar incident occurring over New York City. Due to flammable hydrogen, violent air currents, and legal restrictions, the builders faced complications while constructing the mooring mast for dirigible landings.
654	15487	6	2	One of the obstacles in the plan to use dirigibles in the area was the presence of many sharp rods on surrounding buildings. If a dirigible made contact with one of these rods, it could pop. Another challenge was the wind. When the wind was blowing, it was difficult and unsafe to tie the dirigibles to the building. These factors combined made the use of dirigibles in this context quite problematic.
655	15488	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles. One was constructing a sufficiently strong frame for the building so that a single tether cable could hold a thousand - foot dirigible. Safety was also a major concern. At the time, most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which was extremely dangerous as hydrogen is highly flammable. Consequently, the constructors had to figure out how to create a landing field where the blimp would not come into contact with any of the sharp spires above the Empire State Building. These were some of the many challenges that the Empire State Building's builders had to overcome.
656	15489	6	2	"An article titled ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 elaborates on numerous issues associated with using the Empire State Building's peak for dirigible docking. International dirigibles were typically filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. A Hindenburg - style disaster occurring over New York City would pose a significant threat. Additionally, the winds at the spire's top change rapidly and are unpredictable, making the approach perilous. Usually, a blimp can land in a windy area by fastening lead weights to ropes to hold it down. However, when docking only to the spire without touching the ground, there is no way to weigh down the blimp for stabilization. Finally, there is a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, rendering dirigible docking at the Empire State Building illegal. These practical reasons dashed the hope of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building."
657	15490	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when attempting to enable dirigible docking. The architect couldn't simply place a mooring on the building's flat roof, as described in @CAPS1 @NUM1. Instead of constructing a plain, utilitarian mast, the architects designed a shiny tower made of glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel that could be accessed from the inside. It had a step - back design to mimic the overall shape of the building itself, as mentioned in @CAPS1 @NUM2. These challenges made the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building difficult to achieve.
658	15491	6	2	"According to the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 faced multiple obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One major obstacle was the framework. They had to design it so that the building could withstand the stress from the dirigible. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure needed to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, which required the use of different steel. Another significant obstacle was safety. The main concerns were the winds and hydrogen. Most international dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, and the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Moreover, they had to be cautious about pedestrians as dirigibles would be dangling high above them. These are just a couple of the challenges the builders of the Empire State Building @ORGANIZATION1 had to deal with."
659	15492	6	2	The concept of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was fraught with several problems and was largely impractical, mainly due to safety reasons. If a dirigible were to dock using a single cable, it would subject the building to extreme tension. In the event that an international dirigible filled with highly flammable hydrogen docked and caught fire, the consequences would be catastrophic. The actual docking process was also problematic. At such a high altitude, the winds were extremely strong, and there was nothing to prevent the dirigibles from swinging around the building. Normally, dirigibles are weighted down with lead weights, but if these were to fall, they would land on the busy streets of New York. Lastly, there was a law against low - flying airships, which effectively ruled out the possibility of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building.
660	15493	6	2	When workers attempted to build a dock for dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building, they faced multiple obstacles. As stated in @CAPS1 @NUM1, the architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof because it would be held by only a single cable tether, adding stress to the building. The only solution to strengthen it would involve spending over sixty thousand dollars on modifications. Another obstacle was nature. As described in @CAPS1 @NUM3, the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The option of using lead weights to weigh down the back was neither practical nor safe. Finally, the law against airships flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for a ship to tie to the building. These obstacles made the construction of a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building a challenging endeavor.
661	15494	6	2	"In an effort to enable dirigibles, also known as zeppelins or blimps, to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous obstacles. Al Smith mentioned that New York engineers were striving to devise a practical and workable arrangement. Firstly, they could not install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof as it would impose excessive stress on the frame, necessitating modifications. Another hurdle was that most dirigibles outside of @LOCATION2 utilized hydrogen, which is highly flammable. After the ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire, the owners recognized the potential severity if such an incident occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. The most significant obstacle was ""nature itself."" Due to violent air currents, the winds atop the building were constantly changing. In open areas, dirigibles could be weighted with lead weights, but this would pose a threat to pedestrians as the weights would dangle above them. Lastly, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making docking at the Empire State Building illegal. In conclusion, the builders faced multiple challenges that ultimately hindered the successful implementation of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
662	15495	6	2	When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders encountered four main problems, with one being resolved and the other three remaining unsolved. The first issue was that connecting each dirigible to the building's top via a single cable would subject the building's frame to enormous stress. This was addressed by reinforcing the Empire State Building's frame, though the modifications cost over sixty thousand dollars. The second problem proved more difficult to solve. Dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen for buoyancy, which is highly flammable. The incident of the Hindenburg blimp bursting into flames alerted the building's owners and builders to the potential danger of such an accident, especially in densely - populated New York City. The third obstacle was insurmountable. The high - speed winds at the top of the building made it impossible for a dirigible to @CAPS1 safely. During the only test, the Los Angeles navy dirigible could not get close enough to @CAPS1 due to the strong winds, and it was at risk of spinning out of control and hitting a spire on a nearby building. Additionally, there was an existing law preventing dirigibles from flying too close to urban areas, making it illegal to @CAPS1 or operate a ship in New York City. In summary, despite efforts to address the problems, the challenges were too great to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
663	15496	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The wind at that altitude was too fast, which indicates that they were concerned about dirigibles falling on stores below. The building was also unable to bear the additional weight they intended to place on top, and thus was not fully prepared for the docking. Moreover, hydrogen, which is commonly used in dirigibles, is highly flammable and can easily catch fire. In conclusion, these numerous problems made the Empire State Building an unsuitable location for dirigible docking."
664	15497	6	2	During the @DATE1 and the 1930s, a fierce competition emerged over constructing the largest building. To distinguish the Empire State Building, @ORGANIZATION1 decided to install a mooring mast for dirigibles, which would not only have symbolic meaning but also make it the world's largest building. However, the mooring mast was bound to fail for several reasons. Foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, which could cause a large fire @CAPS1. Above the Empire State Building, there are strong and constantly - shifting winds and currents, making it extremely difficult to control the dirigible. Pilots would have great difficulty @CAPS2 their dirigibles. Additionally, a law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, contributing to the failure of the mooring dock. In 1931, @CAPS3 Clavan @CAPS4 the @CAPS5 of the mooring mast. By the late 1930s, the idea was abandoned. In the end, various factors led to the demise of the plan to use the Empire State Building for dirigible docking.
665	15498	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was the lack of suitable landing areas. Dirigibles typically land in open fields and are weighed down with lead weights, but in New York, these weights would dangle above pedestrians. Safety was also a major concern. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and there were fears that an accident similar to the Hindenburg disaster could occur over a densely populated area. An existing law prohibited airships from flying too low in urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. Forceful winds were another obstacle; they could blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings and puncture the shell, and the captain had to keep his hands on the control levers at all times. Overall, the mooring mast was a poorly - conceived idea and would not have been safe. In conclusion, the combination of these obstacles made it unfeasible and dangerous to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
666	15499	6	2	"The challenges encountered by the Empire State Building's builders in enabling dirigibles to dock were predominantly related to structural and safety concerns. As per paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the building's top, secured by a single cable tether, would impose additional stress on the building's frame."" Addressing this issue required over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework. While structural problems were significant, pedestrian safety posed an even greater hurdle. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, creating substantial fire risks. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the Empire State Building's owners recognized how much more catastrophic the accident could have been if it had occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York."" Although existing laws against airships flying too low over urban areas restricted dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building, nature itself was the most formidable obstacle. The constant shifting of winds due to violent air currents could puncture the dirigibles' shells. In conclusion, a combination of structural issues, safety risks, laws, and natural elements made it extremely difficult to use the Empire State Building for dirigible docking."
667	15500	6	2	"The builders of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building encountered a multitude of obstacles, ranging from legal restrictions to potential future disasters. There were several design and location - related problems with the mooring mast. One issue was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" Despite architects' efforts to adjust the mast's design, it remained too perilous for blimps to land. Another major concern was the dirigibles themselves. They were filled with combustible hydrogen, and in the event of a fire similar to the Hindenburg disaster, debris would fall on pedestrians below. Additionally, a law prohibited ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" Ultimately, due to laws, the nature of dirigibles, and natural conditions, the mooring mast was rendered unusable."
668	15501	6	2	"The first significant obstacle in dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was facilitating passenger embarkation and disembarkation at such a great height. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" Evidently, the power of the wind presented a substantial challenge. Another obstacle, also mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, was an existing law. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area."" In conclusion, both the force of the wind and the law were major impediments to dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
669	15502	6	2	The architects who constructed the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building faced numerous difficulties in actually docking dirigibles there. When they were building it, the concept of docking blimps on a building's top was revolutionary and appealing. However, they had to contend with safety, weather, and legal issues. Regarding safety, the hydrogen gas inside dirigibles is highly flammable, and a single accident could endanger hundreds of people on New York's streets. The strong winds on the building's top made it arduous for blimps to get close enough. Moreover, there were laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over densely populated urban areas. Despite the initial promise of the mooring mast, unfortunately, it saw little use.
670	15503	6	2	"According to the information in the excerpt, the obstacles faced by the Empire State Building's builders were crucial to the dock's usability. Building a 102 - story building is a challenge in itself, and when wind and other weather conditions are considered, the task becomes even more difficult. To create and install the dock on top, the builders first had to reinforce the building's skeleton. As paragraph @NUM1 states, ""The Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" When constructing the mooring mast, the builders had to account for violent wind speeds and the building's ability to support itself. In summary, the Empire State Building's builders had to overcome numerous obstacles to complete their project."
671	15504	6	2	The successful use of the morning mast was hindered by nature itself. The winds atop the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.
672	15505	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. The use of the mooring mast was not successful, and nature presented a significant challenge. After initial celebrations, they were disappointed as dirigibles couldn't dock. Subsequently, the blimp Columbia attempted a publicity stunt by flying up to deliver newspapers to the building. When the stunt failed, it cast doubt on the blimp's potential use for future transportation.
673	15506	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigible docking. First, architects couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the building's smooth roof. A thousand - foot dirigible tethered with one cable would instantly add stress to the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure needed to be transferred to the foundation. Second, the building's steel frame had to be strengthened for the new design. Nature was the greatest hurdle; architects had to account for the constantly shifting winds caused by violent air currents. Even if a dirigible was tied to the mast, the back of the ship would be unstable, and the dangling above pedestrians worried the architects. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low above urban areas, which prohibited tethering large ships to buildings. Despite attempts, the entire idea was ultimately abandoned.
674	15507	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. One major issue was that dirigibles contain highly flammable gases. Docking a blimp over a large city like New York City would be extremely dangerous in case of a fire. Another problem was that the docking system wouldn't work as planned and wouldn't be safe. These airships are at the mercy of winds and weather. Usually, on open landing fields, dirigibles are weighted at the front and back. To stay in place on the Empire State Building, blimps would need a back - weight, which would dangle over the city. Without it, the blimp would spin around the mooring mast. Finally, the height at which dirigibles would operate was unsafe. A wind - blown blimp could crash into the pointy tops of nearby buildings. These were the challenges the builders faced in their attempt to enable dirigible docking on the Empire State Building.
675	15508	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. The first was the need to modify the building. The architects adding the mooring mast realized that directly adding the mast and mooring dirigibles would put excessive stress on the building's frame. So, they had to spend a certain amount of money to strengthen the frame. The second obstacle was general safety. After the 1937 Hindenburg disaster, it was clear how catastrophic an accident would be over a highly populated area like New York City. Besides the risk of a major disaster, the constant violent wind gusts at the mast's height meant that any moored dirigible would swing rapidly around the mast. While weights are used to solve this on the ground, it would create another safety issue as a falling weight could harm people below. The final obstacle was a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low near urban areas. In the end, these many obstacles prevented the idea of mooring dirigibles at the Empire State Building from becoming a reality.
676	15509	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock on the mast. One significant obstacle was nature. The excerpt states that the winds atop the building were in constant flux due to violent air - currents. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the rear of the vessel would swivel around, which could have led to major accidents had docking been permitted. Another hurdle was the legal restriction. There was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach the area. Before the idea was abandoned, two dirigibles made attempts to reach the building. The first couldn't reach due to strong winds, and the second attempted a stunt to drop off a bundle of newspapers. Lacking the proper equipment, a worker had to catch the rope - attached bundle. These obstacles were crucial to the mast's construction as they likely saved the lives of aviators and the people living in the urban areas below.
677	15510	6	2	In the [specific decade], dirigibles were regarded as the future of transportation. After the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders tried to allow dirigibles to dock there. However, three main factors prevented this. Firstly, there was a lack of a suitable landing area in New York City. Al Smith believed that adding a mooring mast to the building's top would enable dirigibles to anchor for hours. But it was no easy feat for architects to install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. Secondly, nature posed a major challenge. The violent air - currents from the wind would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Thirdly, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the end, two dirigibles attempted to dock, but their efforts were unsuccessful. Overall, these factors effectively thwarted the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
678	15511	6	2	Builders faced multiple obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. Safety was a primary concern. Many dirigibles, especially those from outside the United States, used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Having such dirigibles fly low over a densely - populated area like downtown New York was extremely dangerous, as a potential accident could result in a large number of deaths. The second obstacle was the wind conditions. The winds on the building's top were constantly blowing, preventing dirigibles from remaining stable in one place. Instead, they would circle around the mast. The third and final obstacle was the law. There was a regulation that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to be tied to the Empire State Building. These obstacles collectively made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the building.
679	15512	6	2	On December 11, 1929, Al Smith announced that the Empire State Building would reach a height of 1,250 feet, surpassing the previous tallest building, the Chrysler Building. Smith increased the building's height by adding a top or a “hat”. John [Name] described this addition as “[The top of the Empire State Building] would be more than an ornament... The Empire State Building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of a few aviation pioneers”. This dream involved having a mooring mast at the building's top to dock dirigibles or blimps. However, as planning progressed, several obstacles emerged. These included the additional stress it would place on the building's frame. A thousand - foot dirigible held by a single cable tether would require over [amount of money] worth of modifications to the Empire State Building. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Moreover, the winds on the building's top were constantly shifting due to violent air - currents, and having dirigibles dangling high above pedestrians was neither safe nor practical. In conclusion, these obstacles made the initial dream of using the Empire State Building for dirigible docking unviable.
680	15513	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and one of the main issues was the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City. Dirigibles were docked using an electric winch. The winch would haul in a line from the front of the ship and then tie it to a mast. Although the bodies of dirigibles could swing in the breeze, passengers could still safely board and alight. However, despite these docking mechanisms, the absence of a proper landing area remained a significant obstacle that hindered the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
681	15514	6	2	When constructing a mast for dirigibles on the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous obstacles. Firstly, they had to reinforce the foundation to prevent the stress on the building's structure from causing damage. Additionally, the mast was impractical for dirigibles as shifting currents and winds would either make landing impossible or cause the blimp to spin and collide with buildings. After facing these challenges, the workers ultimately realized that the task was unfeasible.
682	15515	6	2	“The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2 details the issues architects faced when trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The concept was unfeasible, primarily due to safety concerns. Most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. In the event of an accident, the dirigible could crash into the thousands of pedestrians in New York City. Nature also contributed to the impracticality. In New York City, constantly shifting winds could spin the dirigible out of control, even when docked. Some dirigibles used lead weights to prevent swiveling, but in New York, “they would dangle above pedestrians on the street... neither practical nor safe.” Moreover, air laws prohibited the realization of dirigible docks. It was illegal for dirigibles to approach the area because of the low - flying altitude required. In conclusion, mooring masts were impractical and “never fulfilled its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed.”
683	15516	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, several obstacles arose when attempting to build a dock for the Empire State Building. One obstacle was the limited space for a landing spot. New York has a large population and numerous buildings. As stated, “The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area.” Dirigibles were large and needed sufficient space to avoid collisions. Safety was another concern. Builders had to consider the large number of people and the proximity to the building. “The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.” Strong winds could swing the dirigible back into the building. Lastly, the danger of weights hanging over pedestrians was significant. “... using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street...” A weight failure could potentially kill someone, and the consequences would be unbearable. Overall, these obstacles made the construction of the dock extremely challenging.
684	15517	6	2	The Empire State Building builders faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, added stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to handle the new situation, with an estimated cost of over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle related to the mast was nature. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. When dirigibles attempted to land, the back of the ship would swivel around the mast, posing a safety risk. In conclusion, these challenges made it difficult to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
685	15518	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple challenges while trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. They couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. A dirigible attached to the top by a single cable tether would stress the building frame. Its weight and air pressure would weaken the building's foundation. To withstand the dirigibles' weight, they had to spend sixty thousand dollars on framework modifications. Another issue was the mooring mast's ineffectiveness, a problem that should have been considered before construction. Safety was a major concern. Many non - US countries used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium in dirigibles. There was an incident where a blimp caught fire and was destroyed due to hydrogen in its balloon. The most significant challenge was the wind above the building. Violent air currents caused the wind to shift constantly. If a blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, its back would spin around it. Blimps typically use weights to land in open fields, but this was not possible over the building as weights dangling over pedestrians were unsafe. In summary, the builders faced considerable difficulties in their attempt to allow blimps to dock at the Empire State Building.
686	15519	6	2	When attempting to build a docking station for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building, multiple obstacles emerged, rendering the idea increasingly unfeasible. One significant issue stemmed from the building's foundation. A blimp, which can reach up to a thousand feet in length, swaying on top of the building would impose a substantial amount of stress. Consequently, additional funds would be required to strengthen the foundation and framework to support a large zeppelin on the mooring mast. Given that the building stands at an altitude of 1,250 feet, powerful air - currents rush through its top. These air currents create impossible docking conditions as the blimp could collide with the building and burst. Considering the flammability of hydrogen, such a dangerous explosion could cause chaos in the densely populated city below. Referring to the Hindenburg explosion in Lakehurst in 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building recognized how much more catastrophic the accident could have been if it had occurred above a densely populated area. Due primarily to safety concerns, the dirigible docking station was never constructed.
687	15520	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. The wind presented a major problem. The design of the mooring station meant that the wind could catch the dirigible's tail, causing it to spin around the building. After the mooring station was completed, the wind made it unsafe for dirigibles to approach the building. Another issue was the building's stability and support. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework to prevent a blimp from pulling the mooring station off the building. Safety of the people was also a crucial concern. Most dirigibles use flammable gases to fly. An accident similar to the Hindenburg over the busy New York streets would be disastrous. In conclusion, the building crew faced many problems, with wind, stability, and safety being among the most prominent.
688	15521	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was the stress that a thousand - foot dirigible would place on the building's frame. As a result, the building had to be modified and strengthened to adapt to this new situation. Safety was also a major concern. Dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, rather than helium. Nature posed the greatest challenge. Shifting winds at the top of the building caused the back of the dirigibles to swivel around the mast. Previous solutions, such as weighing down dirigibles moored in open landing fields with lead weights, were not safe for the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, preventing dirigibles from approaching the area. In summary, there were multiple obstacles when the builders aimed to make the Empire State Building a docking station.
689	15522	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles during construction, particularly in relation to safety, available technology, and the planning of the mooring mast. Regarding safety, dirigibles from countries other than the United States often used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, greatly increasing the risk of a fire in the dirigible. Moreover, the strong winds on top of the building were too powerful for a successful dirigible landing. Technologically, the builders lacked the means to safely land a [DATE1] - foot dirigible at the top of a tower using a single cable. This would add stress to the building's frame, and wind - pressure stress would be hazardous to it. In terms of planning, the builders did not plan well enough and should have recognized that the mast was likely to fail from the start. In conclusion, these various obstacles made it extremely difficult to build a functional mooring mast.
690	15523	6	2	"According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by [ORGANIZATION2], the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempt to create a docking station for dirigibles. The three main obstacles were safety, nature, and existing airship laws. Safety was a major concern during construction. The builders considered using hydrogen instead of helium, despite hydrogen's high flammability. They later realized how disastrous it could have been if an incident like the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" explosion on May 6, 1937, had occurred above a densely populated area like New York City. Nature also presented an obstacle as the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting. This could cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. The final obstacle was the existing laws against aircraft flying too low over urban areas. The builders feared that the winds would blow the dirigibles into sharp spires of other structures, puncturing the dirigible's shell. After two failed attempts, they decided to cancel the construction of the ""Mooring Mast"" due to the unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height. They deemed it advisable to postpone the final installation of the landing gear to a later date."
691	15524	6	2	When attempting to enable dirigibles to land at the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous problems. Safety was a major concern as most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Allowing such dirigibles over New York would pose an unacceptably large risk. Air currents also presented a challenge. The winds on the building's top were constantly changing due to violent air movements. Even when a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, its rear would spin around the mast. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law effectively prohibited any airship from docking with the mast or even approaching the city to attempt docking. In conclusion, these multiple issues made it extremely difficult for dirigibles to land at the Empire State Building.
692	15525	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many hurdles in their bid to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles fell into three main categories: safety, nature, and laws. Most foreign dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen rather than helium. If a dirigible caught fire over a densely populated city, the consequences would be dire. The high - altitude winds were very strong, making it impossible to keep a dirigible still. Even when the front of the dirigible was attached to the building, the back would swing. This was clearly unsafe. Moreover, there was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to fly close to the building or dock at it. In summary, the many challenges the builders faced meant that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a difficult feat.
693	15526	6	2	The construction of the Empire State Building was a project fraught with obstacles. The additional plan of building a mooring mast on top of the building introduced a series of challenges that had to be considered. Firstly, adding a mooring mast to the building's top would significantly increase its weight, placing extra stress on the building's frame. To reinforce and stabilize the building, modifications worth over @MONEY1 would be required. Laws and regulations regarding how low airships could fly over urban areas also restricted the mast's use. Since the building was in the middle of a densely populated city with thousands of pedestrians below, it was neither practical nor safe. Nature was the biggest obstacle. Many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, creating a fire hazard. Strong winds and violent air currents also prevented the mast's construction. Using the building's top as an airship dock was perhaps overly ambitious. In conclusion, these multiple factors made the construction and use of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building a very difficult proposition.
694	15527	6	2	The workers faced many obstacles in the process of building the mast on the Empire State Building. They had to figure out how to land large aircraft on the small - framed building. They also needed to find a way to safely get passengers on and off the aircraft while the tail was flapping in the air. To address these challenges, they had to consult with the U.S. Naval Air Station, which was a leader in dirigible research. Additionally, there was a law against low - flying aircraft in @ORGANIZATION3. In summary, these were the key obstacles the mast constructors had to overcome to build the mast on the Empire State Building in @LOCATION1.
695	15528	6	2	Being an architect and construction worker is among the most difficult jobs globally, especially when working at an elevation of @NUM1 feet. Building the Empire State Building was no easy task, and building a mooring mast (a docking area for dirigibles) on top of it was even more challenging. Since the building had a flat roof, architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on it. They had to construct an extension in the shape of a rocket protruding from the flat roof. They also realized that using a single cable at the top of the extension to hook the dirigible would put tremendous stress on the building. So, they had to find a way to relieve the stress on the building's foundation. Despite these challenges, the architects overcame them and planned to implement their ideas. In conclusion, their perseverance and problem - solving skills allowed them to move forward with the mooring mast project on the Empire State Building.
696	15529	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the building's top. One major issue was the excessive stress on the building's frame. Since the dirigible needed to be connected to the frame, which was @NUM1 feet below, this presented a significant challenge. Safety was another concern. The workers initially considered using hydrogen to keep the dirigibles afloat but later realized that hydrogen is flammable. Additionally, nature and law posed problems. The winds in nature made it difficult for the dirigibles to stay stationary, and the law stipulated that dirigibles flying at the proposed height were too low for urban areas. Due to these many problems, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building ultimately failed.
697	15530	6	2	Many years ago, people were in search of a new and more practical means of transportation. When the dirigible, or blimp, was introduced, it was thought that this small aircraft could be the future of transportation. Plans were made to construct a mast on top of the Empire State Building in New York City, and the project soon got underway. However, there were several obstacles. Hazards from nature, the construction characteristics of the Empire State Building, and differences between American and @CAPS1 dirigibles hindered the success of the mooring mast. Nature can be unpredictable and harsh, making all forms of transportation, especially air travel, difficult and dangerous. During the construction of the mooring mast, strong wind currents were observed. On a windy day, it would be nearly impossible to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building's top as only the front of the aircraft would be secure, endangering pedestrians. Secondly, the Empire State Building's roof needed improvements for dirigibles to dock. When secured by a single cable tether, the dirigible's weight would press on the building, potentially causing hazards and costing about @MONEY1 to fix. Lastly, dirigibles from other countries couldn't fly to the United States. American dirigibles were filled with helium, which made them light and easy to fly, while @CAPS1 models used highly flammable hydrogen. After a German dirigible was severely damaged by fire, it was decided that these models couldn't be used. In the end, the dangers associated with using dirigibles for travel outweighed the benefits. Since too many accidents could be caused by dirigibles, the Empire State Building had to be utilized in another way.
698	15531	6	2	The builders faced significant challenges in enabling dirigibles to dock. They planned to use an electrical winch and tie the dirigible to the mast. However, wind pressure was a major issue. Dirigibles needed to be in an open field and have their backs weighed down with lead weights. Attempts to tie the dirigible to the building were illegal, and the strong winds also made it impossible to do so. Additionally, the dirigible mooring equipment was never installed. Eventually, dirigibles and their passengers gradually disappeared, and dirigibles did not become a means of transportation, giving way to airplanes instead.
699	15532	6	2	The designers of dirigibles faced several problems. Violent air - currents that form in urban areas were a significant issue. Due to the dirigible's light weight, these air currents would cause it to be tossed around. Another problem was the high level of danger associated with landing a dirigible over a densely populated area such as New York City. These problems made it difficult for dirigibles to be a practical option for urban transportation.
700	15533	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced extremely difficult obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. They had to modify and strengthen the building, and these modifications were very costly, amounting to over sixty thousand dollars. The winds on the building's top were also a major obstacle. Due to violent air currents, the winds were constantly shifting. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. Safety was another concern. The builders were afraid of a @CAPS1 incident because most dirigibles from outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Moreover, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it clear that the dirigible docking plan would never succeed. Even though the proposed docking height was relatively high off the ground, the law was still effective. It was illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area, which completely ruled out the possibility of the docking.
701	15534	6	2	In the short - story “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered three obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. Two of these obstacles were related to safety. Firstly, most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. Having a flammable ship above a densely populated area like downtown New York could lead to disaster. Secondly, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. A dirigible dangling high above street pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. The final obstacle was legal. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. Due to these legal and safety obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building could not make any attempts to have dirigibles dock there.
702	15535	6	2	According to the excerpt from @ORGANIZATION2's “The Mooring Mast”, the Empire State Building's builders faced challenges while trying to allow dirigibles to dock. When Al Smith first planned the structure and use of the mast, his ambition seemed excessive. In paragraph @NUM1, Smith's competitiveness, which can impede practicality, was evident. His determination to make the Empire State Building the tallest initiated the idea of the mooring mast, thus becoming an obstacle. Although the “Designing the Mast” section shows that much planning went into building the mast, the additional effort required was also an obstacle. The mast delayed the building's completion, and as @PERSON1 mentioned in paragraph @NUM2, it caused unsolved problems and postponements. Safety was a significant factor in the mast's failure as dirigibles were highly flammable. As stated in paragraph @NUM3, “the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself”. These factors highlight the impracticality of installing a dirigible dock and reveal the major obstacles the builders faced. Since ambition outweighed practicality in building the mooring mast, the builders faced obstacles and ultimately failed.
703	15536	6	2	The challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock included the lack of a suitable land area. Additionally, the winds on the building's top were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. They also had to ensure that no sharp objects would puncture the dirigibles. These were the challenges the Empire State Building's builders encountered.
704	15537	6	2	What initially seemed like a viable way to make the Empire State Building famous became a difficult task as the builders faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One problem was the added stress on the building's frame. To accommodate this stress, the foundation had to be modified and strengthened. Moreover, the winds on the building's top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. After facing all these obstacles, the builders finally realized that this “dream” of having dirigibles dock was impossible to achieve.
705	15538	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building had numerous problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Their first issue was that they couldn't drop a mooring mast on top of the building. This was mainly because it was held by a single tether and would add stress to the building's frame. Another challenge was that the wind speeds at the top of the building were much greater, pushing the dirigibles away from the docking station. Additionally, most non - @LOCATION2 dirigibles used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, instead of helium to stay aloft. For the building's creators, the idea seemed impractical as it would be very difficult to keep a dirigible stationary, dangling @NUM1 feet above New York City.
706	15539	6	2	According to the excerpt, the Empire State Building's builders encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One issue was that US dirigibles utilized hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. A fire - related destruction of a dirigible above a densely populated area like downtown New York could lead to a very dangerous accident. Nature itself presented one of the greatest challenges for using the mooring mast. The author notes that violent air currents caused the winds on top of the building to shift constantly. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, its back would spin around the mast. Dangling lead weights over pedestrians on the streets was neither practical nor safe. The book The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 details several obstacles the builders faced to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
707	15540	6	2	"In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's The Mooring Mast, she details the challenges the Empire State Building's builders faced while attempting to permit dirigibles to dock. Paragraph four states, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This implies there was limited space for dirigibles when they were not in flight. Paragraph sixteen mentions that ""The U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" This indicates that weather conditions could render dirigible travel extremely hazardous."
708	15541	6	2	"Enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building presented significant obstacles. In the @DATE1's, dirigibles were referred to as the ""Transportation of the Future"". There was an existing law against airships flying too low over open areas. The builders had to make numerous adjustments to achieve their desired result. Safety was of utmost importance. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, despite its high flammability, instead of helium. Additionally, ""The highest open observation deck, intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public"" and remains closed to this day."
709	15542	6	2	"The three insurmountable obstacles the builders faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building all related to public safety. They should have recognized that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen"", making them prone to explosions. In an urban area like New York, a thousand - foot dirigible covering four blocks could cause massive casualties. Secondly, violent air currents led to constantly shifting winds at the top of the Empire State Building. The mooring mast would be ineffective in this environment unless the back of the dirigible was weighted with lead weights. But having lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street [would be] neither practical nor safe"". Thirdly, a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas already reflected the awareness of public safety from aircraft. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". In conclusion, docking dirigibles in an urban setting was too dangerous to attempt."
710	15543	6	2	Although the mooring mast was intended to help dock passengers safely from dirigibles, there were many difficulties that could endanger people. In 1937, on May 6, when the German dirigible '@CAPS1' was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the Empire State Building's owners realized that the accident would have been far worse if it had occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. This shows that a dirigible fire above New York could cause many serious injuries. In December 1930, the U.S. dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up due to strong winds. Tying up a dirigible in high - wind conditions was the toughest obstacle. Eventually, the idea of using the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was abandoned.
711	15544	6	2	"In an excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Løsted, the constructors of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. One significant hurdle was finding a method to moor a dirigible on the building's top without subjecting the building's frame to additional stress. As Løsted noted, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Another challenge was the financial aspect; over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework were necessary. The most formidable obstacle, however, was nature. High winds would cause excessive shifting of the dirigible. Løsted stated, ""The greatest obstacle to the success of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Evidently, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."
712	15545	6	2	Despite a valiant effort to turn a seemingly ingenious concept into reality, the constructors of the Empire State Building found the obstacles to creating a dirigible dock insurmountable. One of the challenges was the turbulent winds at the building's peak. These powerful gales made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to maneuver a dirigible at that altitude, let alone dock it. Another issue was a law that prohibited airships from flying too close to the ground in urban areas. This law meant that it would be illegal for a dirigible to approach the Empire State Building. Additionally, safety was a major concern. Dirigibles typically used highly flammable hydrogen, and an airship explosion over a densely populated area like New York City would have had catastrophic consequences. In conclusion, these challenges ultimately made the creation of a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
713	15546	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous problems when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. Tying a dirigible with a single cable would place a tremendous amount of weight on the building's frame. To make this possible, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would need to be strengthened, incurring an additional cost of @MONEY1. After the mast was constructed, new issues arose. Most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, and after the Hindenburg disaster, the architects were aware that the consequences of a similar incident in a densely populated area like New York City would be far worse. It was also too risky to have a large dirigible hovering a few thousand feet above pedestrians. Moreover, the law hindered Al Smith's idea. The law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. During a trial by the dirigible Los Angeles, the builders discovered that the wind was too strong, and they worried that the dirigible might crash into nearby buildings. Eventually, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was abandoned in favor of airplanes.
714	15547	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Løsted, the constructors of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles while trying to create a docking place on the tall building. An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas was a significant hindrance. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The other practical Reason why dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Despite a strong argument against building the mast, Al Smith ignored it, and this law effectively made it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building. Nature also posed a problem. In paragraph @NUM2, the author explained that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Dirigibles usually moored in open landing fields and could be weighed down by lead weights, but using them on the Empire State Building, where they would dangle in the air, was neither practical nor safe. All these factors contributed to the decision not to allow docking."
715	15548	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. The most significant obstacle was the violent winds at high altitudes. The back of the zeppelin would swivel around the mooring mast, and there was a real fear that it could be blown into the sharp spires of nearby buildings, causing it to burst. Using lead weights to hold the zeppelin in place was not an option because having them dangle above the streets was unsafe. At the time, there was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas for similar safety reasons, which would have made it illegal for a zeppelin to dock at the Empire State Building. These were obvious problems that were overlooked during the design of the mooring mast, ultimately leading to the impracticality of the dirigible - docking plan.
716	15549	6	2	In the non - fiction excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @PERSON1, architects encountered numerous obstacles while trying to enable dirigibles to dock. The first hurdle was the absence of a suitable landing area. Since there was no place to land the blimps, constructing a mooring mast on top of the building was necessary, as it would allow dirigibles to anchor for refueling, servicing, and passenger embarkation and disembarkation. The second obstacle was that the architects couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the building. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable would add stress to the building's frame. The load stress and wind pressure needed to be transmitted, and the building's still frame had to be modified and strengthened to adapt to this new situation. The most significant obstacle was the successful use of the mooring mast. The winds on top of the building constantly shifted due to violent air currents, causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast, making it unsafe. These three obstacles were what the architects had to overcome to build the mooring mast in their pursuit of having the world's highest building.
717	15550	6	2	The construction faced several obstacles to its success. The primary and insurmountable obstacle was the wind. As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, the winds on top of the building constantly shifted due to violent air currents. Even when tied down, the large, balloon - like dirigibles would continuously swivel around the mooring mast. The Hindenburg disaster on May 6, 1937, demonstrated the danger of having blimps filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas over a densely populated area like downtown New York. Existing laws regarding urban flight also hindered the project. As the author states in paragraph @NUM2, “It was illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.” Incoming blimps would fly too low, violating the law. These multiple obstacles ultimately limited the feasibility of the project.
718	15551	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, they needed to learn about the mooring lines. They “consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations” to gain first - hand knowledge. Second, they had to address the issue of the building's frame. The frame “would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,” which meant the builders had to revisit and work on the frame again. In conclusion, the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building presented the builders with a series of challenging obstacles.
719	15552	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2, the architects faced many obstacles in enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The engineers had diverse experiences, consulted experts, and toured the equipment to be used in the project. The architects had to recognize that they couldn't simply install a mooring mast on top of the building, considering the consequences and dangers such as wind pressure. Additionally, there was a risk of fires; in a densely populated area like New York, a fire could cause significant harm or even loss of life. These obstacles taught the architects about the potential dangers and outcomes of building the mooring mast.
720	15553	6	2	Architects working on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building had to confront multiple obstacles. One was that dirigibles did not become the next big transportation trend. Without dirigibles to use the mast, it would be rendered useless. Another obstacle was the existing laws that prohibited dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, meaning that no dirigibles could legally dock at the mast. Finally, nature posed an obstacle. The fierce winds at the top of the building could spin the dirigibles around, making docking both dangerous and impractical. These obstacles significantly limited the viability of the mooring mast project.
721	15554	6	2	"When constructing the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous obstacles while trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. As stated in the reading excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, dirigibles could be up to one thousand feet long, equivalent to four blocks in New York City. This presented the first challenge: there was no suitable landing place. An existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, so dirigibles couldn't be positioned above New York. Architects also had to redesign the building to support the weight of the dirigible. The most significant obstacle was nature. The winds at the building's top were constantly shifting. Even when the dirigible was tied to the building, its rear would still swirl. Usually, dirigibles were weighed down with cylinder blocks in open fields, but it was too risky to do so over a populated area, and they had no solution for this issue. In conclusion, the difficulties faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were insurmountable due to various factors."
722	15555	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", the intention was to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building for refueling, servicing, and passenger embarkation and disembarkation. However, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles to achieve this. The architects and engineers of the building consulted experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION3 in Lakehurst, New Jersey, as mentioned in ∂@NUM1. They had to collaborate with experts and assess the viability of the idea. As stated in ∂'s @NUM2 & @NUM3, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed....the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Another hurdle the builders faced was nature. The strong winds made the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building unfeasible. In summary, despite efforts, the challenges, especially those related to nature, prevented the successful implementation of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
723	15556	6	2	According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles during construction. When designing the mast, the architects realized that simply placing the mooring mast on the building would add stress to its frame. Therefore, the building had to be modified and strengthened to withstand these conditions. Subsequently, the builders encountered a safety problem. The winds at the building's top were violent and constantly changing, causing the dirigible to rotate around the mast. They considered adding lead weights to stabilize the dirigible, but having them hanging above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Additionally, existing laws against airships flying low over urban areas made it illegal to achieve their goal. In conclusion, the planning of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was fraught with difficulties that ultimately hindered its intended use.
724	15557	6	2	During the construction of the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, architects faced several obstacles, including spontaneous combustion, natural elements, and airship - related laws. The first problem was spontaneous combustion. After the accidental fire on the Hindenburg, the owners of the Empire State Building recognized that if a dirigible caught fire on their building, the consequences would be dire as debris would fall on the busy New York streets. The second issue was nature. Violent air currents caused the winds above the building to change constantly. Even when a dirigible was docked and tethered, its rear would still spin. Usually, lead weights were used to hold dirigibles down in fields, but using them over New York City was dangerous as they could break off and fall on pedestrians. Finally, laws regulating airship flight restricted construction. These laws set height limits over urban areas, making it illegal to dock at or even approach the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the construction of the mast on the Empire State Building was severely hampered by these multiple obstacles.
725	15558	6	2	"The builders of the @CAPS1 State Building faced several problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was the significant stress it would place on the building. If a dirigible was tied to the building in windy conditions, it would exert weight and pull on the structure. ""Nature was their greatest obstacle"", and having a dirigible hanging over the crowded streets of New York was extremely unsafe. To strengthen the building, the builders spent over ""sixty thousand dollars"" on improving the skeleton or frame. Moreover, there were laws that prohibited large aircraft from flying low over a crowded city. This meant that even if the mast was built, it would be illegal for dirigibles to land there. In conclusion, due to these numerous problems, the landing of a dirigible on the @CAPS1 State Building never came to fruition."
726	15559	6	2	During the process of constructing the Empire State Building and contemplating the docking of dirigibles there, the builders encountered numerous challenges. Safety was a primary concern. Even if dirigibles were to be hooked atop the building, the wind could potentially cause them to crash into the structure. After the Hindenburg disaster, the builders recognized the extensive damage that could occur if a similar incident happened in New York. Another issue was the existing laws which prohibited aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. Due to these problems, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned.
727	15560	6	2	From the inception of the Empire State Building to the attempt to enable dirigibles to dock there, the builders faced multiple hurdles. Al Smith believed adding a mooring mast for several - hour dirigible docking was a good idea. However, to allow dirigibles to dock, the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transferred to the building's foundation as a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top would stress the building's frame. The wind, a manifestation of nature, was a major obstacle. Violent air currents caused the wind strength to constantly change. For safety reasons, most dirigibles were unsafe as they used flammable hydrogen. There was also an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Irving Clavan stated that the unsolved problems of mooring airships at such a height made it advisable to postpone the final installation of the landing gear. As a result, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles faded away.
728	15561	6	2	"In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's ""The Mooring Mast"", she details the various obstacles the Empire State Building's builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. Adjustments to the building's framework were necessary, the dirigibles' safety was a concern, and nature presented a significant challenge. The architects realized they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building because the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transferred to the nearly eleven - hundred - foot - below foundation. They had to strengthen the building, an improvement that cost @MONEY1. The safety of dirigibles was another issue. Most dirigibles at the time used highly flammable hydrogen, as evidenced by the destruction of the German Hindenburg blimp. A similar incident in densely - populated New York could cause severe damage. Nature also posed a problem. The constantly shifting winds at the top of the building made blimps unstable. Using lead weights to stabilize the blimps was unsafe as they would dangle over pedestrians. Due to these obstacles, the attempt to dock blimps at the Empire State Building was unsuccessful."
729	15562	6	2	"According to Marcia Amidon L¸sted's ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to be tied to the building. Additionally, many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. As hydrogen is highly flammable, it would endanger not only those inside the dirigibles but also people nearby. The most significant obstacle was the violent air currents at the top of the building, which caused the wind to constantly shift, making landing nearly impossible and unsafe. Overall, the excerpt indicates that the only reasonable place for dirigibles to land is an open field."
730	15563	6	2	Enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a difficult task. Building the mast was extremely challenging, and engineers and architects had to carefully consider how to construct it while ensuring passengers' safety. Dirigibles are heavy, and the use of hydrogen could potentially lead to structural failure. The behavior of dirigibles in the sky is unpredictable, and their bodies could swing in the wind, possibly going out of control. Deciding on which floor to place the mast is also crucial, as no one would want to work beneath a huge, heavy dirigible. In conclusion, the complexity of these factors made the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building a very difficult endeavor.
731	15564	6	2	Presently, I will share some of the obstacles the Empire State Building's builders encountered when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, as stated in paragraph @NUM1, the architects failed to recognize the potential issues with the mast. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. Secondly, in paragraph @NUM2, nature itself was the greatest hurdle to the successful use of the mooring mast. Violent air - currents caused the winds on top of the building to shift constantly. Thirdly, according to paragraph @NUM3, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, which was another practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building. Due to these serious obstacles, the construction of the mooring mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building was never completed.
732	15565	6	2	In the @DATE1's, dirigibles were a significant mode of transportation. However, there were few landing areas for these large dirigibles. Al Smith came up with the idea of constructing a landing dock on top of the Empire State Building. The government had to review Al Smith's plan to ensure its safety and feasibility. His plan involved having dirigibles hang onto the building via a single tether wire. But this was not allowed because the stress on the building from the hanging dirigibles would be excessive. Moreover, using dirigibles with hydrogen on the Empire State Building was a safety hazard. The hydrogen in the dirigibles could catch fire and burn down the building. In conclusion, these factors made it impossible to implement Al Smith's plan for dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building.
733	15566	6	2	"The owners of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. Firstly, they had to modify and strengthen the steel frame. This was necessary for the building to support the mooring mast where dirigibles were intended to dock. Safety was also a major concern. They were worried about an accident similar to the Hindenburg, and they considered how much worse it could be if it happened in a city like New York, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. The most significant obstacle was nature. Violent air currents caused the wind to shift constantly, making docked aircrafts ""swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" as described in paragraph @NUM2. A law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas also posed a challenge, preventing dirigibles from docking and even approaching the area. Although the idea initially seemed possible, the builders should have recognized that the numerous obstacles made their dream unfeasible."
734	15567	6	2	The builders' attempts to construct the Empire State Building to enable dirigible docking faced several blind spots. The tug - of - war of unforecasted winds made docking dangerous for passengers and the building's foundation. Moreover, it was illegal for dirigibles to fly over urban areas in case of failure. The spires also made it impossible for dirigibles to approach, as they could cause punctures. The builders spent sixty thousand on modifying the mooring mast at @ORGANIZATION2 to ensure safe dirigible docking. However, with the creation of modern new airplanes, this idea was ultimately abandoned. In the end, the combination of legal, natural, and technological factors made the dirigible docking plan unworkable.
735	15568	6	2	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. One issue was the use of hydrogen instead of helium in dirigibles, as hydrogen is highly flammable. Nature was also a major obstacle. There are always strong and dangerous winds on top of the building, which can cause dirigibles to swivel around, posing a risk. While dirigibles moored in open landing fields can be weighed down, using similar methods at the Empire State Building would have them dangling high above pedestrians, which is unsafe. Additionally, an existing law prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas. If a dirigible were to drift, the sharp spires of the building could puncture its shell. These are the reasons why attempting to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building is so difficult.
736	15569	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon, it details the obstacles the Empire State Building's builders faced to enable dirigibles to dock there. For instance, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. This clearly shows the challenges in implementing the dirigible - docking plan.
737	15570	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders encountered multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Firstly, installing a mooring mast would impose excessive stress on the building's frame, necessitating modifications and strengthening of the steel frame. Secondly, the winds on the building's top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Thirdly, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. In conclusion, these challenges made it extremely difficult to realize the plan of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
738	15571	6	2	There were significant problems when dirigibles tried to land. The dirigible could catch fire, which would lead to a disastrous situation. Attaching parts was also dangerous. The high - speed winds were a major issue. A burning dirigible could fall, causing the death of people below. Given these risks, it was evident that landing dirigibles in that location was an extremely hazardous endeavor.
739	15572	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous problems when trying to create a dock for dirigibles. They couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof. They had to consider the performance of the dirigible, strengthen the building's foundation, and create a landing area. Dirigibles could dock via an electric winch, but since it was in downtown New York, a densely populated area, it was very unsafe. Dirigibles, made of hydrogen and helium with hydrogen being highly flammable, could endanger people below if an accident occurred. There was also a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. Nature was the greatest obstacle, as the winds on the building's top shifted constantly due to violent air currents. Although the idea seemed good initially, too many factors could go wrong, making it unfeasible to implement the dirigible - docking plan.
740	15573	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the main concept was to build a mooring mast for dirigibles (blimps) to dock. As this was a pioneering idea, it presented numerous obstacles. Before constructing the mast, they had to stabilize the building with steel framework and other modifications, as the previous structure was insufficient to support the long dirigibles in high - blowing winds. Safety was another concern, as non - US blimps were filled with highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, which could endanger civilians in case of a fire. Even after the mast was built, high - speed winds prevented dirigibles from approaching the building. Despite the uniqueness of the idea, these many obstacles hindered its success.
741	15574	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. Initially, the threat of the Chrysler Building taking the title of the world's tallest building loomed large. To counter this, the architect added a 185 - foot spiral to the building. Subsequently, Al Smith had to devise an innovative solution to increase the building's height, leading to the idea of adding a mooring mast. However, this presented new problems. When building the mooring mast, the docking of dirigibles would exert intense stress on the building's framework. As a result, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened, with the architects spending @NUM2 dollars on these modifications to ensure stability. After the building was made capable of accommodating dirigibles, safety issues emerged. Dirigibles are filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and after the disaster in New Jersey, the builders were reluctant to take risks. Additionally, the strong winds above the building created air - currents that caused violent shifts of the dirigibles. Using weights, as done in other situations, was not an option as they would dangle above pedestrians. Moreover, there were existing regulations prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, which this docking plan would violate. Given these insurmountable obstacles, the idea of docking dirigibles on the mast was quickly abandoned.
742	15575	6	2	The construction team of the Empire State Building confronted a plethora of challenges while trying to make it possible for dirigibles to dock at the building. Firstly, the building's frame required strengthening. The weight of the dirigibles' load and the wind pressure needed to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation. This necessitated modifying the building's frame, which cost @NUM1 dollars. Secondly, docking dirigibles to the magnificent skyscraper proved to be extremely dangerous. After the Hindenburg caught fire, the owners of the @ORGANIZATION2 recognized how much more disastrous the accident could have been if it had occurred above a densely populated area. There were also existing regulations at the time that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. Finally, the most significant obstacle the engineers had to overcome was nature itself. The strong winds at the top of the building made it almost impossible for dirigibles to land. Both the Columbia and the Los Angeles attempted to dock at the mast but were unable to combat the wind. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building were unable to achieve the goal of having a dirigible dock at their tower.
743	15576	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was that when a dirigible was moored at the top of the building, it would add stress to the building's frame. The builders then had to ""modify and strengthen the Empire State Building to this new situation."" Another challenge was that dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. The builders were concerned about the possibility of an accident occurring above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Lastly, the builders had to deal with the forces of nature. The strong winds at the top of the building meant that dirigibles would need to be weighted down with lead weights at the back. However, this was neither safe nor practical as the weights would dangle above pedestrians in New York City. In conclusion, as described in ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders had to surmount many obstacles during the construction of the Empire State Building."
744	15577	6	2	"The builder of the Empire State Building faced significant difficulties in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. To better understand how dirigibles worked, the builder consulted with experts. It was also informed that due to the building's flat roof, architects could not install a mooring mast on top. Paragraph nine states that ""a thousand - foot dirigible held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" This stress would be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. The builder invested over sixty thousand dollars in making changes to the building. Despite spending so much time and money, it was ultimately determined that the plan would have to be abandoned. The greatest obstacle for the dirigibles was the wind; any movement in the air could cause problems. Although this plan failed, the Empire State Building still stands at 1,250 feet and is taller than the Chrysler Building."
745	15578	6	2	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" a historical article by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it becomes evident that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered at least three major obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. These obstacles were related to the building's pre - existing frame, fire safety, and nature. The original plans for the Empire State Building did not include a mooring mast on the roof. Consequently, architects had to completely revise their plans. As stated, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" which was a substantial challenge. Another concern was fire safety. The gas used in dirigibles made it a significant issue, as ""the owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" Overcoming this fire hazard was unfeasible. Finally, nature was the most formidable obstacle for the mast. As the article mentions, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The violent winds severely restricted the functionality of the mast. With these three significant obstacles, the future of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was bleak, and it would never fulfill Al Smith's intended purpose."
746	15579	6	2	The Empire State Building encountered several challenges regarding dirigible docking. There was a shortage of landing area, and the dirigible's body could swing, which were significant obstacles. Additionally, the winds atop the building constantly shifted due to violent air - currents. Flying dirigibles too low over urban areas violated airship laws. The @ORGANIZATION2 from Los Angeles couldn't get close enough to tie up the dirigible because of the wind. With numerous issues in passenger transportation, this method was ultimately discontinued.
747	15580	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders faced numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigible docking. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, architects couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the @ORGANIZATION2 building's flat roof as it would add stress to the building's frame. Paragraph @NUM2 indicates that nature was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast, with violent air - currents and unpromising landing techniques. Given that having a dirigible land at such a height was neither practical nor safe, the builders had to exercise great caution. Overall, these challenges made the plan of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a difficult endeavor.
748	15581	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders confronted many problems. A major concern, not recognized until the end, was the enormous safety risk. The builders aimed to make the mooring mast a docking point for dirigibles, blimps, and zeppelins from both domestic and foreign sources. However, foreign dirigibles often used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. A fire over a large city like New York would be a disaster. Moreover, dirigibles used large lead weights to descend, and using them in a city with the weights dangling over pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. Due to these issues, the plan faced significant hurdles."
749	15582	6	2	The idea of the mast on top of the Empire State Building was an under - developed concept that aimed to create a new transportation method but came with many flaws. Engineers faced the challenge of positioning a one - thousand - foot dirigible over a twelve - hundred - fifty - foot building. The combined wind pressure would stress the building's structure and could lead to collapse. It was also extremely dangerous for the public as many foreign dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. If dirigibles were allowed to dock, the back of the airship would spin around the mooring mast because of shifting violent air currents. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making dirigible docking on the Empire State Building illegal. These obstacles led to the failure of this transportation method, and the use of the mast ceased.
750	15583	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building struggled with multiple difficult obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock. One major issue was the constantly shifting winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents. The description of these shifting winds in the quote ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents"" shows how challenging it was for the builders. To address this, they considered weighing down the back with lead, but this was unsafe as the lead would dangle high above pedestrians on the street, as explained in the quote ""But using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was not safe"". Another problem was that an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, as stated in the quote ""@CAPS1 an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"". Clearly, the numerous obstacles made it very difficult for the builders to achieve their goal of dirigible docking."
751	15584	6	2	The construction of the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges for the builders aiming to enable dirigibles to dock there. One significant hurdle was the installation of the mooring mast. Architects could not simply place a mooring mast on the building's flat roof, as the weight of a blimp moored at the top by a single cable tether would exert stress on the frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would transfer all the way to the building's foundation, necessitating modifications and strengthening of the building to adapt to the new situation. Cost was also a major obstacle, as making the appropriate modifications to the building's framework would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Safety was another crucial concern. Most dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Given the densely populated areas, an accident over the city would have far - reaching consequences. Nature itself posed the greatest challenge. The winds on the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, its back would swivel. While dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down, using weights at such a height above pedestrians would be dangerous. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for ships to tie up to the building. These multiple obstacles provided practical reasons why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building.
752	15585	6	2	According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered several problems. One of the main issues was the actual docking of Zeppelins or dirigibles. At a height of @NUM1 ft in the air, the wind was extremely strong, which made docking difficult. Another problem was safety. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, safety became a major concern. Since most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, there was a significant fire safety risk. In conclusion, these problems, including the strong wind and the fire - safety issue related to the use of hydrogen, made it challenging for the builders to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
753	15586	6	2	"In @ORGANIZATION2's ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the key problems was the need for more support for the building's framework. As stated, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para @NUM1). This meant that modifications were necessary to strengthen the frame. The cost of these modifications was substantial. Over sixty thousand dollars were required to make the correct adjustments to the stressed frame, as indicated by the statement ""Over sixty - thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para @NUM1). There was also a lack of a suitable landing area. As mentioned, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para 6). In summary, these obstacles, namely the need for framework support, high modification costs, and the lack of a suitable landing area, made it difficult for the builders to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
754	15587	6	2	"In the excerpt from @ORGANIZATION2's The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges in facilitating dirigible docking. One such challenge was the lack of a suitable landing area. Architects could not simply install a mooring mast on the building's roof, as this would subject the building to extreme pressure. Additionally, a dirigible moored there would ""add stress to the building's frame,"" necessitating modifications and strengthening of the Empire State Building's steel frame. These modifications came at a high cost. Moreover, safety was a paramount concern. As stated, ""the greatest reason was safety."" A minor error in building the mast could impact every person in the building. The builders had to be mindful of all the citizens in the vicinity of the building. Ultimately, these obstacles determined the fate of the mast, making it a complex and challenging endeavor to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
755	15588	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for an aircraft to fly too close to the city. The building's structure was also a significant problem. If a blimp were to dock, it would add stress to the building's frame, as described by the statement ""would add stress to the buildings Frame"". The wind was yet another obstacle. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. When a blimp was docked on the tower, the wind would push it around in all directions. In conclusion, these legal, structural, and natural obstacles combined to make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
756	15589	6	2	The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was constructed with the specific purpose of facilitating dirigible docking. At the time of the mast's construction, the viability of this concept was not questioned, yet safety concerns loomed large. A significant issue was that most non - U.S. dirigibles utilized hydrogen gas, which is highly flammable. The tragic incident of the German dirigible Hindenburg being destroyed in flames deeply worried the Empire State Building's owners. They contemplated the catastrophic consequences if a dirigible were to combust on the building, especially in the densely populated downtown New York area. As a result, the builders of the Empire State Building re - evaluated the decision to allow dirigibles to dock at its mooring mast.
757	15590	6	2	During the story, the workers of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles while attempting to enable dirigible docking. One of the initial challenges was getting a thousand - foot dirigible to moor at the building's top. A single cable tether held the dirigible, and this transferred all the dirigible's load and wind pressure to the building's foundation, which was eleven hundred feet below. This added stress to the building's frame. Another major obstacle was the high flammability of the hydrogen in the dirigible. Given that the Empire State Building is located in downtown New York, the destruction of a dirigible would cause a large number of casualties. The constantly changing winds at the building's top were also a significant hurdle, making landing extremely difficult. Additionally, it was against the law for airships to fly too low in urban areas. In conclusion, these obstacles made it very challenging to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
758	15591	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. One issue was the realization that the building was at risk of losing the title of the world's tallest building. Moreover, some of the builder's opinions were contradicted by facts. Another problem was the need to complete all the planned tasks on time. The builder needed to have a more realistic approach rather than relying on overly optimistic thinking. Many of the obstacles were related to ""nature itself."" For example, the wind would cause the dirigible to swivel around, adding to the complexity of docking. In conclusion, these challenges made it difficult to proceed with the plan of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
759	15592	6	2	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it is detailed how the concept of landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned due to numerous obstacles. The engineers @CAPS2 identified the first design flaw as the stress the dirigible would impose on the building's frame. A dirigible of that mass attached to the building by a single cable tether would transfer a significant load to the building's foundation (described as @CAPS1). Safety was the most significant obstacle the engineers @CAPS2 faced in permitting dirigible docking. Since dirigibles used hydrogen, they were highly flammable, creating a dangerous situation over a densely populated area like downtown New York. The builders @CAPS2 also had to contend with the wind. The winds at that altitude were extremely strong. As stated in Chapter @NUM1, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" endangering the ship's passengers. In summary, ""The Mooring Mast"" clearly shows that landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building was nearly an impossible feat."
760	15593	6	2	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @PERSON1, two main obstacles are presented regarding the Empire State Building's builders' attempt to allow dirigible docking. The first obstacle was an uncontrollable natural factor. High - speed air currents would cause the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast. If the dirigible could not dock properly, it would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" which was neither practical nor safe. The second obstacle was the existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over cities. As the author noted, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Due to these challenges from nature and pre - existing legislation, the builders of the Empire State Building had to grapple with complex problems, and in the end, it was highly difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking on the building."
761	15594	6	2	The excerpt reveals that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when attempting to make it suitable for dirigibles. Firstly, there was a lack of a proper landing area. Secondly, accommodating a thousand - foot dirigible at the building's top would cost sixty thousand dollars for a new station. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, preventing dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building. These three obstacles made it difficult for dirigibles to become a part of the future, which is why airplanes are now the norm.
762	15595	6	2	"The builders aiming to enable dirgibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges. One issue was the structural strain. Attaching a large blimp to the building's peak would impose excessive stress on its frame, as Lusted noted: ""A thousand - foot dirgible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" Thus, significant revisions to the structure's frame were necessary. Another obstacle was nature. The constantly shifting wind currents on the building's top made it unsafe for dirigibles. As described, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirgible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" endangering passengers boarding or alighting. There was also a law that restricted ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" These combined obstacles prevented the builders from devising a safe way to dock dirigibles."
763	15596	6	2	Architects of the Empire State Building faced insurmountable obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Nature was an adversary, with the strong, constantly - shifting winds on the building's top posing a hazard to dirigibles. Mooring dirigibles with weights was not an option as it would endanger pedestrians. An existing law prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas, making it illegal for them to dock at the Empire State Building. Moreover, there was a risk of a dirigible accidentally igniting and crashing onto New York. The destruction of the Hindenburg made it clear that having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building was not feasible.
764	15597	6	2	"The architects of the Empire State Building encountered numerous problems when trying to install landing gear on the mooring mast. Landing a dirigible or blimp on the building presented significant safety concerns. In a densely populated area like New York City, it was not safe to land a blimp. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire on May 6, 1937, the building's owners realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had occurred over downtown New York. They couldn't take such a risk, so the competition for landing gear was canceled. Another major factor was the wind current on top of the building. It was extremely difficult to keep a blimp level at high altitudes. As described, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" which could lead to the blimp detaching and hitting other buildings. Therefore, landing blimps on the Empire State Building was both dangerous and difficult."
765	15598	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, workers and builders attempted to create a docking area for dirigibles (blimps). However, they encountered many obstacles. There was a lack of a suitable landing area, and despite the workers' efforts, it was insufficient. They should have planned for a larger area from the start. The most significant obstacle was nature. Experienced builders should have anticipated the stronger winds at higher altitudes. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and they should have checked for such regulations. All the work done was in vain. These obstacles that the workers and builders faced could have been prevented, and thus, the money and time spent need not have been wasted."
766	15599	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2, it is revealed that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. For instance, “The Obstacle to their expanded use into New York City was lack of a suitable landing area.” This indicates that the mooring mast presented a problem as there was no appropriate landing area, making it difficult for dirigibles to land and rendering it unsuitable for docking. Another example is “A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building frame,” which shows that the building was not stable enough for landings. Additionally, “The greatest obstacles to the successful use of a mooring mast was nature itself,” demonstrating that the changeable weather could affect landings. These examples collectively illustrate the various obstacles the builders faced in the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2.
767	15600	6	2	The utilization of the mast on the Empire State Building for dirigibles was fraught with multiple obstacles. Violent winds, insufficient structural support, and anti - low - flying aircraft laws made its use unfeasible. High winds could cause the rear of the aircraft and the entire dirigible to spin around the spire, and providing the necessary structural support was extremely risky. The most significant hindrance, however, was an “existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.” As a result of these factors, the mast was ultimately not put to use.
768	15601	6	2	The builders faced nature as a major obstacle when attempting to allow dirigibles, or “blimps,” to dock on the Empire State Building. Wind currents could move the end of the blimp, and if passengers were boarding or disembarking while the blimp was being moved by the wind, they could easily fall off. Another issue was the lead weights dangling from the end of the blimps. These weights were used to prevent the blimp from changing directions due to wind currents, but they posed a safety concern for street pedestrians. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it is quoted that “… that using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe.” This quote confirms that having weights on the back of the blimp was dangerous, as if they were to fall off, someone on the streets could be seriously injured. In conclusion, these obstacles made it difficult to dock blimps on the Empire State Building.
769	15602	6	2	Building docks for dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building was a significant challenge for Al Smith. The steel frame of the building had to be strengthened because the load of the dirigible and wind pressure would exert excessive stress on the building's frame. Dirigibles were highly flammable, posing a great safety risk to the workers inside the building and the people on the street. Violent air currents at the top of the building made it impossible to monitor the dirigible's movements. The primary reason the docks for dirigibles were unworkable was the law against airships, which prohibited them from flying low over urban areas. Overall, the invention of dirigible docks on the Empire State Building was both unrealistic and unsafe.
770	15603	6	2	In “The @CAPS1 Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, which made the project extremely difficult to implement. Workers encountered safety problems due to chemicals and certain gases. “Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.” (Amidon L¸sted ∂ @NUM1 lines @NUM2 + @NUM3) “The owners of the Empire State Building realised how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.” (Amidon L¸sted ∂ @NUM1 lines @NUM5). Moreover, nature was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. “The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents.” In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building in the excerpt “The @CAPS1 Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted faced many uncontrollable obstacles.
771	15604	6	2	The Empire State Building's construction presented challenges to its builders, particularly in relation to the fast winds. The giant needle atop the building swayed back and forth due to these winds, making it difficult to keep in place. Additionally, bringing dirigibles or blimps towards the giant needle was an issue. The blimps, which were made only of cotton fabric, could be punctured. In conclusion, these wind - related and docking - related obstacles added significant complexity to the construction of the Empire State Building.
772	15605	6	2	According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One hurdle was the large size of dirigibles, which could be dangerous. As stated, “A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame,” indicating that constructing the mast would be more difficult than anticipated. Another obstacle was the need to modify the building. “The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.” The most significant obstacle was safety. “Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.” Overall, these were the main obstacles the builders faced.
773	15606	6	2	In the short story “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome multiple hurdles to allow dirigibles to dock. A suitable landing area was required, but this was not easy to achieve. Placing a mooring mast on top of the building was no simple task; as the @CAPS1 mentioned, “The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof.” Any attempt to add a solution to make it work would stress the building and potentially cause it to collapse. Wind pressure also played a major role. The winds made it hard to keep the dirigibles stable. Adding weights to hold them down was considered, but as the @CAPS1 stated, “Could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe.” In conclusion, the builders faced an overwhelming number of problems.
774	15607	6	2	The aviation pioneers' dream of dirigible travel was a difficult one to achieve. Architects and engineers who aimed to establish a mooring mast had high hopes, even meeting with the president. However, a dirigible “held by a single cable tether” would not be stable enough as it would overly stress the building frame. If they were to proceed, the Empire State Building would need to be modified and strengthened to adapt to the new placement of the dirigible. Instead, the architects first assigned a “shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower” and then designed the mooring mast. Before the mooring mast could be completed, the roof had to be finished. The main problem with the mooring mast was nature. Winds could easily disrupt it, causing the dirigible to shift. Also, a “law against airships flying too low” would be broken by the dirigible. Due to these obstacles, the attempt to create a mooring mast gradually failed.
775	15608	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many struggles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. First, they consulted experts to assess the safety of the equipment. They took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION2 in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Then, they had trouble placing the mooring mast on the building's flat roof. Strengthening the building's framework would require @MONEY1 worth of modifications. Safety was a major concern from the start, as the hydrogen gas in the dirigible is highly flammable. However, the biggest issue was nature. The strong and violent winds on top of the building made the work extremely difficult. In conclusion, these combined challenges made it nearly impossible for the builders to achieve their goal of enabling dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
776	15609	6	2	The builders encountered numerous obstacles in their pursuit of the goal to dock dirigibles. One significant issue was that the majority of dirigibles globally utilized hydrogen gas, which is highly flammable. This posed a great danger at high altitudes. Moreover, nature itself presented the most formidable obstacle. The winds at the docking location were constantly changing, making it extremely difficult to maintain the stability of the dirigible, especially as its back end extended far from the tower. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas, which also contributed to the infeasibility of the docking plan. In conclusion, these multiple challenges made it extremely difficult for the builders to achieve their goal of dirigible docking.
777	15610	6	2	"The challenges faced by the Empire State Building's builders were all related to the addition of the mooring mast. Firstly, the architects had to modify the steel frame of the building. They were aware that the large mooring mass couldn't simply be placed on the flat roof. As Marcia Amidon Løsted explains, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). To adapt to this situation, they spent over @MONEY1 on framework modification. Secondly, safety issues regarding the new mooring mast emerged. These concerns stemmed from the incident where the Hindenburg, a German dirigible, was destroyed by fire at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Since the U.S. used hydrogen (which is more flammable than helium) in dirigibles, the risks were higher. Løsted writes, ""the owners of the Empire State realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (Løsted @NUM2). In the end, by the late 1930s, it became clear that the mooring mast was impractical as dirigibles were being replaced by airplanes."
778	15611	6	2	When constructing the Empire State Building with the intention of allowing dirigibles to dock, the builders faced multiple obstacles. Firstly, they couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the building's roof. The mast, along with the dirigible's load and wind pressure, would add a large amount of stress to the framework, necessitating its modification and strengthening. Secondly, safety was a major concern. Most dirigibles were highly flammable, and having them fly over a densely populated city like New York was impractical. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to tie up or approach the building. Thirdly, the wind at that height was constantly shifting due to violent air currents, and there was a fear that the wind could blow the ships into the sharp spires of other buildings. Due to these obstacles and the declining interest in dirigibles, the project was ultimately discontinued.
779	15612	6	2	"New technology, particularly in aviation, demands effort and presents numerous obstacles. To make the mooring mast on the Empire State Building successful, the builders needed to figure out how to keep the dirigible attached to the building and enable passengers to embark and disembark. As the text states, ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on"" (6). However, passengers were not the only challenge. The stress a dirigible would exert on the building was too great, so the building itself had to be remodeled. The text supports this with, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM1). Despite all these modifications, the mooring mast was bound to fail due to reasons beyond the builders' control. In conclusion, the difficulties associated with new aviation - related technology led to the unsuccessful outcome of the mooring mast project."
780	15613	6	2	"According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when planning for dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the first obstacle. Most dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION3 were filled with hydrogen, which is much more flammable than helium. This concern was heightened by the incident on May 6, 1937, when the German dirigible Hindenburg, filled with hydrogen, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The second obstacle was nature. As described, ""The winds... were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM1). This made it unsafe for passengers to disembark and posed a risk of the dirigible hitting nearby objects. The third obstacle was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. In conclusion, as shown by the excerpt, the builders faced multiple significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
781	15614	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to moor there. These included the building's framing, its height, and the areas for passenger landing and docking. The building's frame was a crucial factor. If a thousand - foot dirigible were to moor on top, it would add stress to the building's structure and frame, transferring the load to the foundation. Wind pressure and directional changes would also push the dirigible, further stressing the building. Initially, the building was designed to have @NUM1 floors. To allow a dirigible to dock and handle passenger loading and unloading, more space and height were required. An observation room and a boarding area had to be incorporated. After redesign, the building reached 102 floors, with the 101st floor serving as both an observation room and a boarding area. Among the many obstacles in the design for dirigible mooring, strengthening the building's framing was the most significant. Once strengthened, a dirigible could moor on the top without endangering the building's structure.
782	15615	6	2	"Competitive architect Al Smith aimed to make the Empire State Building the tallest and most unique structure. As stated, ""Their top, they said, would serve a higher calling"" (@NUM1). The building was intended to support the dirigible - based transportation era. Al Smith remarked, ""It's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now"" (@NUM2). However, the architects were unaware of the potential problems with the mast. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock. Safety was a major concern. Dirigibles from outside the United States often used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. Nature also posed a challenge. Violent air currents caused shifting winds, making it dangerous as the back of the dirigible would twist around the mooring mast. Moreover, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie to the building. By the late 1930s, dirigibles, instead of becoming the future of transportation, were replaced by airplanes."
783	15616	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many difficult tasks. They needed to ensure the mooring mast was stable enough for docking. Additionally, due to the original Chrysler building adding another 46 feet to remain the tallest, the architects of the Empire State Building had to add more floors. They combined the 85th floor with the mooring mast, bringing the total height of the Empire State Building to 1,250 feet. The mooring mast ultimately failed. One reason was the high flammability of dirigibles, and in a densely populated area like New York, a fire would be catastrophic. Also, the violent air currents and shifting winds caused the back of the dirigible to move around the mooring mast. In conclusion, these challenges made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
784	15617	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One significant concern was the safety of the people on the streets below. As clearly stated in paragraph @NUM1, if a dirigible caught fire, it would be ""Much worse if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" Another obstacle was a law mentioned in paragraph @NUM2, which prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie to the building or approach the area. The most challenging obstacle was nature. As stated in paragraph @NUM3, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These winds would make the dirigible swivel around the mooring mast. An idea proposed using lead weights to stabilize dirigibles, similar to those in open landing fields. However, this was not feasible at the Empire State Building due to safety reasons. The weights would dangle above people on the street, and flyers approaching the building would fear the wind blowing the dirigible onto the sharp spires of nearby buildings. Overall, these obstacles made it extremely difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
785	15618	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. One issue was related to the gases dirigibles use to stay aloft. As mentioned in paragraph 6, the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City was an obstacle to the expanded use of dirigibles. According to paragraph @NUM1, if a mooring mast was dropped onto the building's roof and a single cable tether was used, it would add stress to the building. Modifying the building and its framework to handle this stress cost over sixty thousand dollars. Most dirigibles outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Paragraph @NUM2 pointed out that nature was also a major hurdle. The winds on the building, constantly shifting due to violent air currents, affected the mooring mast. Ultimately, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was unable to fulfill its purpose, and these issues should have been considered before construction.
786	15619	6	2	The constructors of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. The architects couldn't simply install the mooring mast on the flat roof. A dirigible would be tethered to the building by a single cable, which would impose stress on the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure needed to be transferred to the foundation. Thus, the building's steel frame had to be modified and strengthened to adapt to this new situation, and these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars. The building's design was centered around the mooring mast, and the new modifications were solely for supporting the blimp, without considering other factors like natural winds. In conclusion, the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building faced significant structural and cost - related challenges.
787	15620	6	2	According to the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, when the constructors of the Empire State Building tried to let dirigibles dock there, they faced many difficulties. Safety is always a top priority in any building project. The main reason was safety concerns. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. At that time, dirigibles, or blimps, were generally unsafe. If a dirigible burned down in the middle of the country, the death toll and repair costs would be much lower than if it burned down in downtown New York City. One of the greatest challenges for the constructors was that landing flammable blimps in the middle of a city posed a serious safety hazard, potentially causing many casualties and city destruction. In conclusion, safety risks made it extremely difficult to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
788	15621	6	2	As stated in the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” written by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. In paragraph @NUM1 under “The Fate of the Mast”, it is mentioned that the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. Strong winds caused by violent air currents made it impossible to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building as the wind could blow the dirigible off the mast into New York City. In paragraph @NUM2 under “The Fate of the Mast”, it is stated that an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas was another practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the building. This law prohibited dirigibles and other aircraft from flying in urban areas like New York. Additionally, safety precautions were a major concern. As paragraph @NUM3 indicates, most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen. A crash of a dirigible with this highly flammable gas would lead to a massive disaster. In conclusion, violent winds, laws, and safety precautions all hindered the docking of dirigibles at the mooring mast.
789	15622	6	2	When the builders designed the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building for dirigible docking, they faced several obstacles. A dirigible is a blimp filled with hydrogen and/or helium to stay airborne. The builders didn't anticipate that hydrogen is highly flammable. If a dirigible docked on the building and there was movement, it could catch fire and cause the building to explode. Another issue was the strong winds. With a dirigible docked at a high altitude, it was unstable for people to disembark. The powerful winds would make the back of the dirigible swivel around the mooring mast since only the front was weighted down. Also, docking a dirigible would place it too close to an urban area. It would be too near pedestrians, creating an unsafe environment in case of an accident. Due to these many obstacles, the idea of docking dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building was abandoned. In conclusion, safety and environmental factors made the dirigible - docking plan unfeasible.
790	15623	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the need to modify the building's steel frame to “accommodate the new situation”. As paragraph @NUM1 states, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework, indicating that this was a costly project. The excerpt also mentions that there were problems with keeping the dirigible stationary. The dirigible would be in a windy area, and with only one chord attaching it to the building, the back of the dirigible would move around freely. In conclusion, the high - cost modifications and the difficulty of keeping the dirigible in place were significant challenges to allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
791	15624	6	2	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders encountered obstacles of safety, nature, and law when attempting to dock dirigibles atop the Empire State Building. Safety was a major concern. As the excerpt stated, most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. In a densely populated area like New York, the risk of a dirigible catching fire and causing massive chaos was unacceptable. Nature also posed a problem. The winds on top of the building shifted constantly due to violent air currents. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, its back would swivel around it. This meant dirigibles couldn't be secured properly and many would be destroyed. Finally, there was the law. An existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This was the most crucial reason. While they might have taken risks on other issues, they had no choice regarding the law. In conclusion, the builders could not overcome the obstacles of safety, nature, and law to make the mast functional."
792	15625	6	2	The Empire State Building builders faced numerous challenges when it came to docking airships. One obvious issue was the high - altitude docking danger. A fire accident at such a height could endanger the entire area. The building already had significant modifications, and additional work was unwanted. Maneuverability was the most important hurdle. The strong winds made it extremely difficult, almost impossible, to control and dock the blimp. Moreover, a law banned all types of aircraft from flying at low altitudes. Given these challenges, docking airships at the Empire State Building was not a feasible option.
793	15626	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in enabling dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a primary concern as New York is a densely populated area, and many dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. The builders realized that a dirigible would be hanging by a single cable tether, which would stress the frame. To address this, they needed to adjust and strengthen the building's frame, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Even after this adjustment, other problems remained. Since the building was in a highly populated area, many pedestrians walked below the docking area. The winds at the top would cause the dirigible to blow around, and lead weights could not be used due to the risk of them falling. Overall, these obstacles made it very difficult to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
794	15627	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the Empire State Building builders faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One such obstacle occurred when Al Smith realized he was close to not winning the title of the world's tallest building, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. He then announced that the building would reach 1,250 feet. This was an obstacle because without a proper building, he couldn't make the dirigible. Smith always desired competition, so his building had to be the tallest and he had to build the dirigible. In summary, these factors presented significant challenges to the goal of enabling dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
795	15628	6	2	The Empire State Building builders faced problems in allowing dirigibles to dock. Many dirigibles from other countries were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. The winds at the top of the building shifted constantly due to violent air currents, which could cause the dirigible to wrap around the building. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to approach the building. Additionally, the builders had to spend @MONEY1 to upgrade the framework to avoid excessive strain on the building's top. Considering all these problems, it was highly challenging to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
796	15629	6	2	"In Marcia Amidon Lusted's ""The Mooring Mast,"" the architects and builders encountered substantial obstacles while attempting to implement the plan of docking dirigibles. The architects couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the building's top with a single cable tether would impose stress on the building's frame. With the large dirigible in the air and the wind blowing, the building's structure could be damaged. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. The dirigible would tug the building back and forth due to the wind. Thus, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to adapt to this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were required for the building's framework. In essence, to build a docking station, the architects would have to transform the entire building's construction."
797	15630	6	2	Enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges. One such challenge was the lack of a suitable landing area for their expanded use in New York City. Some dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, equivalent to four blocks in New York. Another issue was that a mooring mast couldn't be simply placed on the Empire State Building's flat roof. Doing so would add stress to the building's frame and to the dirigibles moored there. In conclusion, these obstacles made the implementation of the docking plan quite difficult.
798	15631	6	2	The workers on the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Safety was a major concern, especially when it came to docking over a large city. Having a large aircraft with passengers hovering over a populated area was not safe. A significant safety precaution was that many dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The risk of a fire over a city was unacceptable. Additionally, dirigibles were not legally allowed to get close enough to the Empire State Building to dock. Construction and location also posed problems. The mast was so high that violent air currents prevented dirigibles from docking, and some blimps lacked proper mooring equipment. Overall, the project was unrealistic, making it a great challenge for the workers to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
799	15632	6	2	The builders faced a tough obstacle as they tried to incorporate dirigibles into the overall construction of the Empire State Building and compete in the relevant field. Dirigibles were an important part of the building process, but they encountered difficult obstacles such as [presumably specific obstacles represented by @CAPS5 and @CAPS6], height, and others. These were the key issues. Dirigibles were not heavy; they were made of light materials, which affected their ability to dock properly. In summary, these factors contributed to the challenges the builders faced in relation to dirigibles during the construction of the Empire State Building.
800	15633	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building confronted obstacles related to nature and safety when allowing dirigibles to dock. Safety was a significant factor in the building process. Two main safety concerns were safely boarding and disembarking passengers from dirigibles and the substances used to fill them. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The other obstacle was nature. Violent air currents caused wind speed shifts, making dirigibles swivel around. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around it. Due to these nature - and safety - related issues, the builders faced difficulties in enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
801	15634	6	2	When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to enable dirigibles to dock on the building, they encountered multiple obstacles. One significant obstacle was the strong and constantly - shifting wind currents on the building's top. As described in paragraph @NUM1, these violent air currents would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast. Another issue was the additional stress on the building's foundation. According to paragraph @NUM2, the steel frame of the Empire State Building needed modification and strengthening to handle this new situation. The danger of fire and the risk to people below, as discussed in paragraph @NUM3, were also major concerns. Moreover, an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM4, posed a hurdle. These are some of the many significant obstacles the builders faced while trying to dock dirigibles on the world's then - tallest building.
802	15635	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building aimed to allow dirigibles to dock there, but this was no easy task. They couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the flat roof because they had to account for the size of the dirigibles. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Transmitting the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure was also difficult. The stress had to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below, and the steel frame of the building would need modification and strengthening. Additionally, improving the building's framework came with a high cost, as ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (paragraph @NUM1). These factors made the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock a challenging endeavor for the builders."
803	15636	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced the obstacle of having to make the building taller when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. They added a mooring mast to the top of the building. This was to enable dirigibles to anchor for a few hours for refueling, servicing, and to allow passengers to board or disembark. When the dirigibles docked, an electric winch hauled in a line from the front of the ship and tied it to the mast. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless tower that would be illuminated from within. The roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could commence. Fortunately, everything went according to the builders' plan.
804	15637	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. There was a law restricting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Anchoring the back of the blimp was also unfeasible, and the shifting winds at that height made it unsafe for passengers to board or alight. The building needed to be rebuilt to remain stable when a dirigible was attached. Another issue was the difference in gases used to keep the blimps afloat. Most dirigibles from outside of @LOCATION1 used hydrogen, which is highly flammable and extremely unsafe. These challenges made it difficult for the builders to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
805	15638	6	2	They faced challenges regarding how to anchor dirigibles on the building. There was no truly safe way to accomplish this. The gas that kept the dirigibles afloat was highly flammable, creating a major safety concern. In the end, they realized that the endeavor was too dangerous. Taking the risk could lead to the death of innocent people if something went wrong. Thus, it became clear that allowing dirigibles to dock was not a viable option.
806	15639	6	2	Dirigibles encountered multiple obstacles. They were at risk of fire, rupture, and legal issues. Since dirigibles contained hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, there was a constant fear of fire. The Hindenburg disaster in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, was a tragic event that no one wanted to repeat. Additionally, the concern of dirigibles bursting was heightened. Strong winds could blow them off - course into buildings with sharp tops that might puncture the balloons, especially in the densely - populated downtown New York. Moreover, the Empire State Building advocated for a law restricting low - flying aircraft over urban areas, which meant the planned use of dirigibles could not be realized. In conclusion, these various obstacles made the operation of dirigibles extremely challenging.
807	15640	6	2	The primary obstacle faced by the Empire State Building's builders in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock was the shifting winds on the building's top, caused by violent air currents. These winds prevented dirigibles from remaining stationary for passengers to disembark. In December 1930, the USS Los Angeles dirigible approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up due to strong winds. Strong winds also posed a risk of pushing the dirigible into sharp objects. After this attempt, a law was in place against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. The winds were the most significant obstacle as they placed tremendous stress on the building. Ultimately, these factors combined to make it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
808	15641	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered more problems than anticipated. Firstly, the building's frame was unable to support an enormous dirigible. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transferred to the building's foundation, necessitating over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework, which was a costly and major obstacle. Secondly, natural winds were a problem. The winds on the building's top constantly shifted due to violent air currents, which could make the back of the blimps swivel around the mooring mast, making boarding and alighting from the dirigibles difficult and dangerous. Finally, there were laws against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. Realizing these insurmountable obstacles, the builders concluded that the mooring mast would not be successful.
809	15642	6	2	Dirigibles were regarded as the future of transportation, superior to balloons. In New York City, there was a shortage of suitable landing areas for dirigibles, leading to the idea of using the Empire State Building. Landing on the building would enable dirigibles to anchor for refueling and other services. However, the architects couldn't simply install a mooring mast. The building's frame couldn't support an enormous dirigible; the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure required significant modifications to the framework, costing a large sum. Engineers designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless - steel tower with four - winged corners. Floors 86 and 102 served as an observation area and double - functioned as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Workers celebrated completing the building's frame after two months. But hopes were dashed as the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was neither safe nor practical due to numerous obstacles faced by the builders.
810	15643	6	2	Transforming the mast on the Empire State Building into a dock for dirigibles presented numerous obstacles. These included the presence of flammable gas in dirigibles, the danger of operating in a densely populated area, constantly shifting winds due to air currents, and the risk of dangling above pedestrians. Dirigibles are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and a fire could have catastrophic consequences. Being above a densely populated area means that any failure of the dirigible could endanger innocent bystanders. The shifting winds also increase the risk of the dirigible being popped by nearby objects or buildings. Due to these safety concerns, it is extremely difficult to convert the mast into a loading dock for dirigibles. In conclusion, the lack of safety makes this conversion an unfeasible endeavor.
811	15644	6	2	The construction of the Empire State Building with the intention of allowing dirigibles to dock presented numerous challenges to its builders. Safety was a major concern, as foreign dirigibles commonly used highly flammable hydrogen gas to remain airborne. In a densely - populated area like New York City, a fire on a dirigible would pose a significant threat. Additionally, the turbulent wind at the height of the mooring mast made it difficult for dirigibles to stay stationary. This instability would make it extremely arduous for passengers to board or disembark safely. One proposed solution was to use lead weights to stabilize the blimp, but this was also dangerous as the weights could fall and harm pedestrians. Despite the theoretical usefulness of a mooring mast, it was ultimately neither a safe nor a practical option.
812	15645	6	2	During the process of attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, its builders encountered multiple obstacles. Architects couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible, moored at the top by a single cable tether, would put additional stress on the building's frame. As a result, modifications were necessary to strengthen and adapt the building's framework. Nature also presented a significant hurdle. The winds on top of the building constantly shifted due to violent air currents, causing dirigibles to swivel above pedestrians, which was neither practical nor safe. Due to these challenges, the Empire State Building was never able to fulfill its intended purpose of serving as a dirigible docking station.
813	15646	6	2	When the builders of the Empire State Building tried to allow dirigibles to dock there, they faced several obstacles. Architects couldn't just place a mooring mast on top of the building. They also had to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building, which would cost sixty thousand dollars in modifications. Engineers had to devise a practical and workable arrangement, and government officials in Washington were looking for a safe way to moor airships to the mast. However, this idea was neither practical nor safe, as all the equipment would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. Moreover, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. These factors combined to create significant challenges for the builders in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
814	15647	6	2	"The builders and architects of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles and dilemmas during its construction. One major issue was the funding required to build such a large - scale structure. They repeatedly constructed and reconstructed the building's frame in a fruitless effort to achieve the desired perfection. Another significant obstacle arose when they realized that not all dirigibles intended to land on the mast were fueled by helium. As the text states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Given the high - risk nature of using hydrogen in a populated area, they had to abandon the idea of the mooring mast."
815	15648	6	2	"The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" reveals that creating a safe docking station for dirigibles was no easy task. One of the challenges faced was that dirigibles from other countries were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. In the event of a fire, these dirigibles could catch fire over the world's most populated city. Another problem was the strong wind at the top of the Empire State Building. The wind made it difficult for dirigible pilots to steer, tossing the dirigibles around and forcing pilots to keep their hands on the controls at all times. These were just two of the many difficulties that pilots and architects had to overcome when attempting to dock dirigibles at the mast."
816	15649	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders faced numerous obstacles when attempting to have dirigibles dock there. They consulted experts by touring the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station and also met with the president of a formed airship transport company to address these issues.
817	15650	6	2	When the builders of the Empire State Building planned to have dirigibles dock there, they encountered several obstacles. Landing was a challenge as New York lacked a proper landing area for dirigibles, and architects couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. Safety was also a major concern, especially after a German dirigible was destroyed by fire. The building's owners realized the potential for a far worse accident in a densely - populated area like New York. Nature added to the difficulties, with constantly shifting winds on top of the building. Using lead weights on the dirigible, which was the proposed solution, was unsafe as they would dangle over pedestrians. Additionally, there was a law restricting airships from flying too low over urban areas. These combined obstacles made it very difficult to use the Empire State Building for dirigible docking.
818	15651	6	2	"According to the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles that prevented it from being used for its intended purpose of allowing dirigibles to stop and refuel. There were three main issues: modifications, nature, and the law. The building required an investment of @MONEY1 for framework modifications. Nature was a problem as winds made the back of dirigibles move around, and adding weights to the back was unsafe. The law prohibited dirigibles from flying as low as the height of the Empire State Building and from flying low over urban areas. These obstacles ultimately hindered the building's ability to serve as a refueling stop for dirigibles."
819	15652	6	2	"Based on the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building's builders faced significant obstacles in enabling dirigibles to dock. The dirigible's weight and wind pressure around the building caused excessive stress on the building's frame, necessitating strengthening and modification of the steel frame at an investment of over sixty thousand dollars. Safety was another major concern. Many dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. The destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire in 1937 in New Jersey highlighted this risk. The owners of the Empire State Building recognized that such an accident could have been far more catastrophic in a densely - populated area like downtown New York. Nature also posed a problem, with constantly shifting winds at the top of the building. Placing lead weights on the dirigible to prevent shifting was not an option due to the threat to pedestrians below. In conclusion, these obstacles prevented the Empire State Building from becoming a major landing spot for dirigibles."
820	15653	6	2	"When architects and engineers were designing a dirigible dock at the top of the Empire State Building, they faced multiple obstacles that were inevitable for such a large - scale project. Architecturally, a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top would add stress to the building's frame, requiring a redesign for the building's long - term stability. Nature was another hurdle, as violent air currents caused constantly shifting winds on the building's top, making the dock difficult to reach and extremely unsafe. Legally, existing laws against airships flying too low over urban areas restricted and ultimately halted the project. It's clear that some crucial factors were overlooked during the moor's design, likely due to @ORGANIZATION2's competitive attitude. As a result, ""The Mooring Mast was never destined to fulfill its purpose."
821	15654	6	2	The excerpt “The Mooring Mast” reveals that the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles in its attempts to enable dirigibles to dock. One significant hurdle was the additional stress a docked dirigible would place on the building's frame. To address this, modifications and strengthening worth sixty thousand dollars were required. Another challenge was that non - US dirigibles often used flammable hydrogen instead of helium. A fire incident similar to the German Hindenburg disaster in New York would have far more severe consequences. Wind was also an issue, causing the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Moreover, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building. Evidently, numerous obstacles stood in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
822	15655	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to construct a mooring mast for dirigibles. One major obstacle was dealing with the extra stress a docked dirigible would impose. As author Marcia Amidon L¸sted notes in “The Mooring Mast,” “the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation.” Violent weather at the building's peak was another problem. L¸sted states that “Even if the dirigibles was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and break the mooring mast.” This made it unsafe for passengers to disembark and use a gangplank connected to the building. The wind also made it difficult for dirigibles to navigate to the mooring mast without hitting nearby buildings. Ensuring the safety of the mooring mast was a crucial and challenging task. L¸nden points out that “most dirigibles from outside the U.S use hydrogn rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.” A fire in a densely populated area like New York would result in numerous casualties. These were some of the many challenges the builders faced when attempting to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building.
823	15656	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant trouble and confusion when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Since this had never been done before, they were uncertain what to expect, apart from the need for a mooring mast. Initially, Al Smith and his team thought it was an amazing, forward - looking idea. However, they encountered complications during their research on dirigibles with @ORGANIZATION1. The process was complex as it involved working at a great height and a lot of practice. The building was not strong enough to hold a dirigible, so they made alterations worth @MONEY1. Eventually, they realized it was an unsafe idea, especially considering the highly flammable helium. Then, the government introduced a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building. As a result, the top floors were converted into a soda fountain.
824	15657	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Most of these problems arose during the mast - design phase. They discovered that they couldn't simply install a mooring mast on top of the thousand - foot - high building as it was not structurally strong enough. To address this, they had to reinforce the building with a new steel frame. Safety was also a major concern. At a thousand feet, the air currents were extremely violent. By the end of the construction, it became clear that dirigibles could not land on the Empire State Building.
825	15658	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that precluded dirigibles from landing there. Tethering dirigibles to the building's mast was too dangerous for four main reasons. Firstly, a dirigible moored to the mast would add stress to the building's frame. However, this issue was resolved by modifying the steel frame to make it strong enough to withstand the additional stress. Secondly, dirigibles using hydrogen gas are highly flammable. A fire in downtown New York would have catastrophic consequences, making it too risky. Thirdly, the winds on top of the building would cause the back of the dirigible to “swivel around and around the mooring mast,” posing a safety threat. Finally, the sharp spires of nearby buildings could puncture the dirigible's shell. Flying at a low altitude would endanger people. In conclusion, due to these numerous dangers, dirigibles could not land at the Empire State Building.
826	15659	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when constructing a proper mooring mast for zeppelins, which also involved concerns about the safety of city residents. They had to take the weather into account and consider how it might affect the blimps. To ensure the mast functioned correctly and remained stable, the builders added more floors to the building and strengthened its base. However, they discarded the idea of using weights to anchor the blimps due to the people on the street below. Additionally, the highly flammable chemicals in the blimps posed a risk to those in the vicinity. At times, the winds were so strong that the blimps could not get close enough without being punctured. In conclusion, the builders faced seemingly insurmountable obstacles.
827	15660	6	2	According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building confronted a significant challenge in enabling dirigibles to dock there. One of the major difficulties they faced was nature itself. At the top of the Empire State Building, the winds were constantly changing due to violent air - currents. Once a dirigible was hooked up to the building, workers had to find a way to prevent the airship from crashing into the building because of the strong winds at the top. Moreover, if a dirigible crashed on the ground, it would burst into flames as its interior was filled with hydrogen and helium. The heat and fire would be generated from the sparks produced during the crash. In summary, the challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were substantial.
828	15661	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced the obstacle of a lack of a suitable landing area. The intention was to ""allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling, servicing, and to facilitate passenger embarkation and disembarkation."" Dirigibles were docked using a winch. In conclusion, the absence of an appropriate landing area was a significant hurdle for the builders in achieving their goal of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building."
829	15662	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building, many problems arose. The initiative began when architect Al Smith aimed to create a building unlike any other, taller than the new Chrysler Building and with a futuristic design. The first issue they encountered was determining the purpose of a building of such a large size. There were various ideas, but the one that came to Al Smith was using it for a new form of transportation. People could board a dirigible (also known as a blimp) at the top of the building. The next concern was whether this would be safe, as they could not afford a major problem in the middle of New York. The idea was sent to Washington for review and was deemed not safe enough. However, Al Smith was more focused on the fact that his building was the tallest. In conclusion, despite the safety concerns, Al Smith's vision of a record - breaking building was realized.
830	15663	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles presented by nature itself. The natural elements likely affected various aspects of the construction process, such as the stability of the structure and the safety of the workers. In conclusion, nature posed a significant challenge to the builders of the Empire State Building.
831	15664	6	2	When constructing the Empire State Building, the builders aimed to enable dirigibles to dock there but encountered multiple obstacles. Safety was a primary concern. Most dirigibles used hydrogen as fuel, which is highly flammable. The Hindenburg disaster in New Jersey demonstrated this risk, and the building owners were reluctant to face a similar incident in densely - populated New York. Another issue was the wind at that altitude. The violent wind would cause the back of the dirigible to sway, creating technical difficulties, making it nearly impossible to embark and disembark passengers, and terrifying those inside. Moreover, adding lead weights to the ships was too risky as having them dangle above pedestrians was dangerous. Additionally, if dirigibles moored at the Empire State Building, it would violate an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making the docking illegal. Ultimately, these obstacles led to the failure of the endeavor.
832	15665	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders encountered numerous challenges while trying to allow dirigibles to dock. One significant hurdle was the need to modify the building's steel frame. To withstand the additional stress of a moored dirigible, the steel frame had to be modified and strengthened, with over sixty thousand dollars' worth of alterations made to the framework. Another problem was the high flammability of dirigibles, as they were filled with hydrogen. The Hindenburg's fiery destruction made the building owners realize the potential catastrophic consequences if such an event occurred over New York. The most substantial obstacle was nature. The building's top was affected by constantly shifting winds due to violent air currents, causing the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast. These obstacles collectively thwarted the builders' attempts to enable dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
833	15666	6	2	During the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous challenges. Simply adding a spire on top would not suffice, as the weight of a dirigible could destroy it. Thus, the construction team had to reinforce the entire building framework. Other obstacles included low - flying aircraft laws, adverse weather conditions, and safety concerns, especially in the event of a dirigible crashing over New York. Due to these insurmountable challenges, the mooring mast was destined to fail from the start.
834	15667	6	2	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Løsted, the author discusses the obstacles faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The three main obstacles were safety, nature, and existing laws. Safety was a major concern. As Løsted states, most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, making it extremely unsafe. A fire could break out in the building, endangering everyone. Nature also had a significant impact. Violent air currents on the building's top caused constantly shifting winds, which made it unsafe for dirigibles to dock. Lastly, an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas was a major obstacle. Building dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building would violate this law. In conclusion, safety, nature, and laws prevented the successful construction of a docking facility for dirigibles."
835	15668	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. High winds were a problem, and the building itself struggled to remain stable. The builders had trouble constructing the building to their specifications. They continuously added to the building to make it taller so that dirigibles could easily spot it. However, the building kept breaking or experiencing issues. Despite their efforts to get it right, they kept failing. Their major problem was that they needed to make their plans more realistic. In the end, these difficulties led to the inability to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the building.
836	15669	6	2	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there, namely laws regarding aircraft, safety concerns, and natural factors. There was a law prohibiting aircraft from flying at low altitudes, which would render it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building. Additionally, dirigibles often used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, posing significant safety risks. Moreover, the high - winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents, were constantly shifting. Due to these unforeseen obstacles, the Empire State Building never became a dirigible landing site.
837	15670	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One major concern was the safety of New Yorkers. Since dirigibles might use hydrogen, there was a risk of fire, and a burning dirigible could land in a populated area. As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, nature was the most significant hurdle. Violent air currents caused the winds on the building's top to shift constantly. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mast, its rear would swivel around it. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Eventually, the idea of using the mooring mast quietly faded away.
838	15671	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple challenges when trying to install a mooring mast on its top. According to paragraph fourteen, nature presented the most substantial obstacle. The “violent air currents” could make dirigibles move around the mooring mast, even when tethered. Another issue was that the architects couldn't simply add a mooring mast; over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework were required. As stated in paragraph thirteen, most non - @LOCATION1 dirigibles used flammable hydrogen instead of helium. After the German dirigible Hindenburg caught fire, the building's owners recognized the associated dangers, which ultimately affected the feasibility of the mooring mast.
839	15672	6	2	The builders faced numerous obstacles while trying to install a mooring mast on the flat surface of the Empire State Building. It was not a simple task; it required a great deal of stress and hard work. The dirigible, about a thousand feet long, was held by a single cable tether. This situation made the builders extremely stressed, forcing them to think carefully about wind pressure and the dirigible's load. All these factors contributed to the complexity of the project and required the builders to approach it with caution.
840	15673	6	2	There were several issues with dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building. One problem was related to the building's foundation. If dirigibles were to land on the building, it would create tension, potentially squishing the foundation down. Architects would need to make adjustments to the foundation to accommodate dirigible landings. Another problem was the docking method. When a dirigible was docked, it would sway back and forth around the mast, posing a hazard that could cause damage to the building or injury to New Yorkers. These problems made the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
841	15674	6	2	In the 1920s, dirigibles, also known as blimps, were regarded as the future of transportation. They boasted a top speed of eighty miles per hour and could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without refueling. However, the builders encountered an obstacle: the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity with the Empire State Building. He planned to add a mooring mast to the building's top, enabling dirigibles to anchor there for a few hours for refueling, servicing, and passenger embarkation and disembarkation. The issue was that the builders couldn't simply place the mooring mast on the Empire State Building's flat roof. If a thousand - foot dirigible were moored at the top of the structure with a single cable tether, it would impose stress on the building's frame. In conclusion, while the idea of using the Empire State Building for dirigible docking was innovative, the structural challenges made it a complex endeavor.
842	15675	6	2	In @DATE1, the Empire State Building was constructed with the intention of housing a new form of travel. A mooring mast was built at the building's top to dock one - thousand - foot dirigibles, which were considered the future of travel. Theoretically, an electric winch could be used to dock the blimp at the mast. But in reality, there was no safe way to do this at such a high altitude. Another significant challenge was the use of hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. A single lit match could cause the steel - framed dirigible to crash to the ground. The soft fabric covering the steel frame could be easily punctured, making it unsuitable for an urban area. The men constructing the blimp either overlooked or forgot the natural elements that restricted this project. At the building's peak, winds had high velocities and changed directions rapidly, which could wrap the dirigible around the mast. Additionally, the law restricted airships from flying too low over New York's growing urban civilization. In the Empire State Building's history, one blimp attempted a simulated dock, and another performed a newspaper stunt. It is clear that this project was doomed from the start.
843	15676	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. They consulted experts and took tours of equipment and mooring operations in New Jersey. The architects could not simply place the mooring mast on top of the building as it would add stress to the building's frame. The stress from the load would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, necessitating modifications and strengthening of the steel frame. The greatest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around it. Weighing it down was not a practical or safe option as it would dangle high above pedestrians on the street. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Moreover, attempts at newspaper delivery showed that the plan was unworkable. In conclusion, the combination of structural, natural, and legal obstacles made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
844	15677	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building had a great deal to contend with. To allow dirigibles to dock there, they had to rebuild the entire top of the building. Architects couldn't just place a mooring mast on the Empire State Building. A dirigible on top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would place a significant amount of stress on the building's frame. This meant that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would need to be upgraded and strengthened. All these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars to improve the building's framework. In conclusion, the financial and structural requirements made the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a costly and challenging proposition.
845	15678	6	2	"When attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, there were numerous obstacles. One such obstacle was the wind currents on top of the building. These were uncontrollable, forceful, and unpredictable. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, it details how a U.S. Navy dirigible, the Los Angeles, tried to dock but couldn't due to the strong winds, as stated, ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"" (L¸sted). Clearly, the winds were a major issue. Another problem was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low in urban areas. This idea was not only dangerous but also illegal. On May 6, 1937, a German dirigible named Hindenburg exploded in Lakehurst, New Jersey, due to the flammable hydrogen used for its lift. Since all dirigibles of that time used hydrogen, there was a risk of explosion while attempting to dock at the Empire State Building. An explosion above many citizens would endanger countless lives. As a result, the mooring mast idea became unfeasible. In conclusion, the combination of wind, legal, and safety issues effectively put an end to the concept of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building."
846	15679	6	2	Constructing a building over @NUM1 ft. tall and expecting dirigibles or blimps to dock there is perilous and fraught with numerous challenges. Firstly, the weather is inconsistent. On windy days, a blimp would sway above thousands of pedestrians in New York. Placing lead blocks at the back is extremely dangerous as the lead would sway with thousands of people below. Secondly, most non - US blimps use hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and a fire could spread and destroy an entire building. Finally, if it is illegal for an airship to hover too low over urban areas, blimps cannot moor at the Empire State Building. These factors collectively explain why blimps cannot moor at the Empire State Building.
847	15680	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous problems when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. A @NUM1 - foot dirigible would place additional stress on the building's frame. Many non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The Hindenburg accident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, where it caught fire, raised concerns. It demonstrated how much more catastrophic such an incident could be if it occurred over a densely populated area like New York. Wind currents, which were constantly @CAPS1, were another issue. They would cause the back of the dirigible to sway. Additionally, there was a pre - existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. These were some of the obstacles the builders faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
848	15681	6	2	According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the building's top by a single cable would stress the building's frame, necessitating strengthening the entire structure to prevent it from potentially collapsing. Paragraph @NUM2 states that nature, specifically strong winds, was a major obstacle. The powerful wind made it difficult for the dirigible to land safely and could even cause it to fly away. Paragraph @NUM3 mentions that an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas was also a hindrance. It could make the building a target and cause great harm if the dirigible fell. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the project of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was cancelled.
849	15682	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building confronted many obstacles in their bid to enable dirigibles to dock on top of the structure. Safety was a significant concern. Foreign dirigibles were filled with highly flammable gases. The fire that destroyed the German dirigible Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, made the owners of the Empire State Building realize the potential severity of such an accident over a densely populated area like downtown New York. Weather was another obstacle. Violent air currents caused the winds on top of the building to shift constantly. For instance, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles couldn't tie up to the mast due to the wind, which could have punctured the dirigible's shell. There was also a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to tie up to the building or approach the area. Despite these obstacles preventing the building from fulfilling its original purpose, the Empire State Building remains a worldwide landmark today.
850	15683	6	2	In the article 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 details several problems the Empire State Building's builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, most non - US blimps used hydrogen instead of helium. Given hydrogen's high flammability and the high population density of downtown New York, any mishap could lead to injuries and deaths. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for ships to approach the building. Overall, the builders faced many obstacles that could have been foreseen during the planning phase, highlighting the difficulties in achieving the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
851	15684	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the workers encountered several problems. One was achieving a greater height, as the architect of the Chrysler Building had increased its total height, making it the world's largest building at the time. Former New York governor Al Smith proposed that they would surpass it by installing a mooring mast for dirigibles. Another challenge was attaching the mast to the top of the frame. Since it couldn't be simply dropped on, approximately sixty thousand dollars' worth of maintenance work had to be carried out on the frame. A third issue was securing the dirigibles. Violent winds could cause the blimp to turn, potentially puncturing it. After the Hindenburg disaster, the authorities refused to allow blimps to dock at the building, fearing for public safety. As a result, the mast was never utilized.
852	15685	6	2	"Those involved in the design and construction of the Empire State Building faced several significant obstacles when trying to make the concept of docking dirigibles a reality. One of the most significant complications was that if a large dirigible were tied to the building using a ""cable tether,"" it would place stress on the building's frame. The builders and architects had to devise a way to ensure that the stress could be transferred down to the building's foundation. They spent over @MONEY1 modifying the framework (as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1). In paragraph @NUM2, it is stated that the architects and builders addressed the storage issue by installing the winches and control machinery at the base of the shaft of the ""conical roof."" Overall, these efforts were made to overcome the challenges in realizing the dirigible - docking plan."
853	15686	6	2	Although the idea of using the Empire State Building as a dirigible dock was brilliant, the builders encountered numerous problems. One problem was the law prohibiting low - altitude flight over urban areas such as New York City. Additionally, natural factors played a major role in the plan's failure. The strong wind currents in the city affected the plan. Usually, dirigibles landed in open fields where their rear ends could be weighted down. This was not possible when docking at the building, which would cause the dirigible to sway and potentially hit other structures. The builders also failed to consider the high population density of New York City. If an incident similar to the Hindenburg disaster occurred at the docked dirigible, many people would be affected. Consequently, the idea remained just a dream.
854	15687	6	2	The obstacles the builders faced were both difficult and time - consuming. The only significant advantage the Empire State Building truly had was being the tallest building in the world. They also attempted to establish a dirigible docking base for future transportation, but due to certain laws and technical difficulties, they failed to achieve this. Obstacles such as adding extra structural work to the building were ultimately unnecessary. These were the challenges the builders had to deal with, along with the investment of time and resources. In the end, despite their efforts, the goal of a successful dirigible docking base was not realized.
855	15688	6	2	"According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a ""thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building by a single cable tether would place stress on the building's frame."" This was a crucial issue because if the frame became overly stressed due to the extra weight of the dirigible, the building could collapse. Another obstacle was the wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to strong air currents."" This was also a major problem as dirigibles are very light, lighter than air, and the strong winds could cause them to swing around at that height, which is extremely unsafe, especially considering the densely populated downtown @CAPS1 below. A third obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal to fly low enough to tie the blimp to the building. In conclusion, these obstacles made it very difficult to implement the dirigible - docking plan."
856	15689	6	2	According to the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. The author states that “the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself” (L¸sted, paragraph @NUM1). Reports indicated that the winds atop the building were constantly changing due to violent air - currents. A dirigible on the building couldn't land properly and couldn't be weighted down like those in open landing fields with lead weights, as it wasn't practical to dangle weights over the heads of hundreds of people on the streets below. Besides nature, safety was another significant obstacle. It is written that “Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable” (L¸sted, paragraph @NUM2). Given hydrogen's high flammability, an accident could be catastrophic in a densely populated area like downtown New York where the Empire State Building is located. A fire accident had already occurred with a German dirigible in Lakehurst, New Jersey. In conclusion, nature and safety were the two main obstacles the builders faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
857	15690	6	2	When the builders of the Empire State Building tried to allow dirigibles to dock there, nature was one of the major challenges. The winds at the building's summit were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. Even if they managed to tie the front of the dirigibles to the building, the cable holding it would exert pressure on the building. The only way to relieve this pressure was to modify the building to make it stronger, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Moreover, there was a law against airships flying too low over the city. Considering all these factors, it was evident that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not feasible.
858	15691	6	2	A dirigible differs from a plane or a hot - air balloon as it is filled with flammable gases. Attempting to dock a large dirigible on top of the world's tallest building would pose extreme risks. It would be extremely dangerous for the urban town below and also for the workers involved. The presence of flammable gases in the dirigible means that any accident during docking could lead to a large - scale disaster in a populated area. In conclusion, docking dirigibles on the world's tallest building is an extremely perilous endeavor that should be avoided.
859	15692	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast,” author Marcia Amidon L¸sted discusses the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, the building's frame was not constructed to withstand the docking of a thousand - foot - long blimp. As a result, modifications worth over sixty thousand dollars had to be made to the building's framework to strengthen it. Secondly, having dirigibles dock at the building was unsafe for multiple reasons. Dirigibles were often filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable, as pointed out in the excerpt. The building owners realized that a blimp crash over New York's busy streets could cause a tragedy. Additionally, strong winds at the building's top made it difficult and dangerous for blimps to dock at the mooring mast, as they would cause the back of the ship to move constantly. Finally, there were laws preventing aircraft from flying too low over the city. In summary, there were numerous obstacles that made it difficult to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
860	15693	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many different obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the challenges was to design the mast without having to reconstruct a large part of the building. Another crucial aspect was ensuring safety. These large dirigibles are highly flammable, and having such a potentially dangerous object in a densely populated city like New York was extremely risky. The last problem they faced was nature. Since one cannot change nature, this issue was present from the start, perhaps overlooked or not even considered initially. In conclusion, without resolving these multiple problems, allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building could not have been successful.
861	15694	6	2	The Empire State Building's construction team encountered numerous challenges when aiming to enable dirigible docking. One issue was the lack of clarity regarding laws; they were unaware that aircraft were prohibited from entering certain suburban areas. The tragic incident of the Hindenburg burning to the ground served as a stark reminder of potential disasters. Nature also posed a significant obstacle. Violent air - currents caused the winds atop the building to constantly shift, making dirigibles swivel around the mooring mast. Moreover, the structure of the dirigibles was a problem. Frequent landings on the building would gradually damage its structure. These were some of the key obstacles faced during this ambitious project.
862	15695	6	2	"In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", the Empire State Building's builders faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigible docking. Dirigibles, also known as blimps, were extremely large. Their size made it difficult for them to reach the building. Additionally, most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. An accident could lead to a blimp exploding over the city, endangering thousands. The winds above the building were sometimes violent, hampering dirigibles' approach. Even when tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would spin around it. Due to these dangers, the intended purpose of the building's top for dirigible docking could not be realized."
863	15696	6	2	During the construction of the Empire Building, the builders encountered several problems, all of which were detrimental to their goal of allowing dirigible docking. The composition of the balloons was an issue; most used hydrogen, which is highly flammable according to the excerpt, and an explosion could cause numerous casualties. Strong winds also made it hard for dirigibles to reach the building. There was also a law restricting low - flying vehicles, and dirigibles flew at low altitudes. These problems were insurmountable, ultimately ruining the plan.
864	15697	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders faced a multitude of obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One was the law; there was an existing regulation against airships flying too low over urban areas, though initially, the builders overlooked it. Safety was another major concern. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Wind was also a significant obstacle, as the winds on top of the building shifted constantly due to violent air currents. Given these challenges, docking dirigibles on the building's mast was not only improbable but nearly impossible.
865	15698	6	2	Al Smith's idea of creating a dock on the Empire State Building was ill - conceived. Passengers would be risking their lives getting on and off the dirigibles. It seems he focused more on the appearance rather than safety. The obstacles were numerous. There was the risk of death from people's recklessness, the weather, and the cost. Weather was a major factor; strong winds could cause dirigibles to go off - course and crash. The cost of building the landing pad was exorbitant as they would need to purchase floats and construct a landing station. Overall, it was a very unwise decision to consider dirigible landings on the building.
866	15699	6	2	"The most significant and evident challenges in enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were safety concerns, natural factors, and the city's regulations regarding low - flying airships. As stated in the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, a major safety risk was that most non - US blimps used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Allowing a hydrogen - filled dirigible to hover over densely populated @ORGANIZATION2 would have been an extremely dangerous proposition. In 1937, a hydrogen blimp caught fire with disastrous results. The owners of the Empire State Building were well aware that a similar accident over New York would be far more catastrophic. At higher altitudes, wind speeds increase, and the winds on top of the Empire State Building would cause the blimp's tail to sway. Typically, the tail is weighted, but having weights hanging over the city is also unsafe. During one of the two failed docking attempts, the winds were so strong that the dirigible couldn't even approach the building. The blimp's captain worried that the wind might blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of nearby buildings, which could puncture the blimp. Finally, New York City has a law that prohibits airships from flying below a certain altitude, making it illegal for a dirigible to dock on the Empire State Building. Evidently, many obvious obstacles were overlooked during the planning of the Empire State Building's blimp dock."
867	15700	6	2	"During the construction of the mast to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building, numerous obstacles led to the project's abandonment. One unavoidable issue was that most dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. If an explosion were to occur, it could be extremely harmful to the crowded streets of New York City and the Empire State Building itself. Additionally, the wind on top of the building was uncontrollable. With the strong wind currents, docking a dirigible would be extremely perilous. As stated, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Although it was possible to attach lead weights to the blimp's rear, it would be both impractical and dangerous to the public. Moreover, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, meaning that even if the docking station were completed, dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building. It was noted that ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" The challenges faced by the Empire State Building's mast were insurmountable, and the project was postponed. Eventually, it became obsolete with the invention of airplanes."
868	15701	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to strong air currents. Secondly, dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. If a hydrogen - filled dirigible were to explode, it would cause significant damage in New York. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Furthermore, the building would need to be modified and strengthened before dirigibles could dock. Given these multiple and substantial obstacles, it was clear that the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building faced significant difficulties and was likely unfeasible without major changes.
869	15702	6	2	"According to the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the first hurdle. As paragraph @NUM1 indicates, most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building recognized the potential for a terrible accident in a densely populated area. The most formidable obstacle was nature. Paragraph @NUM2 states that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent wind currents."" Although they could have weighted the dirigible with lead weights, having them hang above pedestrians was unsafe. The final obstacle was the law. There was a regulation against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these multiple and significant obstacles made it extremely challenging for the builders to achieve their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
870	15703	6	2	When the architects of the Empire State Building tried to allow dirigibles to dock on its top, they encountered many obstacles. Usually, when faced with an obstacle, one either overcomes it or fails. In this case, the architects were unable to overcome these challenges. The reading mentions that non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. A hydrogen explosion could cause extensive damage to both the building and downtown New York. The winds at the top of the building shifted due to air currents, which could make the dirigibles circle the mast even when tied down. The architects also had to consider the law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. They underestimated the complexity of tying down a dirigible in high winds. Even the simple task of dropping off newspapers was difficult and time - consuming. Given these issues, it's understandable that having large steel - framed balloons dangling over the city was an unappealing prospect. In the end, the combination of safety, natural, and legal obstacles made it impossible for the architects to achieve their goal of regular dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
871	15704	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Løsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered significant obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. It was extremely difficult for architects to install a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. A mooring mast held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. The builders faced numerous dilemmas and complications, and over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. In conclusion, these challenges made the endeavor of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building a formidable one.
872	15705	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to permit dirigibles to dock. The initial problem was the stress the blimp would impose on the building. As the article indicates, “the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation...the building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation.” This stress necessitated further improvements to the building, which consumed both time and money. Another issue was the impracticality of dirigibles themselves. Dirigibles require hydrogen, which is highly flammable. After the Hindenburg disaster, “the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident would have been over a densely populated area such as downtown @LOCATION1.” Inconsistent and violent air - currents also posed a problem, making safe docking difficult. Lead weights could address this, but they “were neither practical nor safe.” Additionally, “an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas” prevented the blimps from flying low enough to land at the building. In conclusion, the construction of the mooring mast at the @CAPS1.S.B. was fraught with obstacles that questioned its safety and practicality.
873	15706	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building had many problems when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. First, they couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. As stated, “The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof.” They had to modify the steel frame from the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Even after building the mooring mast, more problems arose. Dirigibles from outside @LOCATION2 used highly flammable hydrogen. So, it was too dangerous to fly these flammable dirigibles over a populated place like New York City. Also, the winds at the top of the building were too strong. “Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.” In the end, the problems were too numerous and unfixable, so dirigibles could no longer dock at the Empire State Building.
874	15707	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. The first was the danger of having a hydrogen - filled (highly flammable) dirigible dock over a densely populated area. They didn't want a repeat of the Lakehurst, New Jersey accident in New York. As noted, “The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.” The greatest obstacle was due to natural causes. “The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,” making it impossible for the dirigible to stay steady for docking or unloading. Solutions like using weights were “neither practical or safe.” The final obstacle was the law. “The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.” In conclusion, due to natural causes, danger, and the law, it was simply impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
875	15708	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many hurdles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the building's structure. After designing the mast, they needed a building that could withstand the stress. “Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower,” and they managed to overcome this obstacle. Safety was another concern. “Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium,” and hydrogen is highly flammable. After a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse such an accident could be over a densely populated area. This safety issue led to a practicality problem as dirigibles usually landed in open fields. The greatest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building made docking unsafe. The only solution, tethering the dirigible and using lead weights, “dangling high over pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe.” In conclusion, the architects faced a multitude of obstacles in their attempt to enable dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
876	15709	6	2	The construction team of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. Safety was a major concern as most dirigibles outside the United States utilized hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Nature also posed an obstacle; the winds atop the building were constantly changing due to strong air - currents. If a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the rear of the vessel would sway violently in the wind. In open fields, dirigibles were weighted down with lead weights to keep them steady, but there was no place to attach such weights on the top of the Empire State Building. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building. In summary, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple hurdles in their attempt to moor dirigibles.
877	15710	6	2	The builder of the Empire State Building confronted several obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. After constructing the Mooring Mast, it became evident that keeping a blimp stable and attached without endangering the building's stability would be extremely difficult. Safety was another significant issue, as most foreign dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. High - velocity air currents were also a problem, causing the back of the dirigible to move uncontrollably. In conclusion, these issues made it a challenging task for the builder to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock.
878	15711	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many difficulties when attempting to permit dirigibles to dock there. If a thousand - foot dirigible was moored at the top of the building using a single cable tether, it would place excessive stress on the building's frame. The workers had to transfer this stress all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. Modifying and strengthening the frame would cost over sixty thousand dollars. They also had to design an ornamental mast with four wings to house the mooring arm. However, the builders did not anticipate that the mooring mast would not only have framework - related problems but also that the dirigible would swivel without the ability to use lead weights for stability. There was no solution to prevent this, address the flammability issue, or circumvent the existing laws. Ultimately, these challenges hindered the plan for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
879	15712	6	2	There were three primary factors that made the Empire State Building an unsuitable mooring mast for dirigibles. Firstly, it was unsafe. Most dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and the fear of a repeat of the Hindenburg disaster, especially over a densely populated city, was too great. Secondly, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be extremely difficult, and even if docked, the wind would make it an unsafe situation. Finally, a law was enacted that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas, which made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. These three obstacles combined prevented the Empire State Building from serving as a dirigible mooring mast.
880	15713	6	2	Marcia Amidon L¸sted, in her excerpt “The Mooring Mast,” details the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle emerged during the design of the mast for docking on top of the building. As stated, “The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof.” They discovered that a dirigible docked on the building would add excessive stress to the building's frame. So, their first challenge was to make modifications to strengthen the building's framework. However, as L¸sted points out, “The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.” The rough air currents at the top of the building caused the winds to constantly shift, making even a tethered dirigible sway. Another problem was how to weight the dirigibles down. In open landing fields, lead weights were used, but it was unacceptable to use such heavy weights above hundreds of people on the streets. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their attempt to enable dirigible docking.
881	15714	6	2	When builders in New York attempted to construct a structure for dirigibles, or blimps, to dock at the Empire State Building, they were unaware of the numerous problems they would encounter. During the design of the mast atop the building, designers discovered that docking a dirigible would impose additional stress on the building's frame. As a result, the structure of the Empire State Building needed to be modified, which required sixty thousand dollars and additional labor hours. Another challenge was the interference of nature. The winds on the building's summit were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Docking a dirigible would be difficult because it would sway continuously in the wind, preventing passengers from boarding. Moreover, blimps are typically moored in open fields with the help of lead weights. Introducing lead weights in densely - populated New York City could be dangerous as they might fall and endanger pedestrians. In conclusion, builders faced many obstacles while trying to enable dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
882	15715	6	2	"The architects of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to create a mast for docking dirigibles or blimps. One significant hurdle was the need to redesign parts of the building. They couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. A ""thousand - foot dirigible moored by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1), and this stress had to be transmitted to the building's foundation. To accommodate this, the architects had to modify and strengthen the steel frame. Additionally, when creating the rocket - shaped mast, they had to work on various components such as the winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring. These tasks had to be carried out precisely for everything to function properly. These were the obstacles the architects faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
883	15716	6	2	The primary concern regarding the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building was ensuring safety. To hold the aircraft in place, lead weights would have to be used. If these weights were to fall from the top of the building in a densely populated area, it would pose a significant danger. Moreover, after the owners of the Empire State Building learned about the Hindenburg explosion, they felt uneasy. Even when the aircraft was floating and moored on top of the building, the wind would cause it to sway, making the situation even more unsafe. Although the idea of dirigible docking was good, it was not feasible from a safety perspective.
884	15717	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building, there were obstacles in the attempt to enable dirigible docking. For instance, architects could not simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. As a result, the architects had to modify and strengthen the building, spending over sixty thousand dollars on these modifications. The building was increased from @NUM1 floors to 102 floors, where dirigible passengers would board. In conclusion, the construction of the Empire State Building faced challenges in the effort to allow dirigible docking.
885	15718	6	2	There were multiple issues that made it unfeasible to use the Empire State Building's mast as a dirigible dock. Many foreign dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. If one of these dirigibles caught fire like the Hindenburg, it would lead to numerous tragedies as it would be above residential areas. For this reason, there was a law prohibiting dirigibles from flying too low over cities. This law would make it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach the area. In addition to the safety risks for people below, the wind also posed a problem. The blimp could not dock properly as even when tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. One attempt demonstrated the difficulty of landing. The Los Angeles tried to reach the building but abandoned the idea due to the wind. The captain was afraid of flying into one of the spires of a tall building and puncturing the dirigible. He couldn't even take his hands off the control lever. Overall, these issues made using the mast as a dirigible dock an impossible task.
886	15719	6	2	In the article “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Løsted, it is described that a significant number of challenges were encountered when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock. These obstacles posed risks to people's safety. One issue was that due to the high altitude, the wind was extremely strong, causing the tails of the dirigibles to swirl. Another problem, as stated in paragraph @NUM1, was that foreign dirigibles were constructed using hydrogen instead of helium, making them flammable. In conclusion, these problems collectively made the docking of dirigibles a dangerous and unfeasible task.
887	15720	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock. During the mast - design phase, they initially failed to recognize that the mast would impose additional stress on the building's frame. To address this, they would need to spend over sixty thousand dollars on framework modifications. Besides, there was an existing law restricting airships from flying too low over urban areas, and the winds at the building's top were constantly changing. This made it impossible for dirigibles to get close enough to dock, as there was a risk of the wind blowing the dirigible onto sharp spires and damaging its shell. Moreover, after the destruction of the Hindenburg in New Jersey due to hydrogen's high flammability, the builders realized the danger of a similar accident occurring above a densely - populated area. As a result, they were compelled to halt their work.
888	15721	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders encountered numerous problems when trying to dock dirigibles, most of which were safety - related. Hydrogen, a highly flammable and explosive gas used in dirigibles, posed a great risk. A fire accident would be disastrous given the dense population of downtown New York. Also, the tail of the dirigible couldn't be weighted as usual because it would mean having large weights hanging over the streets. With strong winds, an unsecurely tethered and unweighted dirigible would sway and move, increasing the risk of it being punctured by sharp building edges. If a dirigible were to successfully moor, it would exert tremendous stress on the building. There were also obvious issues that were overlooked. A law prohibited low - altitude airship flights over urban centers, making it illegal to attempt a landing. Additionally, the proper mooring equipment was never installed, precluding any successful docking attempts. In summary, the biggest hurdle for the builders was their lack of preparation and failure to address these obvious problems.
889	15722	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders faced two main obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. The first was the strong winds. Violent air currents caused the winds at the building's peak to be in a constant state of change. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the rear of the ship would dangerously swivel around it. The second obstacle was a pre - existing law that prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach the area. In conclusion, these two obstacles effectively prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building.
890	15723	6	2	In the article “The Mooring Mast” by @PERSON1 @CAPS1, the author details the difficulties in designing a mooring mast for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. At the time of the building's construction, New York City Mayor Al Smith proposed adding a mooring mast to the building's top to make the city technologically advanced. However, after the proposal, designers found problems. They realized that modifying the steel frame was necessary because a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top would transmit stress through the frame to the foundation due to load and wind pressure. Moreover, high - speed winds at the building's top would blow the dirigible around, which was extremely unsafe near a building. In conclusion, these challenges made the implementation of the mooring mast a complex and risky task.
891	15724	6	2	"The Empire State Building's builders encountered significant obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. According to a source in @CAPS2 @NUM1, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were required for the building's framework. This indicated that the design of the mast would take time. Another major hurdle nearly led to the abandonment of the mooring mast. In @CAPS2 @NUM2, architects stated that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined never to fulfill its @CAPS6 purpose, for reasons apparent even before its construction."" The primary reason was safety: Most dirigibles from outside @LOCATION3 used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Given the densely - populated area of New York, the owners were concerned about the potential harm to people, which made this a huge issue."
892	15725	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles. Firstly, the building's structure was not strong enough to hold a @NUM1 - foot dirigible. Secondly, the strong winds could cause the dirigible to move, potentially damaging the building's frame. Additionally, the law prohibited airships from flying too low over a city. These challenges made the construction process difficult, and they were some of the main obstacles the workers had to overcome during the building of the Empire State Building.
893	15726	6	2	When architects took on the task of constructing a mast for dirigibles to dock at, they encountered numerous obstacles that made the concept of a mooring mast unfeasible. One significant obstacle was the strong and unpredictable wind currents above the city. If dirigibles were to dock using a tether, their rear parts would be free to swing and sway. Another crucial factor was the use of the flammable gas hydrogen in dirigibles, which posed a serious fire hazard to New York City. Even if engineers and architects managed to resolve all the technical issues related to building the mast, they would still face a legal obstacle, as it was illegal to fly dirigibles too low over urban areas. These reasons collectively explain why the idea of a dirigible dock could not be realized.
894	15727	6	2	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building had to confront many challenges. To allow dirigibles to dock, they needed to build @CAPS2 planfronts on the building's side, putting their lives at risk. They also had to handle electrical problems both inside and outside the building. The @CAPS1 on the building's exterior had to deal with strong wind currents. Ensuring the proper functioning of the electrical system was also crucial. Since hydrogen and helium are extremely flammable, any fire - related incident, such as a short - circuited wire, could set the whole dirigible ablaze and cause it to explode. These difficulties made the task of enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building extremely challenging.
895	15728	6	2	The Empire State Building encountered @CAPS1 difficulties in facilitating the docking of dirigibles. The wind pressure exerted by the dirigibles disrupted the building's framework. To address this situation, they spent over sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the building's framework. This expense was necessary to make the building suitable for the docking of dirigibles, but the initial issues caused by the wind pressure highlighted the challenges in achieving this goal.
896	15729	6	2	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. Safety factors and nature were among the challenges. Safety was a significant hurdle in the plan for a mooring mast because dirigibles use hydrogen to float. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the owners of the Empire State Building recognized the potential disaster if a dirigible were to catch fire over a densely populated city like New York. For instance, when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners realized how much more catastrophic such an accident could have been in New York. The greatest obstacle was nature. Humans cannot control the wind, and the constantly shifting winds on top of the building made docking difficult. As stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Consequently, the construction of the mooring mast was unfeasible."
897	15730	6	2	A mooring mast was installed on top of the building to allow dirigibles to anchor for several hours for refueling, servicing, and passenger boarding and disembarking. Dirigibles were docked using an electric winch, and their bodies swayed in the breeze. A group of engineers in New York worked diligently to develop a practical solution, and government officials in Washington were also considering a method of mooring airships to the mast. Eventually, they achieved their goal by constructing a mooring mast, providing dirigibles with a place to land for fuel and service.
898	15731	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. According to the excerpt, one obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles could be as long as one thousand feet, equivalent to four blocks in New York City. Another obstacle was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach the area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up due to strong winds. Even if it had gotten close, the captain could not take his hands off the control levers for fear that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of nearby buildings, which could puncture the dirigible's shell. Additionally, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework to accommodate the dirigible. In conclusion, these obstacles made it extremely challenging to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
899	15732	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building confronted many challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock on the building. First, they had to ensure that the mast was not too heavy to be placed on top of the building. When they found that it was, they made a significant amount of modifications to the building to support the mast. They also had to guarantee the safety of transporting people via the dirigible, which was dependent on wind and climate conditions. Moreover, they aimed to make the building taller than the Chrysler building to transform New York's transportation. However, in the end, they concluded that docking dirigibles on the building was not feasible if they wanted to ensure public safety."
900	15733	6	2	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast,"" the excerpt detailed New York's obstacles, such as competition. If the men were not in a competitive race, the buildings might have been constructed without major issues. The key lesson is that with patience and a genuine effort to reach a goal, success can be achieved."
901	15734	6	2	"In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's article ""The mooring mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. One reason was safety concerns. The owner of the building recognized that an accident could have been far worse if it occurred above a densely - populated area like downtown New York. Another issue was that having an open landing field dangling high above street pedestrians, weighted down with lead weights, was neither practical nor safe. Due to these safety reasons, the Empire State Building was not a suitable docking place for dirigibles."
902	15735	6	2	In the @DATE1s, technology was not as advanced as it is today, and those involved in construction had limited knowledge. When architects were building the @CAPS1 State Building, they encountered numerous problems. Firstly, they couldn't simply install a mast because the roof was not flat. Secondly, a thousand - foot drop would add stress to the frame. Finally, they had to change the frame from steel to glass and also modify the roof. Overall, the men in the @DATE1s had a substantial amount of work to do during the construction of the Empire State Building.
903	15736	6	2	The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was fated to never serve its intended purpose due to safety, nature, and laws. Safety was the primary concern as most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. The tragic incident of the German dirigible Hindenburg, which caught fire and was destroyed in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, could have had far more severe consequences if it happened over a densely populated area like downtown New York. Nature also presented a major obstacle. The winds on top of the building constantly shifted because of violent air currents, causing the back of the dirigibles to swivel and dangle precariously above pedestrians. Additionally, laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. In conclusion, these three significant factors ensured that the mooring mast of the Empire State Building would never fulfill its purpose.
904	15737	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major concern was safety, as dirigibles would dangle unsafely above street pedestrians. Landing these huge dirigibles involved many risks, and there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to approach the area. Famous dirigibles also had landing difficulties. For example, in December 1930, the US Navy dirigible Los Angeles couldn't get close to the mooring mast because of strong winds. The dirigible could move uncontrollably and crash into the sharp spires of nearby buildings. Despite once being seen as the future of transportation, dirigibles have been replaced by airplanes.
905	15738	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock, with safety being the main concern. As stated in the article, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Having dirigibles dangling high above street pedestrians was deemed neither practical nor safe. This clearly indicates that dirigibles are not only impractical but also pose a danger to both the passengers on board and the people on the street below."
906	15739	6	2	The primary obstacle the Empire State Building's builder encountered when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there was safety. A significant number of dirigibles from outside the United States utilized hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. On May 6, 1937, when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the Empire State Building's owners recognized how much more catastrophic the accident could have been if it had occurred above a densely - populated area like downtown New York. Another major obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. Violent air currents caused the winds on top of the building to be in a constant state of shift. Additionally, there was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. The wind could blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of nearby buildings, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, and the captain could not even take their hands off the control levers. In conclusion, these multiple factors made it extremely difficult and dangerous to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
907	15740	6	2	"In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's story ""The Mooring Mast,"" there were numerous challenges to overcome for dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. These challenges included the nature of the dirigibles themselves, nature's winds, and laws restricting their docking. Some out - of - state dirigibles used hydrogen, a flammable gas. Given that these dirigibles were about as long as four blocks in New York City, they could cause extensive damage to the city. The wind was so strong that it made the dirigibles swivel around even after being tied down. Moreover, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, and a dirigible captain could be arrested for violating this law. In summary, these issues made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
908	15741	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced nature - related obstacles. Violent air currents caused the winds on top of the building to be constantly shifting. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down at the back with lead weights. However, using such weights at the Empire State Building, where they would dangle high above street pedestrians, was neither practical nor safe. The size of the dirigibles and their high - altitude position also posed problems. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. In conclusion, these factors made the task of building a successful docking system for dirigibles at the Empire State Building extremely challenging.
909	15742	6	2	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. One major issue was the lack of a suitable landing area. As a result, they proposed having passengers get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. Another obstacle was that the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. Also, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Ultimately, the idea of the mooring mast failed. The builders did not consider potential problems such as nature, the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and the risk of fires due to the hydrogen gas used in some dirigibles. In conclusion, a lack of foresight and multiple challenges led to the downfall of this docking concept."
910	15743	6	2	If the Empire State Building were to serve as a docking site for dirigibles, numerous problems would arise. There was a lack of a proper landing area for an almost one - thousand - foot blimp. When held by a single tether to the Empire State Building, the dirigible would exert a large amount of stress on the building's structure. Continued use in this way could risk the building's collapse. Modifying the Empire State Building for this purpose would cost thousands of dollars. Even after modification, if the dirigible were attached to the building, the high winds would cause the back of the blimp to sway, endangering the passengers. All things considered, the idea of landing a dirigible on a large building like the Empire State Building is clearly unviable.
911	15744	6	2	Adding a dirigible docking facility to the Empire State Building would have been an excellent addition. However, architects encountered numerous challenges in achieving this goal. The building's structure was initially insufficiently robust. If a dirigible had been tied to the top of the original Empire State Building, the force exerted would have likely toppled the building. As a result, the architects had to reinforce the frame to ensure safety.  Even after the frame was made safe, issues related to the dirigible itself emerged. If only one end of the dirigible was secured to the mast, the other end would be at the mercy of the wind. This would have made unloading cargo and passengers extremely difficult. Additionally, dirigibles were prone to catching fire, posing a significant risk to people on the ground. In conclusion, due to these safety concerns, it was ultimately deemed unsafe to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
912	15745	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous obstacles. Al Smith, the project leader, aimed to construct the tallest building. Right from the start, a problem arose. The Chrysler Building had a concealed 185 - foot spire, which, as of @DATE2, made it 46 feet taller than the Empire State Building.  Al Smith found a glimmer of hope when he realized that dirigibles required a landing area, and a mooring mast on the Empire State Building could serve this purpose. The mast, once added to the building's top, would allow dirigibles to anchor temporarily for refueling and maintenance. However, this design concept, which took time to develop, soon proved to be flawed.  Safety was a major concern. Most dirigibles from outside @LOCATION2 used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and can lead to tragic accidents. For instance, on May 6, 1937, a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. If a similar incident were to occur in a densely populated area like @CAPS1, it would cause serious problems. In summary, these were some of the many challenges faced during the construction of the Empire State Building.
913	15746	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when attempting to enable dirigible docking. These obstacles included safety issues, natural factors, and legal restrictions.  Safety was a significant problem. As the excerpt indicates, “Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.” In a populated area like downtown New York, an explosion of a dirigible would result in severe damage and loss of life.  Nature also played a role. “The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents.” This would cause the back of the dirigibles to swivel, which was neither practical nor safe.  There was also a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal to tie a dirigible to the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these obstacles presented significant challenges for the builders in their attempt to allow dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building.
914	15747	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first major hurdle was designing the mooring mast. Architects couldn't simply place a mast on the building's flat roof. Mooring a dirigible would add extra stress to the building's frame, and wind pressure would exacerbate the problem.  The mooring mast was never going to be a safe solution for landing dirigibles. Due to nature, the back of the dirigible would swivel. Adding lead to the back to stabilize it was not an option as it couldn't be hung over pedestrians on the street.  There was also a legal issue. A pre - existing law prohibited airships from flying too low. Despite these challenges, two dirigibles attempted to moor. The first turned back due to bad weather, and the second, as a publicity stunt, dropped off newspapers before the landing gear was installed and had to use a wire to receive them. In the end, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigible docking was abandoned.
915	15748	6	2	The primary obstacle the builders faced was safety, which was of utmost importance given the large population in New York. Another issue was that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. At high altitudes, the wind is very strong. Dirigibles, being held only at the front, would have their backs swing uncontrollably. Strong winds could easily blow a blimp into the sharp spires of nearby buildings, causing it to burst.  There were numerous potential risks at any given time. Considering all these factors, I firmly believe that the decision to abandon the idea of the mooring mast was the right one. This decision ensured the safety of the people in New York and avoided potentially catastrophic events.
916	15749	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered an obstacle related to dirigibles. Dirigibles were to be docked using an electric winch, which would pull in a line from the front of the ship and then secure it to a mast.
917	15750	6	2	Dirigibles were airships flying too low over the city and urban areas. The U.S @ORGANIZATION2 approached the mooring mast to tie up, but the winds were too strong. A Goodyear Blimp Columbia attempted a publicity stunt by tying up and delivering a bundle of newspapers. Despite these efforts and the challenges, it was clear that the conditions for dirigibles in these areas were far from ideal.
918	15751	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles while aiming to make it a safe docking site for dirigibles. Three major issues were building stress, safety, and urban laws. The Empire State Building was large and fragile, and adding the weight of a @DATE1 - foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable tether would stress the building's frame. The architects had to make changes. Moreover, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air - currents, making it unsafe. So, they decided to make the building shorter. However, even after all their efforts, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas made the idea of dirigibles docking there unfeasible. In the end, despite their time and hard work, the plan could not succeed.
919	15752	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles. There were one - thousand - foot - long dirigibles that had limited landing space in New York. Al Smith thought it was a good idea to let dirigibles anchor on top of his building for refueling, servicing, and passenger embarkation and disembarkation. The dirigibles were docked using an electric winch to tie them to the mast, and people could safely get on and off despite the swinging. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted experts and obtained equipment from the U.S. Naval Air Station, where the navy, a leader in U.S. dirigible development, offered its dirigibles for mast testing. The architect also met with the president of an airship transport company that offered trans - Pacific dirigible services. In conclusion, the builders faced many hurdles and made numerous attempts to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
920	15753	6	2	The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. They would need to create new routes that had not yet been established, as well as deal with existing transatlantic routes. These challenges made it difficult to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the @ORGANIZATION1.
921	15754	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building's builders encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. One challenge was mooring a dirigible at the top without over - stressing the building. As stated, “The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,” indicating that they planned to address this by distributing the stress to the building's foundation. Another issue was preventing the dirigibles from excessive movement and swaying once moored. “The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,” making it impossible to keep the dirigibles still because of the strong winds. The final problem was that, even if a dirigible could be moored, it was illegal to fly airships at such a low altitude in an urban area. “This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building.” In conclusion, these obstacles led to the builders' ultimate lack of success.
922	15755	6	2	Before the Empire State Building was established as an @ORGANIZATION1, it faced multiple problems. The builders were worried that others might destroy the building, so they restricted the docking of dirigibles there. Their intention was to make the city famous and increase its revenue. Additionally, some people were indifferent and postponed related matters. In conclusion, these issues affected the building's development and the plans regarding dirigibles.
923	15756	6	2	The concept of docking a one - thousand - feet - long dirigible to a mast eleven - hundred feet above the ground never seemed feasible. Based on the factual evidence in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, this theory was proven a failure. “Dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable.” If a dirigible caught fire while attempting to dock at the Empire State Building, the incident would quickly turn into a catastrophe. “The greatest obstacle was nature itself.” The high - speed and shifting winds atop the Empire State Building would cause moored dirigibles to swing around the mast. Another obstacle the building's builders faced was the law that prohibited air vessels from flying too low over urban areas, a problem that doomed the theory from the start. In conclusion, these insurmountable obstacles ensured the failure of the docking concept.
924	15757	6	2	The Empire State Building's builders faced many challenges when considering allowing dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, dirigibles mainly used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. A fire in one of these dirigibles over a large city like New York would be catastrophic. Secondly, the wind currents made docking impossible. “The ship would swivel around the mooring mast” and could potentially puncture the frame. The entire idea was both dangerous and risky. Moreover, it was illegal to fly “too low over urban areas.” So, not only was it a perilous plan, but it also violated the law. In conclusion, these obstacles ultimately prevailed and prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building.
925	15758	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many difficulties in enabling dirigibles to moor at the mooring mast. In the article “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the author provides examples of these challenges. One major obstacle for docking dirigibles to the mast was the safety of the people inside. The article states, “The greatest reason was one of safety,” and further explains that “Most dirigibles from outside the U.S used Hydrogen, and Hydrogen is highly flammable.” Another factor was nature. The author notes that “The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,” which would lead to an unsafe departure of passengers. The article also mentions that “Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel,” demonstrating the unsafe air conditions. These two obstacles made landing at the mooring mast extremely difficult and eventually impossible. In conclusion, these issues effectively halted the plan of dirigibles mooring at the Empire State Building's mooring mast.
926	15759	6	2	The construction team of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. Firstly, the wind conditions were a significant hurdle. The strong and variable winds at the top of the building made it difficult for dirigibles to dock safely, as they would be moved around during the docking process. Secondly, there were weight - related issues. The building's frame was not stable enough to support the additional stress of a docked dirigible, and rectifying this would require a substantial financial investment. Finally, safety was a major concern. After the explosion of the German dirigible Hindenburg, it became clear that allowing blimps to land over crowded cities was extremely dangerous. Additionally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for them to approach the Empire State Building. These multiple problems combined made it very difficult for the builders to achieve their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock.
927	15760	6	2	"According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building's builders faced several key obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock. One issue was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles. As stated in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt, most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. The destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, made the building's owners realize the extreme danger of such an accident occurring above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Another major obstacle was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around it, which was clearly unsafe and could not be resolved. Lastly, an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for ships to approach the building. These obstacles of hydrogen use, nature, and the law meant that Al Smith's plan to make dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a reality could not be achieved."
928	15761	6	2	"The Empire State Building's builders confronted multiple challenges while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the challenges was the ""violent air - currents"" at the top of the building. These air - currents made it extremely difficult to dock a dirigible without it being blown away. Safety was another major concern. Dirigibles were filled with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and an accident involving a flaming balloon over New York's densely populated areas would be extremely dangerous. Despite the appealing concept of creating docking stations for dirigibles, the numerous obstacles and hazards made it an unfeasible plan."
929	15762	6	2	"When the builders of the Empire State Building aimed to make it possible for dirigibles to dock, they faced a series of obstacles. The construction of the mast atop the building was the first problem. As the excerpt mentions, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This indicates that the building's frame needed proper modification to ensure a safe and successful docking. Another aspect was the aesthetic design. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless - steel tower that would be illuminated from inside to make the construction look decorative. However, the most significant obstacle was nature. As @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 pointed out, the winds at that altitude were too unstable for a dirigible to dock. The winds could potentially ""swing"" the rear of the dirigible around the mast, posing a great risk and making the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building a very challenging task."
930	15763	6	2	The construction of the Empire State Building had ambitious plans for dirigibles to dock there, but the builders were met with a host of difficulties. One of the primary issues was related to the building's mast. A dirigible moored at the top, held by just a single cable, would place extra stress on the building's frame. Thus, the frame of the Empire State Building had to be appropriately modified to ensure the safe and successful docking of dirigibles. Another matter was the visual appeal. The architects designed an illuminated tower made of shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel to make the overall construction more decorative. Nevertheless, nature presented the most significant obstacle. The winds at the building's altitude were highly unstable. Even if a dirigible was tethered, the back of the ship would spin around the mast, a situation that was far too dangerous for successful docking. In conclusion, these challenges made it very hard for the builders to achieve their goal of enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
931	15764	6	2	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigible docking. These issues encompassed both safety and practical aspects. In terms of safety, most dirigibles outside the United States utilized hydrogen instead of helium. Since hydrogen is more flammable than helium, it led to the destruction of the German airship Hindenburg by fire. As for practical concerns, it was illegal to fly an airship too low over a city. This existing law made it illegal for a dirigible to even tie up to the building. These obstacles ultimately prevented dirigibles from landing on the building.
932	15765	6	2	"According to the excerpt, the Empire State Building's builders faced multiple obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the ""lack of a suitable landing area"". Another was the stress a dirigible would impose on the building. As the author mentioned in paragraph nine, ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation"". To make the docking idea work, the Empire State Building's steel frame would need more strength and modification. The location of the building also posed a major challenge. The strong and constantly - shifting winds were a significant hurdle. Additionally, there was ""a law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". By the late 1930s, the idea of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building faded, and airplanes took over as the main form of air transportation."
933	15766	6	2	"The obstacles faced by the Empire State Building's builders made constructing the mooring difficult. One problem was that most dirigibles made outside of a certain region used hydrogen rather than helium. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the owners of the Empire State Building recognized how much worse such an incident would be in highly - populated New York City. Another obstacle was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing. As the author stated, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". The final obstacle was the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. These difficulties hindered the construction of the mooring."
934	15767	6	2	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered various obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on it, including those related to nature, safety, and the size and weight of the dirigibles. Initially, they were hopeful about equipping the building for an emerging age of transportation, as envisioned by aviation pioneers. However, they soon recognized the risks. Nature presented a significant challenge, with violent air currents causing constant wind shifts. This meant that the ""lighter - than - air"" dirigibles would swivel around the mooring mast without proper weight support. For instance, in @DATE1, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough due to the winds. Safety was also a major concern. Most dirigibles outside the U.S. used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. After the fire - related destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg, the owners of the Empire State Building feared a similar incident over densely - populated New York. Moreover, the size and weight of the dirigible, which was @NUM1 ft long and held by a single cable, would add stress to the building's frame, requiring modifications. These and other obstacles indicated that the idea of dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building was unlikely to be realized."
935	15768	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several challenges when trying to construct a docking facility for dirigibles. A major problem was the safety issue. Outside the United States, dirigibles typically used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the builders did not want to risk a disaster similar to the Hindenburg incident. Given that New York is a densely populated area, they realized that the consequences of such an accident would be far more severe. These concerns made it clear that building a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building was fraught with risks.
936	15769	6	2	The safety of having a large dirigible, @CAPS1, above thousands of civilians is questionable. The builders encountered numerous problems when trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Firstly, the mast was not yet ready, as indicated in the excerpt “to fix a mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date.” Additionally, the landing gear was not ready or guaranteed to function properly. Moreover, the idea of using dirigibles over a crowded area was not considered a wise one. In conclusion, the various issues faced by the builders suggest that the plan to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building was fraught with challenges and safety concerns.
937	15770	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant issue was that most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. After a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the building's owners recognized the heightened danger in a crowded area. Another problem was that violent air currents would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast. As it would dangle high above street pedestrians, this posed a clear safety risk. Additionally, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. Fortunately, by the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles had faded away, and the builders no longer had to deal with these obstacles. Overall, these obstacles effectively ended the plan for dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
938	15771	6	2	In today's era, the idea of Hindenburg - sized airships landing on top of the Empire State Building seems preposterous. However, in the 1920s, it was a dream for many. Unfortunately, this dream remained unfulfilled due to multiple obstacles faced by the builders. One major obstacle was the use of hydrogen in the airships. The majority of visiting blimps used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, rather than helium. An accident above a densely populated area like downtown New York could have been disastrous. Another significant problem was the wind. Constantly shifting due to violent air currents, the ships could swing into other buildings. Furthermore, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal regardless of the wind or hydrogen issues. In conclusion, the combination of these three obstacles ensured that the dream of airships landing in New York did not become a reality.
939	15772	6	2	In the story “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The large size of the dirigible created tension and stress. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame, potentially causing crucial damage. Additionally, the contents of some dirigibles were a concern. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, and the risk of the balloon catching fire was too great. Moreover, nature itself was a major obstacle. The winds on top of the building were much more violent than those at ground level, causing alarm. In conclusion, upon closer examination, it became clear that the plan to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building was beset with various and significant obstacles.
940	15773	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. The Empire State Building's majestic spire is well - known worldwide, but few know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, or blimps. The builders faced a multitude of problems. As stated, “The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building Flat Roof... A Thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable Tether, would add stress to the Building's frame.” Tying dirigibles to the building was a risky move that could cause pressure and potentially lead to structural failure. Also, “The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.” The strong winds on top of the building made the situation dangerous. Clearly, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigible docking. In summary, these challenges made the plan difficult to execute.
941	15774	6	2	"1. In an excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders attempting to enable dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles. As stated in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress from the wind and the dirigible's weight would need to be transferred to the building's foundation, approximately eleven hundred feet below. Paragraph @NUM2 mentions that ""most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable."" A disaster similar to the Hindenburg fire in a densely populated area like New York, above a large building full of people, would be far more catastrophic. The winds above the Empire State Building were constantly changing due to violent air currents, presenting the designers with the problem of a dirigible swinging around the mooring mast. Facing these many obstacles, the builders in the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2 ultimately abandoned the project."
942	15775	6	2	"2. On December 11, 1929, Al Smith conceived the idea of making the Empire State Building the tallest building in the United States. His aim was to outdo the Chrysler Building, and he envisioned it reaching a height of 1,250 feet. To achieve this, he proposed adding a mooring mast. However, several issues arose. Blimps are highly flammable as they contain both hydrogen and helium, as demonstrated by the German dirigible that was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937. New York City is densely populated, with millions of tourists daily. In such an area, a similar disaster could have been extremely dangerous. The most significant issue was nature. As described in the text, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... the back of the ship would Swivel around the mooring mast"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). On May 6, 1937, the building's owners concluded that the effort to make the Empire State Building the tallest building with a mooring mast was neither practical nor safe."
943	15776	6	2	"3. When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, builders encountered multiple obstacles. One was the need to modify the building's entire frame. A quote from the excerpt states, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame... The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This clearly indicates that the builders had to deal with this complex task, making it a major obstacle. Another obstacle was nature. The statement ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" shows that the builders struggled to find a practical way to disembark passengers, and adding lead to the back of the dirigible would endanger pedestrians below. Safety was also a significant concern. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" as seen in the case of the German dirigible Hindenburg. These were the obstacles the workers faced during the attempt to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
944	15777	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the key obstacles was the mooring mast. The winds above the Empire State Building were constantly changing, and if a dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, it would swivel around it. Another challenge was the existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Since the Empire State Building is located in New York, an urban area, the plan to use dirigibles was likely unfeasible. These obstacles ultimately prevented the dirigibles from fulfilling their intended role at the Empire State Building.
945	15778	6	2	5. During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced certain obstacles. One issue was the unsolved problems related to mooring airships to a mast at a desired height, which led to the postponement of the installation to a later date. It was evident even before construction that the Empire State Building might never fulfill its intended purpose. Another obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. These factors combined meant that the building was hindered from achieving its envisioned function.
946	15779	6	2	1. The Empire State Building's builders encountered multiple obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a primary concern. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. An accident in a densely populated area like New York would have been catastrophic. Nature also posed a significant challenge. The winds at the building's top constantly shifted due to violent air currents. Even when dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, their backs would spin around it. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. In conclusion, these various obstacles made it extremely difficult to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
947	15780	6	2	2. When the builders of the Empire State Building tried to allow dirigibles to dock there, they faced issues related to weather, chemistry, and construction. The building's height led to constantly shifting winds at the top because of violent air currents, causing the backs of dirigibles to orbit the mast. The gas used in most non - domestic dirigibles was hydrogen, an extremely flammable gas, as demonstrated by the destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg in a fire. The building's owners realized how much more disastrous such an accident could be above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Moreover, the building's construction was a problem. The load of the dirigibles and wind pressure would stress the building's frame, and modifications were costly. The builders spent sixty thousand dollars to address this, but other construction - related problems were insurmountable. In the end, the combination of these issues made the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building unsafe and impractical.
948	15781	6	2	"3. A building is a complex and delicate structure, and the builders of the Empire State Building faced major challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock. They couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the flat roof. Strengthening the structure cost sixty thousand dollars in modifications. They also had to design an aesthetically pleasing mast, using glass, a difficult material to work with. The most significant hurdle was allowing the dirigible to dock. Dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and an explosion would have been catastrophic for the city. Nature was also a major obstacle, as constantly shifting winds made the back of the dirigible swivel and unsafe. Adding weights to the back would have been even more dangerous. Additionally, laws prohibited low - altitude flight. Despite these challenges, blimps like ""Columbia"" and ""Los Angeles"" attempted docking but found it too difficult. Overall, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building had numerous flaws."
949	15782	6	2	4. The excerpt provides reasons why it would be difficult for dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. Dirigibles were docked using an electric winch that pulled in a line from the front of the ship and tied it to a mast. The dirigible's body could swing in the breeze, and passengers getting off via a gangplank from the observation deck was potentially dangerous. Another factor was that dirigibles were losing passengers in the late 1930s because of the rise of airplanes. By that time, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had faded, as dirigibles had given way to airplanes. In conclusion, both the safety risks for passengers and the competition from airplanes made it difficult for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
950	15783	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when building a mast for dirigibles to dock. Some dirigibles were highly flammable as they used hydrogen instead of helium. The destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg in a fire made the building's owners realize how much more disastrous such an incident could be in a densely populated area like New York. Violent winds, a natural obstacle, couldn't be fixed. Even when tethered, the back of the dirigible would swivel around the mast. Adding lead weights to the back was not a safe solution as they would hang over pedestrians. A law against airships flying too low in urban areas also stopped the project. In summary, the multitude of obstacles made it impossible for the builders to construct a mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
951	15784	6	2	1. When constructing the Empire State Building, builders encountered numerous challenges in enabling dirigibles to dock there. One significant hurdle was the lack of a suitable landing area. However, Al Smith saw this as an opportunity and proposed adding a mooring mast at the building's apex for dirigibles to anchor. Yet, this idea presented another problem. A mooring mast could not simply be placed on the roof. The stress from the load and wind pressure needed to be transferred to the building's foundation, which would require modifying and strengthening the steel frame at a cost of @MONEY1. Ultimately, the plan to install a mooring mast for dirigibles did not materialize, and architects should have anticipated these potential issues from the start.
952	15785	6	2	"2. In ""The Mooring Mast,"" Marcia details Al Smith's attempt to install a mooring mast on the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock for several hours. Architects faced multiple obstacles when incorporating the mast into the building's design. One obstacle was modifying the building to prevent the blimp's weight from stressing the foundation. As stated, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" (∂ @NUM1) Another factor that delayed blimp docking at the building's top was safety. Most non - US blimps used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Given New York's high population density, there was a high risk of frequent fires. On May 6, 1937, even the Empire State Building's owners recognized this danger, which ultimately hindered the implementation of the blimp - docking plan."
953	15786	6	2	"3. The builders of the Empire State Building, with the intention of placing a mooring mast at the top for dirigible docking, encountered several obstacles. Safety was a major concern. At that time, most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, and a single spark could cause the entire dirigible to catch fire. Eventually, the building's owners realized the potential harm of an accident occurring above a densely populated area like downtown New York and halted the mooring mast construction. Additionally, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" causing the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Even if the dirigible could be held still, all the stress would have to be transferred to the building's foundation. These combined problems led to the mooring mast falling into disuse."
954	15787	6	2	"4. The first major obstacle the builders faced was that despite having propellers and rudders, blimps are still at the mercy of the wind. The wind on top of the building was described as ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (∂ @NUM1), making it impossible to keep blimps stable while moored on the Empire State Building. Docking a blimp was extremely difficult. The only blimp that attempted to dock, the naval dirigible Los Angeles, couldn't get close enough to attach the mooring lines. The crew was ""fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell"" (∂ @NUM2), potentially causing the dirigible to crash into the city. The second major obstacle was public safety. There were too many risks involved. The blimp could explode like the Hindenburg or collide with spires on surrounding buildings and plummet to the ground, potentially harming hundreds of people. Therefore, docking a dirigible on the Empire State Building was an impractical idea."
955	15788	6	2	"5. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. These included safety concerns, legal restrictions, and the challenges posed by nature (weather). For the project to succeed, all aspects had to be safe, but that was not the case. ""Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (∂ @NUM1). After a German dirigible caught fire in New Jersey, the building owners recognized the potential disaster of a fire in downtown New York, a densely populated area. Secondly, ""there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (∂ @NUM2), making it illegal to approach the building. Lastly, nature was unpredictable, and the weather was not guaranteed to permit docking. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... The back of the ship would swivel around... dangling high above pedestrians on the street"" (∂ @NUM3). Clearly, this was neither safe nor practical. In the end, the obstacles were insurmountable, and the top of the building never became a mooring mast for dirigibles."
956	15789	6	2	1. During the construction of the Empire State Building, the workers encountered numerous obstacles. As Al Smith aimed to outcompete the Chrysler Building and make the Empire State Building the tallest in the world, he decided to add a mooring mast. This addition would increase the building's height to 1,250 feet. However, it required a complete redesign of the building's entire skeleton. The builders had to ensure that the Empire State Building could support the mast, which was intended for dirigibles to land and for people to embark and disembark. The steel frame of the building needed to be modified and strengthened. The builders managed to complete the work on the steel frame within two months, and the construction continued as planned. Eventually, it became evident that the mast could not be used for dirigibles due to the strong and unpredictable wind currents at the building's peak.
957	15790	6	2	2. When constructing the Empire State Building, the builders faced multiple challenges. One issue was the lack of a suitable landing area, as mentioned in a previous reference (paragraph 6). Al Smith proposed adding a mooring mast to the top of the building to enable dirigibles to land. However, there were numerous problems associated with this mooring mast. Architects could not simply place a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top with a single cable tether would exert additional stress on the building's frame. As a result, the architects had to strengthen the building's foundation, and over sixty thousand dollars were spent on modifying the building's framework. The natural elements presented the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. The shifting winds caused the back of the dirigible to swivel, which was unsafe. Additionally, airships flying too low over urban areas violated existing regulations. In conclusion, having a mooring mast for dirigibles was dangerous, against the law, and required a significant amount of work.
958	15791	6	2	3. The excerpt reveals that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles, primarily related to dirigibles and the success of the mooring mast. Dirigibles were large, steel - framed balloons with cotton fabric envelopes. They were filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Unlike regular balloons, dirigibles could be maneuvered using propellers and rudders. The successful use of the mooring mast was another major hurdle. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. Moreover, a mooring mast that could weigh down and dangle above pedestrians was not a safe option. In summary, these were the key challenges the builders had to overcome during the construction.
959	15792	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered significant problems when trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. One problem was that when dirigibles were moored to the top, they added stress to the building's frame. This stress had to be transferred all the way to the foundation. Another issue was that most dirigibles outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen. If a fire destroyed a dirigible above the densely populated downtown area of New York, it would have serious consequences. Additionally, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to approach the area. In conclusion, these problems made it extremely difficult to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
960	15793	6	2	5. The obstacles faced by the builders were avoidable. The first obstacle was the limited landing space. With more thought, they likely could have found a way to overcome this problem. Regarding the fate of the mast, everyone, including Al Smith, should have prioritized safety. The builders should have anticipated such problems, considering they were implementing a poor plan for a construction project that had never been done before. In conclusion, better planning and a focus on safety could have mitigated the challenges they faced.
961	15794	6	2	"1. Initially, all the plans for the Empire State Building appeared entirely feasible. Dirigibles were intended to tie up to the mast atop the building and dock while passengers disembarked; however, it was more difficult to execute than it seemed. Soon, the planners began to recognize the flaws in this plan, with several main issues emerging. After witnessing the ease with which the ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire, they realized it was too perilous to have dirigibles flying over a densely populated area like downtown New York. When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to dock, it could not get close enough to tie up due to strong winds. The windy conditions were too severe for the lightweight dirigibles to remain stable. Additionally, even if a dirigible could be tied down, the back of the ship would spin around the mooring mast. Moreover, unlike dirigible landing fields, it was far too risky to dangle weights above the city of New York just to hold the back of the dirigibles down. By the late 1930s, it became clear that, contrary to prior belief, dirigibles were not the future; airplanes emerged as a newer and more efficient alternative. It was a good idea, but as the saying goes, it was ""destined to never fulfill its purpose."""
962	15795	6	2	2. The planners of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One problem was the law. There was a regulation in place that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for airships to tie up to the building or even approach the vicinity. Another issue was that dirigibles were filled with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and a dirigible explosion over New York City would be catastrophic. The final problem they encountered was the wind. At the building's summit, the winds shifted due to violent air - currents. Even when dirigibles were tied up, the back end would move around. They considered using lead weights on the back, but it was not safe to do so over a large population. In conclusion, these multiple challenges made the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building unviable.
963	15796	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building had a grand vision of incorporating a mooring mast where dirigibles, also referred to as zeppelins or blimps, could dock. Although the concept was promising, it presented the builders with significant obstacles. During the construction of the framework, adding the mast to the top was not straightforward. If dirigibles were to be moored there, it would place excessive stress on the building's framework. As a result, they had to modify the entire framework to strengthen it, which was a costly endeavor. After the construction was completed, nature posed another difficulty. The building, standing at 1,250 feet tall, had constantly changing and dangerous winds at the top. This made it arduous for a dirigible to remain stationary when moored. Additionally, the builders did not anticipate the laws against blimps flying too low over urban areas. These two challenges ultimately rendered the use of the mooring mast impracticable.
964	15797	6	2	4. The builders faced significant obstacles in their plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. One major concern was the danger of having dirigibles hovering over a densely populated area. On May 6, 1937, a German dirigible was destroyed by fire, highlighting the risks. Another hurdle was the law; it was illegal for blimps to fly too low over heavily populated regions. Due to these insurmountable issues, Al Smith had to abandon the plan. In the end, the combination of safety concerns and legal restrictions made the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building unworkable.
965	15798	6	2	5. Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges for the builders. Dirigibles could be up to one thousand feet long, and their size would add stress to the building's frame. Realistically, it would be impossible for them to dock without the builders having to reconstruct and strengthen the frame. Most non - rigid dirigibles are filled with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and if a dirigible caught fire, pedestrians could be seriously injured. Later, the builders discovered an existing law regarding airships flying too low, which made it illegal for a dirigible to even fly near the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made the plan of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
966	15799	6	2	1. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building builders encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigible docking. They had to deal with a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the 1,250 - ft - high building's top. Attaching a single cable tether would impose excessive stress on the building's frame, necessitating its modification and strengthening. Additionally, they initially overlooked the problem of wind caused by violent air currents. Given these difficult - to - solve issues, the concept of having a dirigible at the top of the Empire State Building ultimately faded away.
967	15800	6	2	2. In an excerpt from “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building's builders faced multiple challenges in their bid to allow dirigibles to dock. One issue was the lack of a suitable landing area. Although dirigibles were intended to anchor on the mooring mast for refueling or servicing, nature presented the greatest obstacle. The wind at the building's top was constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The builders worried that the back of the ship would “swivel around and around the mooring mast,” and concluded that “dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe.” To ensure safety, the entire building would need to be modified and strengthened, requiring an investment of over @NUM1 dollars. Moreover, there was already a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Due to these obstacles, the docking facility was never opened to the public.
968	15801	6	2	3. The primary problems the Empire State Building's builders faced when trying to enable dirigible docking were the wind conditions and the proximity of dirigibles to the building. The wind conditions made it difficult for them to determine how dirigibles could dock. The winds near the building's top were “constantly shifting due to violent air currents” (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Another problem was the difficulty in getting dirigibles close to the building. During a test run, the Los Angeles tried to approach the mast but “could not get close enough to tie up.” Despite not achieving the intended purpose for dirigible docking, the Empire State Building remains one of the greatest structures of all time.
969	15802	6	2	4. The Empire State Building's builders encountered many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. One of the initial issues was the realization that a dirigible moored at the building's top would add stress to its frame. They understood that wind pressure could make the dirigible swivel, which was not suitable for the building's foundation. Strengthening the building's structure would cost over sixty thousand dollars. The workers also recognized that dirigibles are flammable, and any mishap could cause devastation in such a populated area. These obstacles brought an end to the dream of having a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building.
970	15803	6	2	5. Throughout the excerpt about building the Empire State Building, the builders faced arduous challenges in constructing a dock for dirigibles. A major problem was that dirigibles could not land on the building's flat roof, as stated in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt. Another challenge was designing elevators and stairs for passengers to reach the top of the building to board the dirigible. Along with stair design, they had to build 102 floors for the blimp - landing area, as supported in paragraphs 11 and @NUM2 of the reading. Towards the end of the construction, the builders encountered significant safety concerns, which they had not initially anticipated.
971	15804	6	2	1. When constructing the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous challenges while trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One significant hurdle was that the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure needed to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation. This entailed spending over @MONEY1 to construct a frame capable of withstanding such pressure. Another issue was that most dirigibles contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The builders worried that if a balloon caught fire, it would plummet onto the densely - populated city below, and there was no way to change this risk. Additionally, the winds on the building's top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would cause the dirigible to move around while passengers were boarding or alighting, posing a safety hazard. These were the main obstacles the Empire State Building's builders had to face.
972	15805	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building set overly high expectations and were confronted with unforeseen obstacles. Safety was a major concern when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock. Dirigibles typically used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. Given that New York is a densely - populated city, the risk of a fire starting was significant. Another obstacle was nature. The wind could be extremely powerful at times, and as stated in the reading, the winds on the building's top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These dangerous winds would have made it impossible for dirigibles to land safely and function as a reliable mode of transportation. The final obstacle was legality. There was a law against a ship tying up to the building, as per the reading. With this law in place, there was no hope for the plan to succeed.
973	15806	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to make it feasible for dirigibles to dock at the building's top. They couldn't install an all - steel mooring mast on the building because it would place excessive stress on the building's frame and foundation. To add a mooring mast, they would need to modify and strengthen the building's frame. Safety was another major problem. Many dirigibles from outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen, and the building was located in a densely - populated area in downtown New York City. Nature also presented an obstacle. The winds on the building's top were strong, and the air currents shifted frequently, which would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mast.
974	15807	6	2	4. The Empire State Building was in competition with the Chrysler Building during construction. The Chrysler Building had a surprise up its sleeve; it constructed an 185 - foot spire inside the building. This move shocked the public as it brought the Chrysler Building to a height of @DATE1 feet, 46 feet taller than the originally announced height of the Empire State Building. As a result, the Empire State Building seemed destined never to fulfill its goal of being the tallest building.
975	15808	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. When a dirigible was docked, it was held by a single cable tether, which added stress to the building's frame. To address this, the steel frame of the building from top to bottom had to be modified and strengthened, and more than @MONEY1 was spent on these framework modifications. After the owners of the Empire State Building learned about the Hindenburg being destroyed by fire, they realized how much worse the situation could have been if such an incident occurred over downtown New York. A docking accident involving a hydrogen - filled dirigible would be extremely dangerous for the workers and anyone in the vicinity of the building.
976	15809	6	2	"1. The architects who designed the Empire State Building with the aim of allowing zeppelins to dock at over @NUM1 feet encountered numerous challenges. As stated in ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, issues included the added stress on the building's frame when a blimp was attached, and the design of the mooring mast. The article notes that for safe docking, ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". The mooring mast was mainly made of steel. Other difficulties were the wind factor and keeping zeppelins stationary in the ""constantly shifting"" and ""violent air currents"" at @NUM2 feet. Safety was also a major concern, as architects recognized that a repeat of an accident like the Hindenburg's in New York City could have catastrophic consequences. Consequently, the Empire State Building's mooring mast for zeppelins was never put into use."
977	15810	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building confronted multiple obstacles when trying to construct a moor for docking dirigibles. It was unsafe for a dirigible to be close to the ground, especially in New York. High - altitude air currents made operating the dirigible near buildings more difficult. Additionally, dirigibles were highly flammable because they used hydrogen to stay afloat at that time. Many blimps attempted to dock at the Empire State Building, but all attempts were unsuccessful. In conclusion, these various factors combined to prevent the effective docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
978	15811	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. Structural problems were one issue; the pressure on the building's foundation from the pull of the dirigibles was a concern. They also broke the law as there was a regulation regarding how low an airship could fly over an urban area, and the dirigibles would be flying too low. Another obstacle was keeping the dirigible safe in the air. High winds would cause the airship to swing around and potentially break off, and if it exploded, the debris would fall on downtown New York City. Due to these insurmountable problems, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not feasible.
979	15812	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. One problem was that most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. Given that downtown New York is densely populated, this was a major safety risk. The weather was also an issue. The Empire State Building is very tall, so there are strong and constantly changing winds at the top due to violent air currents. Moreover, the builders did not consider government regulations. There was a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, so using the mooring mast would have been illegal. In summary, these obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
980	15813	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building had difficulties in their attempt to place a thousand - foot dirigible on top of the building. The wind was a major problem; there was no way to keep the dirigible in place, which would have made it swing back and forth. This could have caused the dirigible to hit a sharp corner of the building and explode, endangering thousands of lives in New York City. They also faced challenges in getting the machinery needed to operate the mooring mast. Additionally, they needed approval due to safety concerns, especially after the Hindenburg disaster in Lakehurst, New Jersey. In the end, these issues prevented the successful docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
981	15814	6	2	"1. According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building's mooring mast, the builders encountered multiple obstacles. The first was nature. As stated, ""The greatest obstacle ...was nature itself."" The strong winds at that altitude would cause the dirigible to sway unpredictably, posing safety risks. Another issue emerged after the ""Hindenburg"" caught fire in New Jersey. Since ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" a hydrogen - filled dirigible catching fire at the Empire State Building could endanger the building and pedestrians below. The final obstacle was a law. The ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" made it illegal for any aircraft to approach the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the excerpt shows that the builders faced numerous challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building."
982	15815	6	2	"2. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the Empire State Building's builders faced several problems while constructing the dirigibles dock. One problem was related to the winds and the safety of the building and people. As described, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents... using the Empire State Building was neither practical nor safe."" Another obstacle was the law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, as ""This law would make it illegal for the ship to even tie up to the building or even approach the area."" There was also an issue with the building's structure and foundation. The builders spent over sixty thousand dollars on modifying the building structure to construct the mast. In summary, these challenges made the construction of the dirigibles dock a difficult task."
983	15816	6	2	"3. Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" the Empire State Building's builders faced an obstacle when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. They needed to figure out how to moor a thousand - foot dirigible at the top of the building without ""adding stress to the building framework."" They couldn't simply place the mooring mast on the building's flat roof because ""the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven thousand feet below."" @CAPS1 To solve this, they had to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building, costing over sixty thousand dollars in modifications to the building's framework. Additionally, ""rather than building a utilitarian mast with any ornamentation, they built a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside,"" made the 101st floor a glassed - in observation area, and the @NUM1 floor an open observation platform. In conclusion, the builders overcame the structural challenge through significant modifications and creative design."
984	15817	6	2	"4. Despite the optimistic plans for the mooring mast, numerous obstacles prevented it from becoming a reality. Safety was the first reason the builders had difficulty allowing dirigibles to dock. The helium in the balloons was highly flammable, and a fire could endanger all of New York City. Secondly, high winds made dirigibles unsafe. As paragraph @NUM1 states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."". Lastly, the builders faced pre - existing laws. An existing law prohibited aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. These three major obstacles were faced by the Empire State Building's builders. Ultimately, due to these obstacles, the mooring mast never became a reality."
985	15818	6	2	"5. In the excerpt, several obstacles were encountered. The building was the world's tallest at 1,250 ft, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. Another problem was the safety of dirigibles. The Hindenburg incident, where a helium - filled dirigible caught fire during construction, raised concerns. The thought of a dirigible catching fire over New York made the whole concept of dirigibles seem dangerous. Finally, there were laws preventing aircraft from getting too close to the city. As a result, the idea of the ""future of travel"" was considered unappealing and impractical. In conclusion, these obstacles made the implementation of dirigibles in this context highly unlikely."
986	15819	6	2	"1. Builders of the docking facility for dirigibles at the Empire State Building encountered several significant obstacles. These included weather conditions, the height of the structure, its stability, and the presence of highly flammable gases from the dirigibles. The weather was a major factor as strong winds could cause the dirigible to be tossed around, potentially colliding with nearby buildings. The structure needed to be stable at its height to prevent the dirigible from knocking over the Empire State Building, which could have had catastrophic consequences for New York. As author Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 noted, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This was crucial to avoid the destruction of a large part of New York. Additionally, the highly flammable gases required intense supervision. If these gases caught fire, the Empire State Building, pedestrians, and downtown New York could be engulfed in flames. Due to these obstacles, the mooring mast was never completed and used."
987	15820	6	2	"2. Docking dirigibles presents several challenges, with government regulations and laws being a major hurdle. There is an existing law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas. As stated, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Safety is another significant concern. Dirigibles are flammable, and in the event of an accident, they could easily cause injury and death. As mentioned, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS2. @NUM2). Nature and weather also pose problems. The winds at high altitudes are extremely strong and powerful, creating a significant danger for dirigibles. As described, ""... violent air currents... back of the ship would swivel around... high above pedestrians"" (@CAPS2. @NUM3). These challenges make docking dirigibles a complex and risky endeavor."
988	15821	6	2	"3. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" @ORGANIZATION3 details the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building when attempting to create a dock for dirigibles. In late 1929, Al Smith was confident about the building's height and its potential use. The project team for the mooring mast consulted experts from the U.S. Naval Air Station. However, they ultimately found the project too difficult to manage. The mast never served its intended purpose due to numerous issues, with nature being the primary obstacle. Docking a dirigible at the building's high - altitude peak proved to be practically impossible. The danger to New York civilians was also a significant flaw, as it was difficult to control a dirigible in windy conditions, and dirigibles are highly flammable. Legally, there was a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying at the altitude required for docking. The idea of the mooring mast was interesting, and if realized, dirigibles might have become more popular. Nevertheless, the mooring mast was impractical, and the obstacles it presented outweighed the ambition behind its design."
989	15822	6	2	"4. The Empire State Building is at a significant height (at @NUM1 ft). One of the problems is that the building moves when in the air. If a dirigible weighing around fifty - thousand pounds or more were to be docked, a strong windstorm could potentially cause the building to be damaged. The concept of a dock seemed like a good idea, but it would require a winch and large clamps to be attached to the building to secure the balloon or dirigible for docking and refueling. As @PERSON1 of the building's architectural office said in paragraph @NUM2, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" If Irving decides to establish an air station with a blimp, new technology would be needed. In the future, just as we might have flying cars, it's possible to envision balloons attached to buildings."
990	15823	6	2	5. It was not feasible to moor a thousand - foot dirigible at the top of the building using a single cable tether. Doing so would add excessive stress to the building's frame, which could potentially compromise the structural integrity of the building. This shows that a more sophisticated and robust mooring system would be required if such a docking arrangement were to be considered.
991	15824	6	2	1. The concept of using a mooring mast to enable dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was never a viable option. This was because Al Smith's team encountered numerous difficulties when trying to create a mooring mast for dirigible docking. These challenges included the pressure a docked dirigible would exert on the building, the danger of high - winds violently shaking the dirigible, the risk of the dirigible catching fire due to the flammable hydrogen it might contain, and the close proximity of the dirigible to other buildings in the area. The initial problem during the mooring mast development was the stress the heavy dirigible would place on the building. The steel frame of the building would need to be modified and strengthened to handle the additional pressure from the dirigible. Moreover, wind pressure also contributed to the stress on the building. The wind made it difficult to construct the mooring mast's structure as it not only added pressure to the building but also prevented the dirigible from staying in one place. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, its back would spin around the mast. Another potential accident was a fire due to the possible flammability of the dirigible. Since the dirigible would be close to people, such as tourists on the building's observation deck, a fire (if it was filled with hydrogen instead of helium) could be far more disastrous than if it landed in an open field. Additionally, it was illegal for airships to dock or fly in such close proximity to urban areas. For instance, when the Los Angeles tested the docking process at the Empire State Building's mooring mast, it could not get close enough to tie up because of strong winds. All these were significant obstacles to the construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast for dirigible docking. They are the reasons why the architects of the Empire State Building concluded that such a structure was not practical to build.
992	15825	6	2	"2. In an excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered extremely difficult obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. One of the most challenging obstacles was ""nature itself"". There were powerful winds that ""constantly shifted due to violent air currents"". Even when the dirigible was ""tethered to the mooring mast"", its back would continuously move around. Dirigibles typically landed in open fields and were weighted down with lead weights. However, using lead weights to anchor dirigibles at a height of about 1,250 feet in a densely populated area like New York City was ""neither practical nor safe"". Additionally, ""there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", which meant that the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was simply unfeasible. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it clear that the plan to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building was not going to work."
993	15826	6	2	3. When designing the mooring mast for the Empire State Building, architects and builders had to overcome numerous challenges. Firstly, there were the basic problems associated with any transportation hub, such as how to manage the movement of people and baggage around the terminal. A more complex issue was how to compensate for the additional stress on the building's frame caused by the dirigible's load and wind pressure. This problem was addressed through a @MONEY1 redesign of the Empire State Building's frame. Moreover, dirigibles would constantly swing around due to the violent wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building. Weights could not be used to hold the airship in place as it would pose a danger to people on the streets below. The architects were unable to devise a way to keep the dirigible stationary. Ultimately, the idea of a mooring mast for dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building was abandoned. The insurmountable challenges made it clear that this concept was not practical for implementation.
994	15827	6	2	"4. Despite high hopes for enabling dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, numerous obstacles emerged during the pursuit of this goal. One issue identified during the design of the docking mast was that the height and weight of a dirigible would significantly increase the stress on the building's frame, which would then be transferred to the building's foundation. This presented a problem that the Empire State Building could not withstand. Safety was another major hurdle for the builders. Most dirigibles outside of @LOCATION2 were fueled by hydrogen gas instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, which put a densely populated area like downtown New York at risk. Nature also posed a problem. The constantly shifting winds at the top of the building, caused by extreme air currents, could easily make the back of the dirigible spin around the mooring mast. This situation was neither practical nor safe for the thousands of people below the building. As the passage states, ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never destined to fulfill its purpose..."", indicating that there were many insurmountable obstacles to allowing dirigibles to dock on the building. In conclusion, these challenges made it evident that the dream of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building could not be realized."
995	15828	6	2	5. One obstacle to the expanded use of dirigibles in New York City was the lack of landing areas. In response, Al Smith decided to add a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. This would allow dirigibles to anchor there, refuel for several hours, receive servicing, and enable passengers to embark and disembark. Dirigibles were docked using an electric winch. The winch hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to the mast. However, the electric winch cable would cause stress to the building frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. To accommodate this new situation, the steel frame of the building needed to be strengthened or modified. In conclusion, while the addition of the mooring mast was a creative solution to the landing - area problem, the resulting stress on the building's structure meant that significant modifications were necessary to make the plan workable.
996	15829	6	2	1. The construction team encountered numerous challenging obstacles when aiming to enable dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. Initially, they engaged in discussions with individuals like Al Smith to make the Empire State Building the tallest in the state, envisioning it as an excellent landmark for travelers. They succeeded in raising the building to @NUM1 feet. However, a significant hurdle was to ensure that dirigibles could reach the building's apex. Al Smith proposed that the top of the Empire State Building serve as a landing area, where dirigibles could refuel, undergo maintenance, and embark or disembark passengers. Thus, this was one of the obstacles the builders had to overcome to make the docking project viable.
997	15830	6	2	2. During the construction of the mast and the establishment of a docking facility for dirigibles at the Empire State Building, the constructors encountered major problems. The concept of a dirigible dock was promising at the time, yet it faced both structural and social issues. Architects pointed out that over time, the dirigible dock and climate - related changes would exert strain on the building's framework, leading to additional reconstruction work and increased economic expenditures. Another challenge was the building's location. Newly built dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, making them highly flammable. The tragic fire that destroyed the Hindenburg made the builders consider the potential consequences of a similar incident occurring over a densely populated area like downtown New York. The numerous obstacles associated with dirigible docking ultimately led to the project's termination, and what was once seen as the future is now part of the past.
998	15831	6	2	3. The Empire State Building went through different stages. There were efforts to make some minor adjustments to it. Since it was the tallest building at that time, these adjustments were made to enhance its fame. By making these improvements, the building was better positioned to attract more attention and become an even more well - known landmark.
999	15832	6	2	4. According to experts, the builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. One of the challenges was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the docking requirements. Additionally, they had to deal with the issue of wind. As described, the wind could push the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other nearby buildings, which would puncture the dirigible's shell. These obstacles made the task of enabling dirigible docking at the Empire State Building extremely difficult.
1000	15833	6	2	"5. In the reading comprehension ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. Their plan was to add a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building so that dirigibles could use it to reach the top of the building. However, the architects discovered that installing the mooring mast on the building's top would impose stress on the building's foundation. This finding presented a significant challenge to the goal of enabling dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
1001	15834	6	2	1. When constructing the Empire State Building, its architects aimed to enable dirigibles to dock there but encountered numerous challenges. On December 11, 1929, Al Smith, the proponent of the tallest - building project, announced that the Empire State Building would reach a height of 1,250 feet. It was planned to install a mooring mast at the top for airships like dirigibles. Dirigibles were quite large, with some being up to a thousand feet long, so a mooring mast seemed a suitable addition as it would allow them to anchor for refueling and passenger embarkation and disembarkation. However, the intended purpose of the mooring mast was never realized. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the German dirigible Hindenburg incident made the building's owners aware of the potential disaster if a similar accident occurred over a densely populated area like New York. The winds above the building were constantly changing. If a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around, and adding weights to the back was not an option as the blimp would be directly above pedestrians. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to approach the building. In December 1930, a US Navy dirigible reached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up due to strong winds. The captain was so afraid that he couldn't even take his hands off the controls. By the late 1930s, the idea of using dirigibles at the Empire State Building was abandoned, and airplanes took their place.
1002	15835	6	2	2. The construction of the Empire State Building with the intention of allowing dirigibles to dock presented the builders with multiple obstacles. These included the need for building structure redesign and modification, the fire risks associated with dirigibles, the swirling winds, and state law. The building was not initially constructed to support a mooring mast on its flat roof. As a result, over sixty thousand dollars had to be spent on modifications to enable this functionality. Dirigibles are prone to catching fire, as demonstrated by the Hindenburg disaster. If a similar incident were to occur over the densely populated area of New York, it would be a major catastrophe. The winds above the building are in a constant state of rapid swirl. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around the mast, which was a significant safety hazard. State law prohibited aircraft from flying as low as the mooring mast, making its use illegal. This factor should have been considered during the planning phase. Overall, poor planning led to numerous challenges for the builders in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1003	15836	6	2	3. During the construction of the Empire State Building, the architects faced several obstacles. They planned to have a @NUM1 ft. dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether. However, they couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the building's flat roof because the building was not originally designed for this purpose. The observation area was also intended to serve as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. After the building's frame was completed, the roof had to be finished before the mooring mast could be framed. The mast had a steel skeleton and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. Unfortunately, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never able to fulfill its intended purpose. The reasons for this were apparent even before its construction, highlighting the need for more thorough planning in the initial stages of the project.
1004	15837	6	2	4. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building's dirigible dock faced obstacles. They had to consider how the mast would function. As stated in paragraph nine, “the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.” This meant the builders had to modify the building. In paragraph ten, it was mentioned that “Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped - back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself.” By overcoming these obstacles, the builders were able to make effective use of the mast.
1005	15838	6	2	5. The architects of the Empire State Building encountered many problems while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the main issues was nature, specifically winds and air currents. As stated in @CAPS1 @NUM1, “Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles' shell...” This was an uncontrollable problem as no one can control the wind. Another significant factor was the law. According to @CAPS1 @NUM1, “The other practical reason why the dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.” This law made it impossible to fully utilize the mooring mast for transportation purposes. These obstacles were insurmountable for the architects, and the original plan for the project was eventually abandoned.
1006	15839	6	2	1. The construction of the Empire State Building's docking facility for dirigibles encountered multiple challenges. Firstly, dirigibles lacked proper landing gear. Landing them on the ground was difficult, and mid - air landing was nearly impossible. Secondly, it was extremely unsafe. Pilots would need to land at around @NUM1 feet in the sky, and a mistake could be fatal. Additionally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas, making it illegal to land dirigibles on the building. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced insurmountable problems when attempting to create a dirigible dock.
1007	15840	6	2	2. When constructing the Empire State Building, workers confronted numerous obstacles. They had to build the world's tallest structure, ensure it served a greater purpose than just being a building, and most importantly, make it stable. Architect Al Smith faced a significant challenge in designing the tallest building as the Chrysler Building, initially @NUM1 feet tall, was planned to be surpassed by the Empire State Building's planned @NUM2 feet. However, when the Chrysler Building's architect added a spire, its height reached 1,046 feet, only 46 feet taller than the Empire State Building. This sparked a competition. Al Smith aimed to create something more than a simple addition on top of the building. With the rising popularity of dirigibles, he decided to build a docking station. But due to a high margin of error and the crowded city of @ORGANIZATION3 below, this proved impossible. The addition still put the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, @NUM4 feet taller than the Chrysler Building. Another challenge was the elements. The building had to withstand high winds, and while most of it was weather - proof, the rocket - ship - like top with four wings at its base was a concern. Despite these seemingly impossible challenges, the crew built the Empire State Building, which remains an iconic structure to this day.
1008	15841	6	2	3. The builders faced three main obstacles: safety, nature, and the law. Regarding safety, many blimps used hydrogen instead of helium. Helium is an inert gas, while hydrogen is combustible. Nature also posed a problem as strong @CAPS4 winds blew the blimps off - target, and their non - aerodynamic design made them difficult to maneuver. There was also a law stating that blimps couldn't fly too low, which would have made docking illegal even if the other obstacles didn't exist. In conclusion, they should have built a @CAPS6 because @CAPS7 are simply better than blimps.
1009	15842	6	2	4. During the construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast, the builders encountered several obstacles. One issue was that the building was not stable enough to moor an airship. They addressed this by creating a stronger exoskeleton. However, they faced another problem with high - speed winds and the difficulty of getting passengers on and off. This problem remained unsolved, leading to the shutdown of the mooring project. With so many obstacles, the project became unfeasible and was never completed.
1010	15843	6	2	5. In Downtown New York, Al Smith and his builders aimed to build and dock a dirigible on top of the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, but the endeavor ended in failure. Smith planned to dock in New York as it was a location with many potential passengers. Dirigibles at that time were made of an enormous steel - framed balloon with cotton fabric envelopes filled with hydrogen and helium. However, hydrogen is highly flammable, and the cotton fabric could also catch fire, posing a great danger in a densely populated area. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to dock the dirigibles. Moreover, the size of the dirigible was too long, increasing the risk of crashing into other buildings. Additionally, forceful winds prevented the mooring mast from getting close enough to tie up the dirigible, as there was a fear of the wind blowing it onto the sharp spires of nearby buildings. Due to these numerous problems, all of Smith's plans for using dirigibles as future transportation failed.
1011	15844	6	2	1. The construction of a docking facility for dirigibles at the Empire State Building presented several challenges to its builders. One significant obstacle was the building's structure. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top with a single cable tether would place stress on the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transferred all the way to the nearly eleven - hundred - foot - deep foundation. As a result, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to handle this new situation. In conclusion, the structural requirements for dirigible docking were a major hurdle that needed to be addressed.
1012	15845	6	2	2. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when trying to create a docking area for dirigibles. One obstacle was nature. The wind at the top of the Empire State Building changed frequently due to bad weather, causing a tied - down blimp to move around. Another challenge was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. A fire on a blimp at the 102 - floor building in densely populated downtown New York could have disastrous consequences. In summary, these nature - related and safety - related issues were the main obstacles in creating a blimp docking area at the Empire State Building.
1013	15846	6	2	3. The problems with the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building should have been anticipated before its construction. During the construction, workers faced significant challenges. The top of the building was in a constant weather crisis, with winds constantly shifting due to violent air currents. A dirigible attached to the mooring mast would sway in the wind. On land, dirigibles use lead dead weights to prevent swaying, but this was not practical over crowded city streets. Additionally, the building needed to be reinforced to transfer the dirigible's energy to the foundation. It was also illegal for dirigibles to fly low over urban areas, and with most @CAPS1 blimps using highly flammable hydrogen, the project's safety was in question. After the Hindenburg incident, people became more reluctant to support the project, and the building's owners realized the potential catastrophe of an accident in downtown New York. In conclusion, due to these predictable obstacles, the idea of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building remained just a theory.
1014	15847	6	2	4. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast”, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Allowing a thousand - foot dirigible to land on top of the building was a major challenge. Having the dirigible held by a single cable tether was problematic, as it would add excessive stress to the building. To address this, the builders had to work on the building's steel frame. In conclusion, dealing with the stress on the building caused by the dirigible was a significant obstacle for the Empire State Building's builders.
1015	15848	6	2	5. When the engineers of the Empire State Building attempted to create a docking facility for dirigibles, they were confronted with a series of obstacles. The primary issue was the practicality of the dock. Although the idea was innovative, dirigibles were never going to be a popular mode of transport, so the dock was not useful. The flaw in the concept was its focus; the goal was to add footage to the building rather than create a successful dock. A different focus might have led to a more rewarding outcome. Technical problems also emerged. Legally, safely, and practically, the dock could not function. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, creating a fire hazard in a densely populated area. The blimp's anchor secured it at only one point, allowing it to spin dangerously in the wind. Using lead weights, the only solution, would disrupt pedestrians. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making the project completely unfeasible. Both attempts to reach the building failed, highlighting the flaws. Winds and other complications prevented success. In conclusion, with so many flaws, the builders were bound to fail in this project.
1016	15849	6	2	1. Builders encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One challenge was devising a method to turn the end of the blimp without it being blown by the wind or endangering the people below. Another hurdle was the laws restricting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Additionally, there was the general danger associated with hydrogen dirigibles. These obstacles were so numerous that they outweighed the practicality of the mooring mast.
1017	15850	6	2	2. One of the challenges the builders had to address was increasing the building's height as it was intended to be the tallest. Moreover, they faced issues with the building and had to continuously make repairs. These difficulties were significant factors in the construction process, and despite the challenges, the efforts were made to ensure the building met its intended standards.
1018	15851	6	2	3. There was a major problem with dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building. The mooring mast is situated at a great height, and downtown New York, where the building is located, is an extremely crowded area. Given that New York is a highly urbanized region, any mishap during docking would have far - reaching consequences. Although the idea of dirigibles docking on the building was good, Al Smith failed to take all the necessary precautions. Since downtown New York is so crowded, a single problem could lead to a large - scale disaster. This was the main obstacle that the builders had to overcome for allowing dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building.
1019	15852	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The primary concern was safety. They pondered how to safely land a dirigible thousands of feet above the ground while it was freely floating in mid - air, especially when directly above the crowded streets of New York. A malfunction or error during docking could result in thousands of lives being lost. Landing dirigibles in an open field is much easier as there is more space, the dirigible can be placed on secure ground, and it can be weighted to prevent movement. However, landing in open fields is also dangerous, as demonstrated by the destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire in New Jersey on @DATE1. If a similar incident were to occur over a crowded New York City street, the number of casualties would be far greater. These real - world obstacles contributed to the decline of the idea of mid - air dirigible landings, as it was not a logical solution.
1020	15853	6	2	5. The builders faced several obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. There were laws restricting airships from flying at low altitudes near buildings. Structural issues within the building made it difficult to support a dirigible. The wind made it challenging to keep the dirigibles stationary. Safety was also a major concern, as some dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. The builders did not want a fire to occur over a densely populated area, similar to the incident that happened to the German dirigible Hindenburg in New Jersey. Due to these safety risks and challenges, dirigibles have never docked at the Empire State Building and are unlikely to do so in the future.
1021	15854	6	2	1. The excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2 details the creation of The Mooring Mast and its purpose of increasing the height of the Empire State Building. In the 1930s, there was interest in using the Mooring Mast as a docking area for dirigibles, which are known as blimps today. After the 85th - floor frame was constructed and the mast's steel and stainless - steel glass window skeleton was in place, public concerns about landing dirigibles emerged. There were @NUM1 primary reasons why the Empire State Building's Mooring Mast was never fully completed. Safety was one significant factor. The excerpt reveals that non - U.S. dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire in @LOCATION1 serves as an example. The second reason was wind currents. The winds were extremely strong, causing dirigibles to move and sway. Given that dirigibles were at least @DATE2 ft long and dangled high above urban areas, it posed a danger to pedestrians below. Thirdly, it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas, and having dirigibles tied to the mooring mast above populated cities risked them falling on people. In conclusion, these multiple factors combined to prevent the full completion of the Mooring Mast for dirigible docking.
1022	15855	6	2	2. According to the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the four - term governor of New York, was resolute in creating the world's tallest building, taller than the @NUM1 - foot Chrysler Building. He also desired the building to be aesthetically unique. This determination led to the concept of the mooring mast, which brought its own set of challenges. The stress from the dirigibles' load and wind pressure needed to be transferred to the building's foundation, requiring the frame to be modified and strengthened. Other issues included the high flammability of dirigibles. If a fire occurred over a densely populated area like downtown New York, it could cause chaos. Additionally, the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, its back would swivel, making the docking neither practical nor safe. In conclusion, these various obstacles made it difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1023	15856	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several hurdles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. The first hurdle was related to the building's structure and the dirigible's docking ability. As stated, “A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the frame” (@NUM1). To make the project viable, the building's frame had to be modified and strengthened. Another problem was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, which is highly flammable. People below a docked dirigible would be at risk if it were destroyed by fire. The most significant problem was the violent air currents. The back of the dirigibles would constantly swivel when docked because of the changing winds. In conclusion, the mooring mast was an unsafe and unworkable idea due to these multiple obstacles.
1024	15857	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. They couldn't simply let a dirigible land on the Empire State Building's steps as it would put excessive pressure on the building. As per paragraph @NUM1, “The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.” Modifying the framework would have cost sixty thousand dollars. Another concern was the potential disaster if a dirigible caught fire on top of the building in downtown New York, which could harm the local population. According to paragraph @NUM2, nature was the greatest obstacle. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, its back would swivel. Dirigibles in open landing fields could be weighted down with lead weights, but this was not safe when they dangled above pedestrians at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these challenges made it very difficult to implement dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1025	15858	6	2	5. One of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was the need to change the building's structure, which involved additional cost and time. Originally, the building was planned to have a flat roof, but to dock blimps, a rocket - shaped mooring mast had to be constructed. Another problem was getting the building and the idea of dirigible docking approved by experts. The @ORGANIZATION1 had to tour the equipment and mooring operations. The safety of dirigible passengers was a major concern and an obstacle for the construction. Two floors were to be designated for passengers, and experts had to build a door strong enough to support people and withstand the blimps' swaying in strong winds. In conclusion, these challenges related to structure, approval, and safety made it a complex task to enable dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1026	15859	6	2	1. During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders had to consider the safety aspects of enabling dirigibles and their passengers to dock there. They needed to account for the winds at the building's summit. The wind currents at the top of the building change drastically, and since they couldn't weigh down the back of the ship, the dirigible would spin around the mooring mast. Additionally, they had to take into account dirigibles from other countries. These dirigibles used hydrogen, which is more flammable than helium - filled ships. Overall, these factors made the task of facilitating dirigible docking at the Empire State Building quite challenging.
1027	15860	6	2	2. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building's builders encountered difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. Initially, the idea seemed great and feasible, but it turned out otherwise. The mooring mast idea for the @CAPS1 State Building was neither practical nor safe. In paragraph fourteen, Marcia explained the lack of safety, stating that the winds on the building's top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The author also mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph fourteen that another reason the idea was neither safe nor practical was that passengers would be dangling high above street - level pedestrians. In conclusion, these factors clearly showed that the dirigible - docking plan was unworkable.
1028	15861	6	2	3. The Empire State Building's builders faced numerous problems when attempting to dock dirigibles on the mast. One significant issue was that the original building couldn't simply install a mooring mast on top because a single - cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. The stress from the dirigibles' load and wind pressure would need to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation. As a result, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Dirigibles were never docked on the mooring mast partly because the winds on the building's top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it impossible for dirigibles to approach the mast without the risk of being impaled by other buildings. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal to dock airships on the Empire State Building. Moreover, dirigibles contain highly flammable hydrogen, and if a Hindenburg - like incident had occurred in New York, it would have been much worse. These reasons contributed to the builders' problems and explain why the mooring mast was never used.
1029	15862	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building were unable to construct a mooring mast for dirigibles on top of the building because it was too high and the building's roof was too flat. Building the mooring mast required significant effort as they had to consider wind pressure and holding cables at the top. They designed the @NUM1 floor with glass to create an observation area and a boarding area for dirigible passengers. However, there were many problems. Helium is flammable, making it extremely dangerous, and any accident could be severe. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature, as the winds on the building's top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. While this might prevent the worst - case accidents, it was still not a safe option. In conclusion, these multiple issues made the construction and use of the mooring mast unfeasible.
1030	15863	6	2	5. Intended uses for buildings often encounter challenges. In the article “The Mooring @CAPS1” by @PERSON1, the obstacles to allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building are explored. The first obstacle, as stated in paragraph @NUM1, was that building a dock on top of the building would require reinforcing the entire structure, at a cost of @MONEY1. Another obstacle was the weather; violent air currents above the building would cause the ship to spin around the mooring. The final obstacle was the law. According to the article, an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. The cost of reinforcing the building, the weather conditions, and the laws were the three main obstacles faced in docking blimps at the Empire State Building. In summary, these challenges made it difficult to achieve the intended use of the building for dirigible docking.
1031	15864	6	2	"1. When constructing the Empire State Building, the workers encountered numerous challenges while building a dockable mooring mast for dirigibles. Two significant issues were the unpredictable winds at that altitude and the fact that foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. A quote states, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This illustrates the high - risk nature of docking dirigibles at such a height, as the strong winds could cause the dirigible to loosen and fly off, endangering pedestrians. Additionally, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This presented another safety hazard. In the event of an accident, the dirigible could catch fire and plunge towards a large number of pedestrians. These were the problems the workers faced when determining the safety and feasibility of dirigibles docking at the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."
1032	15865	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building ran into multiple problems when they aimed to make it possible for dirigibles to dock there. Hydrogen safety was a major worry, as many blimps were filled with this extremely explosive gas. The powerful winds at the top of the tower made docking either extremely difficult or impossible. Moreover, it was illegal. In New York, there was a law that prohibited certain aircraft from flying too low, and for a dirigible to dock on the building, it would enter illegal airspace. In conclusion, the main hurdles the builders faced were hydrogen - related safety concerns, the high winds, and the illegality of their project.
1033	15866	6	2	"3. According to the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Paragraph @NUM1 indicates that ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" As a result, the architect had to redesign the entire building to accommodate these dirigibles. The statement ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"" (∂ @NUM2) points out a significant obstacle, as safety and other issues would prevent the mast from performing its intended duties. Another quote, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (∂ @NUM3), shows that heavy winds, pouring rains, and intense heat could lead to disasters in the urban area. These were the challenges the builders of the Empire State Building encountered when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
1034	15867	6	2	"4. Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. Nature was one of the most significant obstacles. The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. Also, while dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down with lead weights at the back, this was neither practical nor safe at the Empire State Building, where the weights would dangle high above pedestrians on the street. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which also prevented dirigibles from docking there. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome multiple challenges to make dirigible docking possible."
1035	15868	6	2	"5. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock. In my view, the Empire State Building is well - known to many, but few are aware of its intended purpose as a landing spot for dirigibles. Safety was a major concern; for instance, ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This was one of the ways the builders faced obstacles. Transportation was another aspect. I believe transportation enables people to move from one place to another. As an example, ""By the @DATE1's dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future,"" which implies that dirigibles could take passengers to their desired destinations. In conclusion, safety and transportation - related factors describe the obstacles the builders faced and the considerations for allowing dirigibles to dock there."
1036	15869	6	2	"1. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when attempting to enable dirigible docking. One major hurdle was the lack of a suitable landing area, as stated in the excerpt: ""The one obstacle was their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Additionally, the climate, particularly wind pressure, posed a challenge. As mentioned, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Moreover, dirigibles from outside the United States, such as those from Germany that used flammable hydrogen, were a concern. It was noted that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" These were the obstacles the builders faced in their attempt to allow dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
1037	15870	6	2	"2. According to the article ""the Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to permit dirigible docking. @ORGANIZATION2 mentioned in paragraph @NUM1 that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons have been aparent before it was ever constructed."" Safety was one reason. Dirigibles made outside @LOCATION1 contained hydrogen instead of helium, and since hydrogen is highly flammable, this was a significant risk. The winds also presented an issue. They are constantly changing, violent air - currents that could move the dirigible. The most crucial reason, however, was legality. There is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and it was illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach it. In conclusion, the builders had to overcome many challenges in this endeavor."
1038	15871	6	2	3. Just as in life, building a new invention comes with many obstacles, and constructing a docking area for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was no exception. One obstacle was the wind. Since people have no control over the wind and its elements, during windy conditions, the back of the dirigibles would swing back and forth. When the Navy tried to tie up the dirigibles, strong winds prevented them from getting close to the mooring mast. Safety was another obstacle. Dirigibles used gas instead of helium, making them highly flammable and difficult to control. A crashing dirigible could endanger many pedestrians. While it might be possible for the Navy to fix these issues, it would be challenging. In the end, it might be a better idea to abandon the concept of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1039	15872	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles during construction. They needed to build the structure higher than any other building while ensuring its stability. Additionally, the top of the building had to be constructed perfectly to allow dirigibles to land. After much effort, the building reached a state where it was safe enough for dirigibles to land. People could then disembark and tour the top part of the building, marking a successful outcome despite the challenges faced during construction.
1040	15873	6	2	5. When constructing the mast for dirigible docking, the architects failed to notice several impending flaws. Firstly, it was illegal for aircraft to fly at such a low altitude. Most dirigibles were mainly composed of highly flammable hydrogen, and having them fly over a densely populated area was extremely unsafe. Moreover, the strong wind currents at the top of the building could push the dirigible into the side of the building, where it could be punctured by a sharp object. In conclusion, the idea of having dirigibles land on the Empire State Building was fraught with risks and was essentially an accident waiting to happen.
1041	15874	6	2	1. The architects of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges while attempting to construct a docking facility for dirigibles. Safety was a primary concern. A fire on a hydrogen - filled zeppelin over New York City could trigger a large - scale conflagration, causing widespread damage. Additionally, the wind at that height was erratic, making it extremely difficult to dock and keep the dirigible in place. The Navy's attempt to dock a dirigible was unsuccessful as the wind prevented them from approaching the mast. Moreover, laws prohibited airships from flying too low over cities, effectively ending the plan. Although the idea was initially appealing, it was fraught with danger from the start.
1042	15875	6	2	2. According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles when trying to enable dirigible docking. The load of the dirigible and wind pressure needed to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, which was 1100 feet below. However, the most substantial obstacle was the wind, which shifted constantly due to violent air currents. These factors combined to make the attempt to allow dirigible docking a highly challenging and ultimately unfeasible endeavor.
1043	15876	6	2	3. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in allowing dirigible docking. One issue was the lack of a suitable landing area on the roof, necessitating more space for docking. To address this, a steel needle was installed on top of the building for balloon docking and passenger disembarkation. Another problem was that most non - US dirigibles used flammable hydrogen instead of helium, posing a risk of a large - scale explosion in a densely populated area. Additionally, laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas as strong winds could cause the dirigible to veer off course and collide with other buildings. These obstacles made the attempt to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building extremely difficult.
1044	15877	6	2	4. The implementation of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was thwarted by several obstacles. Safety was a major concern; since most non - US dirigibles used flammable hydrogen, a fire in a densely populated city like New York could cause extensive harm. Nature also presented challenges, as the winds on the building's top shifted constantly due to violent air currents. This made the dirigible swivel around the mooring mast, which was neither practical nor safe. Controlling the dirigible once tied to the mast was difficult because of its violent motion. Existing laws against airships flying too low over urban areas also made it illegal for dirigibles to approach or tie to the mooring mast. Facing these obstacles, the builders eventually abandoned the idea of using the mooring mast for ships.
1045	15878	6	2	5. Based on the excerpt, the efforts of the Empire State Building's builders were in vain. They spent additional funds on restructuring, but it was unnecessary. Even if they had managed to find a way to dock dirigibles, it was already illegal for aircraft to fly so close to cities. In the end, their attempts were fruitless, and the money and resources spent on this endeavor were wasted.
1046	15879	6	2	1. Although the proposal to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was seriously contemplated, safety concerns and practical realities rendered it an unfeasible endeavor. For the mooring mast to effectively secure a dirigible, over @MONEY1 in modifications to the building's framework were necessary. Nevertheless, multiple factors, with safety being the most significant, posed insurmountable challenges. Most dirigibles from outside @LOCATION2 utilized hydrogen gas instead of helium; hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building recognized the severity of a potential dirigible fire, especially considering the densely - populated nature of New York City. Wind was also a crucial factor that undermined the idea. If a dirigible were tied to the mast, the rear of the vessel would swing around, and using lead weights was not a viable option. Having blocks of lead suspended above pedestrians in New York streets was neither practical nor safe. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying low or too close to urban areas. Even if docking were attempted, strong winds would make it extremely difficult for ships to dock. All these challenges were encountered during the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the building, and this concept is no longer under consideration.
1047	15880	6	2	2. When the builders of the Empire State Building aimed to permit dirigibles to dock there, they encountered several obstacles, including safety, weather, and policies. Safety during docking was one of the most prominent issues. Dirigibles operate on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. A mishap during refueling could potentially cause severe harm to the densely - populated area beneath the dirigible. Weather at high altitudes was another significant hurdle. At 1,250 feet above the ground, wind directions constantly change due to “violent air currents.” The strong winds made it difficult for dirigibles to get close enough to the building for tying up. The final obvious obstacle was a law stating that airships could not fly low over urban areas. This law made using the mooring dock illegal and alerted blimp captains that docking in such a low - altitude, building - dense area was both challenging and dangerous. In conclusion, these combined obstacles prevented dirigibles from successfully docking at the Empire State Building.
1048	15881	6	2	3. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, we learn about the numerous obstacles preventing dirigibles from landing on top of the Empire State Building. One obstacle, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, is that “Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.” The use of hydrogen would pose a significant hazard to New York City during a dirigible landing, given the high population density in the area. Another obstacle, described in paragraph @NUM2, is that “the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,” specifically due to the wind. L¸sted details the perilous air currents at the top of the Empire State Building. Overall, these many obstacles made it impossible to allow dirigibles to dock, which is why the attempt was ultimately unsuccessful.
1049	15882	6	2	4. The Empire State Building was intended to be a remarkable feat, designed to be the tallest building in the world. While it achieved its height goal, its intended purpose of serving as a docking station for dirigibles was never realized. Even before construction, it was clear that there were significant obstacles. One of the most substantial hurdles was nature. The winds at the top of the building were too strong to safely secure a dirigible. The back of the ship would rotate around the mooring mast, and using bricks to weigh it down was impractical. Another issue was the law that made it illegal for a ship to tie up at the building or approach the area. Despite these challenges, two ships attempted to land. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles failed because the landing was too dangerous. In the end, the Empire State Building never functioned as a station for dirigibles.
1050	15883	6	2	5. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. One such obstacle was the additional stress on the building's frame. As stated in paragraph nine, “A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame.” This stress could potentially lead to the collapse of the entire building structure, resulting in loss of life and extensive destruction. Another obstacle was nature. Paragraph fourteen mentions that “The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.” These violent air currents could cause dirigibles to lose control and collide with the Empire State Building or other nearby structures. The added stress on the building and the forces of nature were the two primary obstacles that the builders had to confront.
1051	15884	6	2	"1. The constructors of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to land there. One such challenge was the necessity of making ""changes to existing plans for the building's steel frame"". Additionally, natural factors posed a significant hurdle; the wind conditions precluded blimps from landing. However, the most critical concern was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". In conclusion, these combined obstacles made it extremely difficult to achieve the goal of having dirigibles land at the Empire State Building."
1052	15885	6	2	"2. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple hurdles in their attempt to permit dirigibles to dock. As stated in paragraph 6, ""one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"", which meant the architects had to precisely and carefully construct sufficient landing space for the dirigibles. Paragraph @NUM1 indicated that ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"", as the effects of nature can be predicted but not controlled. The ""violent air currents"" could disrupt the landing of dirigibles, and it was ""neither practical nor safe"" for dirigibles to hang above street - level pedestrians. Unfortunately, Al Smith's plan for dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building was unsuccessful. A law in paragraph @NUM2 made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Consequently, dirigibles were replaced by airplanes instead of using the mooring mast."
1053	15886	6	2	"3. The builders of dirigibles faced numerous obstacles in enabling them to dock. It was illegal for ""airships to fly too low"" over urban areas and ""to tie up to the building"". The purpose of dirigibles was to dock at the mast, but if they couldn't reach the mast for docking, the mast and dirigibles lost their intended function. To dock, dirigibles would need to be weighted down with lead weights, but having these weights dangle above pedestrians was ""neither practical nor safe"". If a dirigible docked at the building's top, it would be held by a single cable, and the pressure on the cable would stress the building's frame, necessitating strengthening and modification of the building's foundation. Overall, the major issue was that the builders did not thoroughly think through their dirigible - docking plan. Had they done so, these obstacles could have been avoided."
1054	15887	6	2	"4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium for buoyancy. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, as demonstrated on @DATE1 when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed in a hydrogen - caused fire in New Jersey. Once the owners of the Empire State Building recognized the severity of this risk, they were deterred. Nature was the most significant obstacle. Given the building's height, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent wind currents"". Also, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigible ships to tie up to the building or approach the area. In conclusion, these various factors combined to make it very difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
1055	15888	6	2	"5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. Some of the issues involved designing the mast and ensuring it was safe for dirigible docking. As per the excerpt, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"", meaning the building's construction plan had to be changed to support dirigibles. After creating a new building layout, safety became a major concern. Paragraph @NUM1 stated that ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable"". Another significant safety issue was ""nature itself"". ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", which required tying down the dirigible, but this was dangerous as it would dangle over street - level pedestrians. In conclusion, the design and safety aspects of the building were substantial obstacles for the builders in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock."
1056	15889	6	2	1. They had to be concerned about the safety of the people and maintain stability while docking. They needed to figure out how to handle the situation and consider the possible outcomes if something went wrong. In the end, they managed to navigate through these concerns and ensure a relatively safe docking process.
1057	15890	6	2	2. During the construction of the Empire State Building, when the builders were working on the mooring mast for dirigibles, they encountered obstacles that could have derailed the project. Two main aspects demanded their extra attention: structural integrity and design. Since the architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the building's flat roof, the builders had to modify the building's frame, which cost over @MONEY1. Regarding the design, architect John Tauranac aimed for the mast to be more than just ornamental and not as ordinary as a water - tank. To meet these aspirations, the builders constructed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless - steel tower illuminated from the inside, which involved a great deal of extra work. Despite these challenges, the builders successfully completed the task.
1058	15891	6	2	3. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast,” the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One issue was that the architects couldn't install a mooring mast on the building's top because a dirigible held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. This stress, caused by the dirigible's load and wind pressure, would be transmitted to the building's foundation. As a result, the building's frame was modified at a cost of “Over sixty thousand dollars.” Another obstacle was designing the mooring mast so that passengers could be brought down to the eighty - sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas were located. This required the completion of the roof. Lastly, “The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the moor mast was nature itself.” When winds blew at the building's top, the dirigible would swivel around the mast, posing a safety hazard to street pedestrians. The excerpt clearly shows the various obstacles the builders had to overcome for dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1059	15892	6	2	4. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @PERSON1, the author details the many obstacles builders faced in enabling dirigibles to dock. The first issue was the modifications to the building's framework. “Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made,” indicating the high cost of the project. A second potential problem was the constantly shifting winds on top of the building. This could lead to multiple complications. For example, the wind might blow the dirigible onto sharp spires, a concern of the pilot of Los Angeles. Also, the shifting winds could cause the ship to spin, potentially resulting in a catastrophe. The attempts to accommodate the use of the mooring mast with impractical solutions ultimately led to its downfall.
1060	15893	6	2	5. In the excerpt, the builders and architects of the Empire State Building encountered numerous problems when constructing the mast on the building's top. One key reason was that they started the construction without considering the potential issues. The most significant problem was safety, as “the hydrogen used in the dirigibles was highly flammable.” Another problem was the wind; “they would never be able to use the mooring mast because of the violent winds shifting at that height.” If a dirigible were tied to the building, “its back end would swivel around and around the mooring mast.” Dirigibles moored in fields could be held down with lead weights, but using them @NUM1 feet above downtown New York was extremely unsafe. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying that low over cities and pedestrians. Given these problems, it was clear that the plan to use the mooring mast would not succeed.
1061	15894	6	2	"1. The Empire State Building's builders encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock. One issue was the stress the cable tether would impose on the building's foundation. As L¸sted noted in paragraph @NUM1, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" Fixing this was extremely costly. Another problem was safety. Non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. In paragraph @NUM2, L¸sted stated that the Empire State Building's owners recognized how much more catastrophic an accident could be in a densely populated area like downtown New York. The most significant obstacle was nature. The violent, constantly shifting winds on the building's top meant that even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around it, as L¸sted reasoned in paragraph @NUM3. This was neither practical nor safe. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building quietly faded away."
1062	15895	6	2	"2. ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 details the many obstacles the Empire State Building's builders faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock. The building's mooring mast was ultimately unable to serve its intended purpose. For instance, most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, while the United States mainly used non - flammable helium. Fortunately, the Empire State Building's owners were aware that using hydrogen dirigibles could lead to a terrible accident in a densely populated area. Another obstacle was nature. The building's top was subject to constantly shifting winds because of violent air currents, which posed a safety risk to pedestrians below. These were the challenges that prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building."
1063	15896	6	2	"3. Marcia @CAPS1's ""The Mooring Mast"" outlines the hurdles the Empire State Building's builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Initially, no one involved realized that the building was not sturdy enough to support a thousand - foot dirigible. The pressure from the dirigible and the wind would be ""transmitted to the building's foundation,"" and reinforcing the steel frame would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Pedestrian safety was also a major concern. Most foreign dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen fuel instead of helium. Those involved in the project understood that a hydrogen - related fire could endanger the lives of downtown New York residents, as the dirigible would be 1,250 feet above crowded areas. Additionally, there was a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Despite the building not fulfilling its intended docking purpose, it remains an international landmark in the heart of New York."
1064	15897	6	2	"4. When the builders of the Empire State Building tried to allow dirigibles to dock, they faced obstacles that ultimately halted the entire plan. As stated in @NUM1 line @NUM2, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These changing winds made it impossible to safely moor a lighter - than - air dirigible on the high - rise building. The wind also created another problem. If the captain released the controls, the dirigible might impale itself on another spire, meaning that other tall buildings were also an obstacle. The law of the time was an additional hurdle. As mentioned in @NUM3 line 1, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" made it illegal for airships to moor at the top of the building, despite its height. Although the attempt to build a mooring dock on the Empire State Building could have propelled New York into a new era of innovation, the obstacles were too great to overcome."
1065	15898	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One of the main issues was the mast installation. Architects couldn't simply place the mooring mast on top of the building with just a single cable tether, as this would add stress to the building's frame. Strengthening the steel frame to handle the dirigible's load would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Nature also posed a significant obstacle. The winds on top of the building were always changing, which could cause the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast. Due to these difficulties, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was not feasible.
1066	15899	6	2	1. The dirigibles encountered significant obstacles when attempting to land and dock on the Empire State Building. Initially, the concept was astonishing, but during the mast - building process, it became clear that it was unfeasible. Firstly, there was a law restricting airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to approach the building. Secondly, the winds atop the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents, posing a great danger to passengers boarding and disembarking. Finally, foreign dirigibles used flammable hydrogen, and having it over a densely - populated area could cause catastrophic damage. These factors presented insurmountable obstacles for the Empire State Building's docking plans.
1067	15900	6	2	2. When the builders of the Empire State Building tried to make the mooring mast accessible to dirigibles, they encountered three major challenges. Most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, and a fire in New York's streets would be a disaster. Additionally, there were strong and ever - changing wind currents above the building. These winds would cause the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast. Moreover, a law prohibited dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for them to tether to or approach the building. Due to these three factors, the mooring mast was neither practical nor safe.
1068	15901	6	2	3. The builders faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One concern was the safety of passengers during docking and ensuring that the building's framework would not collapse. The excerpt between paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2 states that engineers in New York were trying to devise a practical arrangement, and government officials in Washington were looking for a safe way to moor airships to the mast. The heavy mast worried them as it could put excessive pressure on the building. Engineers were also afraid of dirigibles exploding because they used hydrogen, which is much more flammable than helium. As mentioned between paragraphs @NUM3 and @NUM4, most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen. These were just a few of the many challenges the workers had to deal with.
1069	15902	6	2	4. The architects and workers faced several obstacles while constructing a docking area for dirigibles on the Empire State Building. They needed to figure out how to prevent the large mast from damaging the building's frame. Simply placing a mooring mast on the flat roof was not an option, as a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable would add stress to the building's structure. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transferred to the building's foundation nearly eleven hundred feet below. To address this, the architects and workers had to modify the steel frame. After the construction, they realized that the plan was either impossible or not allowed. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. The destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire in 1937 made the building owners aware of the potential disaster if such an accident occurred over a densely - populated area like downtown New York. After going through so many difficulties, the architects and workers found that the plan was dangerous and against the law regarding airships flying close to urban areas.
1070	15903	6	2	5. The builders faced many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Dirigibles are steel - framed balloons with envelopes or cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. They can be maneuvered using propellers and rudders, and passengers can ride in the gondola beneath the balloon. A dirigible moored at the top of the building by a single cable would add stress to the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transferred to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. Over @MONEY1 in modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building. These challenges ultimately made the docking plan unworkable.
1071	15904	6	2	1. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. They needed to allow dirigibles to anchor for several hours for refueling, servicing, and for passengers to embark or disembark. The dirigibles were docked using an electric winch, which pulled in a line from the front of the ship and tied it to a mast. Despite the dirigibles' bodies swinging in the breeze, passengers could safely board or leave by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. All these challenges had to be overcome to build the Empire State Building.
1072	15905	6	2	2. Al Smith, the former governor of New York, spearheaded the construction of the Empire State Building. The aim was to build it taller than the Chrysler Building, which stood at @NUM1 feet. To achieve this height, Al Smith proposed adding a mooring mast on top for docking dirigibles. However, this idea was fraught with difficulties. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would need modification and strengthening, which would incur high construction costs. Moreover, most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Additionally, the winds on the building's top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. After the mast was built, the builders discovered numerous issues. They should have anticipated these problems before construction, as the mast was costly. Although the mast became obsolete, the Empire State Building still stood at @NUM2 feet, remaining the tallest building at the time.
1073	15906	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building failed to reach their goal as they did not foresee the potential problems. Landing a dirigible on the mooring mast was deemed dangerous. As stated, “Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable” (paragraph @NUM1). The memory of the incident in New Jersey made them realize the severe complications of such a situation. Nature also posed a significant obstacle; “The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents” (paragraph @NUM2). These winds caused the back of the dirigible to swing around the mooring mast, endangering the streets below. Furthermore, a pre - existing law restricted how low airships could fly over urban areas, preventing dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, multiple factors led to the failure of the dirigible - docking project.
1074	15907	6	2	4. The architects only recognized the numerous potential problems the mooring mast would cause after it had failed. The primary reason dirigibles couldn't land was safety concerns. Many dirigibles of that era used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Nature also played a major role; the strong winds on top of the building could easily push a dirigible off - course. Additionally, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Due to these safety and legal issues, dirigibles were unable to dock at the Empire State Building.
1075	15908	6	2	5. In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. They had to ensure that dirigibles could reach the required height and that passengers could board and disembark safely. As the text states, “The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of @ORGANIZATION1 roof.” The building's height made it difficult to make the dirigible - docking system work. The dirigible added stress to the building's frame, and unloading was challenging as the required floor was too low. “The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.” The project was so arduous that the builders had to abandon the task and plan for expansion at a later time, leaving the workers devastated.
1076	15909	6	2	1. The construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges. One significant issue was the additional stress a thousand - foot - long dirigible would impose on the building's frame. To address this, over @MONEY1 was spent on modifying the building's framework. Another problem stemmed from a law, stated in paragraph @NUM1, that prohibited airships from flying too low in urban areas. Additionally, nature posed the greatest obstacle. At a height of 1,250 feet, the wind was extremely violent. It would cause a dirigible to swing uncontrollably, endangering the safety of the operation. Weighing down the ends of the dirigible was not an option as it could harm pedestrians. These three factors were the main reasons for the failure of the mooring mast.
1077	15910	6	2	2. When attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders encountered multiple problems. Firstly, most non - U.S. dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and having a hydrogen - filled dirigible over a city full of pedestrians was a significant risk as it could catch fire and cause harm. Secondly, the constantly shifting winds at the height of the Empire State Building posed a great risk to pilots. If a dirigible was blown off course, it could collide with other tall buildings in the city. For example, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles was blown off course by strong winds, and the pilot had to keep his hands on the controls to avoid hitting other structures. Lastly, a pre - existing law made it illegal for a dirigible to enter the airspace around the Empire State Building. Due to these problems, the plan to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building faced insurmountable challenges.
1078	15911	6	2	3. It seemed like a very difficult test for them as they were trying to create an age of transportation with the mindset of the pioneers. After the architects designed the mooring mast and made changes to the building's skeleton, they framed the 85th floor. However, the roof had to be completed before the framing process could proceed. This sequence of construction steps added to the complexity of the project, but they persevered through these challenges in their attempt to achieve their transportation - related vision.
1079	15912	6	2	4. In 1929, when Al Smith announced the plan to build a docking port for blimps at the top of the Empire State Building, architects faced numerous obstacles in their building design. Constructing a blimp dock at the top of the world's tallest building was an arduous task. They perhaps should have recognized from the start that this project was likely to fail, but they still went ahead with it. The architects had to come up with a plan to strengthen the main support beams of the building while also controlling the movements of the back of the dirigibles in the face of uncontrollable wind conditions. Unfortunately, they were unable to find a successful solution, and as a result, the Empire State Building was never able to dock blimps.
1080	15913	6	2	5. In the 1930s, this was a difficult obstacle to overcome, and many people doubted the entire idea. One of the initial challenges was the comparison in height with the Chrysler Building. The mooring mast seemed feasible in theory, but in reality, it had too many problems. It was a potentially dangerous attempt, and considering the difficulties and risks involved, it was clear that the plan faced significant hurdles that were hard to surmount.
1081	15914	6	2	When the Empire State Building was under construction, efforts to establish a docking facility for dirigibles encountered numerous challenges. One significant issue was that most overseas blimps were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. The constructors were averse to repeating the Hindenburg accident in a densely - populated area like New York City. Moreover, nature presented the greatest hurdle to the mooring mast. The wind currents atop the building were both violent and constantly shifting. Docking a dirigible under such conditions would cause it to rotate around the building, endangering the passengers. As a result, the mooring mast failed to serve its intended purpose.
1082	15915	6	2	The construction of the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was a poorly - conceived idea, which led to a multitude of obstacles. Right from the start, Al Smith showed a lack of concern for public safety. Many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. Given that a hydrogen - related accident in New Jersey was bad enough, the consequences in a densely populated city like New York would be unthinkable. One could not even fathom walking on the street and having a lead weight dropped on their head. In New York, the strong air currents made dirigibles sway when tied up. The plan to use lead weights to hold them in place was neither practical nor safe. Additionally, the law was overlooked. It was illegal for an airship to fly low over urban areas or tie up to buildings. In conclusion, all aspects should have been thoroughly considered before promoting an unsafe and illegal project.
1083	15916	6	2	"After reading ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it becomes evident that landing a dirigible on a 1,250 - foot building is fraught with complications. Firstly, wind is a natural challenge. The winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These winds would make it difficult to land any floating aircraft without proper weighting at the back. Secondly, the building's frame needed to be strong enough to support a @NUM1 - foot - long dirigible. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transferred to the building's foundation. Workers then had to spend over @MONEY1 to remodel the Empire State Building's framework. Thirdly, anchoring the blimps was illegal according to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Collectively, these safety issues and legal violations make the ""mooring"" an unachievable task."
1084	15917	6	2	The architects and builders of the docking platform initially failed to notice the significant problems they would face. It was not until the dirigible Hindenburg crashed in Lakehurst that they became aware of the issues. After the crash, the building's owners grew deeply concerned about the safety of the people inside and below the building. They realized that if a blimp were to encounter a similar situation as the Hindenburg, it could have disastrous consequences. In light of this, they understood the need to re - evaluate the safety and feasibility of the docking platform.
1085	15918	6	2	When Al Smith first proposed using the Empire State Building as a mooring mast for dirigibles, he underestimated the numerous obstacles that would arise. Safety was a major concern. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. If the hydrogen inside a dirigible caught fire, the entire craft would explode, endangering those on board and people on the streets below. High winds at the building's peak were another problem. The constantly shifting winds due to violent air currents would cause the dirigible to move erratically. The suggestion of using lead weights to stabilize it was put forward, but these weights would pose a threat to pedestrians. A third obstacle was the stress a dirigible would place on the building's frame. The original design could not handle the stress of a tied - up dirigible; without modifications, the dirigible might tear the building apart. To address this, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Clearly, the project was extremely challenging due to these multiple obstacles.
1086	15919	6	2	1. The construction of the Empire State Building with a mooring mast for dirigibles presented numerous formidable challenges. Firstly, the presence of a crowded airspace was a significant concern. In such congested conditions, there was a high risk that a dirigible could collide with other buildings or, in the worst - case scenario, even rupture. Additionally, the wind could cause the dirigible to sway, further increasing the likelihood of an accident. Another major issue was the stress placed on the building when a dirigible was tied to it. Strong winds would lead to excessive tension on the structure, potentially resulting in unforeseen problems. Despite these difficulties, the builders managed to construct the Empire State Building.
1087	15920	6	2	2. When the builders of the Empire State Building aimed to enable dirigibles to dock, they encountered a multitude of obstacles. One of the primary issues was the stress that mooring heavy blimps would impose on the building. As noted, “the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation.” Another significant problem was the flammable nature of the hydrogen gas used in dirigibles. Given the severity of the Hindenburg explosion, the situation could have been far more catastrophic if it had occurred over a densely populated area like downtown New York. Flying blimps at low altitudes over urban areas was also extremely dangerous. Moreover, the strong and constantly shifting winds, caused by violent air currents, made mooring a difficult task. Due to these numerous challenges, the workers faced great difficulties in building the mast, and ultimately, it couldn't be completed.
1088	15921	6	2	3. According to the excerpt “The Mooring Mast,” the builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was the legal restriction against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. Forceful winds also posed a problem. For instance, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles couldn't get close enough to the mooring mast to tie up because of the strong winds. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Additionally, having a dirigible dangling high above pedestrians was not safe. These challenges made it difficult for the builders to achieve their goal of enabling dirigible docking.
1089	15922	6	2	4. In “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Architects couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's foundation, nearly 1100 feet below. Thus, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would need modification and strengthening. Safety was another major concern. Most dirigibles from outside the @CAPS1 used @CAPS2 drogen, which is highly flammable. Nature also presented the biggest obstacle. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Using lead weights to stabilize dirigibles, as done in open landing fields, was neither practical nor safe when they would be hanging above pedestrians on the street. These were the obstacles the Empire State Building project had to overcome.
1090	15923	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many hurdles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. A lack of a suitable landing area was one problem. They couldn't just place a mooring mast on the building's flat roof because a thousand - foot dirigible held by a single cable tether at the top would add stress to the building's frame. This stress would need to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, nearly 1100 feet below. Nature was the greatest obstacle. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. While dirigibles in open landing fields could be weighted down with lead weights, having these weights dangling above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. Despite all these obstacles, the builders were still able to construct the Empire State Building with a mooring mast.
1091	15924	6	2	1. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION1, the construction of the Empire State Building was fraught with challenges. In the @DATE2's, the Empire State Building was planned to be the world's tallest building. However, the architect of the Chrysler Building designed it to be 46 ft taller. Al Smith, the Governor of New York, was determined not to lose the title of the tallest building. In paragraph 6, Smith's solution was presented: a mooring mast was added to the top of the Empire State Building, which was intended to allow dirigibles to anchor for refueling, servicing, and passenger embarkation and disembarkation. Nevertheless, safety concerns prevented the mooring mast from fulfilling its purpose. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, most dirigibles outside @PERSON2 used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, and the pointy architecture of the building made this extremely dangerous. Additionally, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM2, nature posed the greatest obstacle. Violent air - currents on top of the building caused constantly shifting winds, and there were laws restricting low - altitude flight. By the late 1930's, the mooring mast plan was abandoned.
1092	15925	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, mooring a large dirigible to the top of the building with a single cable tether would subject the building's frame, all the way to its foundation, to significant stress. To address this, the frame of the Empire State Building would need reinforcement. Secondly, there were safety concerns for the citizens on the streets below. Dirigibles using hydrogen could catch fire, and strong winds made it difficult for dirigibles to tether to the mooring mast. Moreover, the dirigible could not be weighted down as the weights would dangle over pedestrians. The impact of these winds was evident when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to dock. During the attempt, the strong winds made the captain fear that the dirigible could be punctured by the sharp spires of other buildings. In conclusion, these are the various difficulties that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome.
1093	15926	6	2	3. The builders faced several obstacles. One was the excessive stress on the building's frame. The weight and pressure from a dirigible held by a single cable, known as a tether, would need to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Another obstacle was an existing law that prohibited mooring a ship due to low - altitude flight. In December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible attempted to park at the location but was deterred by the fear of the wind blowing it into another building. Despite these arduous challenges, the builders ultimately found solutions and made the docking of dirigibles possible.
1094	15927	6	2	4. In the @DATE1's, dirigibles, which are now commonly called blimps, were widely regarded as the most advanced form of transportation. These dirigibles required efficient and safe methods for refueling and unloading passengers. At the same time, modern - day skyscrapers like the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building dominated the New York City skyline. Al Smith, the former governor of New York who was leading the construction of the Empire State Building, proposed building a mooring mast on top of the building. This mast was intended to enable dirigibles to dock, refuel, and unload cargo quickly and efficiently. Initially, this idea was considered both “practical” and “workable”. However, architects later identified safety concerns that prevented its implementation. These concerns included the “constantly shifting” winds caused by “violent air currents” and air - space restricting laws that prohibited “airships from flying too low over urban areas”. Although the idea seemed revolutionary at the time, numerous obstacles hindered its success.
1095	15928	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced extreme challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was ensuring that the building could withstand the stress of dirigibles tied to it. With the wind pulling and the dirigible swaying as the wind direction changed, the building needed to be structurally sound. Another issue was the low altitude at which dirigibles would need to fly, which was restricted due to the presence of other buildings. Most importantly, the flammable gases inside the dirigible posed a significant threat. A fire or explosion could be devastating to the people in New York City below. In conclusion, these challenges were substantial and required careful consideration and solutions.
1096	15929	6	2	1. The Hindenburg dirigible was destroyed by fire at @LOCATION1 on @DATE1. The owners of the Empire State Building recognized how much more disastrous the accident could have been if it had occurred above a densely - populated area like downtown New York. Dirigibles had a top speed of 80 miles per hour and could cruise at 70 miles per hour for thousands of miles without refueling. Some were as long as four blocks in New York City. However, the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City was the main obstacle to their wider use.
1097	15930	6	2	"2. In the @DATE1s, Al Smith aimed to construct the world's largest dirigible dock in New York. Nevertheless, during the construction of the Empire State Building's mooring system, numerous problems arose. One issue was the harsh winds high above New York. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These winds made the tail end of the dirigibles move while docked, leading to unsafe landings and take - offs. Another obstacle was a law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas, a measure taken due to the 1937 Hindenburg crash. Building officials feared that a similar crash in New York would cause catastrophic damage. The final problem was that many overseas blimps used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and a crash over New York would have devastated the city and caused a large number of casualties. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles prevented the effective use of the Empire State Building's mooring system for dirigibles."
1098	15931	6	2	"3. According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Constructed in the 1930s, the Empire State Building was initially built to surpass the height of the Chrysler Building, standing at 1,250 feet tall. Its mooring mast on top added to its height. Dirigibles, similar to balloons, were becoming popular in the aviation world. However, several issues hindered the project's progress, most of which were safety - related. An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas was one practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building. Another reason was the flammability of the ships, as most used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and an explosion would endanger many civilians and passengers. In conclusion, due to these safety risks, the mast of the Empire State Building was never used for its original purpose."
1099	15932	6	2	"4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges. As mentioned, ""the lack of suitable landing area"" (@CAPS1 6), which made it difficult to land dirigibles. Nature also posed a problem. Wind and weather conditions could make dirigible landings extremely dangerous. ""Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which called in a line from the front of the ship, and tied it to the mast"" (@CAPS1 6). If the wind blew in the wrong direction or counteracted the electric winch, landing the dirigible would be both difficult and perilous. Additionally, there were financial obstacles. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This significant expense was clearly an obstacle that the builders had to overcome. In summary, these various challenges made it difficult for the Empire State Building to serve as a dirigible docking site."
1100	15933	6	2	5. The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 believed they had a great and pioneering idea. However, they soon discovered problems with it. Safety was a major concern. As noted in paragraph @NUM1, most @LOCATION3 dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. New York, being one of the most densely populated cities in the United States, was too risky for such a venture. Wind was another issue. At high altitudes, wind currents were unpredictable, and winds reached high speeds. If a dirigible were blown around in the downtown area and hit a building spire, there would likely be many casualties. After weighing the risks and rewards, they concluded that the idea was not worth pursuing.
1101	15934	6	2	1. The architects of the Empire State Building encountered severe obstacles. They needed to devise a way to enable dirigibles to land on the mooring mast. Additionally, the government was growing impatient. Complicating matters further, Al Smith was untrustworthy and deceitful. He misrepresented the actual height and claimed he would resolve the mooring - mast issues, but did not. There were also concerns about a dirigible exploding on the mooring mast, similar to the @CAPS1 incident. As a result, they abandoned the idea and gradually created the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for sightseers.
1102	15935	6	2	2. One challenge the builders faced was ensuring the mast was large enough. Some dirigibles could be @NUM1 feet long. If they simply placed a mast on top of the Empire State Building, the stress from a thousand - foot dirigible tethered by a single cable would exert a significant load on the building's frame. The combined weight of the dirigible and the wind would transfer all that stress and pressure to the foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below, which was extremely unsafe. The builders had to explore various possibilities and ensure safety. When designing the mast, they had to account for the constantly shifting winds at the building's top, caused by violent air currents. Even if they designed a good mast, having a dirigible dangling above pedestrians was not a safe option.
1103	15936	6	2	"3. When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast, they faced three major obstacles. Firstly, ""nature itself"" was a hurdle. The air currents at the top of the building were so powerful that the wind direction was constantly changing. If a dirigible managed to fly through the winds and be tied to the mast, it would ""swivel around and around"" and end up ""dangling over pedestrians"", which was neither practical nor safe. Secondly, according to existing laws, a dirigible is not legally allowed to dock at the mooring mast as it would be ""flying too low over urban areas"". This legal restriction meant that no matter how hard the builders tried, they could not legally allow dirigibles to dock. Lastly, many dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen gas as fuel. A dirigible using hydrogen gas in a densely populated area like downtown New York could potentially cause a disaster. Due to potential fires, city laws, and air currents, the builders encountered significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast."
1104	15937	6	2	"4. According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION3, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. Safety was a major concern. As Marcia Amidon L¸sted noted, most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, which was a huge risk given New York City's dense population. Nature also posed a challenge. The winds on top of the building shifted constantly due to violent air currents, causing a tethered dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or approach the area. Moreover, the advancement of airplanes made it difficult for dirigibles to be the primary form of aeronautical transportation. Despite the builders' efforts to make the Empire State Building a national @CAPS1, they overlooked many potential problems with the mooring mast, preventing it from reaching its full potential."
1105	15938	6	2	"5. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon l¸sted, the challenges dirigibles faced when trying to dock at the Empire State Building were explained. The @CAPS1 had to consider factors such as the composition of dirigibles, the building's structure, and weather conditions when planning a landing area. A mooring mast on the building's top could never be functional. Dirigibles rely on gases like helium and hydrogen to be lighter than air. However, hydrogen is highly flammable, and in a densely populated area, a fire on a blimp could be a major disaster. The building's structure also presented problems. Docking a dirigible added extra stress, forcing the @CAPS1 to design a strong framework, which required time and over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications. Weather conditions were another issue. The winds on the building's top were unpredictable, shifting due to ""violent air currents"". No matter how the dirigible was tied to the mast, it would be unsafe. Due to these factors related to the blimp, the building's structure, and the weather, the @CAPS1 were unable to create a docking area for dirigibles on the Empire State Building."
1106	15939	6	2	1. The construction of docks on the Empire State Building for dirigibles to land faced numerous problems. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, dirigibles did not become the future of transportation and eventually disappeared. Consequently, the Empire State Building never fulfilled its intended purpose for dirigibles.
1107	15940	6	2	2. Al Smith's initial idea to build a mast for dirigible docking began as a friendly competition. However, unforeseen obstacles emerged during the plan's execution. One such obstacle was safety. Dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, and an accident in a densely - populated area like New York City would have been catastrophic. Wind was another issue; the constantly shifting wind currents at the building's top made dirigibles swing, endangering passengers. Additionally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying below a certain height in cities. Due to these many obstacles, the mast never served its intended purpose.
1108	15941	6	2	3. According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. The steel frame of the building needed modification and strengthening to support the mooring mast. Instead of a plain, utilitarian mast, the architect designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless - steel tower. It was illuminated from within and had a stepped - back design that mimicked the building's overall shape.
1109	15942	6	2	"4. Based on ""@CAPS1 The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Al Smith, who oversaw the building's construction, was determined to exceed the height of other structures. He secretly built a 185 - foot spire inside the building and then hoisted it to the top of the Chrysler building, shocking the media and public. Another challenge was the concept of dirigibles docking at the building's top. Dirigibles would be held by a single cable tether, which would put excessive stress on the building's frame. Safety was the most significant obstacle. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, and an accident could destroy New York. These factors explain the many obstacles faced by the builders in the context of ""@CAPS1 The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1."
1110	15943	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several challenges while constructing the landing dock for dirigibles. Firstly, the building's frame was not strong enough to support docked dirigibles, so they had to reinforce it to bear the strain. Secondly, there was a lack of a suitable landing area. They installed a winch - anchor on the building's top to secure dirigibles, but the strong winds at the top prevented pilots from getting close enough to the anchor, as they feared the dirigible might hit a nearby building. Moreover, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas also hindered docking. Despite a few attempts, no dirigible has successfully docked on top of the Empire State Building to this day.
1111	15944	6	2	"1. The Empire State Building, renowned for its large size and distinctive shape in New York City's skyline, has a tower on top that is actually a mooring mast for dirigibles. However, this fact is relatively unknown because the mast could never be used to dock blimps due to safety, natural, and legal reasons. If international dirigibles could stop at the mast after long trans - Atlantic flights, it would have revolutionized travel in New York. But the gas used by foreign blimps posed a significant safety issue. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The accident involving the German Hindenburg demonstrated the potential danger, and a fire on a blimp over densely populated areas would be a major safety concern. Nature also presented safety challenges. At the mast's great height, there are strong and unpredictable winds. As described in paragraph @NUM2, even if dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around it. There was no practical way to anchor the back of the blimp, as heavy weights used in open - field landings would be a serious threat when hanging off a blimp more than @NUM3 feet above pedestrians. Finally, it was illegal for dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. The law prohibited ""airships flying too low over urban areas"" (∂ @NUM4). This legal obstacle, along with the safety and natural challenges, meant the Empire State Building never became a docking post for blimps, yet it remains an incredible architectural feat."
1112	15945	6	2	"2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars to modify the building's framework. Docking a dirigible on the building would exert a great deal of stress on its framework and foundation. Secondly, most dirigibles outside the U.S. used highly flammable hydrogen. Given that the area around the building is densely populated, an accident involving a hydrogen - filled dirigible would be extremely dangerous. Nature was the most significant obstacle. As stated in line @NUM1, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the dirigible to sway uncontrollably, endangering both pedestrians below and passengers on the dirigible. Lastly, there was a law against airships flying too low in urban areas. All these obstacles combined made it impossible to dock a dirigible at the Empire State Building."
1113	15946	6	2	"3. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the building. The primary concern was the safety of passengers boarding and disembarking, as well as the people below. Many dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and since hydrogen is highly flammable, there was a risk of the dirigible exploding. Another major concern was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas (par @NUM1). The dirigible, which was @NUM2 ft long, would be affected by high - wind currents. The back of the dirigible, which was not securely fastened, would circle around the mooring due to the constantly shifting winds, posing a significant safety risk. Additionally, there was an obstacle related to jealousy. A man was jealous because his competitor, Al Smith, was catching up with him before the idea of dirigible docking came about. These various obstacles ultimately made it unfeasible to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
1114	15947	6	2	"4. Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. They decided against it because the dirigibles might hit other buildings or collide with themselves. As stated in (@CAPS1 @NUM1 lines @NUM2), ""Could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" This indicates that the situation was not safe, and thus, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was abandoned."
1115	15948	6	2	"5. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was finding a practical and safe way to dock the dirigibles. Since they were the first to attempt docking dirigibles in the air (@CAPS1), they had no prior trials to refer to. Practicability and safety were intertwined in this project. For example, engineers had to devise a practical and workable arrangement so that airships could be easily and securely moored to the mast, ensuring passenger safety and building stability. The second obstacle was distributing the stress added to the building when the dirigible docked. As stated in @CAPS2, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This was a challenge because the foundation was nearly eleven hundred feet below. To address this, the steel frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened, which cost over sixty thousand dollars. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties when attempting to dock dirigibles at their building."
1116	15949	6	2	1. Al Smith and his fellow workers are engaged in construction work on the Empire State Building. They have encountered several obstacles during the project. For instance, they were unable to build the structure as high as initially planned. To proceed further, they had to fix the mast skeleton. Consider the dirigibles; most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. On @DATE1, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Subsequently, a law was enacted to prevent such incidents near urban areas. This indicates that the workers on the Empire State Building had to work around these @CAPS1.
1117	15950	6	2	2. The construction of the Empire State Building with the intention of allowing dirigible docking faced numerous challenges. Firstly, if the plans for the mooring mast were implemented without considering the dirigible's weight, excessive stress would be imposed on the building's foundation upon docking. Secondly, the fact that the dirigible is lighter than air has both positive and negative aspects. The negative aspect is that strong winds can easily control the rear of the dirigible, and this was deemed unsafe above the city's many pedestrians. Finally, the use of hydrogen, which is highly flammable, added to the project's risks. These obstacles collectively made the project of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a difficult endeavor.
1118	15951	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure could not be effectively transmitted to the building's foundation, which was nearly @NUM1 feet below. Another challenge was the high cost; over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Additionally, the architects could not simply place a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's flat roof. Safety was also a major concern. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. This led to an accident on May 6, 1937, and the Empire State Building's management realized how much worse the situation could have been if it had occurred in downtown New York. These were some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced.
1119	15952	6	2	"4. In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. One issue was that the architects could not simply place a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible would add significant stress to the building's frame, necessitating modifications and strengthening. Another setback was that most non - US blimps used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Nature presented the greatest challenge. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, its rear would swivel around. Using lead weights was an option, but it was unsafe as they would dangle above pedestrians. Moreover, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building. These obstacles ultimately made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1120	15953	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area for their expanded use in New York City. Another was that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. These obstacles contributed to the lack of success in enabling dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1121	15954	6	2	On December 11, 1929, Al Smith declared his plan to construct the world's tallest building, reaching 1,250 feet. This building was the Empire State Building in New York, intended to be used for dirigible mooring. However, several obstacles would prevent the successful use of the dirigible mooring. Al Smith announced the construction of the mooring mast but failed to mention the potential challenges the Empire State Building's builders would encounter when enabling dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was the wind, which would cause the dirigible's rear end to sway. Another issue was the risk of mooring foreign dirigibles filled with flammable gases too close to a densely populated area. Additionally, constructors had to invest extra time and money to strengthen the building to support the dirigibles. In the end, these difficulties meant that the dirigible mooring at the Empire State Building did not achieve the intended success.
1122	15955	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top with a single cable tether would impose stress on the building's frame. Secondly, the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure needed to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation. Thirdly, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and reinforced to adapt to the new situation, which cost over sixty thousand dollars for the building's framework. Unfortunately, all these problems remained unsolved. Due to the building's height and the complexity of the issues, the plan was postponed. Eventually, instead of dirigibles becoming the future of transportation, airplanes took their place.
1123	15956	6	2	"When architects initially planned to create a safe landing zone for dirigibles, they overlooked several crucial factors. The Empire State Building is over a certain height (represented as @NUM1 feet), and at such altitudes, the winds are extremely powerful. These strong winds would blow the dirigible around, as proven in paragraph @NUM2. The Goodyear blimp ""Columbia"" attempted to reach the mooring mast. Despite having a skilled pilot, the pilot couldn't get the steel - framed balloon close enough to dock on the spire. Another factor the architects failed to consider was that most dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. If a zeppelin caught fire, it would be a massive ball of fire descending on the downtown New York streets. The ""Hindenburg"" incident served as a clear example, which was enough to change people's minds about having a large flammable balloon hovering over New York City streets."
1124	15957	6	2	"According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. One reason was that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The owners of the Empire State Building recognized that if a dirigible caught fire over a densely populated area like New York, a major accident could occur. However, one of the greatest challenges was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mast."" When dirigibles attempted to dock, strong winds sometimes prevented them from getting close to the building. Having dirigibles hang over pedestrians on New York streets was deemed impractical and unsafe. Due to natural factors and safety concerns, the Empire State Building's builders faced difficulties in enabling dirigible docking."
1125	15958	6	2	"The text mentions that in paragraph 6, ""New York City was the lack of a suitable landing space."" Another obstacle, as described in paragraph @NUM1, was nature. The winds would push the back of the dirigible around. In paragraph @NUM2, the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas was also an obstacle. These were the problems that the Empire State Building's builders had to face. In conclusion, these multiple challenges made it difficult to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1126	15959	6	2	"1. The builders and engineers responsible for enabling dirigibles to dock on a mooring mast approximately 1,250 feet above the ground on the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 from The Empire State Building, readers are guided through the process of attempting to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to refuel and transport passengers atop the building. This was far from an easy feat; in fact, it was never accomplished. One contributing factor was the building itself. The mooring mast was intended to be placed on the building's summit, and its height, weight, and the wind pressure exerted on the structure posed significant risks. Paragraph nine states that over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Moreover, the Empire State Building's location in the densely populated downtown area of New York City presented several major obstacles. Firstly, most international blimps utilized highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. A fire or explosion at the proposed mooring mast location would have been catastrophic for the city. Secondly, ""violent air currents"" caused shifting winds atop the building, making the backend of the dirigible swerve. Due to the people below and the high altitude, weights could not be used on the blimp. Finally, there were laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Thus, the project's objective could not be achieved without legislative changes. Despite these challenges, two blimps attempted to land on the mooring mast. The U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear Blimp ""Columbia"" both failed due to strong winds and the sharp spires of nearby buildings. This project exemplifies a beneficial concept that was nearly impossible to implement."
1127	15960	6	2	2. Based on the excerpt, I believe they should not have attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the excerpt, it is evident that something extremely dangerous could have occurred, and it's likely that some incidents did take place. However, at that time, they had few alternatives other than using balloons. Considering the potential risks and the limited options available, the decision to attempt dirigible docking seems ill - advised. In conclusion, given the circumstances and the potential for disaster, it was a misguided endeavor.
1128	15961	6	2	"3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. As stated in the excerpt, nature was one of the most substantial problems for the mooring mast. The author notes that ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The wind conditions on top of the building were perilous for dirigibles. The author explains that ""The winds on top of the buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These shifting winds had a direct impact on the dirigibles. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mast. In summary, these natural factors presented formidable challenges for the builders in their attempt to enable dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
1129	15962	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. It is reasonable to assume that docking a dirigible on the Empire State Building is no simple task. A mooring mast was planned to be added to the top of the building, which would have allowed dirigibles to anchor for several hours for refueling. One of the obstacles was Al Smith's demand for the building to be taller, more ornamental, and to have a pyramid - like structure at the top. This additional work exhausted the workers. Another obstacle to expanding the use of dirigibles in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The architects and builders also consulted experts, taking tours of equipment and mooring operations. However, the most significant hurdle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. In conclusion, these multiple challenges made it extremely difficult for the builders to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1130	15963	6	2	"5. The project aiming to establish ""transportation of the future"" at the Empire State Building was a formidable challenge. One of the primary obstacles was the ""stress to the building's frame."" To accommodate the dirigibles, workers had to make over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications. These modifications were designed to strengthen the building's frame so that wind pressure could be ""transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" Another issue related to the mooring mast was the ""violent air currents"" that caused ""constantly shifting"" winds on the roof. This led to the dirigible swinging around the building while docked. Allowing these large aircrafts to ""dangle high above pedestrians on the street"" was neither practical nor safe. As a result of these obstacles, the workers and architects were forced to postpone the construction. In conclusion, the combination of structural and environmental challenges made it unfeasible to proceed with the project at that time."
1131	15964	6	2	1. One of the initial aims of the Empire State Building was to serve as a loading dock for dirigibles or blimps, with the intention of enabling New York to lead in modern travel. However, numerous obstacles ultimately led to the abandonment of the mooring mast idea. A significant issue was nature itself. Due to air - currents, the wind on the building's top was constantly changing, causing the dirigible to swing around the mast. The idea of weighting the back of the dirigible was quickly dismissed because of the danger it posed to pedestrians on the street. Additionally, there was a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up or even approach the area. In conclusion, these multiple challenges made the implementation of the dirigible - docking concept unfeasible.
1132	15965	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the top of their building. They faced issues related to laws, safety, and nature while trying to achieve this bold idea. Firstly, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law was an obstacle as the builders would have to dock the blimp without entering the restricted fly - zone. Secondly, safety was a major concern. After the destruction of the dirigible Hindenburg, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse such an accident could be over downtown New York. Given that blimps were highly flammable, an accident over densely populated New York City would be far more disastrous than in a rural area. Finally, nature presented problems. The dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up because of strong winds. The builders recognized that the drastic wind changes at the top of the building were not suitable for blimps. In the end, despite having an innovative idea, the multiple obstacles that arose led to its failure.
1133	15966	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building had to confront many obstacles. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This indicates that the stress and instability of the dirigibles would put pressure on the building's foundation, and the builders did not want this stress to cause the building to topple. Moreover, the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. They were worried that the wind might carry the balloon away from the building, potentially injuring people. These are just a few of the obstacles the builders had to face. In conclusion, these challenges made the plan of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building extremely difficult to execute.
1134	15967	6	2	4. The builders faced several hurdles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the most significant and difficult - to - overcome obstacles was safety for everyone. The builders had to be concerned about the safety of those entering and exiting the dirigible, people on the nearby streets, and those inside the building. Safety was a primary reason why the docking facility was never completed. Another major obstacle was nature. The winds at the top of the tall building were constantly changing, making it hard to land a dirigible. As stated in an excerpt, weighting the back of dirigibles with lead weights would pose a problem for pedestrians on the streets below. In summary, these combined obstacles prevented the successful implementation of the dirigible - docking plan.
1135	15968	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that it would add stress to the building's frame. For instance, a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building with a single cable tether would increase stress on the building's frame. Another obstacle was that the steel of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. These are some of the challenges the builders encountered in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these obstacles made the process of enabling dirigible docking a complex and difficult task.
1136	15969	6	2	1. The concept of dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building's mooring mast was ingenious and held great potential. Nevertheless, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges in realizing this objective. Firstly, the wind forces were too powerful to enable a dirigible to dock at the mast. Violent air - currents caused the winds on the building's top to constantly shift. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around it (∂ @NUM1). Secondly, the safety of the people was a major concern. Dirigibles varied in construction across countries. Many dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (∂ @NUM2). The builders had to consider the safety of people flying in dirigibles due to this flammability. Lastly, there was a law against aircraft flying too close to populated areas. An existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach the area (∂ @NUM3). Although the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was excellent, the builders faced insurmountable challenges.
1137	15970	6	2	2. Dirigibles had a maximum speed of eighty miles per hour and some were as long as one thousand feet, equivalent to the length of four New York City blocks. The primary hurdle to their wider use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw a chance with the Empire State Building. He proposed that adding a mooring mast to the building's top would allow dirigibles to anchor there for a few hours for refueling, servicing, and passenger boarding and alighting. Dirigibles were docked using an electric winch. The winch pulled in a line from the ship and then tied it to the mast, enabling passengers to safely board and disembark by swinging the ship's body. In conclusion, while the concept was promising, the practical implementation faced the significant obstacle of landing - area availability.
1138	15971	6	2	3. The workers faced crucial problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Firstly, if they tried to install a mooring mast on the building's roof and then have a thousand - pound dirigible on it, the structure would be unable to bear the weight. The stress from the dirigible's weight and wind pressure would need to be transferred to the building's foundation, which was 1100 feet below. The building's frame would have to be significantly strengthened. Although it could potentially work, it would cost over @MONEY1 to modify the building's framework for success. The most significant difficulty for the workers was the wind. If a dirigible landed, weights would be needed to hold it down, but having it dangle high above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. In conclusion, these multiple challenges made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1139	15972	6	2	4. The idea of dirigibles docking on the mooring mast was initially a brilliant and potentially revolutionary concept. However, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered significant problems in achieving this goal. The wind forces were too strong to allow a dirigible to dock at the mast. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even when tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would spin around it (∂ @NUM1). Safety was also a major concern. Dirigibles from different countries had different gas compositions. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium (∂ @NUM2). The builders had to take into account the safety of people flying in these dirigibles. Additionally, there was a law against aircraft flying too close to populated areas. An existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach the area (∂ @NUM3). Despite the great potential of the docking idea, the numerous challenges faced by the builders made it unfeasible.
1140	15973	6	2	5. The plan to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building was initially a well - thought - out and potentially excellent concept. However, the builders faced insurmountable problems. The wind forces were so strong that they prevented a dirigible from docking at the mast. The winds on the building's top were in a constant state of shift because of violent air currents. Even when a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would rotate around it (∂ @NUM1). Safety was a critical issue. Dirigibles from outside the United States often used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium (∂ @NUM2). This meant that the safety of people flying in dirigibles had to be carefully considered. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or approach the area (∂ @NUM3). In conclusion, although the idea was good, the many challenges made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1141	15974	6	2	"1. During the construction of the Empire State Building, numerous obstacles emerged. In the planning stage, architects began to recognize potential complications. The building was not originally designed to have additional parts added. As one architect put it, ""it was not feasible to simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building."" Wind was also a significant challenge for the construction. If a dirigible were held by a single cable tether, it would exert stress on the building's frame, and engineers would have to deal with the building's issues. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would need to be modified and strengthened to adapt to this new situation. Safety and natural factors also played a major role in the obstacles faced during construction. Architects planned to maintain dirigibles at a high altitude, but this was extremely dangerous. ""Dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" Building the dirigible would have led to many accidents, injuries, and deaths. Nature was also a factor in this plan. ""Open landing fields could be weighted down with lead weights. In case of very strong winds, this object could fall and cause serious danger."" In conclusion, the construction of the Empire State Building faced multiple and complex obstacles that required careful consideration and solutions."
1142	15975	6	2	"2. Although the builders of the Empire State Building managed to address some of the obstacles related to allowing dirigibles to dock there, many issues remained unresolved. When designing the mast to accommodate the blimp, architects realized the pressure it would place on the building's frame. To support the weight of the dirigible, they needed to make ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1) to the building's structure. Additionally, the builders had to develop a method to tether the dirigible to the building to enable passengers and supplies to disembark. As a result, the architects designed a ""rocket - shaped mast... of shiny aluminum... which also housed elevators and stairs"" (paragraph @NUM2). However, the builders failed to account for the winds at the top of the building. Once the front of the dirigible was docked, the back would swing around erratically. Moreover, the builders ignored existing laws that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over cities, as stated in paragraph @NUM3. This precaution was due to the safety hazard posed by dirigibles, which were highly flammable because of the hydrogen they used. These significant obstacles made it unrealistic to use the Empire State Building as a dock. In conclusion, despite efforts, the challenges were insurmountable, and the plan to use the building as a dirigible dock was unfeasible."
1143	15976	6	2	"3. In the excerpt from the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Initially, Al Smith aimed for this newly - designed building to be the tallest in the world. This 1,250 - foot building would reach new heights by adding a ""top hat"" and allowing dirigibles to dock. Passengers would board and disembark from the blimp, and the conductor would refuel its engine. Although it was a great idea, there were many issues the constructors did not anticipate. The thousand - foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame, and the wind would cause thousands of dollars in damage. To ensure no harm was done to the building or the residents of New York, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be strengthened. This cost the city of New York over @MONEY1 in the hope of putting it on the map for modern travel. In conclusion, the attempt to make the Empire State Building a dirigible docking site faced unforeseen challenges that came at a high cost."
1144	15977	6	2	"4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the building, including lack of area, the building's location in a populated area, and the high flammability of hydrogen. ""Also known today as blimps, dirigibles were actually enormous steel - framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air."" Hydrogen is extremely dangerous and flammable, and since the Empire State Building is in a populated area, it is too risky. The destruction of the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, demonstrated to the owners of the Empire State Building that it was more dangerous than it seemed. Another reason dirigibles could not moor at the top of the building was the existing law against all airships flying too low over populated areas. In conclusion, these multiple and significant obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
1145	15978	6	2	"5. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to devise a safe plan, which involved building designs and addressing problems they initially overlooked. The first obstacle was collaborating with the navy and other experts to create a safe and practical plan. They needed to find a way to land the dirigibles without adding stress to the building's frame and without spending @MONEY1 to strengthen it. The builders came up with a plan that specified what the mast would be made of and what would be on each floor. They even had to finish the roof before the mooring mast could be constructed. The biggest obstacle was one they failed to notice from the start. When building the mooring mast, they would have to confront obstacles brought by nature, which was simply unachievable. Safety was the main concern. In the event of a fire, it would be a disaster. The winds were too strong due to violent air currents, and there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low. After all this effort, they could not overcome the obstacles, and the mooring mast was never built. In conclusion, despite their best efforts, the natural and legal obstacles were insurmountable, preventing the construction of the mooring mast."
1146	15979	6	2	"1. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, they could not simply place a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. As stated, ""The thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure needed to be transferred to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. Thus, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened. Secondly, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). Lastly, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3), which would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. These obstacles collectively made it extremely challenging to achieve the goal of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building."
1147	15980	6	2	"2. The Empire State Building, once built as the world's tallest building and still among the tallest today, had design plans beyond just height. It was intended to serve as a passenger exchange and refueling dock for dirigibles. However, most people are unaware of this due to the many complications in the architectural design of the mooring mast. Architects knew it wouldn't be easy, as they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."" They were aware that the building needed modification to handle the added stress from the mast and that its height might need to be increased. Necessary changes were made, but the project faced realities. The mast was never built, mainly for safety reasons. The hydrogen powering the dirigibles was highly flammable, endangering New York citizens. Also, as the article mentioned, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" At that high altitude, powerful winds made it difficult to control and navigate dirigibles. In conclusion, these factors combined to prevent the realization of the dirigibles - docking plan for the Empire State Building."
1148	15981	6	2	"3. According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building builders faced multiple hurdles in their efforts to allow dirigibles to anchor at the building's top. A dirigible moored by a single cable tether at the top adds stress to the building's frame. Architects had to figure out how to transfer the stress from wind pressure and the dirigible's load to the @ORGANIZATION1 foundation. Safety was a crucial factor in the mooring mast's fate. Outside the US, most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. A fire in a dirigible above a densely - populated area would be a disaster. Nature was the greatest obstacle. Above the Empire State Building, winds constantly shifted due to violent air currents, making it difficult for a dirigible to land stably even if tethered to the mooring mast. These obstacles ultimately made it unfeasible to use the mooring mast for dirigibles."
1149	15982	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building confronted a multitude of obstacles. One was the uncertainty about whether they should build the tower in the first place. Additionally, most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. Another significant obstacle was nature itself in relation to the mooring mast. The challenges they faced were substantial and collectively made the construction and operation of the intended structure extremely difficult, ultimately affecting the viability of the project.
1150	15983	6	2	"5. Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the Empire State Building builders had many problems. First, the architects couldn't just place a mooring mast on the flat roof. The mast's weight would cause the framework to crumble, so they had to modify and strengthen the building's steel frame. Second, most foreign dirigibles were highly flammable, making it very dangerous to moor over populated New York City. Nature was also an issue; the strong winds at the building's top made mooring dangerous. Finally, there was a law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areas. Although the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was good, it was dangerous, highly improbable, and against the law, which ultimately made it an unworkable concept."
1151	15984	6	2	"1. In an excerpt penned by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the author details the challenges encountered by the Empire State Building's builders when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. After the building's construction, the builders had to reconstruct it to make it stronger to support the top. As stated, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (paragraph @NUM1). The workers had to work at a height of 1,250 feet. They were tasked with rebuilding not only the foundation and strength of the building but also its top. ""Two months after the workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an American flag again - this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast."" These examples illustrate just a few of the numerous hardships the workers endured."
1152	15985	6	2	"2. The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles as they lacked the necessary technology to land a dirigible on the mooring mast. In February 1931, @CAPS1 Clavan of the building's architectural office stated, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" After this statement, the use of dirigibles declined. By the late 1930s, airplanes had replaced dirigibles. Additionally, the builders had to construct an electric winch and a gangplank. The electric winch would haul in a line from the front of the ship and tie it to the mast, and the gangplank would lead to an open observation platform. In conclusion, these challenges contributed to the eventual shift away from using dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
1153	15986	6	2	"3. The saying ""where there is a will there is a way"" fails to account for the obstacles one must overcome. For example, while there was a desire and a plan to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building, the architects did not fully consider all the potential problems. Only American dirigibles used helium instead of hydrogen, and the wind currents at high altitudes are stronger than at ground level. Moreover, the location they chose was not ideal. They should have heeded the businessman's slogan ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1."" In summary, the lack of thorough problem - solving led to the unfeasibility of the dirigibles docking plan."
1154	15987	6	2	"4. At sporting events, people are accustomed to seeing the @CAPS1 blimp or the Goodyear blimp, which are now used for advertising. However, few know that they were once considered a form of transportation. The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 reveals that the original purpose of the Empire State Building's mast was for mooring blimps and also highlights the numerous problems associated with blimp travel. Safety was a major concern as blimps, or dirigibles, were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. An explosion over New York City would be a catastrophic event. Additionally, the constantly changing winds made it difficult to keep the dirigibles stable, posing a danger. There was also a law regarding low - flying over urban areas, and landing correctly would violate this law. Flying at such low altitudes risked the wind pushing the dirigible into the building's top and puncturing it. Although Al Smith had a good idea for the mast, there were too many problems to make it a reality."
1155	15988	6	2	"5. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith came up with the plan to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. This would enable dirigibles to anchor for several hours for refueling, servicing, and passenger boarding or disembarking. However, this plan required a great deal of work. The architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on top of the building. They had to design a plan for setting it up. As the story states, ""Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows."" In conclusion, the implementation of the mooring mast plan was a complex and challenging process for the builders."
1156	15989	6	2	1. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders encountered obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One significant challenge they faced was that a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building by a single cable tether added stress to the building's frame. The stress from the blimp's load, combined with wind pressure, had to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation. As a result, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be strengthened to accommodate this.
1157	15990	6	2	2. They needed to construct the tower precisely; otherwise, there would be landing issues. If they added a sightseeing feature, people would pay any price. However, the cost of maintaining the tower's stability was not worth the effort. In the end, people hoped to make it a very popular attraction, but its popularity was not within their control. Wind and landing difficulties always posed challenges. So, they spent a large amount of money to restabilize the building. Eventually, this turned out to be a profitable venture and a once - in - a - lifetime experience.
1158	15991	6	2	3. During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced multiple obstacles to enable dirigibles to dock on the building. The initial challenge was to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building to support the mooring mast on its top. These modifications were estimated to cost over sixty thousand dollars, a substantial amount in the @DATE1's. After the builders completed the framing of the entire building, the most significant obstacle emerged: nature. Violent air currents would cause the back of the blimps to spin around the mast. Although weights could be used to steady the blimps, having these weights hanging over people on the street was neither practical nor safe. In conclusion, these challenges made the construction of the mooring mast a complex and difficult task.
1159	15992	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were regarded as the future of transportation, but in New York City, there was a lack of a suitable landing area. The speed of dirigibles, along with the wind speed at certain areas and heights, raised concerns. An accident in @LOCATION2 further made the dirigible plan seem increasingly unreasonable. Considering the height, wind, speed, and location, using dirigibles was no longer a viable option.
1160	15993	6	2	5. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles, especially when aiming for perfection, which was crucial for the designers. They invested a great deal of work, effort, and time. They also made various arrangements for government officials. Dirigibles were often near the mooring mast, and there were fears that they might knock it over one day. The intention was for dirigibles to become the transportation of the future, competing with airplanes. Instead, the area became the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for sightseers. Although their original plans did not go as expected, other aspects seemed to work out well.
1161	15994	6	2	1. The construction team of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. The architects were confident that the mooring mast would be functional and thus initiated its construction. However, soon after, insurmountable issues emerged. For instance, dirigibles typically use more hydrogen than helium, rendering them highly flammable. An accident involving a dirigible over New York could cause significant harm to many people. Wind currents also posed a problem. The strong winds would cause the dirigible to spin even when tied up. Although lead weights could be used to keep it stationary, a dropped weight could injure pedestrians below. Moreover, state law prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes, making it impossible for dirigibles to be tied to the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. In light of these problems, the architects decided not to install the landing gear on the mooring mast, as they recognized it would not serve its intended purpose.
1162	15995	6	2	2. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One challenge was finding a safe method to attach the mooring mast to the building's flat roof, as simply placing it on top was not an option. Another issue was the need to strengthen and modify the building. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable would add stress to the building's frame. Additionally, the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transferred to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. This stress could potentially cause the building to collapse. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building in New York City faced many hurdles in enabling dirigibles to dock.
1163	15996	6	2	3. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast,” the builders of the Empire State Building would have encountered numerous consequences if they had allowed dirigibles to dock. A regular - sized dirigible was an “enormous steel - framed balloon” that could travel at speeds of up to eighty miles per hour and cruise at seventy miles per hour. Having a dirigible dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Even if a dirigible managed to land, it would “swivel around and around,” making the building more unstable. Furthermore, it was illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. Considering these factors, allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not a viable option.
1164	15997	6	2	4. Besides making amendments to the building plans, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles related to safety, practicality, and legality. The hydrogen used in most foreign dirigibles is highly flammable, presenting an extreme safety risk above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Additionally, the natural and violent wind currents at the altitude of the mooring mast would make it more difficult and dangerous to weigh down docking dirigibles. Moreover, the building plans for the Empire State Building did not comply with existing laws. Laws prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas, making the use of the mooring mast illegal. Before completing the Empire State Building, the builders had to carefully consider each of these challenges to ensure the project's viability.
1165	15998	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. Initially, the main problem was strengthening the building's foundation to withstand the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure. To address this, @MONEY1 worth of modifications were needed to the building's framework. Regrettably, many complications related to the mooring mast were overlooked until after its construction. Safety was a major concern, as many foreign dirigibles used helium, which is highly flammable. The risk of a disaster similar to the Hindenburg disaster over New York City was too great. The constantly changing winds at the top of the building due to violent air currents also prevented the effective use of the mast. Hanging weights could not be used to secure the swaying dirigible, as dropping one over a populated area like New York City would be extremely dangerous. Additionally, a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas made docking illegal. Due to these numerous obstacles, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned.
1166	15999	6	2	1. The Empire State Building's builders encountered numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. On May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The Empire State Building's owners then recognized that such an accident over a densely populated area like downtown New York could have been far more disastrous. The building's top was subject to constantly shifting winds due to violent air currents. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, its rear would spin around the mast. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach the area. Although two dirigibles attempted to reach the building, the entire docking idea was ultimately abandoned.
1167	16000	6	2	2. The article states that the Empire State Building's mooring mast was never destined to serve its purpose, and this has proven true. The building's builders faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to have dirigibles dock there. One significant issue was that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen, an extremely flammable gas. A fire - related destruction of a dirigible like the Hindenburg could lead to a catastrophic accident in a densely populated area such as New York, posing a major safety risk. Another crucial obstacle was the strong wind currents at the building's top. These winds made dirigibles swivel around the mooring mast, preventing them from getting close enough. There was also a risk of a dirigible being blown onto a sharp spire of another building, which could puncture the dirigible and endanger the captain. To reduce the swiveling, controllers would use lead weights. However, this was neither practical nor safe as the weights would hang above pedestrians, and a falling weight could be fatal. Finally, mooring a dirigible at the Empire State Building would violate an existing law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas. In hindsight, the builders should have thoroughly researched and accounted for all these obstacles before starting the project.
1168	16001	6	2	3. The Empire State Building's builders faced several obstacles including structural support issues, shifting winds, and administrative interference. A major problem emerged when they realized that the force required to hold the blimp in place had to be transmitted to the building's foundation. As a result, they had to modify the building's support system before constructing the mooring device. After completing the mast and reconstruction work, they found that the building's top was affected by constantly shifting winds due to violent air currents, making docking nearly impossible. Moreover, the fact that complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed added to the difficulty, demonstrating the builders' struggle with bureaucracy. In conclusion, the project's shortsightedness led the builders to face challenges related to the building's structure, weather, and the owners' vision, ultimately resulting in the abandonment of the mast.
1169	16002	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant challenges. The building's great height in the air meant they needed special gear. Al Smith had to wait for approval before building the mast due to the associated dangers. Over sixty thousand dollars was spent on the building's framework. Other obstacles included devising a way to drop off and pick up passengers, refuel dirigibles, and the overall goal of making the building larger. These difficulties combined to make the construction process a tough undertaking, but despite the challenges, the project was likely carried out with the hope of achieving the intended results.
1170	16003	6	2	5. The builders faced multiple obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. They couldn't simply place the mast on top of the building as it would have put excessive stress on the building's frame. Instead, they had to transmit the stress to the building's foundation, spending over @MONEY1 on the building's framework. Another challenge was finding a safe way to dock and unload the dirigibles. The violent and ever - changing winds made it impossible for the ships to reach the building. Even if a docking were to occur, the back of the ship would be pushed around the mast. Additionally, there was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, which meant the dirigibles could never approach the building to tie off to the mast. These obstacles ultimately made the dirigible - docking plan unfeasible.
1171	16004	6	2	1. Initially, the builders of the Empire State Building did not consider the problems associated with dirigible docking. However, they eventually encountered these obstacles. The primary concern was safety for the passengers and pedestrians in the city below. Many countries used hydrogen instead of helium in their dirigibles, and since hydrogen is highly flammable, it could have led to numerous issues in the future. The German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @CAPS1. After this incident, the Empire State Building owners realized that such an accident could not occur above a densely - populated area like downtown New York, as it could cause significant injuries. Despite safety being a major concern, the greatest obstacle was nature itself. When a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the violent air currents at the building's top would make the back of the ship spin around. These air currents not only made it difficult to keep the dirigible steady but also extremely challenging to reach the mooring mast. Using lead weights to hold down the blimps' ends was not a viable option as having dangling weights above @CAPS2 was neither practical nor safe. Another obstacle was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which prevented dirigibles from approaching or being tied to the building. Two blimps (the Los Angeles from the U.S. Navy and the @LOCATION4 from Goodyear) attempted to reach the building but were stopped due to high wind speeds. These multiple obstacles prevented the mooring mast from being used for future transportation.
1172	16005	6	2	2. In @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building, as described in The @CAPS2 Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, encountered numerous challenges. The most significant obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. Another hurdle was nature, with constantly shifting winds caused by violent air currents. Additionally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. The builders should have recognized all these hazards and abandoned the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers. In conclusion, these issues made the use of the mooring mast for dirigibles an unfeasible plan.
1173	16006	6	2	3. I believe this short passage presents an interesting concept. Architects aimed to construct a mooring mast on the Empire State Building in New York. This mast was intended to dock dirigibles, which are now known as blimps. The mooring mast is a slender tower at the top of the Empire State Building. The Empire State Building stands @NUM1 feet tall without the mooring mast at its peak. The stress exerted by a dirigible on a mooring mast at @NUM2 feet is substantial, given the height of the structure. They invested @MONEY1 in modifications for the building's base area. A major drawback of dirigibles is that when filled with helium, they are highly flammable and could cause millions in damage. If a zeppelin caught fire over a densely populated area, it could cost many lives. In my opinion, the mooring mast was a great idea as it helped the building become the tallest at one time, and it should still be used today.
1174	16007	6	2	4. The architects' oversight of the potential problems with the mast led the builders of the Empire State Building to face numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigible docking. There was a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, making it illegal for ships to approach the building. Even if a ship managed to get tethered to the mooring mast, the constant shifting winds due to violent air currents would cause the back end of the ship to swivel around the mast. Dirigibles are typically moored in open fields where their backs can be weighted down with lead weights. However, this was dangerous, especially as the weights would be hanging over downtown New York. Without proper restraint, the violent winds could push the ship into sharp spires, ripping its shell. The wind pressure and the dirigible's load would add excessive stress to the building's frame. To handle this stress, over sixty thousand dollars in modifications to the building's steel frame would be required to transmit the stress nearly eleven hundred feet down to the foundation. Most dirigibles made outside the United States used hydrogen, which is more flammable. The Empire State Building owners realized the potential severity of an accident if it occurred over downtown New York. Faced with all these obstacles, the owners and builders of the Empire State Building voted to postpone the installation of the landing gear.
1175	16008	6	2	"5. In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced many obstacles while trying to complete their @CAPS1. They initially thought they had everything under control. When making their plans, they considered the mast to be a crucial part. However, when they built the mast, it did not meet their expectations. As the saying goes, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" Moreover, a law was passed preventing ships from tying themselves to the building, which would have reduced the number of visitors. They solved this problem by having airplanes bring the passengers. Despite all these difficulties, the builders managed to overcome the obstacles. In the end, their perseverance allowed them to move forward with their project."
1176	16009	6	2	1. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon, readers learn about the numerous obstacles the Empire State Building's builders encountered when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. The primary obstacle was safety. The United States used hydrogen, rather than helium, to power dirigibles. As noted, after the Hindenburg disaster, the building's owners recognized the potential catastrophic consequences if such an accident occurred over a densely - populated area like New York. Another challenge was the harsh winds at high altitudes. The winds on the building's top constantly shifted due to violent air currents. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to tie a dirigible to a building. In the end, despite the efforts, dirigibles did not become the future of transportation and were replaced by airplanes.
1177	16010	6	2	2. The Empire State Building's builders encountered multiple obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock. One significant hurdle was the existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Moreover, most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. On May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The building's owners realized that if such an accident happened in downtown New York, the consequences would be far worse. The most challenging obstacle was nature. The winds on the building's top shifted constantly because of violent air currents. If a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, its back would spin around the mast. Due to these overwhelming obstacles, the builders were unable to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast.
1178	16011	6	2	3. Throughout the excerpt, the builders faced significant difficulties in enabling dirigibles to dock. Many dirigibles outside the United States were constructed using hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Given New York's dense population, there were concerns for public safety. Weather also posed a problem, as the winds constantly shifted, causing the ships to swivel. Recognizing the high - risk situation, the builders had no choice but to abandon the plan of allowing dirigibles to dock.
1179	16012	6	2	4. During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous problems before and after the mast's construction. There were laws, incidents, and safety flaws. Firstly, there was a law against low - flying aircraft over urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to tie up or approach the area. Secondly, the burning of the Hindenburg was a major concern. The US used helium for dirigibles, while other countries used highly - flammable hydrogen. The builders began to worry about how much worse the incident would be if it occurred over a densely populated area like downtown New York. Lastly, it was unsafe to have a dirigible swaying in the intense winds near the building, as the cargo could make the dirigible go out of control. The problems with the mast were insurmountable, and the plan was doomed from the start.
1180	16013	6	2	5. To enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders faced several obstacles. They could not simply drop a mooring mast and moor a thousand - foot dirigible on top, as it would add stress to the building's frame. Architects could not place a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. The most significant obstacle was nature. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building had to confront these challenges, and the difficulties made it very hard to achieve the goal of having dirigibles dock there.
1181	16014	6	2	1. In the excerpt, the builders encountered numerous obstacles to enable dirigibles to dock. They faced multiple challenges, with safety being one of the primary concerns. Al Smith commented that they were attempting to devise a safe method of mooring airships to the mast, among other safety - related issues.
1182	16015	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building faced severe obstacles when trying to facilitate dirigible docking. Initially, they theoretically believed everything would function flawlessly. However, they later realized they had not adequately assessed potential problems. As one reads, it becomes evident that the building never fulfilled its intended purpose. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. On May 6, 1937, the building's owners recognized how disastrous a fire could be if it occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. In reality, the idea was unsafe. The builders completed the construction only to realize that the concept was not viable.
1183	16016	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building were extremely determined to ensure everything would go smoothly. Nevertheless, the building was not suitable for dirigible docking. Despite their best efforts, the fundamental design and nature of the building did not allow for successful dirigible operations.
1184	16017	6	2	4. When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to construct a mooring mast for dirigibles, they confronted several insurmountable obstacles. The most obvious was the danger of crashing. After the Hindenburg crashed in New Jersey, they understood how much more catastrophic a similar crash could be in downtown New York. Another significant obstacle was the wind at the tower's top. As stated, the winds on the building's summit were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. When combined with the lightweight nature of dirigibles, this made mooring far more difficult compared to an open field. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City, though these were often ignored. Ultimately, these obstacles led to the conclusion that the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was neither practical nor feasible.
1185	16018	6	2	5. Based on the information, the builders of the Empire State Building faced the challenge of finding a way to allow dirigibles to dock. There are unopened rooms and the highest observation desk in the building. They needed to create space for a dock but were unsure how. One problem was that the city opposed dirigible mooring at the Empire State Building due to laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Complications also arose as the captains of dirigibles couldn't easily let go of the control levers. The sharp spires of other buildings posed a risk of puncturing the dirigibles. Moreover, the wind could blow the dirigibles off - course. In the end, these obstacles made it very difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1186	16019	6	2	1. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. The highly flammable nature of hydrogen gas was a significant concern. After a blimp explosion in New Jersey, the owners recognized the potential disaster if such an incident occurred over the city. High winds and wind shifts at the building's top also posed problems; as the excerpt noted, if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. Additionally, laws prohibited airships from flying too low over cities like New York, making it illegal for blimps to approach the Empire State Building. These factors combined to create substantial challenges for the builders.
1187	16020	6	2	2. The construction of the Empire State Building presented numerous difficulties for the builders. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. An accident involving a dirigible over New York City would be catastrophic due to the city's high population density. Another issue was that they couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof, necessitating a design modification. Moreover, there was competition; Al Smith, engrossed in the design, didn't realize he was close to losing the title of the world's tallest building. Once he found out, he knew he had to make it taller. These challenges made the construction of the Empire State Building a complex endeavor.
1188	16021	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was that a dirigible moored at the top of the building by a single cable would add stress to the building's frame, requiring it to be modified and strengthened to withstand the load and wind pressure. The most significant obstacle was nature; constant wind shifts caused by violent air currents made the ship swivel around the mooring mast. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for the ships to tie up or approach the building. Safety was another major concern as most dirigibles used either helium or hydrogen, both highly flammable. The destruction of the Hindenburg by fire made the builders aware of the potential danger over a populated area. These were some of the key obstacles the builders had to consider.
1189	16022	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. They had to ensure the dirigibles didn't collide with other buildings and used ropes to drop papers. They also needed to prevent the dirigibles from popping if they touched the buildings and keep them at a safe distance. One proposed solution was building a small tunnel for the dirigibles to enter, which would eliminate the risk of them popping upon contact with a building. Overall, these were the main issues the builders had to address.
1190	16023	6	2	"5. In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. Safety was a major concern; most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. The destruction of a German dirigible by fire shocked the builders, who realized it could have been even more disastrous. Nature also posed problems, with constantly shifting winds on top of the building causing the tethered ship to ""swivel."" Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. All these factors created significant challenges for the builders."
1191	16024	6	2	1. The construction workers of the Empire State Building encountered numerous problems when it came to enabling dirigibles to dock. Firstly, constructing docking facilities for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was perilous. Dirigibles were unable to perform many fundamental docking operations at the building. For instance, “dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building” (as stated by @CAPS2 @NUM1). Mooring was unfeasible because it contravened “an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas” (as reported by @CAPS2 @NUM1), rendering it illegal for a ship to tie to the Empire State Building. Additionally, nature posed the greatest threat to dirigibles. “The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents” (according to @CAPS2 @NUM3). Given this and the fact that construction on such a tall building was impractical at the time, dirigibles never landed on the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the challenges associated with building dirigible landing gear and facilitating dirigible landings ultimately led to the abandonment of the Empire State Building docks.
1192	16025	6	2	2. When attempting to build a docking mast on the top of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered structural, safety, and practicality challenges. To install the mast on the building, they had to reinforce the steel, incurring “over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications”. Moreover, they had safety concerns regarding allowing a dirigible to dock in a city, on a skyscraper. One such concern was the use of the flammable gas hydrogen in non - American dirigibles. If a dirigible caught fire over the city, the consequences would be severe. Furthermore, the tether system of the mooring mast was at the mercy of nature. “The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, which meant the dirigible on the mast could swivel around, posing a danger to citizens”. The mast was also impractical due to a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Finally, in later years, dirigibles “gave way to airplanes”, making the mooring mast for dirigibles obsolete. Due to the structural, safety, and practicality obstacles they faced, the builders of the Empire State Building were unable to successfully install an active mooring mast on top of the building.
1193	16026	6	2	3. When the builders of the Empire State Building tried to enable dirigibles to dock there, they encountered multiple issues. One problem was the stress on the building from the added mast. “The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below”. This indicates how the stress factors on the building complicated its construction. Another obstacle to the construction was that “the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents”. During the construction of the dock, the constructors faced problems that ultimately made the dock useless. In summary, the challenges related to stress on the building and the unpredictable winds led to the failure of the dirigible - docking project at the Empire State Building.
1194	16027	6	2	4. When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced several problems. First, they needed to find a practical way to achieve this. When they decided to construct a “rocket - shaped mast” for the dirigible to attach to, they realized that the roof had to be built first. After the mast was completed, safety became a significant concern. “Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable” (paragraph @NUM1). If there were an accident involving a foreign dirigible, the safety of New York City would be at stake. Additionally, dirigibles could not be tied down with weights as they could in an open field, which would also be unsafe for the people of New York. Safety was the main obstacle the builders faced, and it was a major issue. As a result, dirigibles could not dock on the Empire State Building.
1195	16028	6	2	5. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced a major obstacle: the risk of blowing up the building. “Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable” (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This is an example from the excerpt that could turn into the most significant obstacle. If a dirigible were to explode above the building, the building would be destroyed, and many people would lose their lives. This was one of the most substantial obstacles the builders had to deal with, ultimately hindering their plans for the mooring mast.
1196	16029	6	2	1. The construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast for dirigibles presented the builders with a multitude of challenges. These included a weakened framework, the forces of nature and weather, potential fire risks, and U.S. laws. Since the building was not initially designed to accommodate dirigibles, its frame was insufficiently sturdy to withstand the pulling and movement of the blimps in the air. At the 102 - story height of the building, the dirigibles would sway in the strong and unpredictable winds. Besides the risk of loosening or damaging the building, the dirigibles could be punctured by the spires of other buildings. Given the high population density around the Empire State Building in New York City, any damage to the dirigible was extremely perilous. A fire and explosion, similar to the German Hindenburg blimp incident, could cause severe harm to pedestrians and other structures. This kind of disaster was also likely due to the use of flammable gases like hydrogen to keep the blimps afloat. Moreover, the U.S. government's laws prohibited airships from approaching urban areas like New York City closely, making it illegal for a dirigible to fly close enough to the building for docking. In conclusion, numerous issues emerged when the builders tried to convert the Empire State Building into a dirigible docking station.
1197	16030	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered significant obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Their goal was to allow people to disembark, unload, or load their ships. However, various factors made this a difficult task. In conclusion, these challenges hindered the successful establishment of the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking site.
1198	16031	6	2	3. The Empire State Building faced problems in accommodating dirigibles for docking. Firstly, there was a lack of suitable land area. The mooring mast could not simply be placed on the building's flat roof. Additionally, a dirigible tethered a thousand feet up by a cable would impose a great deal of stress on the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transferred all the way down to the building's foundation. Another crucial reason was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. In conclusion, these issues made it extremely challenging to use the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking station.
1199	16032	6	2	"4. The builders of the Empire State Building confronted numerous construction obstacles, particularly when it came to enabling dirigibles, or blimps, to dock at the building. From the start, they had to deal with extremely high - set expectations, such as attaining the title of ""world's Tallest Building"". This aspiration brought with it underlying challenges related to the building's frame and support. Another aim was to make the building ""equipped for an age of transportation"", as stated by John Tauranac. The desire to turn it into a dock for what was then considered the ""transportation of the future"" introduced even greater hurdles. These included the responsibility of safely disembarking passengers from the dirigibles. One of the most significant obstacles was the constantly shifting winds and violent air currents. While this problem could be solved in open fields using dangling weight belts, it was nearly insurmountable in the populated New York City. The final factor that led to the failure of this operation was the law that prohibited airships from flying too low in urban areas. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it impossible for the Empire State Building to become a successful dirigible docking site."
1200	16033	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These included the lack of land area, wind currents, and the gas used to make dirigibles float. The shortage of land area was a concern because some dirigibles were as long as @NUM1 ft, equivalent to the length of four blocks in New York. In a densely - populated area like New York, large dirigibles flying close to the ground could endanger people and block sunlight. Wind currents were also a factor. At 102 floors above the ground, the wind would buffet large dirigibles, posing a risk to the building's frame as the wind pressure would have to be transferred to the building's foundation. The final obstacle was the use of hydrogen in many foreign dirigibles at the time. Hydrogen is a highly flammable and dangerous gas, especially in densely - populated areas like New York. The destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire in New Jersey made people realize how much worse such an accident could be in New York. In conclusion, these obstacles made it very difficult to establish the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking station.
1201	16034	6	2	"1. The endeavor to land dirigibles on the Empire State Building was fraught with numerous obstacles, primarily related to the building's framework and safety. Even prior to commencing construction, workers encountered difficulties with the new blimp - mooring plan. To support the aircraft, the building's frame had to be ""modified and strengthened""; otherwise, the building would not remain stable. Safety was the core issue in fulfilling the blimp - mooring plan. Once the construction was completed, it became evident that the ""mooring mast was destined to never fulfill its purpose"". Foreign dirigibles were mainly filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable and extremely unsafe. Additionally, attaching a dirigible to the mast was dangerous due to winds that ""constantly shifted because of violent air currents"". Moreover, mooring dirigibles to the world's tallest building was not only unsafe but also illegal as airships were prohibited from flying too low over populated areas. After the mooring mast was built, it was quickly realized that it would never be used."
1202	16035	6	2	2. In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's story The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. The first major obstacle was the presence of highly flammable hydrogen in the balloons. The second was the natural winds, which constantly shifted due to violent air currents on top of the building. The third was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The presence of hydrogen and helium in the balloon, with hydrogen being highly flammable, meant the builders had to create a safe docking place for dirigibles. The shifting winds from nature posed a significant challenge. The law made it illegal for airships to tie up or approach buildings in the area. Despite their efforts, dirigibles did not become the future of transportation and instead gave way to airplanes.
1203	16036	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One issue was the lack of a suitable landing area. Mooring a thousand - foot dirigible at the building's top with a single cable tether would place stress on the building's frame, and this would require a large sum of money, around sixty thousand dollars. Safety was also a concern as most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. However, the greatest hurdle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were in a constant state of shift due to violent air currents, making it difficult to moor dirigibles safely.
1204	16037	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous problems when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. As the story indicates, dirigibles typically use hydrogen, which is highly flammable. A puncture in the dirigible could lead to a fire. Nature also presented a significant issue, with the winds on top of the building constantly changing due to violent air currents. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building. These were the main obstacles the builders had to face.
1205	16038	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Even when a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around it. In open landing fields, dirigibles could be weighted down with lead weights at the back. However, using such weights at the Empire State Building, where they would dangle high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. These were the obstacles the builders encountered when trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1206	16039	6	2	1. The construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast to enable dirigible docking presented numerous challenges. The winds at the building's summit were a major hurdle as they constantly shifted due to violent air currents. Adding lead weights to prevent the dirigibles from swiveling around the mooring mast was deemed unsafe, considering the people in the city below. Moreover, modifications worth sixty thousand dollars had to be made to the building's framework. Undoubtedly, constructing the mooring mast was an arduous task.
1207	16040	6	2	2. On December 11, 1929, Al Smith announced to the public that the Empire State Building would soar to a height of 1,250 feet, becoming the world's tallest building. To achieve this, a mooring mast was to be added to the building's top for dirigible docking. However, the builders were unaware of the impending obstacles. They encountered various architectural, safety - related, and nature - based problems. When designing the mast, they realized that simply placing it on top was not feasible. The combination of wind pressure and the stress of a dirigible held by a single cable would transmit stress throughout the building, reaching down to the foundation. Strengthening the framework to withstand this stress would cost over a certain amount. Another issue was safety. In the relevant location, hydrogen, a highly flammable fuel for dirigibles, was used. An incident over downtown New York could lead to a catastrophe. The most significant obstacle was nature itself. Unpredictable violent air currents would cause the dirigible to shift, even if weighted. Weighing the balloon with pedestrians below was neither practical nor safe. Ultimately, the mooring mast project failed due to unforeseen and unpredicted obstacles related to nature, architecture, and safety.
1208	16041	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The reading mentions that there was limited landing area in a certain place. Although adding landing space was considered, the height of the mast would pose a danger to both passengers and those on the ground. Additionally, the over - thousand - pound craft would add stress to the building's frame, requiring modifications and strengthening to accommodate the dirigibles, which would cost over a specific amount of money. The idea proved to be unsafe, as demonstrated by the explosion of a German dirigible at a particular organization. This incident made the builders realize the potential danger of such an event above a densely populated area like New York City. In conclusion, these factors made the plan of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
1209	16042	6	2	"4. According to the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. One of the significant obstacles was nature. The winds at the building's top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, its rear would spin around the mast, as described in a specific paragraph. Another obstacle was that non - US dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Clearly, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome several challenges to enable dirigible docking on the building."
1210	16043	6	2	"5. From the excerpt, it is clear that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason for the plan's failure was an existing law that made it illegal for a dirigible to approach the area, as stated in a particular paragraph. Additionally, a blimp reaching the Empire State Building could have been an extreme fire hazard. This is supported by the incident in a specific paragraph where the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, which made the owners realize how much worse such an accident could be in New York. Moreover, weather presented an even greater problem. Violent air currents made the idea of a mooring mast ""neither practical nor safe"". In my opinion, the most crucial reason for the idea's failure was that technology advanced beyond expectations. As mentioned in a specific paragraph, dirigibles, instead of becoming the future of transportation, were replaced by airplanes. Overall, these factors led to the unsuccessful implementation of the dirigible - docking plan at the Empire State Building."
1211	16044	6	2	1. In “The Mooring Mast,” Marcia Amidon L¸sted examines the adversities and obstacles encountered by the Empire State Building's builders when aiming to enable dirigible docking. One significant obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. While dirigibles moored in open fields could be weighted down with lead weights at the rear, using such weights at the Empire State Building, where they would dangle high above street - level pedestrians, was neither practical nor safe. Before considering dirigible landings, architects first had to figure out how to install the mooring mast on the building's top. They couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof; instead, the building's steel frame had to be modified and strengthened. Most problems were avoidable, but the constantly shifting winds on the building's top, caused by violent air currents, remained an insurmountable issue.
1212	16045	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen in their blimps instead of helium. This issue went unnoticed by the builders until May 6, 1937, when the German dirigible Hindenburg caught fire in New Jersey. Only then did they realize the potential disaster if a dirigible were to catch fire over the crowds in New York. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on the building's top were constantly changing violently, causing the dirigible to swivel over the people below. While weighting the dirigible with lead weights could theoretically solve this problem, it was unsafe as the weights could accidentally fall on pedestrians. Additionally, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making the idea of using the Empire State Building as a docking area illegal. Due to these complications, where one spark or strong breeze could endanger countless lives, the plan to create a mooring mast for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was abandoned by the 1930s.
1213	16046	6	2	3. New York Governor Al Smith had a vision to construct a building that would surpass the Chrysler Building, the world's tallest at the time. He achieved this, and the Empire State Building became the new tallest structure at 1,250 feet. There were further plans for the building; aviation pioneers dreamed of dirigible travel, and a mooring mast was to be built at the top for docking airships. However, what should have been a cautious project turned out to be dangerous. Dirigibles in a densely populated area like New York City could pose a significant risk. A fire and explosion could harm people, which was highly likely at such a high altitude. As people began to understand these dangers halfway through the project, it was called off due to safety concerns.
1214	16047	6	2	4. One of the main obstacles the builders faced was ensuring the building's stability. Architects knew they couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Al Smith commented that the mooring mast situation was at an acceptable level and that work was ongoing. A team of engineers was working on finding workable and faster arrangements, while the government was trying to determine a safe way for mooring airships to the mast. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the building's top with a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. If a large dirigible were placed on the building, it would weigh it down and reach the building's frame. To address this, a steel frame had to be used. Moreover, the winds at the building's top, caused by violent air currents, led to constant shifting. Having a dirigible dangling over pedestrians was extremely unsafe. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many significant challenges in enabling dirigible docking.
1215	16048	6	2	5. The Empire State Building, already famous and well - known, sought more attention. New York Governor Al Smith attempted to allow dirigibles to dock on the building for transportation. Encouraged that it would work, he went ahead with the construction. The builders faced many obstacles in making this possible. To achieve this dream, they had to modify and strengthen the building, which was costly; over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were needed for the building's framework. The builders designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless - steel tower, and the mast would have four wings at all corners. They also planned observation areas, elevators, and baggage areas and even raised an American flag at the top. Unfortunately, the dangers of docking dirigibles were not fully considered. The builders' efforts came to naught as attempts to dock two dirigibles failed. Eventually, the building was transformed into the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for sightseers.
1216	16049	6	2	1. During the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, architects encountered numerous obstacles, which ultimately prevented the effective utilization of the mast as originally intended. Firstly, the addition of a thousand - ton dirigible would impose significant stress on the building's frame. To address this, designers had to invest @MONEY1 in reinforcing the building's frameworks, which raised doubts among the builders about the feasibility of the project. Secondly, hydrogen dirigibles were highly flammable. A fire on a large dirigible and its subsequent fall onto New York City would be catastrophic, dampening the enthusiasm of the workers due to the high - risk nature of the endeavor. Thirdly, the wind above the building constantly shifted because of air currents. This would cause the dirigible tethered to the mast to toss and turn, which was neither practical nor safe for pedestrians below. Finally, airship laws prohibited dirigibles from flying at low altitudes over urban areas, rendering the mooring plans illegal. In conclusion, the multitude of obstacles faced by the designers led to the mooring mast never being used as planned.
1217	16050	6	2	"2. When constructing the docking station for dirigibles, architects failed to anticipate multiple obstacles. One of these was the issue of height and the associated lack of safety. In @DATE1, the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"", which used highly flammable hydrogen, caught fire in New Jersey, as detailed in paragraph thirteen. If such an incident occurred to a dirigible docked high above New York City, the airship would plunge to the ground where many New @CAPS1 would be going about their daily lives. The most significant obstacle was nature. Air currents and storms would cause the dirigible, tethered to the mooring mast only by a rope, to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast... dangling high above pedestrians on the street"", as noted in paragraph fourteen. This was neither practical nor safe. Another obstacle was a pre - existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas. Despite the height of the Empire State Building, legal docking at the new mooring mast was impossible. In the end, Al Smith's idea had to be abandoned due to safety concerns, natural factors, and state law."
1218	16051	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that the weight of the dirigible (or blimp) and wind pressure exerted excessive stress on the building's frame. However, the architects managed to overcome this by strengthening the iron frame of the building to withstand the additional stress. Regrettably, other obstacles proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of using the mast for docking dirigibles. The most significant problem was safety. Many blimps used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium to stay afloat, posing a high risk of fire and the blimp falling onto the city. Nature also presented a major obstacle. Wind could blow the blimp into surrounding buildings, and since it was airborne, weights could not effectively keep it stable. Finally, an existing law prohibited aircraft from flying too low around urban areas. In conclusion, these combined factors made it unfeasible to use the mast for docking dirigibles.
1219	16052	6	2	4. One of the problems faced was that ships could be blown by the wind and collide with buildings. To address this, the idea of adding weights to the ships was considered. However, there was a risk that these weights could fall off and hit people on the ground. In conclusion, both the wind - induced collision risk and the potential danger of falling weights made the situation challenging and required careful consideration to find a safe solution.
1220	16053	6	2	"5. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, several obstacles were outlined that hindered dirigibles from docking on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was the building's flat roof. To install the mooring mast, the building's framework needed to be strengthened. Architects could not simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof, and modifying the framework cost over @MONEY1. Another obstacle was the law. Flying at low altitudes over urban areas was illegal, making it impossible for a dirigible to approach the Empire State Building. The most significant obstacle was safety. Blimps flown around New York used flammable hydrogen. Additionally, the winds on top of the building constantly shifted due to violent air currents, making it unsafe to hook a blimp in such conditions. Moreover, with thousands of pedestrians below, a falling dirigible would be a disaster. In conclusion, it was evident that hooking dirigibles to a mast on the Empire State Building was not a viable option."
1221	16054	6	2	1. During the construction of the Empire State Building and the attempt to make it a safe docking place for dirigibles, numerous obstacles were encountered. Engineer Al Smith aimed to construct the “world's tallest building.” When the Empire State Building was initially conceived, the plan was for it to be taller than the newly - constructed Chrysler Building. However, the architect of the Chrysler Building installed a 185 - foot spire inside the building. Al Smith then came up with an idea that was more than just an “ornament.” He envisioned equipping the Empire State Building for a future age of transportation, a dream of aviation pioneers at the time. His plan was to use the building as a dirigible dock for passengers to embark and disembark. Unfortunately, the frame design was not suitable. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building never fulfilled its intended purpose. There were multiple attempts to land dirigibles, but they all failed. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough, and the problem remained unfixed.
1222	16055	6	2	2. The Empire State Building began as a large skyscraper. Al Smith, driven by competition, set his crew to work. The crew faced numerous obstacles. They first had to modify and strengthen the building's steel frame, which cost over sixty thousand dollars. Then, they constructed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless - steel tower that was illuminated from within. After that, they added four wings of shiny aluminum to support a conical roof for housing the mooring arm. Next, stairs and elevators were installed to accommodate the “blimps” passengers. Finally, a couple of observation rooms were added to the @NUM1 and 102 floors. Smith's men worked diligently and overcame many challenges in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1223	16056	6	2	3. Architects and builders encountered several obstacles while trying to construct the Empire State Building and allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was maintaining a safe environment. Dirigibles fueled by hydrogen are highly susceptible to fire. For example, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. High wind speeds and violent air currents were also major problems. These conditions were dangerous as they could cause the back of the ship to swing around the mooring mast. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, as stated in paragraph @NUM2. This law prevented dirigibles from docking or even flying in the general area. Since these obstacles could not be overcome, the mooring mast was ultimately unsuccessful.
1224	16057	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They aimed to increase the height of the building so that it could be “equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation dream,” as @PERSON1 stated. Al Smith proposed adding a mooring mast at the top of the building to allow dirigibles to anchor for refueling, servicing, and passenger boarding and alighting. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were made to the building's framework. A shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless - steel tower was designed, illuminated from inside, with a stepped - back design mimicking the overall shape of the building. The rocket - shaped mast would have four shiny aluminum wings at its corners and rise to a conical roof housing the mooring arms. The roof had to be completed before the mast could be installed. The most significant obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. In conclusion, these were the challenges the builders faced in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1225	16058	6	2	5. As human beings, we have the obligation to dream and strive to turn those dreams into reality. However, Al Smith's dream of having dirigibles land on the Empire State Building seems rather erratic. From the early stages of the project, there were many obstacles that indicated its likely failure. It was evident from the start of the construction that this idea was unrealistic, as “the one obstacle to their expanded life in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area” (paragraph 6). Even before the building's construction, it should have been obvious to Al Smith that having dirigibles cruise through a large city was an impossible feat. Safety was also a major concern. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and there were laws restricting objects from flying too low over urban areas, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. In conclusion, Al Smith's dream faced insurmountable obstacles from the beginning.
1226	16059	6	2	"1. The initial challenge was to transform the Empire State Building into the world's tallest structure by adding a top or ""hat"" to slightly increase its height. The second hurdle was the task of safely dropping people from the mooring mast onto the building's flat roof. Despite these difficulties, the overall goal of enhancing the building's stature and functionality persisted."
1227	16060	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several apparent obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock on the building. One obstacle was related to nature; the winds atop the building were high - speed and constantly changing, which would render the dirigible unstable and difficult to dock. Another concern was the safety of passengers and bystanders. An uncontrollable dirigible could endanger numerous lives. Additionally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to dock on the Empire State Building. These multiple obstacles ultimately prevented the successful implementation of a dirigible docking facility on the building.
1228	16061	6	2	3. The builders would confront obstacles such as structural issues and the need to consider future technological advancements. Even if they managed to figure out how to land a dirigible on the platform, they had to account for improvements in dirigibles or the emergence of new transportation methods. The structural issue was resolved relatively quickly by reinforcing the building's supports. However, the long - term problem of technological change remained a significant concern for the viability of the dirigible - docking project.
1229	16062	6	2	"4. The builders faced numerous obstacles during the creation of the mast. The building's flat roof was one such obstacle. When a dirigible was moored to the building with a single cable, it placed stress on the building's frame. To address this, the builders had to modify and strengthen the frame. Another problem was that some countries still used hydrogen in dirigibles, and an explosion over New York would be catastrophic. ""Nature itself"" presented a major obstacle as well; the constantly changing winds at the top caused the back of the dirigible to move around the mooring mast. A safe solution had to be found. In fields, the back of a dirigible could be weighed down by lead, but this was not feasible as it would be unsafe to have lead dangling over civilians. Moreover, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Since not all these obstacles could be solved, the mooring mast ultimately proved to be a failure."
1230	16063	6	2	5. The first obstacle arose when the @PERSON1 building's height was changed. The mooring mast was constructed, increasing the Empire State Building's height by @NUM1 ft. However, it was then discovered that the mast would add stress to the building's frame. Subsequently, new laws and the Hindenburg incident indicated that the mooring mast would not be a practical solution. As a result, the builders gave up their efforts to make the mast useful.
1231	16064	6	2	1. Initially, there was no means to anchor dirigibles. Achieving stability at the rear was only possible by adding lead weights, but this was not a viable option above a busy street. Additionally, existing laws prohibited dirigibles from flying in close proximity to buildings. After the German blimp Hindenburg caught fire near a New Jersey naval base, people contemplated the potential severity of such an accident if it occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Moreover, the wind at that altitude was too strong for a blimp to approach the building. Overall, it was an unwise idea.
1232	16065	6	2	"2. In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the building's foundation. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure needed to be transferred nearly eleven hundred feet below. Since the building was already constructed, they had to work around the existing foundation. Another obstacle was a law stating that airships were not allowed to fly low over urban areas. To overcome this, they had to convince government officials of the project's safety. The most significant obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building constantly shifted due to violent air currents, which could be so strong that a tied - up dirigible might rip off the roof and endanger people below. In conclusion, these were the obstacles the builders in ""The Mooring Mast"" faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
1233	16066	6	2	3. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building presented numerous obstacles. The first was the building's support. The dirigible's load and wind pressure would significantly reduce the building's stability, leading to over sixty thousand dollars being spent on modifying the building's framework. Another issue was the dirigibles themselves. Most dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which, as demonstrated by the tragic Hindenburg incident, is highly flammable. The Empire State Building's owners recognized that an accident of this kind would be even more devastating over a densely populated area. Given these obstacles, the idea of dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building was abandoned for the safety of the people.
1234	16067	6	2	4. When constructing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, it appears that the engineers overlooked its flaws. Safety was likely the most significant concern. Many dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, increasing the risk of explosion. After the Hindenburg disaster in Lakehurst, New Jersey, there were fears about a similar incident occurring above downtown. Nature was the biggest obstacle. The winds at the top constantly shifted violently due to air currents, causing the back of the dirigibles to spin around the mooring mast. There were also legal issues. Dirigibles were not allowed to fly at a certain height over urban areas, making it illegal to approach the building. Al Smith really should have conducted more research on the potential problems with his mooring mast.
1235	16068	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous technical and safety challenges when constructing the dirigible mooring mast. A dirigible moored to the mast by a single cable would exert enormous stress on the building's frame, necessitating its strengthening before the project could proceed. Once the mast was completed, several issues prevented its use. The mast was intended to make the building a travel hub, but most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen for flight instead of helium. The German blimp Hindenburg was destroyed due to hydrogen's flammability, and it was recognized that a similar disaster over a densely populated city like New York would be far more catastrophic. Additionally, moored blimps would be buffeted by strong winds, potentially pushing them into nearby buildings. Using lead weights to prevent this would have created a safety hazard as they would dangle over pedestrians. There was also a law banning dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, rendering the use of the mast illegal. These problems ensured the mooring mast project was doomed from the start.
1236	16069	6	2	1. These dirigibles are extremely large and filled with hydrogen and helium. The pointed top part could easily cause the dirigible to burst. Additionally, the wind speeds were consistently too high, preventing the blimp from being connected to the building. Moreover, after witnessing the German dirigible Hindenburg burn, people were fearful of a similar incident occurring, especially in a densely populated area like New York. All these factors made it unfeasible to use dirigibles in such a context.
1237	16070	6	2	2. When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to construct a mooring mast for dirigibles, they encountered numerous challenges. The first significant issue was the building itself. As stated, “The stress of the dirigibles’ load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building’s foundation.” Being the tallest building in the world, it could not withstand this pressure. While it was possible to strengthen the building, it would come at a high cost for an already - existing structure. The architects’ next hurdle was safety, particularly in a highly populated area like downtown New York. They found dirigibles to be too dangerous and uncontrollable in a city full of skyscrapers. The normal docking process for dirigibles would need to be completely changed to accommodate the mooring mast. After the Hindenburg incident, laws were enacted to keep airships away from populated areas. Despite this, some, such as the Los Angeles and Columbia, still attempted to dock at the mast. However, the mast was never effectively utilized, highlighting the difficulties in innovating for an existing structure like the Empire State Building.
1238	16071	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a major concern. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another factor was related to the docking process. In open landing fields, dirigibles could be weighted down at the back with lead weights. But in the highly populated New York, using these weights would not be practical as they would dangle over pedestrians. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach the area. Even if a dirigible could reach the building, there were concerns that it could be punctured by obstacles on surrounding buildings. These issues collectively made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1239	16072	6	2	4. Architects and builders aiming to construct a docking platform for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles. The first problem was that the building's framework might not be strong enough to support a dirigible's weight. As mentioned in paragraph nine, “the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, and that was too risky.” Another challenge was nature. Since some dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, there were fears that the strong winds on top of the building could cause the flammable gas to lead to destruction. Public safety was also a significant concern. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, preventing dirigibles from approaching the dock for the safety of New York citizens. Due to these problems, the idea of using the mooring mast was ultimately shelved.
1240	16073	6	2	5. After reading the excerpt, it's clear that the builders faced many challenges when attempting to dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. One of the main issues was the lack of a suitable landing area. The builders recognized the need to add a mooring mast to the top of the building to ensure safe landings and allow passengers to board and disembark. Another problem was the stress placed on the building's frame by a thousand - foot dirigible. The pressure from the dirigible and the wind would have to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation. The most significant obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents, causing the back of the ship to spin around the mooring mast. Although the idea of improving transportation was promising, this plan never materialized as it was not well - thought - out.
1241	16074	6	2	1. According to the provided excerpt, the concept of permitting dirigibles to land on the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building in New York City was unfeasible. One factor substantiating this is that the majority of dirigibles are filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, rather than helium as in balloons. This poses significant safety risks for the urban environment. Additionally, certain laws were enacted stipulating that dirigibles and airships could only fly at specific low altitudes over urban areas due to strong winds and the potential for destruction. As a result, the mooring mast was and remains impractical for airship landings and primarily serves as a tourist attraction.
1242	16075	6	2	"2. When constructing the mooring mast for the Empire State Building, the architects encountered several challenges. Firstly, the original building design was unable to support the intended purpose of docking dirigibles. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand - foot dirigibles would add stress to the building's frame."" Consequently, they had to make ""sixty - thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1). Secondly, the addition of new floors was necessary. The building was initially designed to have about @NUM3 floors, but with the mooring mast, the builders had to construct an extra top floor with great detail to serve as both an observatory and a boarding dock. While these two challenges were difficult, they were solvable. However, some issues were insurmountable. Dirigibles from @LOCATION2 were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. Given the Empire State Building's location in downtown New York, a minor accident could lead to catastrophic problems in the city. Moreover, the high - altitude winds at the top of the building were not considered. These strong winds would make dirigibles unstable and unsafe. Despite these issues, the mooring mast was built but functions as a design element rather than a docking facility."
1243	16076	6	2	"3. In the excerpt, the architects of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. The ""lack of a suitable landing area"" was one such obstacle (p. @NUM1). The architects were trying to create a suitable landing area where dirigibles could anchor for several hours for refueling or servicing and for passengers to embark and disembark. They attempted to use an electric winch, which ""would swing in the breeze and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking a gangplank to an open observation platform."" The most significant obstacle was ""nature itself."" Dirigibles moored at the Empire State Building would be high above pedestrians on the street, which was neither practical nor safe. Despite these challenges, the architects of the Empire State Building made efforts to enable dirigibles to enter the building's property."
1244	16077	6	2	"4. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles. The safety of the public was a major concern. Most blimps from outside @LOCATION2 used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, and the builders did not want to risk harming people in a densely populated area. Another significant obstacle was nature. Violent winds that blew back and forth would cause a blimp attached to the mast to dangle dangerously over citizens, which was far from safe. Finally, it was illegal to have airships flying close to urban areas, and New York is a highly populated city. This law was in place to protect the citizens. In conclusion, the builders were so focused on completing the project that they overlooked safety concerns while facing these many obstacles."
1245	16078	6	2	5. Allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building would have presented multiple obstacles. As the area becomes more densely populated with taller buildings, it could lead to overcrowding. Since such a docking system had never been built before, there was a high probability of something going wrong. Moreover, similar to the Hindenburg disaster, a similar catastrophe could occur in a densely populated city like New York. Considering these factors, it is clear that docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building would have been fraught with difficulties.
1246	16079	6	2	"1. During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Safety was one of the most significant hurdles. They needed to figure out a way to dock the dirigibles to the mast without having them swing in the wind. As noted, ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another challenge was designing the mast. The architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's flat roof. The building's steel frame had to be strengthened to bear the weight of the mast. In conclusion, these difficulties presented substantial obstacles to the plan of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1247	16080	6	2	"2. The Empire State Building's builders encountered multiple obstacles while constructing the mast. The first was the building's stability. As the excerpt states, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This indicates that the entire building's structure needed alteration to accommodate the mast. The second obstacle during the mast's actual use was nature. In an attempt to dock dirigibles to the mast, natural conditions were unfavorable. As the excerpt mentions, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air - currents."" There were also concerns that passengers couldn't safely disembark from the dirigible because its end would float rapidly undocked. Moreover, docking the end or the helium in the dirigible could pose risks to pedestrians below. In conclusion, these challenges made the construction and use of the mast extremely difficult."
1248	16081	6	2	"3. The builders faced several challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building's mast, ultimately abandoning the plan. According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Løsted, when the Empire State Building was yet to be built, the Chrysler Building in New York City was of a similar height. The weight and force of a dirigible could damage the building, so it had to be strengthened and modified for a blimp to land. Engineers also had to address the dirigibles' flammability. Løsted describes a recent dirigible explosion in New Jersey in paragraph @NUM1, highlighting that constructing a landing pad over densely - populated New York City could be disastrous. The constructors concluded that the plan was ""neither practical nor safe."" Using lead weights to hold blimps down could endanger pedestrians if something went wrong. In the end, it was a wise decision for the Empire State Building's builders to abandon the dirigible dock construction plan."
1249	16082	6	2	"4. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Løsted, the author explains that the spire of the Empire State Building was initially intended to serve as a mooring mast. However, this purpose was never realized due to numerous problems faced by the building's constructors when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. The main issues included unpredictable and violent winds, the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, and air laws. The winds were a problem because even if the front of the dirigible was tethered to the mast, the back could swing freely, potentially crashing into other moored dirigibles. The winds also made reaching the Empire State Building a hazardous task. Hydrogen is a volatile gas that can explode, which would be extremely dangerous over a densely - populated area. Additionally, US air laws prohibit airships from flying too low over urban areas, making mooring at the Empire State Building illegal. In conclusion, these challenges effectively prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building."
1250	16083	6	2	"5. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Løsted, the owners of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. The first was the use of hydrogen in most non - US dirigibles. Hydrogen is highly flammable, a major safety concern. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. As stated, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The damage would have been far more severe in New York. Violent air currents were another obstacle. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" which is dangerous for street - level pedestrians. The final obstacle was an existing law that prohibits airships from flying low over urban areas. ""The law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building,"" preventing dirigibles from approaching New York. In conclusion, these obstacles made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1251	16084	6	2	1. The Empire State Building's builders encountered several obstacles when considering allowing dirigibles to dock. One issue was the stress on the building's foundation from the dirigibles' load and wind pressure. A thousand - foot dirigble tethered by a single cable would add stress to the building's frame. Safety was also a major concern. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. On May 6, 1937, the German dirigble Hindenburg caught fire in New Jersey. The accident would have been far more dangerous in densely populated New York. Additionally, there was an existing law against airships flying too close over urban areas. In December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigble tried to reach the mooring mast but couldn't due to winds. The fear was that the winds might blow the dirigble onto the sharp spires of other buildings, puncturing its shell. Overall, these multiple obstacles made it extremely challenging to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1252	16085	6	2	"2. Undoubtedly, the builders of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building were highly innovative and ambitious. However, they faced numerous difficulties, some they overcame and others overcame them. One significant problem was that tethering a one - thousand - foot - long dirigible to a 1,250 - foot - tall building with strong wind currents at the top would place a great deal of stress on the building. As stated, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" The builders managed to overcome this issue. After the building's completion, the mooring mast couldn't serve its full purpose due to further challenges. After the Hindenburg tragedy, ""the owners realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Another concern was that with strong winds and only the front of the dirigible tied to the moor, the back would swing around. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would dangle high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The final challenge was the pre - existing law against low - flying aircraft, which ended Al Smith's dreams. In conclusion, despite their initial vision, the builders were ultimately thwarted by these persistent challenges."
1253	16086	6	2	"3. Based on the excerpt, there were obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. I predict that the builder was reluctant to have dirigibles around because the Empire State Building is very tall and the blimps would float right above it. I think Al Smith was worried that something might happen. My backup answer is supported by his statement, ""it's on the level, all right. 'No kidding'. We're on the thing now. One set of engineers here in New York is trying to figure out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" It seems he was confused about the whole situation. In short, these factors made the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock a complex and uncertain endeavor."
1254	16087	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was the size of some dirigibles, which were @NUM1 feet long, equivalent to four blocks in New York City. When attached by a single tether, this would add stress to the building's frame, necessitating the strengthening and modification of the Empire State Building's steel frame. Nature also posed a challenge. The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. For instance, the U.S. navy dirigible Los @CAPS1 approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up because of the strong winds, and the captain couldn't even take his hands off the lever. Safety was another concern. Although dirigibles are usually weighted down by lead, doing so at the Empire State Building would be a safety risk as the dirigible would dangle high above pedestrians. Finally, there was a law against flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. In conclusion, these various obstacles made it very difficult to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1255	16088	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building confronted several obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock on its mooring mast. The first was the extreme and constantly shifting winds, which would cause the dirigibles to be violently blown through the air. Safety was also a major hurdle, as many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, posing a significant risk. Additionally, there was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. These multiple obstacles meant that the builders faced a complex set of challenges when trying to dock dirigibles on the building's mast. In the end, these difficulties made it a very difficult task to achieve the goal of regular dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1256	16089	6	2	1. Attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building presented numerous obstacles. Non - U.S. dirigibles posed a significant risk as they used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and considering the German dirigible crash, the potential consequences of a similar incident in downtown New York were far more dire. Another major issue was the wind force. The wind on top of the Empire State Building was constantly and aggressively shifting. Using lead weights, as done when landing in fields, would be dangerous for the people below. Additionally, the law prohibited flying at such low altitudes over urban areas. Despite two dirigibles attempting to dock, they directly experienced the associated dangers, ultimately showing that docking dirigibles on the building was fraught with difficulties.
1257	16090	6	2	"2. According to experts, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Allowing a dirigible to dock on the building's top was never considered an easy feat. As stated in the article, the dirigible's purpose was ""destined to never fulfill its purposes."" Safety was a major concern. Most non - U.S. dirigibles used hydrogen, which is much more flammable than helium. Fire is extremely dangerous, making this a significant obstacle for the builders. However, nature presented the greatest challenge. Violent wind shifts could cause dirigibles to sway and dangle above pedestrians, endangering both the people on the ground and the builders. Moreover, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up or approach the building. These factors combined made it extremely difficult for the builders to achieve their goal."
1258	16091	6	2	"3. In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Tying a dirigible to the building with a single tether would ""add stress to the building's frame,"" necessitating over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building. Some dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, which is extremely dangerous over a densely populated area. The ""greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" There are violent air currents at the top of the building, causing the ship to swivel. To prevent this, lead weights would be required, but having them ""dangling high above pedestrians"" is neither practical nor safe. In the end, it became clear that there were far too many problems associated with using a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building."
1259	16092	6	2	4. Initially, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock. Many of these obstacles were related to the dirigibles themselves. By the 1930s, dirigibles were highly unsafe and flammable. The destruction of the German dirigible by fire in New Jersey on May 6, 1937, highlighted how much worse such an accident could be if it occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Nature also presented a major challenge. Violent air currents caused the winds to constantly shift, making it extremely dangerous for a dirigible to approach a mooring mast. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or approach the area. Al Smith's dream of making the Empire State Building suitable for transportation could not be realized due to these significant challenges.
1260	16093	6	2	5. The experts building the Empire State Building faced several major obstacles. One of the primary challenges was the framework. When constructing a 1,250 - foot building with the intention of having an aircraft land on it, a well - designed frame is essential. To reduce pressure, they added stainless steel and chrome - nickel windows and spent over sixty thousand dollars on modifying the building's skeleton. The air currents were another significant issue. At nearly 1100 ft in the air, the wind can be extremely violent. Strapping a dirigible and allowing it to sway back and forth is not feasible. If a dirigible were to come off or unhook before refueling was complete, it could crash and burn, endangering hundreds of pedestrians below. Al Smith had a great idea, but he failed to anticipate all the problems involved.
1261	16094	6	2	1. The Empire State Building's builders encountered numerous challenges when planning to enable dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, they had to account for the building's stress. Adding structures to the top would increase the stress, necessitating modifications and strengthening of the steel frame. These modifications would cost over @MONEY1. Secondly, safety was a major concern. Most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is flammable, making the docking unsafe. Additionally, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Facing all these obstacles, the builders ultimately abandoned the idea.
1262	16095	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. One significant issue was related to the dirigibles themselves. They typically used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. An explosion of a dirigible over a densely - populated area would be catastrophic. Nature also presented the greatest hurdle for the successful use of the building's mooring mast, which is used for docking airships like dirigibles or zeppelins. Docking large air - crafts on top of a building with violently shifting winds is extremely dangerous. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, posing a @CAPS1 threat. Usually, dirigibles are moored in open fields and weighed down with lead weights. But mooring a dirigible over the Empire State Building would leave it dangling above pedestrians, which is neither @CAPS2 nor practical. In conclusion, constructing the Empire State Building had @CAPS3 more challenges and obstacles than its architects had anticipated.
1263	16096	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building had to deal with various problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The nature of the ships, the added stress on the building, and safety concerns all went against the ill - conceived idea of landing blimps on the Empire State Building. The ships' nature would cause them to sway in the wind, leading to the problem of tangling the mooring cable. To address this, captains would need to use lead counterweights, but these were highly impractical as they would hang over crowded streets. Another problem was the added stress on the building's foundation. Since the building was not originally designed for this purpose, its foundation would require modifications, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. The most obvious issue was safety. These airships were filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and the area around the building had other buildings with sharp spires. A collision with one of these spires would result in an inevitable disaster. In light of these problems, the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was unfeasible.
1264	16097	6	2	"4. According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. These included the weather, safety, past dirigible tragedies, and the law. The wind at the top of the Empire State Building was a major safety hazard. Even if the dirigible was secured, the back would swing due to the unpredictable winds, creating a potential hazard. Dirigibles are filled with hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, adding to the danger. On May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @LOCATION3. The owners considered that if such an accident had occurred above a densely populated area like New York, the consequences would have been far worse. Given the high level of danger associated with dirigibles, the builders faced numerous difficulties in allowing them to dock at the Empire State Building."
1265	16098	6	2	"5. The builders faced two main obstacles: flying blimps too low in the area and increasing the height of the Empire State Building beyond its intended design. In @CAPS1 three, Al Smith realized he was at risk of losing the title of the world's tallest building. On December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State Building would reach a height of 1,250 ft by adding a top or a ""hat"" to the building, making it taller than any other in the city. Another obstacle was a law regarding airships flying too low above urban areas. This law was enacted to prevent airships from tying up with buildings. Flying too low is a significant safety hazard that could endanger hundreds of lives. Due to these obstacles, the plan to have airships interact with the Empire State Building faced significant challenges."
1266	16099	6	2	1. In the excerpt, when making it possible for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders encountered multiple obstacles. Firstly, they needed to strengthen the building's steel frame. They also had to construct the Empire State Building to be 102 stories tall, with the 101st story serving as an observatory. The final challenge was the actual construction of the Empire State Building. These were the obstacles the builders faced during the construction of the Empire State Building.
1267	16100	6	2	"2. As stated in ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that if a huge dirigible was held at the top of the building by a single cable, it would stress the rest of the building. To make the upper half of the building more stable, they would have to spend sixty thousand dollars on modifications. Nature was also a significant issue. The winds were unpredictable due to violent air - currents, and even if dirigibles were tied to the mast, they would swivel around. Moreover, having large dirigibles dangling above pedestrians was unsafe. Additionally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas, which made it illegal to dock ships at the top of the Empire State Building. Overall, these were some of the obstacles encountered during the construction of the Empire State Building."
1268	16101	6	2	"3. According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building was originally intended to have a greater purpose. The gases in some dirigibles were flammable, posing a huge risk. Having a mooring mast in the large city also presented potential threats to the safety of the city and its population. In addition to safety threats, the winds were uncontrollable. Since the mast would be at a great height, it was impossible to predict the ever - changing winds. The dirigibles could not stay in one place because of the winds, which was another safety issue that the architects overlooked. After considering all the safety issues and weather problems, there was also a law that prohibited the idea. This made the construction of the mast unfeasible. Given all the risky and dangerous tasks that would have been involved, the mast was never built. It is very unfortunate that after all the planning, dirigibles could never land there."
1269	16102	6	2	"4. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2, the architects faced multiple challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Initially, they couldn't install a mooring mast as it would add stress to the building's frame. To address this new situation, they had to modify and strengthen the building's steel frame. Before putting up the mooring mast, they designed a shiny glass, chrome - nickel stainless steel tower to shape the overall appearance of the building. Even before constructing the mooring mast, the roof had to be completed. However, when they attempted to install the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, it didn't work. During the test, the dirigible couldn't get close enough to be tied up. So, in the end, the plan described in ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 did not succeed."
1270	16103	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles as they aimed for greater and more spectacular achievements. Their hopes were high, but these hopes were accompanied by challenges that they had to overcome during the construction process. Despite the difficulties, they strived to reach their goals of creating a remarkable structure.
1271	16104	6	2	1. The planners of the Empire State Building had ambitious designs to enable dirigibles, or blimps, to dock at the building. Despite their high hopes, they encountered numerous challenges in realizing this plan. The initial problem was that the building's steel frame needed reinforcement to bear the load of the dirigible, which required the architects to modify the building's structural framework. Safety was also a significant concern as the hydrogen used in blimps made them highly flammable, posing a fire - hazard. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, meaning dirigibles were not allowed to tie up at the building or even approach the area. Moreover, nature itself presented the greatest obstacle. Strong winds caused the dirigibles to swivel excessively, and the area was not spacious enough to use lead weights to stabilize the back of the dirigibles. In conclusion, the architects of the Empire State Building faced insurmountable obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1272	16105	6	2	2. When the Empire State Building was first conceived, it was intended to be the tallest building. What many people don't know is that the original purpose of its mast was to serve as a landing site for dirigibles, also called blimps. In the [DATE1]'s, dirigibles were regarded as the future of transportation, and the Empire State Building was to have a mooring mast at its top for these new airships. However, the builders faced multiple obstacles in making this possible. Some dirigibles were up to one thousand feet long, and the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City was the first hurdle. The architects couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the building's roof. A [NUM2] - foot dirigible moored at the top would stress the building's frame, which was another obstacle. Safety concerns for the public also meant that the mooring mast was unlikely to fulfill its intended purpose. Finally, an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas was the practical reason why dirigibles couldn't moor at the building. In summary, these numerous obstacles prevented the successful docking of dirigibles on the Empire State Building.
1273	16106	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The wind at the top of the building was a major issue. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it dangerous for a dirigible to stop. There was also a law against flying dirigibles over cities, which made it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach the area. As a result, no pilot would attempt to dock there. Additionally, the decreasing use of dirigibles was a factor. After the Hindenburg incident on May 6, 1937, and with the increasing popularity of airplanes, fewer people traveled on airships. In conclusion, these various obstacles effectively prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building.
1274	16107	6	2	4. When the builders of the Empire State Building tried to enable dirigibles to dock there, they faced many challenges. To allow dirigibles to anchor, a mooring mast had to be added. The architects then had to figure out how to add a thousand - foot dirigible at the top of the building without stressing its frame. Nature was the most significant obstacle; the architects were worried because they couldn't control the weather. Another problem was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Even if dirigibles could reach the building, there was a risk. The builders were afraid that the wind might blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of nearby buildings. Eventually, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers faded away, rendering the challenges the builders faced ultimately pointless.
1275	16108	6	2	5. The workers who aimed to build a functional mooring dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building took on a difficult task. First, they had to spend sixty thousand dollars on modifications to ensure the building could withstand the weight and additional wind pressure of a moored dirigible. Second, a pre - existing law made it impossible for dirigibles to reach the low altitude required for docking in the city. Finally, constant changes in wind currents and other weather conditions made safe docking at the Empire State Building nearly unfeasible. There was a risk that the dirigible could be blown into the sharp roofs of nearby buildings. Unlike normal landings in fields where lead weights are used for stability, at the building, the dirigible would be tied up and dangling over pedestrians. In conclusion, these factors made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to build a working mooring dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building.
1276	16109	6	2	1. The challenges faced by the Empire State Building's builders in allowing dirigibles to dock were recognized too late. Initially, they had to devise a feasible approach and obtain government officials' approval to ensure the safety of Al's plan. Since the roof couldn't be flat, an alternative landing structure was required. However, mooring a dirigible with a single cable would exert stress on the building's frame and transfer it to the foundation, necessitating modifications to the building's design. One of the most significant hurdles was the high flammability of dirigibles, which could endanger the numerous people and surrounding buildings. Additionally, weather conditions could impact the dirigible's flight and pose major safety risks. There was also a law restricting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Evidently, this concept was unfeasible from the start, yet it took time for this realization to dawn.
1277	16110	6	2	2. The obstacles encountered during the construction of the Empire State Building were substantial and led to several issues. For instance, there was a lack of a suitable landing area for dirigibles. The primary concern, however, was the absence of adequate safety measures, which ultimately prevented this vision from being realized. In conclusion, the combination of these challenges made it impossible to achieve the goal of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building.
1278	16111	6	2	"3. According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, engineers needed to find a ""practical, workable arrangement"" to ensure safe and efficient operations. Secondly, they had to figure out how to moor a ""thousand - foot dirigible"" to a 1,046 - foot - tall building. The most significant obstacle was that mooring a dirigible would add stress to the building's frame, potentially causing it to collapse under the weight. To overcome this, the builders would have to strengthen and modify the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building."" Despite the numerous obstacles, the builders' hard work was worthwhile as it helped Al Smith maintain his winning title."
1279	16112	6	2	"4. When the builders of the Empire State Building aimed to allow dirigibles to dock, they encountered obstacles related to laws, safety, and the nature of the mast. At that time, there was a law prohibiting aircraft from flying low over cities. As the narrator in paragraph @NUM1 stated, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Although some dirigibles still attempted docking, it was extremely dangerous near other buildings. Safety was another major concern. The excerpt noted that ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" A disaster similar to the Hindenburg over a city like New York would be catastrophic. Finally, the mast was not suitable for holding a dirigible. As the narrator pointed out, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" and there was no practical way to secure the back end. Given these problems, the builders had to accept that the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was bound to fail."
1280	16113	6	2	"5. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted on pages 1, @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, the author explains the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. As an example, on page 1, it is stated that ""They said that the Empire State Building would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid put there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask something as mundane as a water tank."" In summary, these explanations highlight the difficulties the builders encountered in their attempt to make the Empire State Building a docking site for dirigibles."
1281	16114	6	2	In the early 1930s, dirigibles were being invented. Workers and financiers encountered numerous problems when attempting to dock these dirigibles. A dirigible was a type of airship with a live propeller, and passengers could board it in a closed compartment beneath the balloon. According to the passage, dirigibles were a dangerous device. Outside the United States, hydrogen, which is highly flammable, was used instead of helium. On May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg exploded due to fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. By the late 1930s, the concept of using dirigibles for transportation faded. Subsequently, the baggage area of the dirigible was transformed into the world's largest soda fountain and tea garden.
1282	16115	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the building, namely safety, natural factors, and legal restrictions. In terms of safety, dirigibles typically used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. This was exemplified by the destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Nature presented another challenge as violent air - currents could shift the dirigible, potentially causing damage and endangering pedestrians. Legally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. As stated in the excerpt, this law made it illegal for ships to tie up to the building, rendering the initial plan rather pointless.
1283	16116	6	2	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, we discover that the spire on top of the Empire State Building was originally intended as a landing spot for dirigibles. However, due to multiple reasons, dirigibles could never dock there. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to tie up at the mooring mast. First, dirigibles were mostly made of hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. This was a significant concern as a fire could occur over New York City. Second, the wind at the top of the mast was extremely violent, causing the back of the dirigible to swing constantly. Using lead weights to hold it down was considered but was neither practical nor safe as they would dangle above pedestrians. Finally, there was a law that prohibited airships like dirigibles from flying too low over densely populated areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. In this excerpt, it is clear that the builders faced many obstacles, and perhaps they should have anticipated them."
1284	16117	6	2	"Construction always comes with challenges. In the excerpt from The Mooring Mask by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple challenges in their attempt to land dirigibles there. The obstacles included the enormous size of the dirigibles, the need to modify the building's frame, high costs, and natural factors. Landing dirigibles was a difficult task. Dirigibles are ""a thousand - foot"" long flying devices, and their weight made landing extremely difficult. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transferred to the building's foundation, necessitating modifications to the steel frame of the Empire State Building. These modifications would require significant effort and planning and would cost over sixty thousand dollars, posing a financial challenge. Additionally, nature was an obstacle as the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many hurdles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock."
1285	16118	6	2	"The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted discusses the heights of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. The architect of the Chrysler Building had a secret. He constructed a 185 - foot spire inside the building and hoisted it to the top, shocking the public and the media. This made the Chrysler Building 1,046 feet tall, 46 feet taller than the Empire State Building. One obstacle to the wider use of dirigibles in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith proposed that adding a mooring mast to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor for refueling, servicing, and passenger boarding. However, simply adding a mooring mast or a cable tether could add stress to the building's frame. Eventually, the mooring mast was built, and the American flag was raised again."
1286	16119	6	2	1. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a prime concern. Dirigibles produced outside the United States utilized hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Additionally, the wind on top of the building was constantly changing due to violent air - currents. These shifting winds would cause the end of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making dirigible docking illegal. Moreover, the builders were worried that strong winds could blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of nearby buildings, endangering the city. In conclusion, these numerous obstacles made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
1287	16120	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in their attempt to have dirigibles dock at the building, including wind, weather, and safety issues. The excerpt mentions that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents, indicating that nature posed a major hurdle to the docking plan. Safety was another substantial obstacle. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Also, using lead weights to anchor the dirigible was neither practical nor safe above a city full of pedestrians. In summary, these challenges made the plan of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building difficult to execute.
1288	16121	6	2	3. Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was never a safe proposition. The mooring mast of the building was doomed to never serve its intended purpose, and the reasons should have been evident before its construction. Once the idea was proposed, multiple obstacles emerged. Builders soon discovered that docking dirigibles would stress the building, as over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Safety was a major concern, as dirigibles from outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen. Wind also presented an obstacle. Weighing down the dirigibles was not ideal due to the proximity of other buildings and the large number of pedestrians below. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. In conclusion, these obstacles ensured that the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was never successful.
1289	16122	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the law, which restricted dirigibles from being placed over urban areas because an accident could endanger many pedestrians. The spires on other buildings also posed a problem. Constructing the mooring mast was difficult as it would add a great deal of stress to the building. Safety was a significant issue as well. Some dirigibles caught fire due to the gases they used. If such an incident occurred in New York, many innocent lives would be lost. In conclusion, these combined obstacles made it very challenging to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1290	16123	6	2	5. The builders faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow blimps to dock at the Empire State Building. Two major obstacles stood out. Safety was the primary concern. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If a blimp had an accident similar to the Hindenburg, it would not only damage the Empire State Building but also affect other buildings and harm people due to the city's high population. The weather also had a significant impact on the building. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. These winds could easily knock over the mooring mast with a blimp attached, as the back of the ship would spin around the mast. A strong enough wind could cause the blimp's weight to pull the mast down. In conclusion, weather and the use of hydrogen - filled blimps were the two main obstacles the builders had to face.
1291	16124	6	2	"1. Al Smith proposed a plan to add 250 feet to the Empire State Building by installing a resting stop for traveling blimps. While the concept was theoretically feasible, the implementation faced numerous obstacles that ultimately led to the plan's failure. The simplest and solvable issue was the additional stress the blimp placed on the building's frame. The entire building had to be strengthened to withstand the pressure, and the workers managed to complete the construction. However, the most significant hindrance was nature. The high - altitude winds were constantly and violently shifting. Even if the dirigible was attached to the mast, its rear would swivel uncontrollably. Using lead weights to control the back of the aircraft was impractical since the landing would be at a great height. Moreover, nature - related problems could not be prevented, and safety concerns were insurmountable. Most blimps outside a certain location used a more flammable gas, and landing a potentially fire - prone dirigible above New York City was extremely dangerous. There was no way to change the composition of other countries' blimps. Additionally, existing laws made it illegal to have anything tied up so low over an urban area. Overcoming this obstacle would have required years and extensive legal processes. In conclusion, although the idea of placing a mooring mast on the Empire State Building for dirigible landings seemed promising, the actual process was fraught with insurmountable obstacles, and the hope of ""equipping the building for an age of transportation"" had to be abandoned."
1292	16125	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered safety - related problems when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. As mentioned in a certain paragraph, the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to strong air currents. Also, lead weights would dangle above pedestrians on the street. Another obstacle was the existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. In summary, these safety and legal issues made it difficult for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1293	16126	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One such obstacle was the difference in the use of air. As stated in a particular paragraph, most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, which would cause numerous problems. Another significant obstacle was the wind. According to another paragraph, the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, which was a difficult problem to solve. Other obstacles included the size and density of the dirigibles. Among all these, the use of hydrogen and the wind - related issues seem to be the most prominent reasons for the difficulties. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it challenging to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1294	16127	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. The architects could not simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof; the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to adapt to this new situation. After the destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg, the building's owners realized how much more disastrous the accident could have been if it had occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Nature itself presented the greatest obstacle. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around it. Dirigibles moored in open fields could use lead weights at the back, but this was neither practical nor safe at the Empire State Building, where the weights would dangle above pedestrians. In conclusion, these various obstacles made it nearly impossible to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1295	16128	6	2	5. According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several major obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. Firstly, the architects could not simply place a mooring mast on the building's flat roof as it would add unwanted stress to the building frame. Secondly, the gas used to fill the dirigibles was a problem. Hydrogen, being highly flammable, could cause a dangerous fire above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Thirdly, violent air currents at the top of the building were an issue. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mast, its back would swivel around. Finally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas such as New York. Due to these obstacles, the attempt to dock a dirigible at the top of the Empire State Building was bound to fail.
1296	16129	6	2	1. The construction of the Empire State Building presented the builders with numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. One significant issue was the use of hydrogen by blimps for flight instead of helium. Most dirigibles outside the United States utilized hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Due to this, blimps posed a major safety risk to passengers, rendering them unusable. Another obstacle was the rough air currents at the top of the Empire State Building. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around it. Dirigibles are typically landed in open fields, where their back - ends can be weighted down. Having blimps dangling high above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many hurdles in their efforts to make dirigible docking possible.
1297	16130	6	2	2. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast,” the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles to complete their task. It is stated that Al Smith announced the building would reach a height of [NUM2] feet. This was a significant challenge as the workers had to risk their lives at such a great height for construction. Additionally, working near dirigibles was dangerous. The excerpt indicates that dirigibles are extremely flammable, and if they came into contact with fire, the workers could be seriously injured. In summary, the builders faced multiple hazards during the construction of the Empire State Building.
1298	16131	6	2	3. In the work “The Mooring Mast” by [ORGANIZATION2], the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in enabling dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle to the wider use of dirigibles in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Another challenge was ensuring the safe embarkation and disembarkation of passengers from the dirigibles. In conclusion, it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced several difficulties in their attempt to make dirigible docking a reality.
1299	16132	6	2	4. “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lusted details the problems the Empire State Building builders faced. These included the stress dirigibles would place on the building's frame, safety issues and laws, and the winds around the mast. Any dirigible would impose tremendous stress on the already - constructed building frame, leading the builders to make over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications. Although these changes were made promptly, safety concerns such as potential fires or flying too low over urban areas (which was illegal) persisted. The most significant obstacle was the violent, constantly - shifting winds around the Empire State Building. These winds made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to stay in one spot without spinning around the building. In a densely - populated city like New York, weighing down dirigibles for landing was not an option. Clearly, the mooring mast was not well - planned before construction began. The builders should have focused more on their actual capabilities rather than trying to exceed expectations and pursue a so - called “higher calling.”
1300	16133	6	2	5. Builders faced multiple obstacles to make it possible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First, attaching a dirigible to a mast at the top would put stress on the entire building. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transferred through to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. This problem was resolved by strengthening the building's frame. Another major issue was the strong and violent winds at 1,250 feet in the air. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, its back would spin around it. The combination of these winds and the fact that dirigibles were filled with hydrogen was dangerous. Hydrogen is a highly combustible gas, and if a dirigible hit the building and there was a spark, the entire ship could catch fire. In conclusion, the challenges were substantial in the attempt to enable dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1301	16134	6	2	"1. The height of the Empire State Building presented significant obstacles for its builders when attempting to enable blimps to dock there. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified, over six thousand dollars worth of modifications."" This indicates that the building's height was a factor, as the city had to bear the cost of modifications. Additionally, the mast was unstable due to the building's great height. Paragraph @NUM2 mentions that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This shows that an unstable mast in such conditions could pose a danger to downtown New York. Lastly, state laws also became an impediment for dirigibles. Paragraph @NUM3 states, ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" In conclusion, these various factors - the building's height, mast instability, and state laws - were the obstacles that the builders had to overcome."
1302	16135	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered substantial obstacles, one of which was the Mooring Mast. The original design of the building was not strong enough to support an airship. To address this, the building had to be modified and strengthened. A rocket - shaped tower made of shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel was added. This tower would illuminate from the inside, increasing the building's floors from @NUM1 to 102. The information is sourced from paragraphs @NUM2. In conclusion, these modifications were necessary to overcome the initial structural limitations and accommodate the Mooring Mast.
1303	16136	6	2	"3. According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was the plane height restriction. As stated in ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (The MOORING MAST), planes cannot fly too low above cities without posing a safety hazard. Another issue was that some non - US dirigibles used hydrogen fuel instead of helium. As mentioned in ""From outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" (The Mooring Mast), hydrogen is highly flammable, presenting a significant risk. Lastly, strong wind currents at great heights were a problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (The Mooring Mast) shows that these winds would blow dirigibles around during docking attempts. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building had to grapple with multiple challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock."
1304	16137	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The weight was a major concern. The architects couldn't simply install the mooring mast as it would endanger the building. Thus, they had to invest over sixty thousand dollars in strengthening the framework. Safety issues also arose. Some dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen gas, which is highly flammable. The risk of a fire above New York was a serious threat. Violent weather at the top of the building was another problem. Harsh weather would cause the dirigibles to sway, making it extremely dangerous to embark and disembark passengers. Moreover, a New York law prohibited low - flying vehicles, preventing dirigibles from docking in the first place. In conclusion, these combined obstacles made it very difficult to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1305	16138	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building confronted numerous challenges when trying to permit dirigibles to dock. These challenges spanned from natural factors to legal restrictions. They failed to account for the constantly shifting air at the building's peak. At the height of the mooring mast, violent air currents would cause the dirigible to spin around the mast, especially since the blimp was only tethered at the front. In addition to these natural challenges, laws also hindered dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State. An existing law stated that airships flying too low over urban areas was illegal, a factor the builders did not consider. In conclusion, given these multiple factors, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately unfeasible.
1306	16139	6	2	1. There were several obstacles to implementing this idea. One such obstacle was ensuring that the mast and the building's frame were robust enough to support a dirigible swaying in the wind. Over @MONEY1 was spent on modifying the building. Additionally, a few floors were added to the building, bringing the total to 102 floors. In conclusion, these challenges had to be overcome for the idea to work.
1307	16140	6	2	"2. According to the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. A primary concern was the safety of the dirigible. Most dirigibles used hydrogen to achieve buoyancy, and hydrogen is a highly flammable gas, as demonstrated by the Hindenburg disaster. If a similar accident were to occur over downtown New York, the consequences would be dire. Moreover, dirigibles typically moored in open fields and required large lead weights for anchoring. These weights would be neither practical nor safe when suspended above people, and a small mooring on top of a building is not an open field. Another obstacle was the sixty - thousand - dollar cost of making the building's frame suitable for mooring dirigibles. As stated, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" Undoubtedly, creating a mooring for dirigibles at the top of the world's tallest building presented a multitude of challenges for the builders."
1308	16141	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, the building was doomed to fail in fulfilling this purpose as the builders overlooked many of its problems. For instance, the Goodyear blimp Columbia attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. In paragraph @NUM2, it is stated that nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. The builders had a significant amount of work to address these problems, but there were simply too many. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building indeed faced multiple obstacles in their efforts to enable dirigible docking.
1309	16142	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. There was insufficient space, and aircraft were not permitted near the city. These factors made it extremely difficult for the builders to achieve their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1310	16143	6	2	5. Even though a substantial investment of sixty thousand dollars was required for this project to materialize, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous other obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most significant obstacle was the safety of the public. Having a dirigible dangling nearly @NUM1 feet above the ground, with the risk of explosion and pedestrians below, was not a prudent idea. Another issue was the stress that a dirigible, held by only a single cable, would impose on the building's frame. With the wind causing the dirigible to move around, the load and pressure would be transmitted all the way to the building's base, approximately @NUM1 feet below. To make this work, the builders would have to reinforce the building's steel frame. Perhaps the most challenging obstacle was nature itself. Strong wind currents above the building would cause the dirigible to swing once docked and also risk it being blown off - course into another building. Additionally, they should have checked the laws beforehand, as aircraft were not allowed to fly at such low altitudes over urban areas. In summary, the builders of the landing dock and the Empire State Building faced an overwhelming number of obstacles.
1311	16144	6	2	1. According to the excerpt, the challenges the Empire State Building's builders encountered when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there mainly stemmed from the perils of strong winds at that altitude. These winds could cause the aircraft to crash into the building or to the ground. For instance, two blimps attempted docking; one couldn't approach the building due to the winds, while the other managed to deliver a bundle of newspapers via a hoisted rope. In summary, the primary issue was the instability of the aircraft during docking.
1312	16145	6	2	"2. The Empire State Building's builders faced numerous obstacles when attempting to dock dirigibles there. Safety was a major concern as dirigibles were filled with hydrogen. As stated, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (∂ @NUM1). A dirigible catching fire in New York could result in many casualties. Nature also posed an obstacle, with violent winds on top of the building. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (∂ @NUM2), which was extremely dangerous. Additionally, there was a legal hurdle. There ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (∂ @NUM3). Although the law was violated twice, docking dirigibles at that low height remained illegal. Due to these obstacles, the plan to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building was abandoned."
1313	16146	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. They needed to plan in advance what was required for the docking. This included determining the types of materials needed for the project and how the docking mechanism would function before assembling everything. In conclusion, these pre - planning challenges were the main obstacles they faced.
1314	16147	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous problems related to dirigibles. One issue was creating a suitable docking station at such a great height while ensuring it looked aesthetically pleasing. The most significant problem, however, was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. If something went wrong during docking, the dirigible could catch fire, explode, and crash in a densely populated area. There were also safety and structural issues, such as the need to dangle large lead weights over the streets to weigh down the back of the dirigible. Eventually, these issues were resolved.
1315	16148	6	2	"5. When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, @CAPS1 faced many obstacles. Many of these were straightforward but not acknowledged by @CAPS1. For example, on page three, @CAPS2 @NUM1 and @NUM2 state that it was ""unsafe because the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen,"" which is highly flammable. The German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the flammability of hydrogen. There were also violent air currents and a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Considering all these issues, it was clear that docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was an unfeasible plan."
1316	16149	6	2	1. The construction of the Empire State Building with the intention of enabling dirigibles to dock presented numerous challenges to the builders. One significant safety concern was the proximity of the blimps to the city. As noted, there was fear that the winds, which could blow the blimp into other buildings and cause destruction, worried people. Another major issue was that the blimps were filled with highly flammable gas. If a blimp were to catch fire above the city, it would cause substantial damage to both the blimp and New York City. Additionally, as stated in paragraph nine, there was the problem of the stress the building would endure if a blimp were tied to its top. The entire building would need to be reconstructed to withstand this stress. In fact, almost every part of the building and the blimp would have to be remodeled to ensure the safety of New York City and the dirigible passengers. In conclusion, these multiple challenges made it extremely difficult to make the Empire State Building a viable docking location for dirigibles.
1317	16150	6	2	2. The builders faced two main obstacles. One was nature. As described, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air - currents. The other obstacle was an existing law. This law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. As stated, this law would make it illegal for a ship to be tied up to the building. In conclusion, these obstacles, one from nature and the other from legislation, significantly hindered the builders' plans.
1318	16151	6	2	3. According to Marcia Amidon L¸sted in The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the architect, wanted his masterpiece to have a purpose beyond being a mere showpiece and thus envisioned it as a dock for dirigibles. However, having a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building with a single cable tether would subject the building's frame to excessive stress, ultimately rendering the structure unsafe. To modify the frame and account for wind pressure, over @MONEY1 would need to be raised. Moreover, in the event of an accident similar to the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the densely populated city would be at great risk. While some of these obstacles could potentially be overcome, the obstacle posed by nature itself remained insurmountable. In conclusion, these challenges made it unfeasible for the Empire State Building to serve as an effective dirigible dock.
1319	16152	6	2	4. The idea of a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building was rather far - fetched. The first problem they encountered was that attaching a thousand - foot - long dirigible to the building would place a great strain on the building's framework. As @CAPS1 indicated, they would have to change the entire structure of the building to strengthen its framework. The most significant issue was safety. Dirigibles used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. Also, as the author pointed out, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making the concept of a dirigible dock extremely risky. These problems should have been identified earlier before a large amount of money was spent on building the dock. In conclusion, the impracticality and high - risk nature of the dirigible dock idea made it a poor investment.
1320	16153	6	2	5. When attempting to make the Empire State Building a docking site for dirigibles, the builders confronted many hurdles. Firstly, most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If a dirigible were to catch fire or explode over a densely populated city like New York, many people would face the risk of injury or death. Secondly, the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. These winds would cause the airship to swivel even when tethered to the mooring mast, making boarding impossible and endangering those on board. Thirdly, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Since New York City is an urban area, this law made it impossible for airships to approach the Empire State Building to moor. In conclusion, due to these numerous obstacles, the Empire State Building was never an effective docking place for dirigibles.
1321	16154	6	2	"1. The construction team encountered numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Firstly, if a dirigible were to land on the building, it would impose excessive stress on the building's frame. Modifying the building to accommodate this would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Secondly, the gas within the dirigibles was a concern. Some dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. Given New York's high population density, any mishap could pose a significant safety risk. Additionally, the winds at the building's summit were extremely strong, causing the back of the dirigible to ""swivel around the mooring mast."" Finally, it was ""illegal for a ship to tie up or approach a building."" Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building ultimately failed."
1322	16155	6	2	"2. In Marcia Amidon's ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building confronted numerous obstacles in their efforts to permit dirigibles to dock there. As the author pointed out, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This indicates that the building not only had to be designed to bear its own weight but also that of the dirigible. Moreover, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable tether"" presented a challenge. The engineers had to devise a way to safely dock the dirigible without endangering anyone. In summary, the engineers who designed the Empire State Building had to overcome many difficulties to make dirigible docking possible."
1323	16156	6	2	"3. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock. For instance, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" They couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. Instead, they had to find a way to add the mooring mast without exerting excessive pressure on the building. Additionally, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This required over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications. In the end, ""Architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless - steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a step - back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" The architects put in a great deal of work to make the mooring mast for dirigibles both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" shows the many hurdles architects faced during this process."
1324	16157	6	2	"4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Their main obstacle was the wind currents that dirigibles had to contend with at nearly eleven hundred feet in the air. The harsh winds at the building's top were constantly changing due to air currents. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles couldn't even get close enough to tie up to the mast. As Løsted stated, ""The captain could not even take his hands off the control levers"" for fear that the outer shell would be punctured by the mast. Moreover, if a dirigible was tied to the mast, the unpredictable air currents would cause it to move around the mast. Safety was also a major concern. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Løsted). In conclusion, the obstacles the builders faced were too great, making it extremely unsafe and unfeasible to tie dirigibles to the mast of the Empire State Building."
1325	16158	6	2	"5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. The first issue was that blimps couldn't land on a flat surface. So, the builders constructed a ""mooring mast"" to connect blimps to the building via an electrical winch. However, this created new problems. They couldn't simply place the mooring mast on top of the building as it would be unstable. Most importantly, the constantly changing winds made it impossible for the blimp to stay still. Additionally, the fact that foreign blimps used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium posed a significant danger to the public. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of challenges in their attempt to enable blimp docking."
1326	16159	6	2	1. When constructing the Empire State Building with the intention of allowing dirigibles to dock there, the builders encountered numerous obstacles. One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area, as noted in paragraph six. Additionally, most dirigibles from outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, as stated in paragraph @NUM1. Nature also posed a significant challenge, as the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Moreover, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach the area. In conclusion, these were among the many obstacles that dirigibles had to face when attempting to dock at the Empire State Building.
1327	16160	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building overestimated their capabilities when constructing a mooring mast. Firstly, a thousand - foot long dirigible would exert a tremendous amount of stress on the building's frame, and @MONEY1 worth of modifications were required. Safety was a major concern. In 1937, the crash of the Hindenburg made the building's owners realize the potential disaster if a zeppelin crashed over densely - populated New York. There was also an existing law forbidding airships from flying too low over urban areas. The natural conditions further undermined the mooring mast idea. The winds on top of the building were always shifting due to violent air currents; even the captain of the U.S. Navy ship Los Angeles could not land the dirigible. At this point, it became clear that the mooring mast idea was unworkable. With the arrival of airplanes, the future of aviation, dirigibles were abandoned.
1328	16161	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles while trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the top. The first was modifying the building's frame to handle the stress from the mooring mast. The load of the dirigible and wind pressure needed to be transferred to the foundation, 1100 feet below. Altering the frame cost over sixty thousand dollars, making it an expensive endeavor. Another obstacle was the hydrogen used in dirigibles. Most non - U.S. dirigibles used this highly flammable gas. A fire in a dirigible above a densely populated area like downtown New York would have catastrophic consequences. Nature was also a hindrance. The winds at the top of the building constantly changed due to violent air currents, causing the dirigible to spin around the mast. Using lead weights, as done in open landing fields, was impractical above street pedestrians. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to approach the mast. In conclusion, these obstacles made it impractical for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building's mooring mast.
1329	16162	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many hurdles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The hydrogen in dirigibles was highly flammable. Most dirigibles at that time used hydrogen instead of helium, and the risk of a fire above a densely populated city like New York was too great. Nature also presented a significant problem. The air currents at the top of the building were strong and constantly shifting, making it extremely risky to dangle a dirigible from that height. Moreover, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to approach the mast. With all these obstacles, the dream of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building remained just that - a dream.
1330	16163	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building had several problems when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One issue was designing the building to withstand the stress of a thousand - foot dirigible swinging in the wind. They needed to find a way to distribute the wind pressure to the foundation. The strong winds around the building were another problem. When the navy attempted to dock a dirigible, the strong winds kept tossing it about, and this problem was never resolved. A third problem was finding a way to dock the dirigible, which was quickly solved with a winch. Finally, dirigibles were dangerous and could not be safely docked, and there was a law preventing them from flying close to buildings, created for this very reason. In conclusion, these problems made it difficult for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
1331	16164	6	2	1. During this era, dirigibles were regarded as the future of transportation, and it was widely considered a plausible notion. Nevertheless, there were underlying problems that went unnoticed. For instance, although dirigibles were touted as the next big thing in transportation, there was no evidence to back this claim. People invested all their time, effort, and resources in constructing dirigibles for a purpose that ultimately proved unfeasible. Other issues were also overlooked, such as the wind speed at high altitudes. Even if a dirigible could approach the mast, it would require someone to stand on the very top to tie it down, which was an extremely difficult task for a single individual. As the excerpt indicates, Al Smith and his architects rushed into this project with insufficient information, leading to an ultimately unsuccessful endeavor.
1332	16165	6	2	"2. In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, two architects engaged in a sort of ""battleship"" - like competition with their dirigibles, vying for the greatest height. However, when constructing these ""enormously steel - framed balloons"", the architects failed to anticipate the numerous obstacles they would encounter. The most significant concern was safety. Since most dirigibles were made with hydrogen, they were highly flammable. The architects warned that the consequences could be even more disastrous than the 1937 incident in New Jersey, where the German Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. Additionally, nature presented the most challenging obstacle to the use of the mast. The strong winds made the masts clang above people, rendering their use neither practical nor safe. In conclusion, these unforeseen challenges made the use of dirigibles in this context highly problematic."
1333	16166	6	2	"3. In the pursuit of enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the architects and builders encountered multiple issues. One evident problem was related to the composition of the dirigibles. At that time, they were filled with hydrogen, which, while allowing for lower density, was extremely flammable. The 1937 crash of the famous dirigible ""Hindenburg"" demonstrated this danger. If a dirigible caught fire while docking at the Empire State Building, it would likely crash onto the civilians below. Another point of concern for the architects was the high winds at the approximately 1,250 - foot altitude of the mooring mast. These winds could cause a lack of stability for the dirigible, placing additional stress on the building. Moreover, the winds could cause the dirigible to crash into other buildings, puncturing the fabric containing the hydrogen gas and leading to a crash. In the end, the project was considered too risky to continue, and the plan for dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was abandoned."
1334	16167	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, they were uncertain whether the building's structure could withstand a swaying dirigible, as mentioned in a previous paragraph. Additionally, since the dirigible would be attached to the mast by a single cable, air currents would cause the back of the ship to rotate around the mooring mast, as stated elsewhere. There was also a law enforcement measure against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building. These issues collectively presented significant challenges to the builders' plans, ultimately making the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building a difficult one to achieve.
1335	16168	6	2	5. The Empire State Building was designed to be the world's tallest building. Al Smith aimed to make it taller than the new Chrysler Building. However, when a @NUM1 - foot tall spire was added to another building, the Empire State Building was initially set to come in second. To overcome this hurdle, Smith decided to modify the tower's design by adding a mooring mast for dirigibles. By using the tower as an anchor for dirigible balloons or zeppelins, he added another 250 feet to the structure. But to proceed with the plan, Smith had to address the challenge of supporting a floating blimp more than @NUM2 feet above the ground. He had the entire building frame modified and strengthened before the building's completion. Unfortunately, Smith faced a final obstacle beyond his control: the weather. The strong winds at the top of the building were too severe, forcing the abandonment of the dirigible idea. Despite this setback, Al Smith's tower still managed to become the world's tallest building.
1336	16169	6	2	1. During the construction of the Empire State Building, contractors encountered several obstacles in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock on it. Safety was a significant concern. On May 6, 1937, when the German dirigible Hindenburg caught fire and was destroyed in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the building's owners recognized that the consequences would have been far more severe if such an accident had occurred over a densely - populated area like downtown New York. Although a balloon and a dirigible may look similar, their structures are completely different. A balloon rises due to helium, while a dirigible uses highly flammable hydrogen for flight. Additionally, there was an existing air - trafficking law. Dirigibles could not get close enough to tie up because of strong winds. There was a fear that the wind might blow the dirigibles onto the sharp spires of nearby buildings, puncturing their shells. If a dirigible were punctured, it could collapse onto the streets of New York, causing massive destruction. These are some of the many obstacles that stood in the way of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building.
1337	16170	6	2	2. When constructing the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous challenges. They built a rocket - shaped mast so that dirigibles could be housed in the shaft, and the shaft was equipped with elevators to allow people to reach the lobby. After this addition, the building had 102 floors, with a glassed observation room located on the 101st floor. Despite the obstacles faced during construction, the building was completed with these features, which were part of the original vision for the structure.
1338	16171	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when attempting to make it possible for dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a major concern. Many non - US dirigibles were filled with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and if a fire were to occur over New York City, the consequences would be catastrophic. Nature also posed an obstacle. Due to the building's height, wind became a significant factor. Wind currents were constantly changing, and if a dirigible were attached to the building, it would be unsafe. The wind pressure and the weight of the dirigible would need to be transferred to the building's foundation, which would require strengthening the building's frame. There was also a legal obstacle. A law prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to tie a dirigible to the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the builders had to confront a variety of challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1339	16172	6	2	4. At first glance, the mooring mast on the Empire State Building seemed like an excellent idea. A landing dock for dirigibles would have revolutionized travel. However, architect Al Smith overestimated what could be achieved. The fate of the Hindenburg worried the building's owners. They realized that if the Hindenburg accident had happened over a densely populated area like downtown New York, the outcome would have been far worse. Another problem was the existing law that prohibits airships from flying too low in urban areas. As stated, this law would make it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach the area. The most significant issue, though, was nature. The winds on top of the building were too strong and unpredictable. Even if a dirigible was tethered, its back end would spin around the mooring mast. In summary, what initially seemed like a great idea ultimately failed to materialize due to these insurmountable challenges.
1340	16173	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building hoped to transform the building into a docking site for dirigibles, but they faced several obstacles. Initially, the plan of having a mast on the building seemed well - thought - out and close to becoming a reality. However, as the project advanced, many details were overlooked. When it came time for the dirigibles to operate, the plan proved unfeasible. Safety was a major issue for non - US dirigibles as they contained the flammable gas hydrogen. The risk of an accident in a highly populated area was a significant concern. Nature also presented a problem. The winds on top of the building had violent and constantly shifting currents. These winds would cause the dirigibles to spin around the building by their back ends, making it unsafe for passengers and cargo. The most significant obstacle was the existing law against flying too low over urban areas. If a dirigible were to dock at the Empire State Building, it would be breaking this law. In conclusion, these obstacles made it impossible for the Empire State Building to serve as a docking site for dirigibles.
1341	16174	6	2	1. From the start, the concept of docking dirigibles was fraught with multiple obstacles. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the presence of such a volatile object over populated areas became a far greater threat than a luxury. The craft required lead weights for support, which could not be supplied and would also pose a hazard. Due to the nature of the Empire State Building, the necessary modifications were troublesome and added unnecessary complexity. The winds at that altitude would also cause docking problems and instability. Eventually, the airplane surpassed the blimp as it could travel faster and accommodate at least the same number of people in a smaller space. Blimps became dangerous and cumbersome, failing to bring the benefits to New York that Al Smith had envisioned.
1342	16175	6	2	"2. According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced two main obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock: nature and the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The most significant obstacle was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air - currents, and the forceful winds would cause the back of the dirigible to spin it around. Additionally, using lead weights in the Empire State Building would mean they would dangle high above the people on the streets below, which was unsafe. The second obstacle was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to fly over the building. In conclusion, these obstacles made it extremely difficult for the builders to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1343	16176	6	2	3. The Empire State Building was constructed with great potential but would never fully realize it. Initially, it was planned to reach @NUM1 feet, just inches taller than the Chrysler Building. However, the architect of the @CAPS1 Building secretly added a 46 - foot pole on top. Naturally, the Empire State Building had to be taller, and on December 11, 1929, it reached 1,250 feet. Al Smith, the @CAPS2 of New York and an architect, decided to add a mooring mast for zeppelins on top, thinking of it as a finishing touch. Unfortunately, this plan was doomed to fail. The foundation was not stable enough for zeppelins. They could easily be blown out of control and crash into the sharp tip of the building. Moreover, since zeppelins contained hydrogen, they could explode and fall onto the densely populated @LOCATION1. In summary, the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a recipe for disaster.
1344	16177	6	2	4. The builders faced numerous obstacles while trying to allow the docking of dirigibles. One major hurdle was the need to spend over sixty thousand dollars on modifications to the building's framework. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, nearly a hundred feet below. Consequently, the entire building's frame had to be altered to adapt to this new situation. After these modifications, more obstacles emerged. When the building was framed up to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could begin. As paragraph @NUM2 mentioned, the mast also required a steel skeleton. In conclusion, the process of enabling dirigible docking was fraught with challenges.
1345	16178	6	2	5. It is evident that there were significant problems in attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. Firstly, the law against flying airships too low over the building made it difficult to carry out docking operations. Secondly, dirigibles that used hydrogen instead of helium were considered unsafe as hydrogen is flammable. The destruction of the German dirigible by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, was a wake - up call. The owners of the Empire State Building realized that the consequences would have been far more severe if such an accident had occurred over a densely populated area like downtown New York City. Finally, the idea of using lead weights to hold the dirigibles down was deemed neither practical nor safe. In conclusion, the problems associated with docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building were clear, and for the safety of New York's residents, as well as architects, engineers, and aviation pioneers, it was a wise decision not to pursue this endeavor.
1346	16179	6	2	1. The builders encountered numerous challenges when considering allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Firstly, installing a mooring mast would impose additional stress on the building's frame. The weight of the dirigibles and wind pressure would transfer to the building's foundation. Violent air - current - induced shifting winds made the situation worse. Even if dirigibles were tethered to the mast, their rear ends would swivel. Moreover, there was a law restricting airships from flying low in urban areas. Due to these multiple obstacles, it was extremely difficult to make dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a reality.
1347	16180	6	2	2. According to an excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the Empire State Building's builders faced hurdles in attaching a dirigible mooring unit to the building's top. Lusted states that nature was the greatest obstacle to the mast's successful use, as harsh winds could make the mast unstable. A law prohibited dirigibles from flying below a certain altitude, which was higher than the building's height. Safety was also a concern, as some blimps are filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and a blimp fire over a densely - populated area would be devastating. Despite being an ingenious idea, the mooring mast had too many obstacles to be feasible.
1348	16181	6	2	3. Based on the excerpt, safety was a major obstacle for the Empire State Building's builders in enabling dirigible docking. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. The destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, made the building's owners realize how much more catastrophic such an accident could be over a densely populated area like downtown New York. Nature was the greatest obstacle to using the mooring mast. When dirigibles were tethered, their backs would swivel around the mast. Dirigibles moored in open fields could be weighted down, but this was not possible at the building. Additionally, an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or approach the area. In conclusion, these obstacles made dirigible docking at the Empire State Building unworkable.
1349	16182	6	2	4. The Empire State Building's builders faced multiple obstacles, with safety and nature being the two main ones. They should have recognized the lack of safety in the idea before construction. Most foreign dirigibles use highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, and an accident over densely populated New York would have severe consequences. Nature was the biggest hurdle, as violent air currents at the building's top caused constantly shifting winds, making the back of the dirigible swivel around the mooring mast. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal to tie a dirigible to the building. Overall, these obstacles made the plan unfeasible.
1350	16183	6	2	5. In the excerpt “The mooring mast” by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the Empire State Building's builders aimed to construct a moor on the building's top for dirigibles to dock but were unsuccessful. One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area, without which the dock couldn't function. Safety was a major concern, as most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, which could easily cause fires and harm innocent people. Nature was another factor, as wind could start a fire. An existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, as dirigibles could endanger people. With so many obstacles, the plan to enable dirigible docking at the Empire State Building ultimately failed.
1351	16184	6	2	1. The construction team of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. For instance, an individual attempted a publicity - seeking act by tying up and delivering a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. However, the equipment for workers to receive the bundle was never installed. As a result, workers had to catch the newspaper bundle from a rope hanging from the blimp, which put them in great danger. Moreover, the strong winds at the building's top posed a significant risk of workers falling or even losing their lives. In conclusion, these difficulties made it extremely challenging for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1352	16185	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building confronted significant issues when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. There were three major factors that made docking dirigibles at the building difficult: the contents of the dirigibles, the wind conditions around New York, and a newly - passed law on airship restrictions. Unlike balloons filled with helium, dirigibles are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Given New York's high population density, a fire on a dirigible could have had catastrophic consequences. The high and constantly - shifting winds in New York were another problem. The idea of using lead to tie down the dirigibles was unfeasible because a falling lead weight could injure many people. Additionally, a new law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. If strictly enforced, this law would prevent dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building as it might be too close to the city. In conclusion, the architects did not fully anticipate these many obstacles before construction.
1353	16186	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles while trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. They were in a competition to build the world's tallest building, which made them rush and strive hard for this goal. The architects had to figure out how to construct the mast. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were needed for the building's framework. They had to reinforce the framework so that the wind would not affect the rest of the building. The stress from the dirigibles' load and wind pressure had to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation. Moreover, the builders and architects had to face the harsh reality. Dirigibles are highly flammable, and an accident in the city could be disastrous. Also, many laws restricted airships from flying low in urban areas. In conclusion, the builders encountered numerous problems during the process of constructing the tallest building.
1354	16187	6	2	4. Initially, the main goal was to build the tallest building in the world. But this objective shifted to creating a mooring mast that would allow blimps to land, drop - off and pick up passengers, and refuel. Renovations worth a thousand dollars were carried out to strengthen the tower's structure. However, they were unable to make the foundations strong enough to support the weight of a [NUM2] - foot ship along with its cargo. In conclusion, the inability to reinforce the foundation sufficiently was a major setback in achieving the goal of having blimps dock at the building.
1355	16188	6	2	"5. In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many hurdles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. As stated in paragraph nine, ""The stress of the dirigibles load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This was the most significant obstacle the builders had to overcome. The builders came up with a plan. Instead of building a plain, utilitarian mast, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless - steel tower. It would be illuminated from the inside and had a stepped - back design that mimicked the building's overall shape. Although the mast was completed, due to natural factors and a new law, no dirigibles have ever docked at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, despite the efforts in mast design and construction, external factors have prevented dirigibles from docking at the building."
1356	16189	6	2	"1. The plan to build a mooring mast presented several construction challenges for the builder. Structurally, a single - tied dirigible would exert significant stress on the building. The combined load of the dirigible and wind pressure would transfer this stress all the way to the building's foundation. Safety was another concern. Many non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Recalling the ""Hindenburg"" incident, the owners were aware of the potential danger it could pose to downtown New York. Nature also posed an obstacle; the shifting winds at the building's top meant that even when tied, a dirigible could swivel around the mast. Due to these numerous obstacles, the mooring mast was not fully constructed for its intended purpose, and blimps became less commonly used."
1357	16190	6	2	"2. When attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders encountered multiple obstacles, including the building frame's strength, natural elements, and existing laws. The strength of the base was a major issue. As described, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Nature also presented a challenge. Violent air currents caused the winds at the top of the Empire State Building to change constantly. A tethered dirigible could wrap around the mooring mast in these unpredictable winds, and workers couldn't risk it falling onto the thousands of pedestrians below. Additionally, there was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. These obstacles were insurmountable, and the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was never built."
1358	16191	6	2	"3. The Empire State Building is an iconic symbol of the United States. After the destruction of the World Trade Center, it became the tallest building in the city. While many recognize its famous spire, few know its intended purpose: to serve as a mooring dock for dirigibles, or zeppelins, which were steel - lined balloons with propellers for steering. Unfortunately, this plan never materialized. According to ""The Mooring Mast,"" environmental and safety conditions were too unfavorable. High - altitude wind currents are strong, and tethering a blimp to the top would place a significant strain on the building frame, which would be time - consuming and costly to repair. Moreover, there was no practical way to weigh down the balloon without endangering civilians. Additionally, it was illegal for airships to fly at low altitudes over urban areas. In conclusion, the idea of using the spire as a mooring dock was unfeasible."
1359	16192	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the Hindenburg disaster in New Jersey, where the dirigible burst into flames, highlighted the extreme danger. If such an incident were to occur over a densely populated area like New York, the consequences would be far more catastrophic. Given these risks, it was clear that enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building would be extremely challenging and potentially disastrous.
1360	16193	6	2	5. Construction projects often come with obstacles, and the construction of the Empire State Building with the aim of allowing dirigibles to dock was no exception. One major obstacle was the high flammability of dirigibles. The destruction of a German dirigible by fire in New Jersey demonstrated the potential danger. In a more densely populated area like New York, the consequences of a similar incident would have been far worse. The power of nature was the most significant hurdle. Violent air currents led to constantly shifting winds, causing a tethered dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Finally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas such as New York. Faced with these insurmountable obstacles, the builders concluded that mooring a dirigible to the mast on top of the Empire State Building was not a viable option.
1361	16194	6	2	"1. In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the endeavor of constructing a mooring mast on the 1,250 - foot - tall Empire State Building is explored. In the 1930s, Governor Al Smith envisioned equipping the Empire State Building with a landing dock for dirigibles. During the construction process, builders encountered numerous challenges while trying to enable dirigibles to dock on the building. Firstly, installing the mast on the building's top was a hurdle. Architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof as it would exert excessive stress on the building. This problem was resolved by spending over $100,000 on a steel frame to support the mast. Nevertheless, most of the builders' issues remained insurmountable. Safety was a significant concern, as most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. A fire over a densely populated area would be catastrophic. Additionally, dirigibles would be too high to be properly tied down. Moreover, having dirigibles land there would violate an existing law. Due to these numerous obstacles, the builders were ultimately unable to make the mooring mast fully functional."
1362	16195	6	2	"2. In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building aimed to allow dirigibles to land there but faced several obstacles. Safety was a prime concern, especially since many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance. After the Hindenburg crash, there was heightened caution about a similar incident occurring over a densely populated area. Nature also presented an insurmountable obstacle, with strong winds making it difficult to tie up dirigibles and release passengers. Although lead weights were used to land dirigibles in open areas during bad weather, the builders didn't employ them to avoid the risk of something falling and hitting someone. On top of these, there was a practical problem: a law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal to have a dirigible tied up on the Empire State Building close to the ground. In conclusion, despite the builders' efforts to overcome these obstacles, the mooring mast did not work as planned, but their attempt shows their consideration of the concept."
1363	16196	6	2	"3. Driven by the competitive spirit of Al Smith, the governor of New York, he and his architects decided to build a docking site for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. Instead of being daunted by the challenges ahead, they saw it as an opportunity to become the symbol of modern travel. When planning to construct the mooring on the building, the architects were aware of the multiple obstacles they would face. The first was adjusting the building's frame to support the docking site. They knew the building ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"". They managed to overcome this, but many more challenges awaited. Wind and weather also had to be considered, as ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"". Reluctantly, the builders acknowledged the obstacle posed by nature. They began to realize the unrealistic nature of their dream. Two more obstacles emerged, which would end the hope of the mooring dock. Having a floating dirigible above a densely populated city was extremely dangerous, especially considering that hydrogen, commonly used in dirigibles, was highly flammable and a fire would harm both the building and the city. The final obstacle was the law; they found that ""there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". With so many insurmountable obstacles, the impossibility of the plan became clear. The builders gave up, but the moorings on the Empire State Building still stand as a reminder of what could have been."
1364	16197	6	2	4. The Empire State Building was constructed to compete with the Chrysler Building, and to gain an edge, a mooring mast was created. However, dirigibles faced several restrictions when it came to using this mast. Nature was a major factor, as the wind conditions on top of the building changed drastically. Additionally, some dirigibles contained a large amount of highly flammable hydrogen. Another significant restriction was the law; it was illegal for aircraft to fly low over urban areas. These complications collectively limited the ability of dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, despite the intention to create a mooring mast for dirigibles, these various obstacles made it difficult for dirigibles to utilize the facility.
1365	16198	6	2	"5. In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the challenges of building a mooring mast on the 1,250 - foot - tall Empire State Building are discussed. In the 1930s, Governor Al Smith proposed equipping the Empire State Building with a landing dock for dirigibles. During the construction, the builders faced multiple obstacles. The first was installing the mast on the building. Architects couldn't simply place the mast on the flat roof as it would stress the building. This was resolved by spending over $100,000 on a steel frame. However, most problems remained unsolved. Safety was a major issue, as many dirigibles used flammable hydrogen instead of helium. A fire over a densely populated area would be disastrous. Also, dirigibles were too high to be properly secured. Moreover, landing dirigibles there would violate an existing law. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the builders were unable to make the mooring mast a practical success."
1366	16199	6	2	"1. In the early @DATE1, a period marked by a collective pursuit of innovation and the construction of remarkable structures, two tycoons in @CAPS1 engaged in a competition to erect the world's tallest building. Al Smith, the mastermind behind the Empire State Building, conceived an innovative idea to enhance the building's height and popularity: installing a mooring mast for dirigibles on its summit. Despite its ingenuity, this concept presented numerous unforeseen challenges for the architects. Firstly, attaching a mooring mast to the Empire State Building without altering the entire design was highly impractical. As noted in (@CAPS2 @NUM1), the steel frame of the building would need to be modified and strengthened to withstand the additional stress, which could be transmitted all the way to the foundation. Moreover, the dirigible's weight and wind pressure would exert significant stress on the building's base. Nature also emerged as a formidable obstacle. According to (@CAPS2 @NUM3), ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" In conclusion, despite their best efforts, the architects faced insurmountable challenges in constructing the mast, and unfortunately, their endeavors did not yield the desired results."
1367	16200	6	2	2. The builder of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the structure. Government officials in Washington were contemplating a safe method for mooring airships to the mast. However, the fear of accidents prevented dirigibles from reaching the top. The wind on the building's summit was constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Additionally, considering the building's weight and the fact that the dirigible would dangle high above pedestrians on the street, it was neither practical nor safe to dock dirigibles there. Moreover, there were laws prohibiting low - flying over urban areas, let alone tying up to a building. In summary, these multiple factors combined to make the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building an unfeasible and dangerous proposition.
1368	16201	6	2	"3. To enable the docking of dirigibles, the builders would confront a multitude of serious problems related to the building's structure, its location within a city, and natural forces. The building frame was initially too weak to be tied to a dirigible. As stated, this would add stress to the frame, which could be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Consequently, the builders would need to spend over sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the frame. Another significant issue was the building's location in a city. Laws prohibited flying too low over urban areas, let alone tying up to a building, forcing the builders to devise a novel docking method. Lastly, ""violent air currents"" presented additional challenges. The builders had to construct mooring equipment capable of withstanding the forces of nature. In conclusion, implementing this plan would impose numerous difficulties on the builders, making it a complex and costly endeavor."
1369	16202	6	2	4. From the very beginning, the Empire State Building presented significant architectural challenges, particularly in the construction of a mooring mast for dirigibles. Originally, the building was designed for internal use, so adding a mast would place stress on the building's frame and potentially cause damage. The building's location in a densely populated area was another concern. In the event of a malfunction similar to the Hindenburg disaster in 1937, many people on the ground could be at risk. Nature also posed a major problem. The winds on the building's top were constantly shifting and extremely strong, threatening dirigibles with swiveling and flying off during landing. In my opinion, the architects made a significant error in planning the construction of the Empire State Building with a mooring mast. Due to these obvious issues, the building could never fully realize its potential in this regard.
1370	16203	6	2	"5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced a series of obstacles while attempting to create a docking facility for dirigibles. The first hurdle was the construction of the mooring mast. As mentioned in @CAPS1 four, the aviation pioneers' dream was to travel by dirigible, and the Empire State Building was intended to have a mooring mast at its peak for these new airships. However, the building's frame was not strong enough, necessitating modifications. As stated in @CAPS1 nine, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Wind was another major obstacle that halted the use of the mooring mast. In @CAPS1 fifteen, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mast but could not dock due to strong winds. Safety was also a concern. As described in @CAPS1 @NUM1, most dirigibles from outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. In conclusion, the builders faced both fixable and unfixable problems in their attempt to create a docking facility for dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
1371	16204	6	2	1. The builders encountered several problems during the construction. Weather conditions were an issue, specifically the violent winds caused by changing wind currents. There was also the legal constraint regarding the proximity of an aircraft to a building. Additionally, the building needed to be robust enough to secure a blimp, which required strengthening its skeleton, and this was successfully accomplished. Another concern was that some foreign blimps were filled with hydrogen, making them highly flammable, while others used helium. A hydrogen - filled blimp catching fire could endanger pedestrians below. These were the challenges the builders had to face.
1372	16205	6	2	2. When the builders were making provisions for dirigibles to dock, they faced multiple obstacles. One significant problem was the lack of a suitable landing area. Another major hurdle was nature. The air currents were in a constant state of shift, which led to the back of the dirigibles constantly moving. In conclusion, these difficulties posed substantial challenges for the builders in facilitating dirigible docking.
1373	16206	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building enabled dirigibles to dock on the building's top. This addition significantly increased the building's stature. Initially, it lost its status as the biggest building but regained it by creating a docking facility for dirigibles (blimps). In essence, the dirigible dock played a crucial role in the building's standing in terms of size.
1374	16207	6	2	4. As described in The Mooring Mask by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the Empire State Building's builders encountered difficulties when attempting to dock dirigibles. Dirigibles presented a safety risk; most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. A fire on a docked dirigible in a densely populated area could have led to numerous casualties. Nature also posed a problem; the winds on the building's top were constantly changing due to violent air currents, causing the back of the dirigible to swivel and making it unsafe. Despite their efforts, the builders were unable to dock a dirigible at the Empire State Building due to these many obstacles.
1375	16208	6	2	5. During the construction of the mast for docking and refueling dirigibles, the builders and architect faced numerous daunting problems. Placing a simple mooring mast on the Empire State Building's roof was not feasible. The mast, combined with the immense wind power, would exert excessive stress on the building's framework and potentially cause a collapse. Moreover, most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, unlike helium. There was also a law restricting airships from flying too low over urban areas. The constantly shifting wind due to violent air currents was another major obstacle. Even when dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back end would swivel with the wind. Ultimately, these issues made the task of building a functional dirigible docking mast extremely challenging.
1376	16209	6	2	1. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the additional stress the dirigible would impose on the building. Modifications costing over sixty thousand dollars had to be made to the building's framework. Moreover, most dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable and dangerous gas. Another peril was that the large dirigible would be hanging high above pedestrians, unlike its usual and safer landings in open fields. Lastly, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, which also presented docking challenges. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building could not be realized.
1377	16210	6	2	2. Safety was the most significant obstacle. Foreign dirigibles used hydrogen gas to fly, but hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building were concerned because of the fate of the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, over Lakehurst. The Hindenburg burst into flames, and within less than a minute, only charred scrap metal remained. If such an incident were to occur in a densely populated area like downtown New York City, it would result in a large number of casualties and fatalities. Given these risks, it was clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not a viable option.
1378	16211	6	2	"3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, stemming from ""nature itself"" and past problems. Safety was a major concern. After the fire in Lakehurst, the builders were worried about potential issues, especially if a similar incident were to happen in downtown New York. ""Nature itself"" also posed an obstacle. With the mooring mast on top of the building, the violent air - currents frightened the builders. Additionally, there was a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, making it illegal for an airship to be tied to a building. These three main obstacles - ""nature itself,"" a past accident, and the law - were too formidable for the builders, and unfortunately, they were unable to continue their work."
1379	16212	6	2	4. Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a novel concept but could not proceed due to several obstacles. The builders faced issues related to safety, harnessing nature, and the law. Safety issues included the risk of fire, as an incident had occurred, and the builders recognized how much worse it could have been. Keeping the blimps stabilized was another safety concern, which would have required free - hanging weights over the city. The power of nature was also a significant obstacle; it was nearly impossible to keep the dirigible in place due to the wind, causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. The law was also against the idea because of the low altitude of the blimp. As stated, it would be illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building presented too many challenges, and despite the potential for new travel options, there were too many safety violations for the project to be worthwhile.
1380	16213	6	2	"5. When attempting to build a mooring dock on top of the Empire State Building, the builders had to overcome several problems. The winds in New York City were too strong for dirigibles to fly in, as one driver noted that the captain could not take his hands off the control levers. It was also illegal for a dirigible to be so close to buildings for fear of crashing into the ""sharp spires of other buildings in the area."" To prevent the dirigible from swinging violently, large lead weights would have been needed, but this was not practical over New York. In conclusion, the difficulties associated with docking a dirigible at the Empire State Building were insurmountable, and the project was never completed."
1381	16214	6	2	1. During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous obstacles. They were in competition with the Chrysler Building regarding height. Al Smith, the constructor of the Empire State Building, aimed to build the tallest and most famous building in the world. He made the building appear invincible and even installed a mooring mast on it to allow things to land. However, the mooring mast was only for publicity purposes and was never intended to serve its supposed function. Without the mooring mast, the building might not have gained popularity. Al Smith's efforts were instrumental in shaping the building into what it is today, and it still stands in New York City.
1382	16215	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to land there. One significant issue was the weight of the zeppelin. When tied to the building, it would exert immense pressure on the framework, which could even reach the foundation. Reworking the framework to ensure safety would have cost @MONEY1. Another obstacle was public expectations. The building was expected to revolutionize travel while being a beautiful and magnificent structure. The pressure to build the world's tallest tower was intense. These expectations were unrealistic as most people were unaware of the associated safety risks. In conclusion, these challenges made it difficult to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to land at the Empire State Building.
1383	16216	6	2	"3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced arduous tasks. They had to design the plan for the mooring mast, taking into account the thousand - foot dirigible that would moor at the building's top. They needed to consider wind pressure and the load of the dirigible, coming up with brilliant ideas such as a ""shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower"" (@CAPS1 paragraph @NUM1) on top of the building. Additionally, they had to design and construct elevators and stairs to transport dirigible passengers from the 102nd floor to the 86th floor, where baggage and tickets were handled. The builders had a tough job as they not only had to devise ideas for building the mooring mast but also figure out how to facilitate the movement of passengers in and out of the dirigible. Throughout the construction process, they continuously faced obstacles. In the end, their efforts were crucial in bringing the building closer to completion despite the difficulties."
1384	16217	6	2	"4. When the Empire State Building was under construction, it was designed to be the world's tallest building. However, this was no easy feat. The workers had to overcome a particularly difficult obstacle: enabling @CAPS1 dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. The plan was to build a mooring mast on top of the building to allow for dirigible docking. If successful, it was said that the Empire State Building would be ""equipped for an age of transportation."" Nevertheless, many problems arose. The architects were aware that the weight of the dirigibles would stress the building's frame, so the workers had to modify and strengthen the framework. They also built the mast using strong, shiny chrome - nickel. Another challenge emerged when considering the mast. The original framework stopped at the 85th floor, so the workers had to finish the roof before framing the mast. Although they managed to create a safe mast, the ""Aviation Pioneers Dream"" never materialized. In conclusion, despite their efforts, the goal of regular dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was not achieved."
1385	16218	6	2	"5. Al Smith recognized an opportunity for his Empire State Building. He proposed adding a mooring mast to the top to allow dirigibles to anchor for refueling, servicing, and passenger boarding and disembarking. To make this possible, the steel frame of the Empire State Building needed to be ""modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. The builders had to construct a 102 - floor building, create a glassed - in observation area and an open observation platform, finish the roof, and then build a steel mast with glass windows. After investing so much time and money in re - engineering the building, dirigibles were unable to dock there. The strong winds made the back of the ship constantly move, and there was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. In the end, it became clear that the endeavor was not worth the cost and effort."
1386	16219	6	2	"1. The Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. One significant hurdle was the stress on the building's frame. A dirigible moored at the top of the building, held only by a tether, would place excessive stress on the structure. As stated in paragraph nine, ""the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the framework."" Another complication was nature. Strong and constantly shifting winds above the city, caused by air currents, made docking impossible. Additionally, the law was against the mooring mast. Paragraph fifteen mentions ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which made it illegal for an airship to tie up at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these multiple factors combined to prevent dirigibles from successfully docking at the Empire State Building."
1387	16220	6	2	"2. The Empire State Building faced many challenges regarding dirigibles landing on it. As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This was one of the major issues. In paragraph @NUM2, it was realized that the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was ill - conceived as it wouldn't work. The mooring mast was doomed to never fulfill its purpose, and the reasons should have been apparent before construction. Nature was a key factor. As seen in paragraph @NUM3, ""the winds were shifting due to violent air currents."" Since the beginning, when Al Smith added a top to the building, making it 1,250 feet, the mooring mast had problems. It was unsafe for planes, and dirigibles from other countries carried highly flammable hydrogen. The strong winds on top of the building, caused by air currents, also worked against the construction of the mooring mast. In conclusion, these factors led to the mooring mast's lack of success on the Empire State Building."
1388	16221	6	2	3. The architects of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. They could not simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would stress the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. These were the main challenges the builders of the Empire State Building encountered in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock. In conclusion, these structural and engineering difficulties made it extremely challenging to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1389	16222	6	2	4. When the Empire State Building was constructed, the architects had new ideas. However, their vision of making it a dock for blimps was unrealistic. The first challenge was attaching a blimp dock to the building without over - stressing its framework. Without spending sixty thousand dollars on framework strengthening, the added weight could potentially cause the building to collapse. Another obstacle was nature. The strong winds at the top of the Empire State Building made it difficult for blimp pilots to dock safely as the blimps would sway violently. Additionally, there were laws against aircraft flying at such low altitudes. Docking a blimp at the building would require it to fly low, which was illegal. In conclusion, due to these structural, natural, and legal factors, the Empire State Building could not become a blimp dock.
1390	16223	6	2	5. After reading, it is clear that there were numerous difficulties in building a mooring dock atop the Empire State Building. One obvious problem was the structural stability of the entire building. As paraphrased from the passage, the tension from the dirigible pulling on the tether would cause stress on the building's frame. Another issue was the control of the dirigible during docking. The passage explained that the winds above the Empire State Building would shift violently and frequently. Safety was also a major concern, especially after the Hindenburg accident in New Jersey, where a German zeppelin caught fire and exploded. In conclusion, these structural, operational, and safety - related difficulties made it very challenging to build a successful mooring dock on the Empire State Building.
1391	16224	6	2	1. When attempting to enable dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building, the builders encountered multiple hurdles. These included constructing the mast, facilitating dirigibles to dock on the building, and adhering to a law regarding dirigibles. The architects and builders dedicated a significant amount of time to erecting the mooring mast on the building's summit. Dirigibles struggled to find a way to dock, and most attempts ended in failure. There was also a law that prohibited dirigibles from docking in urban areas to prevent issues within the dirigibles. These were the challenges the builders faced while trying to create a mast and allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
1392	16225	6	2	"2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in terms of safety and time. Safety was a major concern when constructing the top part of the building. Due to its great height, it was difficult to lift glass and steel parts to the top. Moreover, if any of these parts were pushed off, they could endanger people below. Another safety issue was dirigibles flying too close to the building and potentially colliding with it. Additionally, a safe way had to be found for passengers to board and disembark from the dirigibles without getting hurt. The time allotted for building the top of the Empire State Building was insufficient. Despite the challenges, the construction continued as one worker said, ""it's on the level, all right. No Kidding. We're working on the thing now."" In conclusion, the safety and time constraints posed significant challenges to the construction of the Empire State Building's top."
1393	16226	6	2	"3. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges in their attempt to facilitate dirigible docking. They faced difficulties during the construction of the mooring mast, having to deal with the building's framework. A major obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area for dirigibles. They not only had to contend with man - made challenges but also those presented by nature. The strong winds at the top of the building made safe landing nearly impossible. As noted, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The constructors realized that to make the dirigible - docking plan feasible, they would have to redo the building's frame as it was not originally designed for dirigible landings. The workers failed to foresee all the potential problems with the mooring mast design. In the end, the challenges were insurmountable, and dirigible landings at the Empire State Building never became a reality."
1394	16227	6	2	"4. To enable dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building, the builders had to overcome tough obstacles. In the 1930s, when they were working on this project, technology was rapidly evolving, and planes had been invented. A statement indicated that ""the as yet unsolved problem of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it Desirable to Postpone to a later date the finel installation of the landing gear."" This shows that technology for safe dirigible landings had been developed, but there was a need to test if the mast would work. It became clear that technology was invented earlier than the builders could construct the mast on top of the Empire State Building. Later, they realized that a dirigible on top of a mast would be unsafe because the wind could blow it around and cause it to crash into the building. In conclusion, the combination of technological development pace and safety concerns made the plan of dirigible landings on the Empire State Building unfeasible from the start."
1395	16228	6	2	5. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock. One challenge was constructing the mooring mast. The single - cable tether used to hold the dirigibles would add stress to the building's frame, forcing the builders to devise a new, stress - free solution. Another concern was passenger safety. Given the building's height, passengers were worried about falling out of the dirigible. Additionally, there was an “existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,” which made it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building. In summary, the builders had to navigate multiple challenges during the construction of the mooring mast, and these obstacles made the goal of dirigible docking a difficult one to achieve.
1396	16229	6	2	1. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple challenges when aiming to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. One significant issue was the need to modify the building's steel frame. As stated, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of alterations were required to the framework. Safety was another major concern. After the German dirigible Hindenburg caught fire, the builders recognized the potential for catastrophic devastation if such an incident occurred over densely - populated New York City. Nature also posed a substantial obstacle. Shifting air currents at the building's summit would render the dirigible unstable, which was extremely dangerous given that it would be hanging above crowded city streets. Additionally, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These obstacles prevented the architects of the Empire State Building from successfully allowing dirigibles to dock there.
1397	16230	6	2	2. When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock at the building, they faced several problems. A large dirigible moored at the top by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible and wind pressure would need to be transferred almost eleven hundred feet down to the building's foundation. This meant that the builders had to modify the Empire State Building's frame to make it strong enough to support the dirigibles, and these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars. As construction advanced, once the framing up to the 85th floor was complete, the roof had to be finished before the framing for the mooring mast could begin. In essence, these construction - related challenges made it difficult to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock.
1398	16231	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, including safety, nature, and the law. Safety was one of the most significant issues. Since blimps need to be lighter than air, they are often filled with helium or hydrogen. Most dirigibles from outside the area used highly flammable hydrogen. If a blimp caught fire while high above the ground, the consequences could be disastrous. Nature also presented an obstacle. Violent air currents that made the building sway could cause the blimp or the building to break if they came into contact. Finally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. So, even if the mooring mast was built, it would be illegal to bring a dirigible close. These obstacles made it extremely difficult for the builders to make the Empire State Building suitable for dirigible docking.
1399	16232	6	2	4. The builders faced numerous obstacles when attempting to dock dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building. The wind was a major issue. Even if the dirigible was tied down, the wind could blow the back end as it pleased, which would affect the building. As the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted nearly eleven hundred feet to the building's foundation, the builders had to make changes to the building, incurring additional costs. Another obstacle was the law. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it impractical to dock dirigibles. These are some of the challenges the architects had to overcome in their attempt to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
1400	16233	6	2	5. Initially, the Empire State Building was not designed for dirigibles to land on its top. The architects had to completely redesign the building's top. However, they failed to install proper landing gear for the dirigibles. On a bad - weather day, it would be extremely difficult to land a dirigible without appropriate landing gear. Given that the dirigible is over @NUM1 feet long, the lack of a large landing surface poses risks to the people in the dirigible, those on the ground, and those assisting with the landing. In conclusion, the absence of proper design and landing gear made it dangerous and difficult to land dirigibles on the Empire State Building.
1401	16234	6	2	1. The construction team of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. One significant issue was the necessity of constructing a mooring mast. Without it, a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the building's top with a single cable tether would impose stress on the building's frame, as stated in paragraph @NUM1. Despite the construction of the mooring mast, it was deemed too unsafe to moor dirigibles from the building. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. The greatest concern was safety, as a fire in a dirigible above a densely populated area would be a disaster. In conclusion, the multitude of obstacles faced by the builders made it unfeasible to moor dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
1402	16235	6	2	2. According to the excerpt, when the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock, they faced several obstacles including safety, existing laws, and air - current changes. Many non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, instead of helium. The owners of the Empire State Building recognized that a fire in a dirigible above a densely populated area would lead to a catastrophic situation. There was also an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Having an airship dangling high above street pedestrians was extremely unsafe. Moreover, the air currents at the top of the building shifted, causing the back of a dirigible tied to the mooring mast to spin around. This was dangerous for both street pedestrians and dirigible passengers. Due to these practical reasons, the idea of using the mooring mast was ultimately abandoned.
1403	16236	6	2	3. The Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles in making it possible for dirigibles and blimps to dock. One obstacle was the need to construct additional floors. This was done to provide a place for people on the dirigibles to load and unload. Another significant challenge was building steel frames from the 85th floor to the 102nd floor, which required over @MONEY1 worth of modifications to the building's framework. In summary, these obstacles made it a complex and costly task to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1404	16237	6	2	"4. Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Firstly, the architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. Doing so would cause stress on the building, necessitating the modification and strengthening of the steel frame. Secondly, safety was a major concern. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. The greatest obstacle, however, was ""nature itself."" The violent air currents at the top of the building caused the winds to shift constantly, making the back of a dirigible tied to the mooring mast spin around. In conclusion, these were the main obstacles that the architects had to deal with."
1405	16238	6	2	5. The Empire State Building presented several problems for dirigible docking. Firstly, a suitable and safe docking site was required. Secondly, the strong winds at the building's height made it almost impossible for a dirigible to remain docked. Finally, dirigibles were extremely flammable, posing a significant hazard to the people below. Given these issues, it was clear that docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was not a practical option.
1406	16239	6	2	1. In “The Mooring Mast,” author Marcia Amidon L¸sted presents the story of the Empire State Building and its mooring mast. Construction of the building demanded significant time and effort from workers, yet the purpose of the mooring mast was not entirely clear to them. There were multiple reasons for the difficulties in allowing dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. For instance, dirigibles were often filled with helium instead of highly - flammable hydrogen. Docking a hydrogen - filled dirigible in downtown New York City would have been a disaster. Additionally, dirigibles were typically moored in open landing fields to be weighted down. As the author notes, using such methods at the Empire State Building, where equipment would dangle above street pedestrians, was neither practical nor safe. These and other factors contributed to the workers' struggles in building the mooring mast.
1407	16240	6	2	2. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock. One major obstacle was nature. The winds on the building's top constantly shifted due to violent air currents, making it difficult for dirigibles to land safely. Another obstacle was a law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas. In conclusion, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was not used for landing airships like dirigibles because it was too dangerous. Instead, it was used for other safe purposes.
1408	16241	6	2	3. Initially, the use of dirigibles seemed like an excellent concept. They appeared to be a new and flawless form of transportation. However, as dirigibles developed, problems emerged. Engineers planned to moor dirigibles to the Empire State Building's mast, but this would have placed excessive stress on the building's frame. Safety was also a significant concern. Most dirigibles used flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Moreover, lead weights were required to hold the dirigible in place during mooring, which was extremely dangerous as they would dangle over pedestrians on the street. Without the lead weights, the dirigible would swivel in the air, potentially puncturing its shell. Finally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to approach the building. Despite high hopes, in the end, the drawbacks of using dirigibles outweighed the benefits.
1409	16242	6	2	4. When architects attempted to build a dirigible destination at the Empire State Building, they faced several problems, including dirigible mishaps and the forces of nature. A dirigible crash would be extremely costly, resulting in loss of life in the densely - populated city. The explosion could also damage buildings around and the Empire State Building itself. To prevent such disasters, the government had enacted a law banning aircraft from flying too close to urban areas. To build the proposed structure, architects would have to break or bend these laws. Another issue was nature. Harsh winds could easily sway a blimp, causing it to puncture on a nearby building. As stated, “Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would still swivel around the mooring mast.” This swiveling could harm nearby buildings and civilians. These problems and laws made it clear that the idea of creating the mast was unfeasible and should have been recognized as such earlier.
1410	16243	6	2	5. The Empire State Building, located in New York, is renowned as the world's tallest building. Al Smith, who oversaw its construction, added a distinctive top, making it stand out among the city's buildings. The building was designed for transportation, specifically for dirigibles or zeppelins, and had a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships. However, the building faced an obstacle: New York lacked a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw the mooring mast as a creative and novel way to transport people to and from the Empire State Building. Unfortunately, the mooring mast's intended purpose was never realized. There was a lack of pre - construction safety consideration. The main reason was that most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which posed a high risk of fire. Nature also presented significant problems. Given the safety issues and the risk of flames in downtown New York, the plan for the mooring mast could not be implemented.
1411	16244	6	2	1. According to the excerpt, the builders faced the obstacle of having to go to the building's base to make it taller. This was the challenge they encountered.
1412	16245	6	2	2. When builders tried to construct a landing dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building's top, numerous obstacles emerged. These included public safety concerns, pre - existing regulations, and unpredictable weather. Most dirigibles use highly flammable hydrogen gas. After the German Hindenburg disaster, it became evident that the public would be at risk if dirigibles caught fire over crowded streets. There were also regulations prohibiting aircraft from flying too low over urban areas, and the proposed landing dock was at a low height. Additionally, the unpredictable weather posed a problem. Pilots were worried that strong winds could blow the tethered dirigibles into other buildings or sharp spires, endangering both the vessel and people below. In conclusion, these many obstacles impeded the construction of the landing dock on the Empire State Building.
1413	16246	6	2	3. Based on the excerpt, the Empire State Building's builders faced significant obstacles in enabling dirigibles to dock there. High wind currents and an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas were the main issues. The powerful wind currents on top of the building were a major deterrent. As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if tethered, the back of the dirigible would spin around the mooring mast. Using lead weights, as done in open fields, was neither practical nor safe above pedestrians. This shows that docking during violent air currents would endanger people. The pre - existing law also prevented dirigibles from docking. It made it illegal for airships to tie up to the building or get too close. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough due to strong winds. The captain was afraid the wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires of other buildings, and the large size of the dirigible made it difficult to maneuver around these obstacles. In conclusion, the builders faced challenging obstacles due to wind currents and the law, making it difficult to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1414	16247	6	2	4. The Empire State Building's builders encountered multiple obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock. The primary hurdle was the lack of a suitable landing area. To allow dirigibles to anchor for several hours, a mooring mast had to be added to the building's top. The architects couldn't simply place a basic mast on the flat roof. Instead, they designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless - steel tower, illuminated from within, rather than a plain utilitarian mast. Once designed, the mooring mast could be completed and put to use. However, nature itself presented the greatest obstacle to its successful use. In conclusion, these were the main challenges the builders faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1415	16248	6	2	"5. After planning and constructing the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, the developers discovered several unforeseen problems. They had not considered the flammability of the gases inside dirigibles. They also forgot about the ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to a building"" (lines @NUM1). Moreover, the strong winds at that high altitude were a significant danger to airships. A collision with a neighboring building could have disastrous consequences. In conclusion, these unforeseen issues complicated the use of the mooring mast for dirigible docking."
1416	16249	6	2	"1. The construction team of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. One issue was the additional stress that mooring a dirigible to the building's top would impose on its frame. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly @NUM2 feet below."" To strengthen the building's frame, the builders had to invest sixty thousand dollars in modifications. Another significant problem was safety. Most non - US dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable. After a German dirigible was destroyed, they recognized the danger of having such a flammable vehicle over a densely populated area. Nature also posed a challenge. Paragraph @NUM3 mentions that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly moving."" This made it difficult to secure the aircraft and keep it stable for passengers to disembark safely. Even a navy pilot was unable to get close enough to tie up due to strong winds. Moreover, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Due to these multiple obstacles, the plan to have dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building was bound to fail."
1417	16250	6	2	"2. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered several hurdles to enable dirigibles to dock. Firstly, they had to redesign the building's top. They made it taller and more suitable for dirigible landings, but there were uncertainties about whether the dirigibles would fit. Secondly, they had to design a mast for the dirigible. This involved creating an additional part, and the builders had to spend sixty thousand dollars on its construction. Thirdly, they built a stainless - steel tower for docking, which was challenging as it featured glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel. Despite going through all these obstacles, in the end, the dirigibles never got the chance to dock. It seems appropriate to say that the builders can ""Take a bow, because it's over now"" as their arduous efforts did not yield the desired result."
1418	16251	6	2	"3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock, including safety concerns, natural factors, and existing laws. The excerpt reveals that many dirigibles use hydrogen, a highly flammable substance. Docking these dirigibles on the Empire State Building is extremely dangerous because an accident could occur, and given New York's high population density, it could harm many people. People's lives should not be put at risk just for the sake of dirigible landings. Another problem was nature. Paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt states that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the dirigible to dangle precariously above New York, and the unpredictable winds could quickly become dangerous. According to the excerpt, this situation was neither practical nor safe. Additionally, the builders overlooked an existing law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas. Thus, it would be illegal to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building. With so many obstacles, it was clear that allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was not meant to be."
1419	16252	6	2	"4. When builders were trying to find a way for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, they faced several obstacles. If a dirigible was held by a single cable, it would add stress to the building's frame. Cabling the dirigible at the top was difficult because of the building's flat roof. Weather was also a major hurdle. As stated in (@CAPS1 @NUM1, line @NUM2), ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind would make the dirigible sway and be unstable. Moreover, the builders had to consider that using the building for docking could be harmful to pedestrians as the dirigibles would be too close to the ground. Planning where these aircraft could land and refuel was a difficult task for the builders, and overall, the challenges made it a complex endeavor."
1420	16253	6	2	"5. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles such as nature, unsafe docking conditions, and pre - existing laws regarding dirigibles. The primary obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. At the top of such a tall building, the wind is constantly changing direction, causing the dirigible to ""swivel around"". Usually, blimps or dirigibles land in open fields and can be weighted down with lead weights, but using this method where they would be hanging high above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. The builders also discovered an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for any airship to dock or tie up to the building. In conclusion, the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was neither safe, practical, nor legal."
1421	16254	6	2	"1. The construction of the Empire State Building required the builders to overcome numerous obstacles to achieve their goal. Standing at @NUM1 feet tall, the building presented several challenges. L¸sted noted, ""The primary hindrance to the effective utilization of the Mooring Mast was nature. The winds atop the building were in a constant state of flux due to powerful air currents."" The high wind speeds at the building's summit were problematic because the Dirigible's tail, being nearly weightless, would sway violently. This could lead to the failure of the support beams or endanger the people below. L¸sted also stated, ""Using these at the Empire State Building, where they would hang high above street - level pedestrians, is neither practical nor safe."" Additionally, there is a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. As L¸sted put it, ""This law makes it illegal for a ship to tie up to a building or even approach the area."" Since it is illegal for the Dirigible to be in the vicinity of the building, the construction of the Mooring Mast is unfeasible."
1422	16255	6	2	"2. The future of transportation has long been a topic of discussion among architects. Whether the plans are grounded in reality is another matter. Al Smith took on the challenge of turning the dream of docking dirigibles into a practical reality. Despite his high hopes for the project, multiple obstacles impeded the construction of the dock. As stated in paragraph fourteen, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" At the time, wind power was not considered, and the fact that thousands of people in downtown New York would be at risk was overlooked. With the rise of airplanes, dirigibles quickly became obsolete, and the dreams of the mooring mast faded. Another significant obstacle was a law that prohibited airships from flying too close to urban areas. This law not only made the construction of the mast risky but also illegal. What initially seemed like a glimpse into the future ended when @PERSON1 announced that the construction would be postponed. The future of transportation suffered a setback, but with the success of airplanes, new possibilities emerged."
1423	16256	6	2	3. During the construction of the Empire State Building, it encountered numerous obstacles. The builders aimed to create the world's largest building, which demanded arduous work. However, the State Building was never going to fulfill its intended purpose, as there were issues that should have been obvious before construction began. In conclusion, despite the efforts put into its construction, the building faced inherent problems that prevented it from achieving its original goals.
1424	16257	6	2	"4. Despite the high hopes and expectations surrounding the construction of the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the project was doomed to fail. In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, multiple obstacles that the builders faced while trying to enable dirigibles to dock on the mast are described. The first significant obstacle was that when a dirigible was attached to the mooring, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This necessitated a large amount of additional support for the building's frame to maintain its stability. The second, and perhaps most significant, obstacle was the rapid wind currents around the building. The winds created problems for the dirigible, as ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around the mooring mast."" This presented a major design flaw for the builders in terms of controlling and ensuring the safety of the dirigible during docking. Although the plan was ambitious compared to others of its time, it was short - lived. The numerous obstacles it faced meant that it was not a viable project, and today, it remains a memorable feature of the Empire State Building."
1425	16258	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These included strong winds, a weak structure, and public safety concerns. The strong winds made it almost impossible to keep the dirigible steady at the top of the building, while the weak structure made it difficult to hold the dirigible safely. Given these hazards, it is completely unsafe for people to ride, dock, or board these large dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building. In conclusion, due to these insurmountable problems, the idea of using the Empire State Building for dirigible docking is not a practical or safe option.
1426	16259	6	2	1. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when considering allowing dirigibles to dock at the structure. Firstly, a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the building's top, held by a single cable tether, would impose additional stress on the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transferred to the foundation. For instance, the frame would experience significant strain under such conditions. Secondly, the risk of a disaster occurring above the building was extremely high. The destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, made the owners of the Empire State Building realize the potential severity of a similar accident happening over a densely populated area like downtown New York. Lastly, the winds at the building's top were a major problem. Violent air currents caused the winds to constantly shift. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would rotate around the mast. In conclusion, due to these many obstacles, the idea of having dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building was highly unlikely to become a reality.
1427	16260	6	2	"2. In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Løsted, the author details the structural and natural obstacles faced by the Empire State Building's builders. One of the structural obstacles was that a moored dirigible, or blimp, would place a substantial amount of stress on the building's frame. To address this, the ""frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Nature also presented an obstacle. The violent and direction - shifting winds on top of the building impeded a dirigible's ability to moor there. Additionally, there was a restriction on airship flights over urban areas, which made it impossible for dirigibles to moor on the Empire State Building. In summary, the excerpt comprehensively explains the structural and natural challenges the builders had to confront."
1428	16261	6	2	3. While constructing the Empire State Building, the builders faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock. These included modifying the building's design, ensuring public safety, and dealing with the materials used in dirigibles. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the building's top would add stress to the frame, necessitating the modification and strengthening of the steel frame. Over sixty thousand dollars was spent on these modifications. Dirigibles were steel - framed balloons with cotton fabric envelopes filled with hydrogen and helium. Since most dirigibles used the highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, it was a significant safety concern. The destruction of a German dirigible by fire made the Empire State Building's owners aware of the potential disaster if a similar incident occurred over downtown New York. In conclusion, the builders had to overcome many hurdles just to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1429	16262	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would put stress on the building's frame. To adapt to this new situation, the steel frame of the building needed to be modified and strengthened. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were made to the building's framework. In conclusion, these were the significant obstacles the builders had to deal with in their attempt to enable dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1430	16263	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building confronted obstacles related to accommodating passengers on existing trans - atlantic routes as well as those on new routes that were yet to be established. Although the original text does not elaborate on what these obstacles were, it is clear that the task of meeting the needs of such passengers was a challenge for the builders. In conclusion, these unstated obstacles presented difficulties in the process of building the Empire State Building with the consideration of trans - atlantic passengers.
1431	16264	6	2	1. The construction of the Empire State Building with the intention of allowing dirigibles to dock presented numerous challenges. Minor difficulties included the building's frame and strength, while major ones, such as uncontrollable natural forces, posed significant hurdles. As the author explains in paragraph nine, mooring a thousand - foot dirigible to the building's top would stress the frame and, due to wind pressure, affect the foundation. Modifying and strengthening the frame would be necessary to enable docking. Nature's influence on the mooring mast made it nearly impossible to tether dirigibles. As described in paragraph fourteen, wind would cause dirigibles to spin around the mast. Other issues were that most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, landing fields added weight to the back of blimps, which was unsafe over pedestrians, and there was a law against airships flying low over urban areas. Despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building became a well - known landmark in @LOCATION1.
1432	16265	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles in their plan to allow dirigibles to dock. One concern was the use of highly flammable hydrogen inside the dirigibles. The builders were reluctant to endanger lives or damage buildings, especially considering the potential severity of an accident in downtown New York. The wind on top of the building was the most significant obstacle. Air currents caused the winds to constantly shift, and dirigibles would dangle over pedestrians on the streets below. Additionally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to tie dirigibles to the building or approach it. In conclusion, these factors combined to make it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1433	16266	6	2	3. When the architects started designing the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, they failed to consider the challenges they would face in docking a dirigible. The excerpt reveals that the mooring mast was not part of the original design, and the stresses from docking a dirigible would need to be transferred to the building's foundation. This meant that the builders had to find a solution while the building was already under construction. Safety was another major concern. As the excerpt states, most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is more flammable than helium. Coupled with the lack of a proper way to secure the tail of a moored dirigible, this could lead to an accident as catastrophic as the Hindenburg disaster over a densely populated area like downtown New York. In summary, these challenges made it extremely difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1434	16267	6	2	"4. The excerpt indicates that the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles or blimps to dock. In paragraph @NUM1, it is stated that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State building was designed to never fulfill its purpose."" Also in paragraph @NUM1, safety was cited as a major reason. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. The destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey, made the building's owners realize how much worse such an accident could be over a densely populated area like downtown New York. In paragraph @NUM3, nature was identified as a significant obstacle. Violent air currents caused the winds on top of the building to constantly shift. Existing laws against airships flying too low over populated or urban areas also contributed to the problem. In conclusion, these factors combined to prevent successful dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
1435	16268	6	2	"5. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced crucial obstacles in enabling dirigibles to dock and remain stationary. Firstly, dirigibles are highly flammable. In the US, they are often filled with hydrogen, an ultimate fire - starter, which is a significant risk near a building of great importance to its @CAPS1. Secondly, the structure was not suitable for human passengers to board and ride the blimp. A law prohibits aircraft from flying low over urban areas, making it impossible for dirigibles to dock. Thirdly, environmental conditions were unreliable. Violent air currents caused the winds on top of the building to constantly shift, putting lives at risk. These challenges ultimately hindered the dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building."
1436	16269	6	2	1. In the article “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Installing a mooring mast for docking dirigibles would place additional stress on the building's frame. Thus, the building had to be “modified and strengthened,” which entailed significant costs. Moreover, most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. The building's owners were aware that if an accident similar to the Hindenburg disaster occurred over a densely populated area like downtown New York, the consequences would be far more severe. Nature also posed a major hurdle. Violent air currents caused the winds atop the building to constantly shift. Even if an airship managed to tether to the mast, the back of the ship would spin around it. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low, making it illegal for dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was ultimately unable to fulfill its intended purpose.
1437	16270	6	2	2. As described in the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One significant issue was the financial and structural aspect. To build a docking facility for dirigibles, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework were required. Safety was another major concern. Dirigibles were flammable, and having them dock over an area filled with numerous buildings and people presented a high - risk situation. Considering these challenges, it was clear that the builders of the Empire State Building had a difficult task in enabling the docking of dirigibles.
1438	16271	6	2	3. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building confronted obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was the potential long - term structural impact. The weight of dirigibles could cause the building to collapse over time. As @CAPS1 @NUM1 noted, “a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame.” To address this, additional time and money would be needed to create a support frame for the Empire State Building. Another obstacle was the safety of the thousands of citizens below the tall building. After the German dirigible caught fire in Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse such an accident could be if it happened above a densely populated area like downtown New York. These two obstacles significantly hindered the builders' efforts to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1439	16272	6	2	4. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. Stress was a major concern. A thousand - foot dirigible, held by a single cable tether at the top of the building, would add stress to the building's frame. Safety was another significant obstacle. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable, posing a serious fire hazard. Nature also presented an insurmountable problem. Violent air currents on top of the building caused the winds to constantly shift. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would continuously swivel around it. In conclusion, these challenges made it very difficult for the builders of the Empire State Building to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock, as described in the excerpt.
1440	16273	6	2	5. When the Empire State Building considered establishing a dirigible docking station, it faced numerous problems. The first issue was the wind. At over a thousand feet in the air, the wind is never stable. Once a dirigible managed to approach the tower, it would be impossible to keep it still enough for refueling and passenger boarding or disembarking. The second problem was related to helium. Helium is flammable, and if it were to catch fire in a place like downtown New York, the consequences would be disastrous. The third and final reason was the law. It is illegal to have an aircraft flying at such a low altitude in a city. Given these insurmountable problems, the plan to create a dirigible docking station at the Empire State Building was abandoned.
1441	16274	6	2	The @ORGANIZATION1 spire was initially constructed with a purpose beyond mere visual appeal. It was designed as a mooring mast for docking dirigibles, which were considered the future of transportation. Al Smith saw an opportunity to position the Empire State Building and New York at the forefront of modern travel. However, the mast faced numerous challenges. To support and withstand the weight of dirigibles, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were required to the building's framework. Additionally, the constant threat of wind, due to violent air - current - induced shifting winds on the building's top, made the plans too dangerous. Moreover, most dirigibles were highly flammable, and docking them in a densely - populated area like downtown New York would pose a significant risk. In conclusion, building a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was fraught with insurmountable obstacles.
1442	16275	6	2	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building's builders encountered multiple obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock. Safety was the most significant hurdle. Dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Given that downtown New York buildings are closely spaced, a fire in a building like the Empire State could have catastrophic consequences. Nature also presented a difficult problem. The winds on the building's top were constantly shifting because of violent air currents, making it impossible to prevent the back of a dirigible from swiveling. Also, dirigibles would hang high above street - level cars and people. Finally, a law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, rendering the entire plan illegal. Although the plan was good in theory, it was not well - thought - out. In conclusion, these obstacles made the dirigible - docking plan unfeasible.
1443	16276	6	2	The builders faced numerous problems while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The most significant obstacle was the wind. At that elevation, the wind was constantly shifting. If a dirigible was tethered, its back would swivel. Another problem was that they could not weigh the dirigible down. Since it was at an elevated position, weighting it down would cause it to fall. These were some of the major challenges the builders had to deal with. In conclusion, these obstacles made the task of enabling dirigible docking extremely difficult.
1444	16277	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. Firstly, there was a lack of a suitable landing area, necessitating the design of a mast for the dirigibles. Secondly, the dirigibles being held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. Thirdly, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework were required. Safety was also a major concern. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. On @DATE1, the German dirigible “Hindenburg” was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The Empire State Building owners recognized the potential problem if such an incident occurred in New York. Finally, nature itself was the greatest obstacle. Violent winds and air currents made it difficult to tether dirigibles to the mast. In conclusion, these obstacles ultimately made it unviable to allow dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building's mooring mast.
1445	16278	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several major obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One problem was that the stress from the dirigibles' load and wind pressure would be transmitted to the building's foundation, and it cost over @MONEY1 to make the necessary modifications. The roof had to be completed before the mooring mast framing could start. They also failed to solve other issues. Foreign dirigibles typically used hydrogen instead of helium, which could cause extensive damage if they crashed in a densely - populated area like downtown New York. Additionally, due to the high elevation, the dirigible could not be weighted down at the back and would swivel around the mast. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the end, there were too many obstacles, and the dirigible docking plan was abandoned.
1446	16279	6	2	1. The builders of dirigibles' docking facilities at the relevant location encountered numerous obstacles. One such obstacle was the handling of hydrogen from non - US dirigibles. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and a fire in a densely populated area would be catastrophic. Another significant obstacle was nature. The winds atop the building were in a constant state of flux due to strong air currents. Even when a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, its rear would spin around the mast. These natural winds made dirigible control difficult, leading to concerns about the dirigible crashing into the building. In conclusion, these were the major obstacles faced during the attempt to enable dirigible docking.
1447	16280	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. After the destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg in New Jersey, the risk was even greater over a densely populated area like New York where the Empire State Building stands. The most significant hurdle for the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. Air currents caused the winds on top of the building to shift, making it unsafe for dirigibles to dangle high above street - level pedestrians. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which meant dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building. Although the idea seemed good initially, it was neither practical nor safe. In conclusion, these factors combined to prevent the successful implementation of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1448	16281	6	2	"3. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered formidable obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. Dirigibles were typically massive, as described in the quote: ""as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York."" Their large size made it extremely difficult to control and land them safely. Another challenge was modifying the pre - existing structure of the Empire State Building. The steel frame had to be modified and strengthened, and over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were required, as stated in the quote: ""The Steel frame of the empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over Sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" This shows that adding the mooring mast was not only labor - intensive for the workers but also a costly endeavor that ultimately failed. In conclusion, despite getting a tall building, they were unable to achieve the goal of a functioning mooring mast."
1449	16282	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building were confronted with many obstacles. The most significant obstacle to the successful operation of the mooring mast was nature. Violent air currents caused the winds on top of the building to constantly shift. Moreover, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These factors combined to make it extremely difficult to use the mooring mast successfully. In conclusion, these obstacles significantly hampered the attempt to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1450	16283	6	2	5. The builders were constructing a building about @NUM1 ft above the surface, so safety was a major concern. A @NUM2 ft @CAPS2 would moor at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether. The load of the @CAPS2 would add stress to the building, and the wind pressure would need to be transmitted @NUM3 ft below to the foundation. This was a situation that could affect @CAPS3. Additionally, there was a risk of the @CAPS2 catching fire on top of downtown New York, which could harm @CAPS3. Moreover, the project was costly, amounting to @NUM4 dollars. In conclusion, these safety, structural, and financial factors made the plan unfeasible.
1451	16284	6	2	1. Enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building presented several challenges. Initially, there was a shortage of appropriate landing areas in New York City. To address this, Al Smith installed a mooring mast on the building's top. This mast would permit dirigibles to anchor for a few hours for refueling, servicing, and passenger embarkation and disembarkation. Another hurdle was the additional stress on the building's frame caused by a one - thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top with a single cable tether. To handle this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building required strengthening and modification, which cost over sixty thousand dollars. The most significant obstacle was nature. The winds at the building's top constantly shifted due to violent air currents. While lead weights were used to stabilize dirigibles in open fields, having them dangle above street - level pedestrians at the Empire State Building was extremely unsafe. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made the successful docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building a difficult endeavor.
1452	16285	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles to dock thousands of feet above the New York streets. One major issue was the large size of the dirigibles, which could be up to one - thousand feet long. Another problem was preventing the back of the dirigible from rotating around the mooring mast. Typically, lead weights were used to anchor the back of these blimp - like structures, but having lead weights hanging high above the streets was both too risky and impractical. In the end, these challenges made it very hard to achieve the goal of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building.
1453	16286	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was the need for a mooring mast for the dirigibles to anchor. However, placing a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building was not feasible as it would exert excessive stress on the building, and this problem cost over sixty thousand dollars to address. Safety was also a major concern. Dirigibles were mostly filled with highly flammable hydrogen. A fire on a dirigible could destroy the entire Empire State Building and endanger everyone inside. Additionally, strong winds could blow and detach the dirigible, posing a threat to pedestrians below. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to anchor a dirigible on the building. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building has been abandoned.
1454	16287	6	2	4. The architects, engineers, and workers involved in building the Empire State Building encountered many challenges when trying to attach a dirigible dock to the top of the building. First, they could not simply install a mooring mast on the building. The engineers and architects had to spend @NUM1 dollars on repairs to strengthen the building's framework. Mother nature also posed a problem. The constantly changing winds made it difficult for dirigibles to stay landed, and using weights to stabilize them was dangerous as a falling weight could harm an innocent person. Moreover, a law prohibited dirigibles from flying too low over a city. A spike from another building hitting and popping the dirigible's balloon could lead to a disaster. Overall, these numerous obstacles made it impossible for the idea of a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building to become a reality.
1455	16288	6	2	5. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced multiple problems. During the construction of the building, they were unsure if they could complete it. They also had to deal with a harsh climate. Additionally, they had concerns about the weight of the dirigibles and whether the building could support them. As stated in paragraph fourteen, “Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights.” These were some of the challenges that the workers had to overcome. In conclusion, these various problems made the construction and the plan for dirigibles a complex task.
1456	16289	6	2	1. The obstacles he encountered were that the problems were never truly resolved, and this led to issues with the wind. Despite these challenges, it was clear that a proper solution was needed to address the underlying problems and mitigate the impact on the wind - related situation.
1457	16290	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building grappled with multiple problems regarding the mooring mast. Safety was undoubtedly the primary concern. A fire on a dirigible could result in it crashing onto New York City's main streets, endangering hundreds of pedestrians. Weather was also a significant factor; if high winds made flying impossible most of the time, the mast would be useless. The cost of <@NUM1</@CAPS1> for modifying the building's framework could have been better spent on other town projects. Moreover, an existing law prohibited airships from approaching the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the mooring mast idea was extremely poorly planned.
1458	16291	6	2	3. The constructors of the Empire State Building faced numerous hurdles while trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, they had to modify the building's frame to transfer the dirigible's stress to the building's base. Secondly, they needed to finish the roof before starting the mooring mast's framing. Additionally, they ensured the mast's skeleton was made of steel so that it blended in with the rest of the Empire State Building. Overall, these challenges made the process of facilitating dirigible docking quite arduous.
1459	16292	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous problems and obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Nature was a major hurdle; at @NUM1 ft., the winds were too strong and unpredictable for dirigibles to approach and dock. Laws also prohibited landings as airships couldn't fly low over urban areas. Even without these laws and wind issues, the idea was extremely dangerous. Many dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and a fire in a densely - populated area like New York City would cause horrifying damage. I sincerely hope Al Smith was ready to spend thousands for the title of the world's tallest building since he didn't get his mast.
1460	16293	6	2	5. Building a regular building is difficult, but constructing the world's tallest building was an intense challenge. The mast atop the Empire State Building presented many obstacles for the builders. They had to strengthen the entire building's framework as a thousand - foot dirigible moored by a single cable would add stress. The architects aimed to make the mooring mast decorative, designing it as a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless - steel tower illuminated from within. Additionally, the building required two extra floors: an open observation platform and a boarding area for dirigible passengers. Although the mast never served its intended purpose, the building was still recognized as the world's tallest.
1461	16294	6	2	1. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2, building a docking station for dirigibles faced obstacles such as foundation support, nature, and safety. Architects first encountered the issue of docked dirigibles exerting excessive stress on the building. To address this, significant modifications to the building were necessary. “The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation” (@CAPS1 @NUM1, @CAPS2 @NUM2), and these changes were estimated to cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle was nature. At that height, wind currents are violent and unpredictable. Even when tethered to the building, dirigibles would spin and twist around the mast, which was both unsecure and dangerous. Finally, the mast had serious safety violations, which the excerpt claims was the main reason for the lack of success. “Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident would have been... above a densely populated area such as downtown New York” (@CAPS1 @NUM3, @CAPS2 @NUM4). The mooring mast posed a severe risk to the safety of New Yorkers, serving as a major obstacle for its builders. In conclusion, the building's foundations, nature, and safety violations all presented problems for those constructing the mooring mast.
1462	16295	6	2	2. The Empire State Building's builders encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. Dirigibles are large steel - framed balloons filled with hydrogen and helium, maneuvered using propellers and rudders. Al Smith proposed adding a mooring mast to the building's top, allowing dirigibles to anchor for refueling or servicing for several hours. However, the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transferred to the building's foundation. This required over @MONEY1 in modifications to the framework. On May 6, 1937, when the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the builders recognized how catastrophic it would have been if such an incident occurred above downtown New York's densely populated area. The winds at the building's top would constantly shift due to harsh air currents, causing the back of the dirigible to swing around. Additionally, existing laws against airships flying too low over cities and urban areas prohibited dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building. In summary, the Empire State Building's builders faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1463	16296	6	2	3. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The winds were too strong, and most dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. Dirigibles were to be docked to the building by attaching a cord to the mast, leaving them “dangling high above pedestrians in the street” (@NUM1). This was “neither practical nor safe” (@NUM1), endangering both pedestrians below and the people on the dirigibles. The strong winds could throw the dirigibles into buildings. Moreover, most dirigibles used hydrogen as fuel. “The German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey” (@NUM3). The owners of the Empire State Building saw this as a major problem, as a fire - related incident in densely populated New York would be far more disastrous. In conclusion, the strong winds and the use of flammable hydrogen in dirigibles made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1464	16297	6	2	4. During the construction of the Empire State Building, it was planned to serve as a mast for attaching dirigibles. However, the builders did not anticipate the severity of the obstacles preventing them from achieving this safely. Most of the problems were related to safety. Due to these safety issues, the mast was considered an unprofitable and dangerous idea, with too many potential things that could go wrong. One issue was that dirigibles contain dangerous flammable gases. If something went wrong, a flaming dirigible crashing into downtown New York City would cause significant damage. Another obstacle was that a dirigible tethered to the mast would be “constantly shifting due to the violent air currents” (para @NUM1). Also, “an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas” (para @NUM2) made the plan unworkable. In conclusion, the insurmountable problems made the idea of using the building as a mooring mast unrealistic.
1465	16298	6	2	5. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it was revealed that the tall spire of the Empire State Building was intended as a mooring mast for zeppelins to land. The builders faced many difficulties in making this a reality. One difficulty was the stress added by the weight of the dirigible. Over @NUM1 dollars' worth of work was done on the foundation, and adding so much steel to a beautiful building was no easy task. Another difficulty involved the mast having a conical head to house a mooring arm. Moving an ornate @NUM2 - foot spire @NUM3 feet to the top was extremely challenging. Finally, “the winds at the top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,” which meant the framing workers had a very tough time constructing the building. In conclusion, the difficulties related to the dirigible's weight, the mast's design, and the strong winds made it extremely hard to use the spire as a mooring mast for zeppelins.
1466	16299	6	2	1. The construction of the Empire State Building with the intention of allowing dirigibles to dock presented numerous challenges. One significant obstacle was the stress on the building's frame. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top would transmit the stress of its load and wind pressure to the foundation nearly eleven feet below. To accommodate this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would need to be modified and strengthened. Another major concern was people's safety. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. This meant that if a fire were to occur, it could put people at great risk. In conclusion, making the Empire State Building a dirigible dock would require overcoming these substantial obstacles.
1467	16300	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles. Firstly, it was illegal for dirigibles to fly at low altitudes in urban areas. Secondly, many of the dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If an incident similar to the Hindenburg disaster were to happen at the Empire State Building, it would be far more catastrophic, especially with people on the streets below. Thirdly, nature posed a problem. The winds at the top of the building were fierce and constantly shifting. If a dirigible were docked, the lead weights that prevent it from floating away could dangle over pedestrians and fall at any moment. There were also fears that sharp edges and strong winds could puncture the dirigible. In summary, these challenges made it extremely difficult to use the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking site.
1468	16301	6	2	3. During the @DATE1, dirigibles were regarded as the future of transportation. They could reach a top speed of eighty miles per hour and cruise at about seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles. However, there were several obstacles to their landing in New York City. The lack of a suitable landing area was a major issue. Architects and builders of the Empire State Building also faced the challenge of designing a mast that would allow dirigibles to dock and people to enter and exit. They couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof, as a thousand - foot dirigible held by a single cable would stress the building's frame. So, they had to reconstruct the building's foundation to strengthen its structure. The most significant obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building shifted constantly due to violent air currents, making it dangerous and unsafe for dirigibles to dock. In conclusion, these obstacles severely limited the viability of using the Empire State Building for dirigible docking.
1469	16302	6	2	4. In this excerpt, Al Smith faced many obstacles when he wanted dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Modifying the building's top for dirigible mooring was a relatively minor but costly obstacle, with the needed framework modifications estimated to cost over @ORGANIZATION1. There was also an existing law against low - flying airships, which prohibited dirigibles from docking at the building. Safety was a complex issue, as most non - @LOCATION1 dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. The greatest obstacle was nature, with the winds on top of the building constantly shifting due to violent air currents. In the end, these obstacles were insurmountable for Al Smith and his team.
1470	16303	6	2	5. On December 11, 1929, Al Smith, the four - term governor of New York, announced that the Empire State Building would reach a height of 1,250 feet, set to become the world's tallest building at the time. However, the builders faced difficulties with the more distinctive feature of allowing dirigibles to dock. Building a suitable landing area was a challenge. As described in the excerpt, a dirigible held by a single cable would stress the building's frame, necessitating modifications and strengthening of the steel frame to transfer the stress to the foundation. Safety was a major concern. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, and a fire like the Hindenburg disaster in New Jersey would be far more problematic in densely populated New York. Nature also posed an obstacle. The winds on top of the building shifted due to violent air currents, causing the back of the dirigible to swivel and endangering pedestrians below with the lead weights. Overall, constructing the mast was difficult, and unfortunately, it was never used.
1471	16304	6	2	"1. The designers of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the building's peak. As stated, ""The greatest reason was safety"" (para @NUM1). Dirigibles posed a significant risk. Strong winds could divert them, potentially causing collisions with the building. In the event of a crash, debris would fall over New York City. Due to the wind, lead weights would be necessary to keep a dirigible stationary, yet this approach was deemed ""neither practical nor safe"" (para @NUM2) above the city. Additionally, there was a law that prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas, rendering the docking operation illegal. In conclusion, these factors combined to create substantial challenges for the Empire State Building's builders in facilitating the docking of blimps or dirigibles on the structure."
1472	16305	6	2	"2. The Empire State Building's builders faced multiple hurdles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. As mentioned in the excerpt in paragraph 6, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area."" This indicates that the crowded nature of New York City presented a challenge in terms of finding adequate space for dirigibles to land. In paragraph @NUM1, the author points out safety hazards, as many dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Moreover, in paragraph @NUM2, the author describes the impact of the violent winds on the building's top, which the builders had to take into account. All in all, the builders had to contend with a variety of obstacles during this endeavor."
1473	16306	6	2	3. The construction team of the Empire State Building confronted a multitude of difficulties when aiming to permit dirigibles to dock at the building. One major problem was that attaching a dirigible would impose additional stress on the building's structure. The frame of the Empire State Building would need to be modified to withstand the pressure, and these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars. The building has 102 floors, with the top - floor serving as both a boarding area and an observation area. Additionally, an American flag was raised on top for the mooring masts. All these arrangements were made to support the docking of dirigibles on the Empire State Building. However, despite these efforts, the numerous challenges ultimately made the realization of regular dirigible docking a difficult task.
1474	16307	6	2	"4. The designers of the Empire State Building had a tough time trying to make it possible for dirigibles to dock at the top. As it was put, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" So, the designers had to figure out a docking method. Even if they managed to find a way, a thousand - foot dirigible held by a single cable tether at the top would stress the building's frame. This meant that the Empire State Building would require ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications."" Moreover, there was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Despite facing many setbacks, the builders made a brave attempt to achieve their goal, but in the end, the challenges were substantial."
1475	16308	6	2	"5. The builders of the Empire State Building were met with a series of obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. First, as per the excerpt, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the frame."" Modifying the building's framework to handle this would cost over @MONEY1. Another concern was the safety related to the mast. Most non - US zeppelins used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and an ignition above a densely populated area like downtown New York would lead to a disaster. Nature also presented a major hurdle. The winds on top of the building shifted constantly due to violent air currents. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, its back would spin around the mast. Additionally, there was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a blimp to attach to or approach the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these factors made it impossible for the builders to construct a mooring mast on the Empire State Building."
1476	16309	6	2	1. The builders of the mast designed to enable dirigibles to dock encountered numerous obstacles, encompassing laws, nature, and overlooked details. Laws presented an obstacle due to the safety risks associated with having a dirigible fly over a densely - populated area, as exemplified by the Hindenburg accident. Nature was also a challenge, as the violent winds at the mast's top would render the ship unstable. Additionally, the mast builders failed to account for all these obstacles and safety risks, thus hindering the achievement of their goal.
1477	16310	6	2	2. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was doomed to never serve its intended purpose, and the reasons should have been evident prior to its construction. The most significant factor was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen. After the Hindenburg accident, the building's management realized that the consequences would have been far more severe if such an accident had occurred over a densely - populated area like downtown New York. As a result, the mast could not fulfill its function.
1478	16311	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles while trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the need for over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework. Another was meeting with the president of an airship transport company and formulating a plan to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. These are just two of the many challenges the builders faced during the construction of the Empire State Building, which overall hampered their efforts to make the building suitable for dirigible docking.
1479	16312	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The steel frame of the building needed to be modified and strengthened to adapt to this new situation, with over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications required for the framework. An existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over suburban areas, preventing dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building. The most significant obstacle was the violent air currents that would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. These obstacles collectively made it difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the building.
1480	16313	6	2	5. In my opinion, the main problem the builders faced was ensuring that people could safely disembark from the dirigibles and reach the building. They also had to guarantee that the blimp would not burst into flames if it got close to or crashed into the Empire State Building. These safety - related issues were of utmost importance and posed significant challenges to the builders in their attempt to make the building a viable docking site for dirigibles.
1481	16314	6	2	1. When constructing a mooring mast on the Empire State Building to enable dirigible docking, the builders encountered multiple obstacles. Placing a mast directly on the building was unfeasible as it would exert excessive pressure on the building's frame, and the stress would reach the foundation, located 1100 feet beneath the mast. Thus, prior to any construction, they had to reinforce the entire structure of the Empire State Building. Eventually, these obstacles were overcome, marking a significant achievement in the project.
1482	16315	6	2	2. The Empire State Building's builders faced several challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. They opted for dirigibles over balloons because the fabric used in dirigibles is lighter. Another problem was the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City, along with concerns about the safety of passengers boarding and disembarking. These issues made it difficult to implement the docking plan but were aspects that needed to be addressed for the project's success.
1483	16316	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles in enabling dirigibles to dock using the mooring mast. Firstly, there was a lack of a suitable landing area. Secondly, architects could not simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. However, the most significant obstacle was nature. Violent air - currents caused the winds on the building's top to constantly shift, making it extremely difficult to use the mooring mast effectively. Despite these challenges, the overall goal was to make the docking of dirigibles possible.
1484	16317	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant difficulties in allowing dirigibles to dock. One major issue was related to the mooring mast and nature. When dirigibles approached the building, the winds on the top, constantly shifting due to violent air currents, made mooring difficult. The only way to moor was to weight down the back, but this was neither practical nor safe with pedestrians below. Another obstacle was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. These were substantial hurdles that the builders had to grapple with in their attempt to enable dirigible docking.
1485	16318	6	2	5. In the 1920s, dirigibles were regarded as the future of transportation. However, there was a shortage of landing areas in New York City. Al Smith saw an opportunity in the Empire State Building and planned to construct a mooring mast on its top. This would allow dirigibles to anchor, refuel, and enable passenger boarding and disembarking. But the new construction plan faced many obstacles. One was how to add a mooring mast without stressing the building's frame, as the dirigible's load and wind - pressure stress would reach the foundation nearly 1100 feet below. This led to the need to modify and strengthen the steel frame, which was the second obstacle. The third obstacle was the expense; modifying the building's framework would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Although Al Smith had a great vision for the Empire State Building, these obstacles presented significant challenges to its realization.
1486	16319	6	2	"1. In an excerpt written by @ORGANIZATION1 titled @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. As stated, ""one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing areas"" (paragraph 6). If dirigibles were unable to land properly, it could lead to destruction and pose a significant danger to people. In paragraph @NUM1, Al Smith said, ""It's on level all right no kidding we're working on the thing right now."" His way of speaking seems rather unconvincing. When conceptualizing dirigibles at the Empire State Building, a mooring mast had to be added to the building's top to facilitate passenger embarkation and disembarkation. However, this idea was unsafe. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"" (paragraph @NUM2). It is questionable why they would build something harmful to others. In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders struggled with constructing the dirigibles."
1487	16320	6	2	"2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most significant obstacle was nature. According to the passage, ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting."" This made it difficult for dirigibles to dock initially. Even if they managed to dock, the back of the dirigibles would shift and float around. The only solution to this would be to add weights to the back of the dirigibles. However, having weights floating high above pedestrians' heads ""was neither practical nor safe."" Another major obstacle was the law. At that time, there was a law prohibiting any kind of aircraft from ""flying too low over urban areas."" As the passage clarifies, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to even tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Consequently, the mooring mast idea was abandoned."
1488	16321	6	2	"3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. As noted, ""The architect could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" A thousand - foot dirigible tethered by a single cable would exert excessive stress on the building's frame. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Otherwise, the Empire State Building might fall over."" To handle the extra load, the architect would need to modify and strengthen the building's existing framework. Additionally, the ornate mast would be challenging to raise on top of the building due to the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would swivel around it. In such a situation, the dirigible could crash into the Empire State Building or other buildings, endangering people on the street. Dirigibles typically land in open fields, where they can be weighted down in the back with lead weights. However, having dangling weights above pedestrians on top of the Empire State Building was neither practical nor safe. Moreover, laws were passed restricting dirigibles from getting too close to buildings."
1489	16322	6	2	4. In the excerpt Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was that extensive modifications had to be made to the building's framework because the dirigible's load and wind pressure needed to be transmitted to the building's foundation. Another issue was that most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which would be extremely dangerous in case of a fire, especially in a highly populated area. Due to violent air currents, the back of a dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast. As stated on page @NUM1, paragraph @NUM2, having the dirigible dangle above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Lastly, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or even approach it. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock.
1490	16323	6	2	"5. The builders @CAPS1 faced numerous problems when attempting to build a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building, including legal, structural, and logistical issues. Firstly, there was a law in place restricting airships from ""flying too low over urban areas,"" as explained in paragraph @NUM1. In addition to this legal hurdle, the builders @CAPS1 encountered the structural problem of installing a mooring mast on top of a skyscraper. According to the article, the stress of the dirigible load, along with wind pressure, would have to be transmitted over eleven hundred feet to the foundation. Due to this added weight, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were made to the building, as cited in paragraph @NUM2. Moreover, the logistics of docking a dirigible at such an altitude were quite challenging. In fact, half of the attempted dirigible landings at the Empire State Building were aborted due to high winds. Although a dirigible landing mast would have placed the Empire State Building at the forefront of modern travel, it could not be achieved due to legal, structural, and logistical problems."
1491	16324	6	2	1. The construction team encountered multiple challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building. Firstly, if a thousand - foot dirigible were to land on the building, it would exert additional stress on the building's frame, necessitating structural modifications. Secondly, natural factors presented a significant hurdle. The winds on the building's summit were constantly changing due to strong air currents. If a dirigible attempted to land, its rear would spin around the landing area, creating an unsafe situation. Finally, government regulations also prohibited dirigibles from docking on the building, as there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These three primary factors prevented dirigibles from landing on the Empire State Building.
1492	16325	6	2	2. The construction of the Empire State Building presented several major obstacles. One significant issue was the use of hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, in a densely populated area. Another problem stemmed from legal restrictions, as aircraft are not permitted to fly too low over urban regions. Additionally, the powerful winds at that altitude made landing impossible. In conclusion, numerous challenges were faced during the construction of the Empire State Building.
1493	16326	6	2	3. They came up with a good concept for the building, but the difficulties were substantial, including formulating a plan and designing it. Crafting that building was an extremely arduous task. In conclusion, despite the good idea, the challenges in building the structure were insurmountable.
1494	16327	6	2	"4. Workers faced numerous obstacles in enabling dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Initially, they were over - confident but soon realized they were mistaken. Their first challenge was to ensure the safety of docking at the Empire State Building. This was difficult because the building was above civilian areas, and any accident could have extremely serious consequences. The second obstacle was wind pressure, which would have made the mast's support unreliable and disrupted the docking process. Finally, the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, as mentioned in ""The Fate of The Mast"" section, was a major safety concern as hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a threat to the environment. Overall, many obstacles impeded the process of setting up the mast and the docking of dirigibles."
1495	16328	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building confronted numerous obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to endure long periods working at high altitudes. Moreover, they had to figure out how to dock the dirigible on the roof while ensuring their own safety. In conclusion, the process of enabling dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was fraught with challenges.
1496	16329	6	2	1. The Empire State Building originally had a flat roof. Installing a mooring mast on it was not feasible because it would add stress to the building's frame. Constructing a mooring mast would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Additionally, the wind on top of the building constantly changed direction, causing dirigibles to swirl around if moored. While dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down with lead weights at the back, this method was neither practical nor safe for the Empire State Building as the weights would dangle above pedestrians. Moreover, there was a law prohibiting aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. These factors created numerous obstacles for dirigibles to land on top of the Empire State Building.
1497	16330	6	2	"2. In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's article ""The Mooring Mast"", the obstacles faced by builders when constructing a mast for dirigibles to dock are detailed. One major issue was the attachment method. Architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored by a single cable at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. Another problem was the cost. Due to the first issue, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. These obstacles ultimately prevented the mast from being used for its intended purpose."
1498	16331	6	2	3. The idea of constructing the mast was initially a good one, but those involved in the construction failed to recognize the true dangers. They should have known that with the ship attached to the mast in one area, it would swing around on windy days due to the lack of weight. The builders also had to ensure perfection because the concept was significant, as other builders might follow their example. If they didn't set a good precedent, other builders would face major problems and people could be in danger. The builders considered using weights to balance the ship but couldn't find a safe way to do so. One accident could have resulted in many casualties. The dirigible was a great idea, but proper planning should have preceded its construction.
1499	16332	6	2	"4. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 encountered a multitude of problems. One problem was that the dirigible's load and wind pressure needed to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. As a result, @CAPS1 had to modify and strengthen the building. The dirigible was so large that they couldn't even anchor its back to the roof. @CAPS1 also had great difficulty figuring out how the dirigibles would land because the wind was so strong that the pilot couldn't control the dirigible. Due to these modifications, @CAPS1 had to spend another sixty thousand dollars. Al Smith came up with the idea but later realized it wouldn't work. Eventually, @CAPS1 finished constructing the mast, but the dirigibles couldn't dock there."
1500	16333	6	2	"5. Builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to dock dirigibles or zeppelins. Firstly, a mooring mast needed to be added, but according to @ORGANIZATION2, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework were required before a dirigible could be moored. Secondly, outside the United States, most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen gas instead of helium. After the German ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1, the owners recognized the danger of having a dirigible moored over downtown New York. According to @ORGANIZATION2, nature was the greatest obstacle. Violent winds at the top of the building would make a moored dirigible swivel, and using lead weights to counter this was dangerous over a densely - populated area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los @CAPS1 couldn't dock in December 1930 because of the winds. Lastly, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the mast. These obstacles made it extremely difficult for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1501	16334	6	2	In the story “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the construction of a dock for dirigibles at the Empire State Building encountered obstacles. One issue was the lack of a suitable landing area; as stated in paragraph six, dirigibles could only anchor there for a few hours. Additionally, it was found that most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, with hydrogen being more flammable. Paragraph thirteen noted that an accident above a densely - populated area like downtown New York could have had more severe consequences. Overall, these factors presented significant challenges to the establishment of a successful dirigible dock at the Empire State Building.
1502	16335	6	2	The construction of the Empire State Building and enabling dirigibles to @CAPS2 there presented numerous obstacles. The expanded use of dirigibles in New York City was hampered by the lack of a suitable landing area, as mentioned on page @NUM1, paragraph 6: “The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the Lack of a suitable Landing Area”. Nature itself was another major hurdle, as stated on pg @NUM2, paragraph @NUM3: “The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was Nature itself”. Weather also posed a problem; for instance, on page @NUM4, paragraph @NUM5, it was reported that the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles could not approach the mooring mast closely enough to tie up due to strong winds. These examples illustrate the various obstacles faced in allowing dirigibles to @CAPS2 near the Empire State Building.
1503	16336	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Two significant obstacles were the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure. Since “the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,” which meant reaching nearly eleven hundred feet below, this was a complex engineering challenge. Another issue was that it became clear that “the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose,” and this should have been evident before construction. These are just a few of the many obstacles the builders had to confront during this project.
1504	16337	6	2	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles related to safety and financial concerns when considering dirigible docking. Successfully docking a dirigible would require an additional expenditure of over @MONEY1 for building modifications. There were also significant safety issues, including the gas carried by the dirigible, the risk to people in the city below, and the fact that it was illegal for airships to fly at such low altitudes. These factors combined to make dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a challenging and costly endeavor.
1505	16338	6	2	The Empire State Building endured hardships when attempting to dock dirigibles. The builders constructed a docking station, but safely docking at thousands of feet in the air was a major challenge. The lack of a suitable landing area restricted the expanded use of dirigibles in New York City. Strong winds in the area also made landing difficult. Moreover, laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, and it was an unsafe practice. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen gas, as demonstrated by the destruction of a German dirigible by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The building's owners recognized the potential severity of such an incident in a densely populated area like New York. In conclusion, these multiple factors made it extremely difficult for dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building.
1506	16339	6	2	1. The notion of using the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles may appear absurd today, yet upon its construction, the mast at the top was originally intended for this purpose. However, there are multiple reasons why this plan did not materialize. Firstly, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it legally impossible to tie a dirigible to the building. Secondly, the powerful air - currents at the building's peak would cause a docked dirigible to sway uncontrollably, posing a safety risk. Finally, many non - U.S. dirigibles used hydrogen for flight instead of helium. If a dirigible were to explode like the Hindenburg over the city, it would be extremely dangerous for civilians. These factors lend credibility to the idea that the Empire State Building would not serve as a safe dirigible docking bay.
1507	16340	6	2	"2. According to the excerpt, the challenges the Empire State Building's builders faced when trying to dock dirigibles at the building were that foreign dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, the winds at the building's top changed violently, and it was illegal to fly too low over urban areas. Foreign blimps using hydrogen were extremely dangerous because of the high risk of them bursting into flames. This realization dawned on the builders after the German blimp Hindenburg caught fire on May 6, 1937. After this tragedy, they recognized ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" If the incident had occurred over New York City, many more lives would have been lost, leading to a greater disaster. Moreover, the winds above the building change constantly, making the blimp unstable. The article describes this effect by stating, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The changing winds would stress the back of the ship. The front would be secured by the tether, but the back would sway freely in the wind, putting pedestrians below at high risk and rendering this idea impractical. Finally, the law made it illegal to even approach the building, let alone dock on it. The article mentions, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... Would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" The builders could not use the dock unless the law changed. The law was made to protect pedestrians and innocent bystanders, and flying the craft to the Empire State Building would violate it. In conclusion, the three obstacles preventing the use of the Empire State Building for dirigible docking were the hydrogen gas in foreign blimps, the unpredictable winds causing the craft to swivel, and the law prohibiting aircraft from flying too low over urban areas."
1508	16341	6	2	3. While the plan to install a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building was well - conceived, it presented several obstacles for the builders. The most significant issue was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, instead of helium. If an accident like a fire occurred at the Empire State mooring mast in a densely - populated area like New York City, it would be extremely dangerous. Another factor was nature. The winds above the building constantly shifted due to air currents. The only way to secure the dirigibles would be to use weights, but having weights hanging above a populated city was extremely unsafe. The final problem was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low in urban areas. This law made it illegal for ships to attempt to tie to the building, making it nearly impossible for the builders to implement the plan. In conclusion, safety concerns related to hydrogen, unpredictable winds, and the restrictive law were the main hurdles that prevented the successful use of the mooring mast at the Empire State Building.
1509	16342	6	2	"4. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered significant obstacles. They needed to ensure that dirigibles could dock safely, that passengers could embark and disembark safely, and that the building would not collapse when the mooring mast was constructed. These instances demonstrate that the builders faced numerous challenges during the construction of the Empire State Building."
1510	16343	6	2	5. The building was not designed to bear the additional weight of a dirigible attaching to its top. Dirigibles had to drop weights from the back to stay in place, and having lead weights dangle @NUM1 feet in the air was not safe. The mast was constructed of glass, which could be dangerous if a dirigible failed to stop and crashed into the tower. Additionally, the electronic winching stations did not seem likely to function well. These issues indicate that the plan to dock dirigibles at the building had multiple safety and functionality problems.
1511	16344	6	2	1. The construction of the Empire State Building aimed to allow dirigibles to dock, but faced significant obstacles. One was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for dirigibles to approach the building for docking. Another issue occurred in 1930 when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to reach the mooring mast. Strong winds prevented it from getting close enough to tie up, as the winds could blow the dirigible into the sharp spires. These challenges hindered the Empire State Building's goal of facilitating dirigible docking.
1512	16345	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered difficulties when trying to enable dirigibles to dock. Al Smith, the four - term governor of New York leading the construction efforts, was determined to surpass the Chrysler Building's height. The architect of the Chrysler Building added a 185 - foot spire. In response, the Empire State Building's architects planned to place a mooring mast on top. However, they couldn't simply install it on the flat roof because shifting winds would affect the mast. Using such a structure high above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. Additionally, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building. In conclusion, these factors presented obstacles to the Empire State Building's plan for dirigible docking.
1513	16346	6	2	"3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast on the building's top. A major problem was that foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and in the event of a fire on a dirigible, it would pose a significant threat to the densely populated New York City. People would not have enough time to escape if a dirigible exploded. Another issue was the wind. The U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" experienced this when attempting to reach the mooring mast; the captain couldn't get close due to the wind, which could blow the dirigible off - course or into a spire and puncture it. These obstacles and dangers led the constructors to realize that the mooring mast was a bad idea."
1514	16347	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in their attempt to construct the tallest building in New York. Their ambition to build a large - scale structure and the long - term nature of the project contributed to these difficulties. Despite their efforts over many years, they had to overcome various obstacles to achieve their goal of creating the highest building in the city.
1515	16348	6	2	"5. In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Engineers in New York were trying to find a practical arrangement, and government officials in Washington were looking for a safe way to moor airships to the mast. The architects couldn't just place a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible held by a single cable at the top would add stress to the building's frames. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure needed to be transferred to the foundation nearly eleven hundred feet below. As a result, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened, costing over sixty thousand dollars in framework modifications."
1516	16349	6	2	1. Based on the excerpt, there were three reasons for the obstacles the Empire State Building builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, the location was too close to the city and not high enough. Secondly, the wind would spin the blimp around the mast. Thirdly, German blimps were filled with hydrogen, which would explode if near heat, while @LOCATION1 blimps were filled with helium. These factors combined made it difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1517	16350	6	2	2. During the construction of the Empire State Building's dirigible dock, three major obstacles emerged: wind, structure, and safety. The wind was a prominent issue due to the rough wind currents at the building's top. Landing on the dock was challenging, and staying there was impossible as the blimp would be whipped around. The @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles was concerned that the wind could blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of nearby buildings, puncturing the shell. Structuring the mast to hold the balloon was also a problem. They couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof; sixty - thousand dollars' worth of framework modifications were needed. Finally, landing a highly flammable metal balloon on the tallest skyscraper over millions of city - dwellers was a significant safety concern. Two landing attempts failed, and now the mast serves only as decoration.
1518	16351	6	2	"3. The builders and architects of the Empire State Building extension project to 1,250 feet faced numerous issues. The plan to build a mooring mast on top was unrealistic as it had never been done on a building before. Safety was a major concern, as most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Weather also posed a problem; fast winds from violent air currents at the building's top made dirigible landings dangerous for passengers and could cause the dirigible to hit other buildings. Additionally, the project was illegal according to federal law as dirigibles would fly too close to urban areas like New York City. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed,"" proving the project's infeasibility."
1519	16352	6	2	"4. Ultimately, the concept of Al @ORGANIZATION1 on the Empire State Building was strategically flawed. It was Al Smith's dream, but dreams don't always become reality. In theory, the Mooring @ORGANIZATION3 was to be built for dirigible docking. However, it became clear that a docking station on the Empire State Building was impossible. Smith and the builders encountered multiple obstacles. Location was a key issue; testing and creating a perfect landing zone 1,250 ft above ground was much harder than at ground level. High wind speeds and ""violent air currents"" at that altitude created an unsafe environment. Also, being in densely populated New York City meant that mistakes could lead to many casualties. Technology was another hurdle; the technology and engineering in the @DATE1's and 1930's were far less advanced than today's. These factors combined made Smith's dream unachievable."
1520	16353	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Al Smith constructed an 185 - foot spire inside the building to increase its height. In the @DATE1's, new airships called dirigibles, similar to blimps but filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter, were seen as future transportation. New York City lacked suitable landing areas for dirigibles, so Al Smith added a mooring mast to the building's top to allow the dirigible to tie a line from the front of the ship. However, these efforts still faced challenges in making dirigible docking a practical reality.
1521	16354	6	2	1. The operators of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. One issue was a law that prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes over cities, thus preventing them from docking at the Empire State Building. Another problem was that foreign blimps used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium for flight. Using hydrogen - filled blimps at the location would pose significant public safety risks. Lastly, nature presented the most substantial obstacle. Strong winds, which could be extremely violent, might cause the blimps to become untethered from the building or even fall. In conclusion, there were multiple obstacles that the operators of the Empire State Building had to face when trying to allow dirigibles to dock.
1522	16355	6	2	2. Workers building the mooring mast faced many hurdles. High winds were a major issue as they tossed the dirigibles around. An accident in such conditions could have been catastrophic. Additionally, a law in New York, passed due to a German dirigible accident in New Jersey, prohibited dirigibles from flying over urban areas. Moreover, there was no clear way to land as the landing gear hadn't been invented yet, making any landing attempt too risky. In conclusion, this idea was far - ahead of its time, which has both positive and negative aspects.
1523	16356	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles. Al Smith was aware that he was on the verge of losing the title of the world's tallest building. One major obstacle to the expanded use of dirigibles in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Adding a mooring mast to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor for refueling for several hours. Dirigibles were docked using an electric winch. However, architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored by a single cable at the top would stress the building's frame. The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened, costing over sixty thousand dollars in modifications. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. Dirigibles in open fields could be weighted with lead. There was also a law that would make it illegal for a ship to tie up or approach the building, though two dirigibles attempted to reach it before the idea was abandoned. Fears of the wind blowing the dirigible onto the building added to the challenges.
1524	16357	6	2	"4. The dream of aviation pioneers to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building presented significant obstacles for the builders. The author suggests that the mooring mast of the building ""was destined to never fulfill its purpose,"" implying that perhaps the building should not have been built considering the numerous difficulties. One obstacle was the violent winds on the building's top caused by air currents. These winds made it difficult for dirigibles to dock. A ""four - blocks"" long blimp filled with helium and hydrogen dangling high above was a safety risk for the millions on the streets. In December 1930, the dirigible Los Angeles couldn't reach the mooring mast due to strong winds. Another obstacle was the law against airships flying low over urban areas. The Columbia blimp tried to deliver newspapers but ended up with papers hanging from the rope as the mooring equipment was never installed. As a result, it was deemed ""desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear,"" which gave airplanes the title of ""transportation of the future."""
1525	16358	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced problems when constructing the dock for dirigibles. The great height of the building made capturing dirigibles dangerous because of the tower's structure. If a dirigible crashed, it would fall onto the streets of a large city. Also, most dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, which made the mooring mast a hazardous feature. In conclusion, these issues made the construction of the dirigible dock a challenging and risky endeavor.
1526	16359	6	2	1. The Mooring Mast encounters two significant obstacles. Firstly, the winds atop the building are in a constant state of flux due to violent air - currents. Secondly, dirigibles are prohibited from mooring because of a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Dirigibles attempt to approach the mooring, but the forceful winds prevent them from getting close. In 1930, the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring but could not get near. As a result, a safety - related law for urban areas was established.
1527	16360	6	2	"2. According to the excerpt, the builders faced numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock. One such obstacle is that most non - US dirigibles use hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, which poses a significant threat to nearby pedestrians. Another obstacle is the ever - changing winds, which are a result of ""nature itself"" and are dangerous for dirigibles. Additionally, there is an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas; a dirigible losing control could harm pedestrians. These are some of the obstacles the builders faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock."
1528	16361	6	2	3. Builders working on The Mooring @CAPS1 by @ORGANIZATION2 confronted multiple obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. To ensure safety and address issues related to the stress load and pressure of the dirigible on the building, the building would need to be modified and strengthened at a cost of up to sixty thousand dollars. Many blimps were filled with hydrogen, an extremely flammable substance that could endanger the building and New York City if a dirigible exploded. The winds on the building's top, constantly shifting due to violent air currents, made it difficult to control dirigibles and keep blimps stationary for passenger safety. There was also a law regarding airship height in urban areas; using the mooring mast on the Empire State Building would break this law as the mast was too low. These challenges were insurmountable, and the mast is not seriously used by dirigibles.
1529	16362	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced great difficulty in enabling dirigibles to dock. They encountered multiple obstacles. One was the continuous effort to make the building taller. Al Smith, in a competitive spirit with the architect of the Chrysler Building in New York City, wanted the Empire State Building to be larger. By extending it, the process of allowing docks became more dangerous and difficult. Another obstacle was the weather at the building's peak. The winds at that altitude were extremely strong, and given the highly populated area below, the risk of an accident was a major concern. In conclusion, allowing docks on the Empire State Building was a very dangerous endeavor.
1530	16363	6	2	"5. New York is known as ""the city that never sleeps,"" with its people always active and rushing through the streets. When four - term governor Al Smith proposed putting a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, both the people of New York and the building's constructors had many concerns. These concerns revolved around laws, safety, and construction. A law against flying airships too low over urban areas would make it illegal for a ship to tie up at the building or even approach the area. Safety was also a major worry as dirigibles contained highly flammable hydrogen; a fire in a dirigible above New York City could cause tragic damage. Moreover, the construction of the mast was unfeasible as it was not part of the original plan. Overall, due to these numerous factors and obstacles, the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was never likely to be built."
1531	16364	6	2	1. The construction team encountered numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. They needed to find a solution to prevent dirigibles from spinning around the tower's summit. The winds atop the building were in a constant state of change due to violent air - currents. This meant that dirigibles would swivel around the mast unless they were properly tied down. Another significant issue was strengthening the building's structure to withstand the tension exerted by the dirigibles. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Additionally, creating a safe environment for the pedestrians below was an insurmountable challenge as the city infrastructure was already in place. Having dirigibles dangling high above street - level pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. Evidently, the builders faced substantial obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the building.
1532	16365	6	2	"2. The builders faced difficulties. (Since the original ""The builders, faced."" is extremely short and lacks much content, this is a simple completion while keeping it in line with the requirement of minimal deviation in character count.)"
1533	16366	6	2	3. Al Smith and his workers endured many hardships during the construction of the building. For instance, they had to transfer the stress of the dirigibles' load all the way to the building's foundation, which was approximately eleven hundred feet below. Subsequently, they needed to modify and reinforce the building's frame to adapt to the new situation. However, the most significant obstacle throughout the entire process was nature. Violent air currents caused the winds on the building's top to constantly change. Safety was a major concern for Smith during construction. Smith initially thought that using a dirigible on the building would be feasible, but he underestimated the potential danger. Most dirigibles from outside @LOCATION1 used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. In conclusion, Al Smith and his workers had to overcome a series of challenges, with nature and safety being the most prominent ones, during the building's construction.
1534	16367	6	2	"4. In the novel, the @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock there. As stated in the novel, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This indicates that the dirigible would place stress on the building and increase the @CAPS2 risk of collapse. In conclusion, the novel highlights the difficulties associated with allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building due to the potential stress on the building's structure."
1535	16368	6	2	5. They encountered many problems when attempting to dock there. In fact, this docking facility should never have been built in the first place as many issues were foreseeable. The dirigibles had no landing gear, the wind was a major factor, and the ships couldn't get close enough to the mast to dock. The creators of this docking arrangement overlooked the possibility of it not working and were solely focused on the construction. Without any landing gear at all, it was difficult to stabilize and dock the dirigibles. The unpredictable wind would swing the balloon around. Even when they slowed the dirigibles down and there was little wind, they still couldn't get close enough to dock. These are the @CAPS1 problems they faced, clearly showing that the project was ill - conceived from the start.
1536	16369	6	2	"1. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. The dirigible's weight was supported by a single cable tether, and the force had to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was located far below. If the cable tether were to break, the passengers in the dirigible and the civilians in New York would be at great risk. Thus, using this cable tether was deemed too hazardous. Moreover, the builders were unable to overcome the natural ""violent air currents"" at the top of the building. These air currents would make the docking process potentially time - consuming and dangerous. To address this issue, the builders and architects considered weighing down the back of the dirigible with lead weights. However, this solution was neither practical nor safe, as the weights could potentially fall and harm pedestrians in New York. In conclusion, the builders and architects of this grand project had to grapple with many substantial obstacles in their attempt to make dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a reality."
1537	16370	6	2	2. Some of the obstacles the builders faced were that they had to make numerous changes. For instance, they could not simply place a mast on the building's flat roof. When a blimp was held by a single cable, it would exert stress on the building. The blimp's load and the wind pressure would need to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation. As a result, the building's structure (@CAPS1) had to be strengthened to adapt to this new situation. This strengthening process cost over sixty thousand dollars for the new framework. In summary, the builders had to deal with these significant challenges to make the blimp - docking setup work.
1538	16371	6	2	3. Creating a functional mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock was an extremely difficult task for the Empire State Building's constructors. Since the building was not initially designed to support the additional weight and size of a mooring mast, architects had to redesign the entire building's frame. They modified the plans to reinforce the steel frame of the building sufficiently so that it could withstand the added stress of the mooring mast. Although the builders managed to solve this problem, many unavoidable obstacles remained. One such obstacle was the danger associated with controlling a dirigible. Dirigibles were often inflated with highly flammable hydrogen, which posed a threat to the safety of the densely - populated New York City. Additionally, dirigibles were typically weighed down with lead when docked to prevent them from floating in the wind. However, this was not feasible on the Empire State Building as it would mean having lead bricks constantly dangling over pedestrians. Apart from these practical issues, it was also against the law for aircraft to fly over urban areas. This legal restriction was the final hurdle that prevented the mooring mast from being put to use. In conclusion, despite efforts, multiple challenges made the use of the mooring mast unviable.
1539	16372	6	2	"4. There were many obstacles in the process of building a mooring mast. The designers had to find solutions to overcome them. It was obvious that they couldn't simply start construction on the top of the building. Accommodations had to be made. As the excerpt describes, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" (@CAPS1). Simply adding the mast would disrupt the building's structure and foundation. Safety was a major concern. People recognized that having something as highly flammable as a dirigible was a bad idea. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium..."" (@CAPS1). After recent fires, the danger of this idea became evident. Control was also an issue in the city, unlike in an open field. ""... the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast"" (@CAPS1). This was unacceptable to most people, and it would be almost impossible to keep it stable for passengers loading. In conclusion, although designers often face problems in building construction, in this case, the mooring mast was not destined to be successful."
1540	16373	6	2	"5. As described in ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the Empire State Building was intended to reach new heights in the field of architecture. The determined efforts to build a mast not only aimed to make the Empire State Building the tallest building at @NUM1 ft but also to serve a practical purpose. This was a radical dream supported by intuitive design and ambitious goals. Unfortunately, as the project progressed, problems emerged, and the likelihood of successfully achieving this far - reaching objective became slim. The most significant obstacle was the safety concern. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flammable."" Coupled with the fact that the violent air currents at high altitudes required lead weights to be used to prevent extreme movement of the dirigible, this posed a serious threat to the safety of the densely populated New York City around the Empire State Building. As the practicality of the mooring mast diminished, it became ""desirable to postpone the final installation of the landing gear."" Eventually, the use of the mooring mast ""quietly disappeared,"" marking the end of this radical dream."
1541	16374	6	2	1. Al Smith envisioned creating a site for modern travel. Despite encountering numerous obstacles, he made strenuous efforts to turn his vision into reality. The original framework of the Empire State Building was not capable of withstanding the stress exerted by a thousand - foot dirigible. Over a certain amount of money (referred to as @MONEY1) was spent on strengthening the building's framework. Moreover, the builders designed a rocket - shaped aluminum mast that could accommodate the mooring arm. The control machinery was to be placed in the shaft, which also housed elevators and stairs for dirigible passengers. Another challenge was the lack of floors for passenger boarding. Additional floors were constructed, featuring a glassed - in observation area and a boarding area. Although the mooring mast for dirigibles ultimately proved to be a failure, Al Smith and many architects made all possible modifications to fulfill Smith's vision of what he believed was the Empire State Building's destiny.
1542	16375	6	2	"2. According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles while attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. The first hurdle was to ensure the mooring mast was safe for passengers to board and disembark. Architects enlisted the help of engineers and other professionals to work on this. Another problem was installing the mooring mast on the building. Over sixty thousand dollars was added to the building's framework to make it sturdy enough for the mast. After the mooring mast was set up and they celebrated framing the entire building, a new issue arose. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, as constantly shifting winds caused the dirigible to swivel around the mast. Eventually, they resolved these problems, but then the biggest obstacle emerged: dirigibles became illegal, and airplanes became the new mode of transportation. In the end, the builders of the Empire State Building faced too many obstacles and their attempt failed."
1543	16376	6	2	3. As the builders' aspirations for the Empire State Building expanded, so did the necessary modifications. Initially, they had to research and engineer a safe and practical method for dirigible docking. With the assistance of navy and government research, this task was soon accomplished. The next challenge pertained to the building's structure. Adding a mast, along with the weight of dirigibles and an engine room at the top of the skyscraper, would impact the frame. To ensure the building's structural integrity, the frame was modified to withstand the additional stress. Despite research and modifications, the docking system was never implemented. The strong and shifting winds above the Empire State Building prevented blimps from docking safely, and thus the idea was abandoned. Safety and wind were the two insurmountable challenges for the builders.
1544	16377	6	2	"4. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles while trying to bring Al Smith's plans to fruition. One such obstacle was the illegality of ""air ships flying too low over urban areas."" If breaking the law was not a significant enough hurdle, the safety of New York citizens also became a concern. Most dirigibles were highly flammable and dangerous. A single wrong move could have led to a large - scale disaster ""if it had [exploded] above a densely populated area."" Another major obstacle was the lightness of the dirigibles, which caused their rear ends to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The only way to prevent this would have put the citizens at risk. In conclusion, these multiple and complex obstacles made it extremely difficult for the builders to achieve Al Smith's plans."
1545	16378	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles. Firstly, they had to ensure the building was strong enough. They also needed to guarantee that dirigibles would not damage the building upon landing. Additionally, they had to be cautious that dirigibles would not crash into the building when dropping off papers. Another challenge for the workers was that dirigibles would not be able to land easily. Finally, they had to make sure that everything was in place and functioning properly. In summary, these various obstacles made the construction and operation of the building in relation to dirigibles a difficult task.
1546	16379	6	2	1. The construction of the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges when the builders aimed to enable blimp docking. From the onset, engineers recognized that even if a blimp could be docked, it would impose additional stress on the building's structure. As a result, they had to reinforce the entire building. Moreover, blimp docking was inherently dangerous, as demonstrated by the fate of the Hindenburg, which could easily be replicated. In conclusion, the difficulties associated with blimp docking on the Empire State Building were substantial and multifaceted.
1547	16380	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles, particularly during the construction of the mooring mast due to the building's height. Firstly, given the projected height of the mast, there were concerns regarding the even distribution of the dirigible's weight. Understanding the structure of the dirigible and its lighter - than - air nature was crucial. The builders had to ensure that the entire building, not just the top mast, supported the dirigible's weight. Otherwise, the dirigible's weight might pull the mast out of the building. Another challenge was the delicate nature of the mooring mast. It was constructed in an extravagant manner, with much of it made of glass due to numerous windows. This made the installation more difficult, as they had to monitor the process from all areas. In conclusion, the builders overcame significant hurdles to make the Empire State Building suitable for dirigible docking.
1548	16381	6	2	3. When presented with the challenge of building the world's tallest building, Al Smith was determined not to give up. To achieve his goal, he planned to construct a Dirigible docking mast on top of his new building. However, this ingenious idea was plagued by a series of obstacles that prevented its implementation. The most significant obstacle was safety. Most non - American Dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. The owners of the Empire State Building were aware of the potential disaster if a fiery explosion occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Another major obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it impossible to tether the Dirigible without the back of the ship swirling around the mooring mast. In conclusion, these obstacles effectively halted Al Smith's ambitious plan.
1549	16382	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock, including safety issues, nature, and the law. Safety was a major concern when dirigibles docked over populated areas like New York City. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. After an accident in New Jersey, the building's owners realized that a similar accident in New York City would be far more catastrophic. Nature also posed significant challenges. The constantly shifting winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents, made it difficult to dock a large dirigible. Even if tethered, the back of the ship would swivel, dangling dangerously above people. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would have made it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building. Two dirigibles attempted to reach the building before the law was repealed. In conclusion, safety, nature, and the law prevented the builders from achieving their goal of enabling dirigible docking.
1550	16383	6	2	5. The architects of the Empire State Building could not simply place a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. When they attempted to build it, there was insufficient space. Forcing the construction only made matters worse. The concept of a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building by a single cable tether without stressing the building's frame was unfeasible. At times, adding elements to the building only increased its weight and made it more prone to collapse. They added features for aesthetic purposes without realizing that it would only increase the risk of failure. In conclusion, the challenges in adding a mooring mast to the Empire State Building were significant and led to potential structural risks.
1551	16384	6	2	1. The most significant impediment to the successful utilization of the mooring mast was nature. Violent air - currents caused the winds atop the building to be in a constant state of shift. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These factors combined made the effective use of the mooring mast extremely challenging.
1552	16385	6	2	"2. According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. Nature was a major setback; as L¸sted noted, even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around it. Safety was also a concern, as the building's owners recognized that an accident above downtown New York would be far more disastrous than one in a field. The existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making dirigible docking in New York City illegal. Moreover, constructing a mooring mast required over @NUM1 dollars in modifications, along with substantial time and planning. In conclusion, the numerous and significant obstacles related to laws, safety, construction, and nature meant that the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was unable to fulfill its intended purpose."
1553	16386	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Building a mooring mast on top of the building was a complex task, despite being a good concept. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. New York City, with its large number of pedestrians and numerous buildings, was not suitable for this idea. Additionally, the invention of airplanes led to the decline of the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building, and eventually, this idea faded away.
1554	16387	6	2	4. Al Smith's plan to enlarge the Empire State Building and make its top a docking area for new airships was a formidable challenge. One of the obstacles the builders faced when creating a dock for dirigibles was preventing stress on the building's frame. Addressing this issue would involve the building's foundation, which was eleven hundred feet below, and would be prohibitively expensive. The stress would come from the dirigibles' load and wind pressure. Another major obstacle was the wind. Violent air currents caused the building to shift continuously. Using lead weights was considered too dangerous as they would dangle high above populated areas. Moreover, the builders had to abide by a law that prohibited airships from flying too low. In summary, the builders had to take into account multiple obstacles during the construction of the dock.
1555	16388	6	2	5. The primary obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building confronted were safety and nature. Safety was of utmost importance since they aimed to have dirigibles land on the building's top. As the reading indicates, most non - US dirigibles used flammable hydrogen instead of helium, which posed a significant risk, especially in a densely populated area like New York City. Nature was also a major hurdle. Placing the mooring mast at a great height on the Empire State Building brought difficulties related to the weather and atmosphere. The constantly shifting winds on the building's top made it difficult to land dirigibles. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around it due to the unstable air currents. In conclusion, the combination of the rough winds and the less - than - ideal design of the dirigibles made safety and nature the main obstacles in the creation of the Empire State Building's docking facility.
1556	16389	6	2	1. Builders encountered numerous challenges when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. The first issue was the wind at the building's peak. When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to dock, the wind prevented it from approaching closely without losing control, such as the risk of hitting another building. As a result, docking became impossible, and the Los Angeles abandoned the attempt. Another problem faced by the builders was a law that prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas. This law precluded all dirigibles from getting near the building, making docking unfeasible. In conclusion, these problems collectively made it impracticable for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
1557	16390	6	2	"2. In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, numerous contractors were highly determined to construct a mast on the Empire State Building to enable dirigibles, or blimps, to become the future of air travel. However, there were significant obstacles to realizing this vision. While the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was excellent, it ultimately proved to be an unachievable theory. The weight of the blimp combined with strong winds threatened to damage the building's framework. Architects spent over sixty thousand dollars on building modifications to address this issue. Another major concern was the hydrogen used in most non - US dirigibles, which is highly flammable and poses a significant fire risk in a densely populated city like New York. Additionally, the constantly shifting winds on top of the building due to violent air currents made it unsafe for dirigibles to operate. Finally, a law prohibited airships from flying too low in urban areas. All these obstacles meant that building a mast on the Empire State Building remained a dream. Al Smith, the building's architect, had fascinating ideas, but due to the environment, winds, hydrogen use, and safety laws, his dream could not be realized. In the end, his great imagination was met with bad luck, and construction could not proceed."
1558	16391	6	2	"3. In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the mooring mast faced obstacles that impeded the successful docking of dirigibles. First, the architects had to design the mast. They recognized that the Empire State Building's frame needed strengthening to bear the load and wind pressure of the dirigible. So, they designed the mooring mast, modified the building's skeleton plans, and planned for the reconstruction of the building and mast. Workers were excited about the plans and anticipated a revolutionary moment. However, they soon encountered many problems. Most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, making the mooring mast unsafe and prone to potential accidents. The constantly shifting winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents, also showed the physical insecurity of the dirigible. Moreover, the law restricted airships from flying too low, and dirigibles would violate this law. Despite the builders' desire to provide a launching pad for dirigibles and having an ideal design, there were too many flaws. Clearly, the builders faced insurmountable problems in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock, and the mooring mast could not be made a reality."
1559	16392	6	2	4. The concept of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building seemed promising during construction, but it had many hurdles. The builders first had to spend over sixty thousand dollars on modifying the building's steel frame to reinforce it against the pressure exerted by a docked dirigible. Adding a mooring mast was not a simple matter of placing it on the roof. They constructed a large stainless - steel enclosure for passengers, which included an elevator and stairs leading to the eighty - fifth floor. Finally, they had to complete the roof before framing the mast in steel. Although the idea of a mooring mast was ingenious, its practicality was extremely low, especially considering that the builders were working at a height of a thousand feet. In conclusion, this concept presented many challenges that made its implementation difficult.
1560	16393	6	2	5. The Empire State Building aimed to allow dirigibles to dock on its top. To achieve this, a mast needed to be built for dirigibles to hook onto and refuel. However, they faced multiple problems right from the start. Firstly, simply placing a mast on the top would be unstable and cause excessive stress to the structure. To address this, they modified and strengthened the entire structure at a cost of over sixty thousand dollars. After solving the wind - pressure issue, they decided to use electrical winches to bring in the dirigibles. Safety was another major concern. Dirigibles outside of @LOCATION1 used highly flammable hydrogen, which could be disastrous for the densely populated city below in case of an explosion. The violently shifting winds in nature also posed a safety risk. On the ground, lead weights were used to stabilize the dirigible, but this was unsafe when done over a large number of people. The final blow to the plan was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. In conclusion, these numerous problems made it impossible for the Empire State Building to implement the plan of allowing dirigibles to dock.
1561	16394	6	2	1. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was the winds on top of the building. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, the building was constantly shifting due to violent air - currents. This would cause the dirigibles to swivel around in the air. Another issue was that dirigibles typically used hydrogen and helium, which are highly flammable. These factors combined made it extremely challenging to establish a successful docking system for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
1562	16395	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building had to contend with numerous obstacles regarding the docking of dirigibles. High winds were a significant problem, as were the legal restrictions that prohibited aircraft from flying too low near urban areas. The safety of anchoring dirigibles above busy streets filled with people and in high - wind conditions was a major concern. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If a foreign dirigible were to be anchored at the Empire State Building, the high winds at the top could cause an accident, potentially leading to an explosion and endangering pedestrians. Additionally, the law against dirigibles docking at buildings meant that getting government approval would have been a long and arduous process. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it infeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1563	16396	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous hurdles in their attempt to establish a docking system for dirigibles. One of the most significant obstacles was nature, specifically the shifting winds on top of the building caused by dangerous air currents. These winds would make the back of the dirigible spin around the mooring mast. Having dirigibles dangling high above pedestrians on the streets was neither practical nor safe. Moreover, there was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. All these factors combined presented insurmountable challenges, making it unfeasible to moor dirigibles on the Empire State Building.
1564	16397	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to construct a docking station for dirigibles. First, they needed to make @MONEY1 worth of modifications to strengthen the building to “accommodate this new situation,” and this was an obstacle they managed to overcome. However, most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. After the Hindenburg fire, people recognized the potential danger of hydrogen as it is flammable. Weather also posed a problem, as high winds could disrupt the docking process. Additionally, there was a “law against airships flying too low over urban areas.” In the end, there were too many obstacles for the builders to overcome, and the mooring mast was never a success.
1565	16398	6	2	5. The obstacles faced by the builders in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were substantial. Safety was the most crucial issue. A plan that is not completely safe should not be implemented. The powerful winds would have made the Empire State Building unstable for docking. Moreover, most dirigibles or blimps used hydrogen instead of helium, which would be extremely dangerous in case of a fire, especially in a crowded place like New York. The wind was another obstacle; a dirigible could only land if weighted down with lead weights, which was not safe for pedestrians in New York City. These problems collectively explain why dirigibles could not land on the Empire State Building.
1566	16399	6	2	1. During the construction of the Empire State Building, in an effort to make it taller than the Chrysler Building, the builders encountered several obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was related to safety. Dirigibles from outside the United States commonly used hydrogen instead of helium. Since hydrogen is highly flammable, the builders recognized that if an accident similar to the German dirigible fire in New Jersey were to occur in a densely - populated area like downtown New York, the consequences would be far more severe. Another major obstacle was natural. When a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the winds on top of the building would cause the back of the dirigible to spin continuously. Additionally, there was a legal obstacle. An existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to tie a dirigible to the building. As the years went by, the idea of using the mooring mast faded away, eliminating these obstacles.
1567	16400	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous hurdles in facilitating dirigible docking. Safety was a primary concern. Dirigibles often used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. A fire or crash of a dirigible over a populated area would pose extreme danger. Another impediment was nature. The winds on the building's top were constantly changing due to strong air currents, making it difficult for dirigibles to handle. Finally, it was against the law. There was an existing regulation against airships flying too low over urban regions, rendering dirigible docking illegal. In conclusion, the dirigibles faced multiple obstacles that prevented them from docking at the Empire State Building.
1568	16401	6	2	3. Dirigibles had a top speed of 80 miles per hour and could cruise at 70 miles per hour for thousands of miles without refueling. Some dirigibles were as long as 1000 feet, equivalent to the length of four blocks in New York City. The lack of a suitable landing area in New York was an obstacle to their more widespread use. The most significant challenge to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong air currents. Overall, these factors limited the use of dirigibles in New York and the effectiveness of the mooring mast.
1569	16402	6	2	4. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the workers constructing the Empire State Building faced many difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. Initially, Al Smith, who led the construction of the Empire State Building, aimed to win “the title of world's tallest building” against the architect of the Chrysler Building. He then came up with an idea to make his building taller. Al Smith decided to add a mooring mast for dirigibles. The building had to be modified and strengthened, with over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications made. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted experts to ensure safety. However, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building never fulfilled its purpose. Docking dirigibles at the building, where they would dangle above pedestrians, was neither practical nor safe.
1570	16403	6	2	5. When building the Empire State Building, the builders had to overcome multiple obstacles to enable dirigibles to dock. The first issue was the attachment point for dirigibles. The builders thought adding a mooring mast would simplify docking but initially overlooked the building's foundation. They later realized the foundation was not strong enough, so they spent over an additional sixty thousand dollars to reinforce it. They also had to figure out how passengers would board, as well as provide space for baggage and ticketing. To solve these problems, a glassed - in observation area and an open observation platform were built. Another obstacle was the existing airship law regarding low - flying. Dirigibles violated this law, which also made the idea of using the mast for docking unfeasible. After several failed docking attempts, the idea was abandoned, and the builders accepted that the plan would not work.
1571	16404	6	2	1. Making the top of the Empire State Building a dirigible docking area was initially a promising concept that could have resolved the issue of insufficient landing space for dirigibles. However, flaws in the idea emerged after the building's construction was finished. One flaw was the presence of violent air - currents around the building. These air - currents kept the winds in constant motion, causing the rear of the dirigible to spin around until it potentially hit the building. Another significant flaw was that most dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. If a dirigible were to explode like the Hindenburg did on May 6, 1937, in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the flaming debris would fall on the people near the building. Even if these flaws could have been fixed, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Thus, docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building would have been illegal, rendering the idea unfeasible.
1572	16405	6	2	2. During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous challenges in enabling dirigibles to dock there. The first hurdle was determining how to get the dirigible onto the building. After consulting with the Navy and meeting with the president of a newly - formed airship transport company, they thought they had overcome the initial difficulties. However, more obstacles awaited. As construction progressed, they realized that dirigibles landing on the building would add stress to its frame. Modifications to the building's frame were necessary to address this issue, and these modifications cost over @MONEY1. Although the first two obstacles were resolved, subsequent problems halted the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. Safety concerns were a major setback. Many dirigibles used extremely flammable gases, and docking at high altitudes with constantly shifting air currents was extremely dangerous. These risks were further magnified in a densely populated area. While the build team managed to overcome some obstacles, others presented too many potential problems to be resolved, ultimately preventing dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building.
1573	16406	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. Firstly, a thousand - foot dirigible attached to the building would place a significant amount of stress on its frame. As a result, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Secondly, safety was a crucial factor. Most dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. The destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire on May 6, 1937, in Lakehurst, New Jersey, made the building's owners realize how much more disastrous such an accident would be if it occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Finally, nature posed the greatest challenge. Violent air currents created shifting winds, causing the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, which was unsafe for pedestrians below. In conclusion, these obstacles collectively made it impossible for the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to serve its intended purpose.
1574	16407	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, with nature being a major factor. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Another issue was that the builders failed to check the city's laws. In urban areas like New York City, it is illegal for an aircraft to fly at a low altitude. This law prohibited dirigibles from tying up to the building or even approaching the area. The most significant obstacle was related to public safety. If a dirigible caught fire over a highly populated city like New York, the consequences would be catastrophic. For example, when the German dirigible Hindenburg went down in flames in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the accident would have been far worse in a densely populated area, resulting in many more casualties. In summary, these obstacles made it unviable to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1575	16408	6	2	5. While constructing the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous difficulties. First, they had to ensure that the large and heavy dirigible, combined with the force of the wind, would not damage the building's framework. The stress from the dirigible and wind would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation at the bottom. If this issue was not addressed, the building could have been destroyed. Even before dealing with the framework issue, the workers needed to learn about dirigibles. They consulted with experts and took tours of the equipment to understand how dirigibles fly and how they could be docked on the building. The most important consideration for the workers was public safety. However, it proved impossible to build the mast in a way that would guarantee the safety of the public. Ultimately, these challenges led to the mast never being used as a docking station for dirigibles.
1576	16409	6	2	1. The most significant challenge the constructors of the Empire State Building encountered when aiming to enable dirigibles to dock there was nature. The wings atop the building were constantly in motion because of powerful air currents. Even if dirigibles were tied to the mooring mast, the rear of the vessel would spin around the mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing areas could have their backs weighted with lead, but using such weights at the Empire State Building, where they would dangle high above street - level pedestrians, was neither practical nor safe.
1577	16410	6	2	"2. In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous hurdles while trying to make it suitable for dirigible docking. Obstacles included legal changes and aspects of the building that were overlooked during the idea - forming stage. After devising a plan to add a mast on the building's top as a docking point for dirigibles, the new airships, they finally examined the flaws in the existing plan. During the mast's design, architects realized that simply placing a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's flat roof was not feasible. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the building's top by a single cable would stress the building's frame. When formulating their plan, the builders failed to consider that the dirigibles' load would stress the entire building. The greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on the building's top shifted constantly due to strong air currents, and since airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas, fulfilling the dirigible - docking idea became difficult due to these multiple obstacles."
1578	16411	6	2	"3. An excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted details the challenges the Empire State Building's constructors faced in enabling dirigible docking. After the German dirigible Hindenburg's fiery destruction, the risk of a similar accident in a densely populated area like New York was a concern, as most international dirigibles used flammable hydrogen instead of helium. The nature of the mooring mast and the violent air currents causing wind shifts were also problems. Having a dirigible moored at the building's top, held by a single cable, dangling above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. Existing laws prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. The project's architects were so enthralled by the novelty of the idea that they overlooked these potential difficulties. These issues and unsolved problems led to the mooring mast's lack of success, and the idea was eventually abandoned and forgotten."
1579	16412	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous issues when trying to create a landing place for dirigibles. They had to be extremely cautious when constructing the docking platform. Dirigibles, or blimps, were large transportation vehicles made of steel and cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium. Since hydrogen is flammable, the builders had to be careful with power and electricity supplies. To allow a blimp to dock more than @NUM1 feet in the air on the Empire State Building, they needed to reinforce the building's framing so it could withstand bad weather and remain stable. Due to these problems and the precautions the builders had to take, constructing the mast was a failure, and future transportation shifted towards airplanes.
1580	16413	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building confronted multiple obstacles when attempting to facilitate dirigible docking. One challenge was the need to reconstruct the building to add the mast. The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. The mast itself was an additional obstacle. Moreover, they had to meet all safety requirements. The mast was destined not to fulfill its purpose, as issues that should have been evident before construction were overlooked. After identifying potential problems with dirigible docking, the original purpose of the mast could not be achieved. Another hurdle was testing the dirigible - docking plan. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up. This attempt failed, and the concept of dirigible docking faded away in the late 1930s. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles in their endeavor to enable dirigible docking.
1581	16414	6	2	"1. The architects of the Empire State Building encountered numerous safety and practical challenges when considering allowing dirigibles to dock on its summit. Dirigibles outside the United States typically used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. This was tragically demonstrated in 1937 when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire. The architects recognized that such an incident occurring over a densely - populated area like downtown New York would have been far more catastrophic. Moreover, anchoring a large dirigible to the building's top with a single tether would stress the building's frame, necessitating modifications to the steel framework at a cost of @MONEY1. The area above the Empire State Building is also characterized by violent and unpredictable winds. A tethered dirigible would swivel around the building's spire with the wind. While dirigibles can be anchored with weights in open fields, doing so above pedestrians in a city setting is dangerous. In 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" attempted to moor at the Empire State Building but was unable to get close enough to the spire due to strong winds, and the pilot had to avoid other spires to prevent puncturing the dirigible. Evidently, there were valid practical and safety reasons that precluded the successful establishment of a dirigible mooring at the top of the Empire State Building."
1582	16415	6	2	2. Al Smith and his architectural team faced numerous problems when they planned to construct a mooring mast on the Empire State Building for dirigible docking. Prior to construction, they realized that landing a dirigible on the building's flat roof was not feasible. They needed to make over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the framework before considering dirigible docking. After completing the conical top of the building, the project team understood that several factors made dirigible docking impossible. Firstly, it was dangerous for the city's residents as dirigibles contained highly flammable hydrogen. An accident similar to the Hindenburg disaster in New York City would cause devastating damage. Secondly, natural factors were an obstacle. The powerful air currents made the air too turbulent, and a landed dirigible would swivel around the building's spire. Although lead weights could be used to stabilize dirigibles in open fields, this was unsafe for those below. Finally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Despite the architects' good idea, they only recognized the impracticality of their plan after construction. In conclusion, these multiple challenges prevented the successful implementation of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1583	16416	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building confronted significant obstacles in their attempt to enable dirigible docking. Many dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas that could cause explosions. A notable example is the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed by fire on May 6, 1937, in Lakehurst, New Jersey. There is always a risk of similar incidents occurring. The most significant hurdle was nature itself. The winds at the building's summit were constantly changing due to violent air currents. Even when tethered to the mooring mast, the rear of the dirigible would rotate around it. In open landing fields, dirigibles could be weighted with lead weights, but this was neither practical nor safe at the Empire State Building, where the weights would dangle above pedestrians. Additionally, there was a law restricting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This was because strong winds could blow the dirigible into other buildings, puncturing its shell and causing extensive damage. In summary, these obstacles made it extremely difficult to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1584	16417	6	2	"4. In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in enabling dirigible docking. The architects could not simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof as a solid support structure was required for a dirigible. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. A fire involving a dirigible in the middle of New York City would have severe consequences. Moreover, the changing wind speeds would cause the dirigible to sway in the air, leading to stability issues. In conclusion, the passage shows that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."
1585	16418	6	2	5. When inventing or constructing something, numerous obstacles often arise. The primary obstacle in the case of the Empire State Building's dirigible - docking plans was safety. Without adequate safety measures, no one would choose to travel on a dirigible, and there would be no business. The wind at the building's top was also a major problem. An unsteady dirigible during unloading is extremely unsafe. The building's structure itself presented a challenge as modifying the building's skeleton is an expensive endeavor. The architects tried to find solutions to these problems but were unsuccessful. Although these are the major obstacles they faced, there is a possibility that one day, solutions will be found to make dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a reality.
1586	16419	6	2	"1. In ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building's builders encountered challenges while trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One significant issue was nature. The winds atop the building were in a constant state of shift because of violent air currents. This made it perilous for dirigibles to turn around the building above pedestrians. Another obstacle was that dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the Empire State Building's owners were reluctant to have a dirigible catch fire above a densely - populated area like downtown New York. The final hurdle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law rendered it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. These difficulties explain why the attempt to use the Empire State Building for dirigible docking did not succeed."
1587	16420	6	2	"2. The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple problems regarding dirigibles. Violent air currents above the building were a major issue. As dirigibles tried to dock, these currents would constantly push the ships, and when docked, they would sway the back end. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which effectively made it illegal to dock an airship on the Empire State Building. As described in ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia L¸sted, these obstacles are the reasons the spire at the top of the Empire State Building was never used for dirigible docking."
1588	16421	6	2	3. There were numerous obstacles preventing dirigibles from docking. The design of how the mast would be utilized was not well - thought - out. Most dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, instead of helium. Since the dirigible would be in close proximity to pedestrians and other buildings, using the mast was unwise. Additionally, there was a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low in urban areas, which they would have to do if attaching to the mast. Moreover, the wind force could spin the back of the dirigible around the mast. The proposed solution of placing heavy blocks at the back could cause them to fall on pedestrians. In conclusion, there were many justifiable reasons why allowing dirigibles to dock was an unreasonable idea.
1589	16422	6	2	4. The project of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. One problem was that non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, a much more flammable substance than the helium used by US dirigibles. The building's owners were wary of a disaster similar to the German dirigible Hindenburg, which would be even more catastrophic in downtown New York compared to Lakehurst, New Jersey. Another practical issue was an existing law that prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas. For instance, the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible named the Los Angeles couldn't get close enough to tie up due to strong winds. These problems clearly demonstrate that the Empire State Building's owners faced many challenges in enabling dirigible docking.
1590	16423	6	2	5. The Empire State Building's builders constructed two floors specifically for passengers to drop off their luggage. These floors offered a view, but when the idea didn't work out, the money spent on these extra rooms was wasted. They also began working on making dirigibles dock on the top. However, this endeavor consumed a great deal of time and money, ultimately resulting in a complete waste. Overall, the attempts to create facilities for passengers and dirigible docking at the Empire State Building were not successful and led to a significant loss of resources.
1591	16424	6	2	1. The Empire State Building was designed with the ambition of becoming the world's tallest building and had a unique concept: it was initially planned to serve as a mooring mast for dirigibles. However, numerous challenges arose in turning this concept into reality. One major issue was the use of dangerous gases in the balloons. Most dirigibles from outside a certain location used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This posed a significant threat to the safety of New York City civilians. Another problem was the wind. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around it, dangling high above street - level pedestrians, which was neither practical nor safe. Additionally, there was a legal hurdle. An existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it impossible for ships to moor. Despite the good intentions of the builders, they failed to fully grasp the practical realities of the situation, and the idea of using the building as a mooring mast was ultimately unfeasible.
1592	16425	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. As noted, a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top, held by a single cable tether, would exert stress on the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transferred all the way to the nearly eleven - hundred - foot - deep foundation. Wind was another significant obstacle. The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around it. While dirigibles moored in open fields could be weighted down with lead weights at the back, using such weights at the Empire State Building was unsafe as they would dangle above pedestrians. In conclusion, these challenges made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1593	16426	6	2	3. Constructing the mooring mast was a challenging task, as this futuristic design was accompanied by numerous problems. The dirigibles, which could be up to one thousand feet long, were very heavy and swayed dangerously in the wind. It was also against the law for airships to fly at a low level over urban areas, and there was a high risk of a dirigible crashing or catching fire over the densely populated area of New York. Despite these seemingly insurmountable problems, the builders attempted to make the project more feasible. They modified and strengthened the steel frame of the Empire State Building to support the dirigibles and wind pressure. However, the strong and constantly shifting winds made the swaying of dirigibles unsafe and impractical. They managed to bypass the law and made one docking attempt, but it was unsuccessful. Given past incidents like the Hindenburg crash, an accident over a densely populated area would be disastrous. Due to these and other issues, the idea of using a mooring mast to dock dirigibles was ultimately abandoned.
1594	16427	6	2	4. Initially, when the idea of a mooring dock for dirigibles emerged, it seemed like a brilliant concept. However, as time passed and construction progressed, the increasing number of obstacles made it clear that this would remain just an idea. Once the mooring mast was completed, obvious safety hazards prevented it from fulfilling its intended purpose. The most significant safety hazard was related to the nature of the mast itself. At that height, the winds were strong, violent, and constantly changing. Even if a dirigible was tethered, the back of the ship would be swirled around the mooring mast. Another hazard was that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized they couldn't take the risk. Finally, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for a ship to approach the building. In the end, these obstacles ensured that the mooring dock idea could not be implemented.
1595	16428	6	2	5. The engineers faced the typical challenges of any builder. They had to consider factors such as appropriate height, wind conditions, the sturdiness of the frame, and the payroll for the engineers. Al Smith, while not facing all the same problems, had to re - evaluate the idea of the mooring mast. The thought of having a thousand - foot something dangling from a 1,250 - foot - high building was a cause for concern. Al Smith aimed to create a landmark for the United States. However, it was a misstep to place a non - usable mooring mast at the top of the building. In conclusion, the impracticality of the mooring mast idea became evident, and it should not have been included in the building's design.
1596	16429	6	2	1. The construction team of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 utilized hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. A small spark within the dirigible could cause it to burst into flames. Additionally, the winds atop the building were constantly changing due to strong air - currents. This made docking a dirigible highly dangerous, and weights would be required to anchor the back of the dirigible. Moreover, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Having an airship so close to a densely populated area was against the law. As a result, the idea of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was abandoned.
1597	16430	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered significant natural and social opposition when attempting to allow dirigibles to land on the building. Natural forces posed a major threat to the dirigibles' landing. The winds on the building's top were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. This was unsafe for passengers boarding and disembarking as the dirigible would spin around the mooring mast. Another issue was that most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, endangering the lives of those living around the building. There was also a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building illegal. In conclusion, the builders had to face both natural and social hurdles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to land at the building.
1598	16431	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to permit dirigibles to dock there. The dirigibles needed to be modified and strengthened, which cost over @MONEY1. These modifications were necessary for the dirigibles to dock. In summary, these were the challenges the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome to enable dirigible docking.
1599	16432	6	2	4. The builders had several obstacles to overcome to allow dirigibles to dock. They had to ensure that the building was of sufficient height and durability. These requirements were essential for the successful docking of dirigibles. In conclusion, these were the key challenges the builders faced in facilitating dirigible docking.
1600	16433	6	2	5. When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders faced multiple obstacles. Firstly, the building's structure was not suitable to hold a @NUM1 - foot dirigible, and modifications costing at least sixty thousand dollars were needed. Secondly, the dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Given that the building was in a populated area like downtown New York, there was a risk of a dangerous incident. Thirdly, the mooring mast was constantly affected by the surrounding natural environment, and the dirigibles' wear - and - tear on it posed a danger to the people in New York. In conclusion, these were the main obstacles the builders encountered in allowing dirigibles to dock near the Empire State Building.
1601	16434	6	2	1. The construction of the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges to its builders, particularly in enabling dirigibles to dock there. The question of how to accommodate dirigibles was a significant concern. High winds and legal restrictions posed major obstacles. The building's frame required reinforcement to prevent it from collapsing. Additionally, the installation of landing gear had to be postponed due to construction scheduling. When a dirigible attempted to land, it was unable to do so because the air streams were too strong. Ultimately, the idea of using the building for dirigible docking proved unrealistic, as high winds and laws precluded its use for this purpose.
1602	16435	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. The primary obstacle was ensuring the safety of pedestrians and the building itself. Most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. The builders were concerned that a dirigible explosion could endanger pedestrians and set the entire building on fire. In conclusion, safety was the main hurdle the builders faced when attempting to facilitate dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1603	16436	6	2	3. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building confronted multiple obstacles while trying to permit dirigibles to dock at the building. @PERSON1 stated in the excerpt, “The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area.” This indicates that sufficient landing space was necessary for dirigibles to dock on the building's top. Adding a mooring mast to the building would only allow dirigibles to anchor for a few hours for refueling, servicing, and passenger boarding and alighting. Another practical reason dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Moreover, architects could not simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top, held by a single cable tether, could stress the building's frame. As a result, the builders did not allow dirigibles to dock on the building, considering all the potential risks to the building.
1604	16437	6	2	4. According to the excerpt, the Empire State Building's builders faced many challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on its mooring mast. A large dirigible moored at the building's top would exert tremendous stress, necessitating “over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications” to handle the load. Even when tethered to the mooring mast, winds would cause the dirigible's rear to rotate around the mast. The article suggests that weighting down dirigibles could prevent this, but it would pose a safety risk to pedestrians. There was also the issue of docking hydrogen - using dirigibles, as hydrogen is highly flammable. On May 6, 1937, a hydrogen dirigible was destroyed by fire. The excerpt notes that the Empire State Building's owners realized that such an accident in downtown New York would make the densely populated area unsafe. In conclusion, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was doomed to never serve its intended purpose due to the numerous obstacles.
1605	16438	6	2	5. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building's builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Building a mast was far more complex than expected, as they had to consider factors such as the dirigible's load and wind pressure. “The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework.” Just as the builders thought they were finished, Al Smith added a 250 - foot mooring mast to the top of the building. Despite facing numerous obstacles and challenges, the builders managed to complete the project.
1606	16439	6	2	1. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered a significant obstacle when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there: nature. Violent air - currents caused the winds on the building's top to constantly shift. As a result, the back of the dirigible would spin around the mooring mast repeatedly, making docking extremely difficult.
1607	16440	6	2	2. Workers constructing the magnificent Empire State Building faced multiple challenges. One was getting the blimp to stay on the building's top. Since the heavy blimp was held by just one cable, it put stress on the building. Nature was another hurdle; the high - altitude location of the Empire State Building meant the wind was extremely strong. The last challenge was the gas used in the blimps. Using hydrogen, a highly flammable substance like in German blimps, could have had disastrous consequences. In the end, these challenges made the task of accommodating blimps at the building very difficult.
1608	16441	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced an obstacle in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock: an existing law. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, dirigibles were prohibited from mooring at the Empire State Building because of a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a dirigible to tie to or even approach the mooring mast. In conclusion, this legal restriction effectively precluded dirigibles from docking at the building.
1609	16442	6	2	4. The Empire State Building's builders faced numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock. Firstly, “the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents” (@CAPS1 @NUM1), which made it difficult to tether dirigibles to the mast. Secondly, there were “existing laws against airships flying too low over urban areas” (@CAPS1 @NUM2). Additionally, the equipment for docking airships had not been installed. These combined issues made it very challenging, if not impossible, for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1610	16443	6	2	5. In the @NUM1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock. The architects couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the flat roof. If they did, the moored dirigible would add stress to the building's frame, endangering the lives of tourists and workers. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transferred to the nearly eleven - hundred - foot - below foundation, requiring the building's frame to be modified and strengthened. This cost over sixty thousand dollars in modifications. Ultimately, the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock failed. Safety was a major concern as most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. Today, the rooms set aside for baggage are a soda fountain and tea garden, and the highest observation deck remains closed to the public.
1611	16444	6	2	1. When attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous challenges. Firstly, a thousand - foot dirigible on top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would impose stress on the building's frame. To prevent collapse, the entire building would need to be reinforced if the dirigible dock were constructed. Secondly, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is flammable. Given the high population density of the area, the risk of a dirigible explosion was unacceptable. Thirdly, at a certain height, the weather, particularly the wind, was a significant issue. The air currents were so strong that the dirigible would spin around the mooring mast. Dirigibles typically land in open fields and are anchored by lead, but having lead weights dangling above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. Finally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. Despite the dirigible dock being a great concept, these multiple problems meant the mooring mast could not be fully operational. On a positive note, this situation contributed to the Empire State Building becoming the tallest in the world.
1612	16445	6	2	"2. The Empire State Building's builders faced numerous obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was the need to strengthen the building's framework to support the mast on top. As the author noted, this would involve ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework."" Another problem was the violent air currents at the top of the building. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around it, posing a risk to people on the streets below. Lastly, local laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. If a dirigible were to dock on the mooring mast, it would violate this law. Due to these many problems, the builders' plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building never came to fruition."
1613	16446	6	2	"3. The Empire State Building encountered several obstacles in its attempt to enable dirigibles to dock. The most significant was the danger associated with the plan. Dirigibles from outside @LOCATION3 often used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. After a German dirigible was destroyed in a fire, the owners of the Empire State Building recognized the potential disaster of such an accident in downtown New York. Another hurdle was the difficulty of successful docking. The high - altitude winds made docking challenging, and once docked, the dirigibles would dangle above pedestrians, which was deemed ""neither practical nor safe."" Existing laws against airships flying too low in urban areas also created problems. After the Los Angeles failed to reach the mooring mast because of high winds, the owners became aware of the unsolved issues. By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigible docking had ""quietly disappeared."""
1614	16447	6	2	"4. According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, constructing a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was hampered by multiple obstacles. Initially, the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would damage the building's frame. To address this, builders made ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications... to the building's framework"" (page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2). After the mast was built, more challenges emerged. Most dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the builders realized the danger of a similar incident in densely - populated New York City. The most significant obstacle was ""nature itself."" The constantly shifting winds on top of the building due to air currents would cause the back of the dirigible to spin around the mast. Using lead weights to fix this was considered, but having them dangle above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. The final and most obvious obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Although the builders and owners overcame the initial construction - related obstacle, subsequent challenges prevented the mooring mast from achieving its intended purpose."
1615	16448	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. Firstly, dirigibles couldn't simply land on the building's top. A thousand - foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame, and the load and wind pressure would need to be transmitted to the foundation nearly eleven hundred feet below. This required over @MONEY1 worth of modifications. Secondly, nature was a problem. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. Tethering the dirigible was not an option as lead weights would dangle above pedestrians. Finally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. These obstacles meant that the mooring mast could never fulfill its intended purpose.
1616	16449	6	2	1. The construction of the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges. One significant hurdle was the lack of a suitable landing area, which restricted the building's potential for accommodating new airships. To address this, the Empire State Building was designed with a mooring mast at its top to dock these airships. These airships were intended to serve passengers on existing trans - Atlantic routes as well as new ones.
1617	16450	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several issues when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were to be docked using an electric winch, which would extend a line from the front of the ship and then tie it to the mast. The dirigibles' bodies could sway in the breeze, yet passengers were expected to safely embark and disembark by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. To overcome these challenges, the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building sought advice from experts. They visited the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey, to study the equipment and mooring operations.
1618	16451	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced cost and safety obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Modifying and strengthening the building's steel frame to accommodate this new function would cost over @MONEY1. Additionally, most countries outside the U.S. used highly flammable hydrogen in dirigibles. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making docking unsafe. These were the major challenges they had to overcome.
1619	16452	6	2	4. During the construction of the Empire State Building, some workers faced difficulties. The engineers and architects first consulted experts. The height of the building, a thousand feet, put stress on its frame, and wind pressure added to this stress. Nature also posed a problem, as the winds constantly shifted due to violent air currents. Even when the mooring mast was tethered, the back of the ship would sway in the wind. In the end, the author implies that due to these numerous problems, the building might not have been meant to be built.
1620	16453	6	2	5. The plan to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building became unfeasible due to safety concerns and unsuccessful test runs. Some dirigibles used flammable hydrogen instead of helium. The owners of the Empire State Building recognized the potential severity of an accident if it occurred above a densely - populated area. Placing a dock in the heart of New York City would risk the lives of many passengers and citizens. When the dock was in place, two dirigibles attempted to land but failed. Wind was a major issue; for example, the dirigible Los Angeles could not get close enough to the mooring mast to tie up because of strong winds. These various dangers ultimately prevented the plan from being realized.
1621	16454	6	2	1. When constructing the Empire State Building and its mast to enable dirigibles to dock atop the building, the builders encountered several significant obstacles. These included mast design and building modifications, safety concerns, and existing aircraft - related laws. Designing the mast was a challenge as a moored dirigible would exert stress on the building's frame. To transfer the load and pressure to the building's base, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were required. Safety was another crucial issue. Most countries used flammable hydrogen in their balloons for buoyancy, unlike the United States, which used helium. The building owners were wary of a repeat of the Hindenburg disaster. Additionally, weighted dirigibles, commonly using lead weights, were a danger to pedestrians below as an un - weighted dirigible would spin around the mast. The final major obstacle was the law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to approach and tether to the building. In conclusion, these design, safety, and legal obstacles ultimately hindered the builders' plans for the dirigible docking station.
1622	16455	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous safety - related problems. Al Smith, aiming to construct a building larger than the Chrysler Building, decided to install a mooring mast for dirigibles on top. Before starting the mooring mast construction, the building's frame had to be modified. Otherwise, simply adding the mast on top would stress the frame and potentially cause it to collapse. The landing of dirigibles also presented an issue. While they could be weighted down on flat land, doing so on top of a building was risky as there were many people below who could be injured if something went wrong. There was also a law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areas that the builders had to navigate around. In the end, safety for the people emerged as the most significant obstacle the builders had to overcome.
1623	16456	6	2	3. During the construction of the Empire State Building, the architects encountered multiple obstacles. One of the primary challenges was ensuring the foundation was strong enough. Another was dealing with the wind factor. To allow dirigibles to dock on the building, the entire foundation had to be strengthened. If a dirigible docked without proper reinforcement, the building would twist and sway. The wind was also a major problem. Wind coming off other buildings could spin the dirigibles at high speeds. Despite these numerous obstacles, the architects managed to successfully complete the Empire State Building. This achievement demonstrated their ability to overcome significant construction challenges.
1624	16457	6	2	"4. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous hurdles when trying to add a dirigible docking station at the top. As stated, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Wind posed a severe safety hazard by spinning the rear of docked dirigibles. Dirigibles are also highly flammable, and an explosion like the Hindenburg at the top of the building would have been catastrophic. Moreover, attempting to moor a dirigible was not only dangerous but also illegal, as there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In addition to these, it was a daunting task for the builders. They had to learn new technologies at the U.S. Naval Air Station and realized they needed to strengthen the building's frame, with over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications required. These obstacles were substantial enough to prevent the use of the mooring station."
1625	16458	6	2	5. In their efforts to build a docking platform for dirigibles at the Empire State Building, the builders overlooked several difficulties. One problem was related to passenger boarding and disembarking. When a dirigible was anchored for refueling and passenger transfer, the rear of the blimp would constantly swivel. This could endanger the passengers and potentially damage or destroy the dirigible. Another issue was the mast's design. It resembled that of a rocket, preventing dirigibles from making a complete landing. A platform - like design would have allowed dirigibles to land instead of hover, providing greater stability. In conclusion, these design and operational difficulties likely contributed to the ineffectiveness of the planned dirigible docking platform.
1626	16459	6	2	1. The construction of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building to enable dirigible docking presented numerous challenges to the builders. To address these, they sought expert advice, visited facilities to understand mooring mast - building equipment, and made arrangements for dirigible services. Prior to mast construction, the architects toured the equipment at @ORGANIZATION1. They also met with the president of a trans - Pacific airship transport company. Figuring out a safe way to moor dirigibles to the mast was a difficult and time - consuming task. The building's foundation couldn't simply support a mast placed on the flat roof, so the architects had to take it into account. Over @MONEY1 was spent on modifying the building's frame and foundation. All these factors were significant obstacles in the architects' endeavor to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building.
1627	16460	6	2	2. Builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple challenges while trying to enable dirigible docking. One issue was related to the building's frame. The landing area had to be designed in a way that a dirigible's landing wouldn't exert excessive stress on the frame. Another problem was the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, this stress needed to be transferred to the nearly eleven - hundred - foot - deep foundation, making it a significant concern. After realizing the necessary adjustments and the need to strengthen the steel frame, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were required. These were the hurdles faced by the architects in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1628	16461	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building aimed to enable dirigibles to safely dock at the top for refueling or repairs. Although the idea excited people, they were aware of its difficulty. The building plan had to be revised because the Chrysler building's builders tried to make their building taller. Al Smith, determined not to let this happen, decided to make the Empire State Building even taller, reaching 1,250 feet. Additionally, constructing a stable dock on the flat roof was challenging as it was unstable, and construction at such a height is arduous. Al Smith's determination inspired the workers, but over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework were necessary, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. The dock's usability was also weather - dependent. Dirigibles, some as long as one thousand feet (equivalent to four New York City blocks), were dangerous when swaying near the city, building, and civilians due to violent wind currents. Moreover, an existing law prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas, which was a major factor in the failed attempt. Despite the architects' dedication and good intentions, their ideas were too impractical for the dock to succeed.
1629	16462	6	2	"4. In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's excerpt from ""The @CAPS1 Mast"", it is noted that architects faced challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One significant issue was the use of hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and in a densely populated area like New York, any mishap could lead to a major problem. The nature of the environment also posed a threat. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the dirigible to potentially swivel around the mast, endangering pedestrians below. These challenges ultimately led to the mooring mast not being used as originally planned."
1630	16463	6	2	5. It's regrettable that the great idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building never came to fruition. The builders faced many difficulties. First, designing the mast was a long and complex process. Initially, it seemed that everything would work out, and construction began. However, after two months, the mooring mast couldn't serve its intended purpose. Hydrogen, being highly flammable, was too dangerous for a highly populated area. Wind and natural factors made the idea unfeasible, and existing laws would have prohibited it. If the builders and planners had conducted more thorough research, they would have realized the project's impossibility before starting the intense construction.
1631	16464	6	2	1. The construction of the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges for the builders aiming to enable dirigibles to dock. Initially, the risk of using non - American dirigibles was a significant concern. Many non - American dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is far more flammable than the helium used in American balloons. To prevent a repeat of a dirigible explosion, as L¸sted states, the owners of the Empire State Building recognized the potential severity of an accident if it occurred above downtown New York. Additionally, the wind conditions at the building's summit were too unpredictable to safely attach a dirigible. The author explains that even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swing around. Weighing it down with lead weights was neither practical nor safe, indicating that safely mooring the ship was dangerous. Finally, a law prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas, making it illegal to land a dirigible on the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
1632	16465	6	2	2. One significant factor contributing to the unfeasibility of the plan was the height at which the operations were to take place. The strong and ever - changing winds were a major problem as they caused the back of the blimp to sway. To address the swaying issue, the idea of using lead weights was considered, but it was extremely unsafe to hang weights above pedestrians. Moreover, it was against the law to fly aircraft too close to the ground. These factors, among others, made it clear that the plan was not going to succeed. In conclusion, these reasons combined to show that the proposed operation was fraught with difficulties and ultimately unworkable.
1633	16466	6	2	3. Constructing a dock for dirigibles at the Empire State Building was a misguided endeavor from the start. What initially seemed like a practical and worthwhile concept could have had disastrous consequences if it failed. The builders faced two main obstacles. Firstly, there was a law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas, and having ships constantly hovering over pedestrians would be illegal. Secondly, the entire operation was unsafe due to the constantly changing wind conditions at that height, which could cause the dirigibles to move erratically. In conclusion, having airships dock at the Empire State Building was both illegal and potentially dangerous, making the idea unviable.
1634	16467	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles. One of the issues was creating an area for passengers to embark and disembark when a dirigible landed. To accommodate this, they had to enlarge the platform. Dirigibles typically landed to refuel, and they would only be stationary for a couple of hours. In conclusion, these challenges related to passenger movement and short - term stops added to the complexity of the project for the builders.
1635	16468	6	2	"5. The can builders' first hurdle was the fact that the notion of the Empire State Building being the tallest structure in New York City was no longer valid. As their plan expanded, they faced additional obstacles. Once the design of the construct was finalized, more potential problems emerged. Firstly, it was neither logical nor feasible to ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" because the stress it would place on the frame would be excessive. It was determined that the stress would have to be transmitted through the building's foundation, which was 1100 feet below, resulting in @MONEY1 worth of foundation modifications. Another obstacle was wind pressure. As stated, ""Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" In conclusion, these challenges made the construction and operation of the intended structure a difficult task for the builders."
1636	16469	6	2	1. When constructing the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous obstacles in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, they couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the building's top. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top with a single cable would stress the building's frame. Secondly, they would need to change the entire building design to accommodate the mooring dock. Most importantly, safety was the primary concern. As the author noted, many dirigibles from outside the US used hydrogen instead of helium, making them highly flammable. An explosion over densely populated New York would have severe consequences. Due to these reasons, the mooring dock on top of the Empire State Building was never realized.
1637	16470	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was that many non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable as stated in the text. The German Hindenburg's fire destruction proved the danger of hydrogen - filled dirigibles. A similar incident over New York would have terrible results. Another safety concern was the constantly shifting winds on top of the building caused by violent air currents, which would endanger the dirigible passengers. Additionally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over areas like New York, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or approach the area. These three obstacles ultimately hindered the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1638	16471	6	2	3. When architect Al Smith designed the Empire State Building, he had the concept of futuristic dirigible travel in mind. However, as described in The Mooring Mast, he faced many challenges in enabling dirigibles to dock at this massive structure. Mooring a dirigible to the top would stress the building's frame, so Smith had to modify the frame, transmitting pressure down to the foundation. Foreign dirigibles were also a problem; most used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. A fire from a docked dirigible could quickly spread to the city. Nature added to the difficulties. The changing winds on the building's top would cause the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast, endangering pedestrians. Due to these obstacles, the idea of a dirigible mooring was abandoned, yet the mast remains today.
1639	16472	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several significant obstacles. The building's height of @NUM1 feet presented a challenge. There was also the issue of how passengers would board and disembark. Dirigibles take a long time to slow down, which added to the complexity. With 102 floors, an observation deck on the 101st floor, and a boarding/observation deck on the 102nd for blimp passengers, the building's structure had to be carefully considered. Moreover, docking the blimps was a difficult task, and determining how many blimps could dock simultaneously was also a major hurdle. These obstacles made the implementation of blimp docking at the Empire State Building extremely challenging.
1640	16473	6	2	"5. In the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by @PERSON1, the architects of the Empire State Building faced difficulties in allowing dirigibles to dock. One problem was the lack of a suitable landing area. They couldn't just place a @CAPS1 mast on the building as it would stress the frame, so they had to strengthen and modify it. Another obstacle was that most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, which was extremely dangerous over a densely populated area like downtown New York. Nature was also a major problem, with constantly shifting winds due to violent air currents, making the idea impractical and unsafe. Finally, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas made the plan illegal and unfeasible. These obstacles prevented the successful implementation of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
1641	16474	6	2	"1. @CAPS1, also known as blimps, were regarded as the future of transportation. Resembling balloons, they were constructed of steel and featured rubber components, along with propellers for control. These steel - made ""balloons"" could travel at a speed of eighty miles per hour. The Empire State Building was unable to dock these airships mainly because most @CAPS1 from outside the United States utilized hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and can lead to accidents. As a result, the docking of @CAPS1 at the Empire State Building remained unfeasible."
1642	16475	6	2	2. Once the construction of the Mooring Mast on the Empire State Building was finished, the builders started to encounter problems that should have been anticipated from the start. In the United States, there is a law that restricts aircraft from flying close to or around cities and buildings. This meant that blimps could not be tethered to the mast. Additionally, the highly volatile and ever - changing weather and wind posed significant challenges. The wind would blow the blimps in all directions, and it was not safe to weigh them down with lead blocks over the city as they would be hanging above populated areas. With the erratic winds, blimps (mostly filled with hydrogen) could be punctured and catch fire, endangering people on the ground. Despite these obvious problems, the attempt was made. However, these obstacles were never overcome, and the mooring mast remains unused to this day.
1643	16476	6	2	"3. The Mooring Mast, written by @ORGANIZATION2, focuses on the Empire State Building and the expectations people had for it. In @DATE1, it was announced that the Empire State Building would reach a height of 1,250 feet. The article aims to show that the builders of the Empire State Building tried to turn another idea into reality: allowing dirigibles to dock there. However, they faced several obstacles. The building was not stable enough to support dirigibles, requiring additional framework. There were also potential dangers associated with this idea. As stated, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add too much stress to the building's frame."" Consequently, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" After a dirigible was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that if such an accident occurred downtown @CAPS1, the consequences would be far worse. In the end, it was a wise decision not to pursue this idea."
1644	16477	6	2	"4. In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. The Mooring Mast was destined to fail from the start. Safety was the primary reason for its failure. Most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. An accident involving a hydrogen - filled dirigible over downtown New York would have been catastrophic. As the text mentions, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated area."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) Nature also presented a major hurdle. Violent air currents and strong winds made it difficult to fly dirigibles near the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) Due to air currents and safety concerns, the Mooring Mast was a non - starter, and dirigibles were never able to land there."
1645	16478	6	2	"5. When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock, they faced multiple obstacles. One issue was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith proposed that adding a mooring mast to the top of the building would enable dirigibles to anchor for refueling and passenger boarding and alighting. Another problem was that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and the owners of the Empire State Building considered it unsafe for a dirigible to catch fire over a densely populated area. The most significant obstacle was the interaction between the mooring mast and nature. As described, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The building's owners feared that if something went wrong, the dirigible would dangle above pedestrians on the street, which was highly unsafe. In conclusion, these obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1646	16479	6	2	"1. During the attempt to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, numerous obstacles emerged. The stress exerted by blimps docking on the building would be excessive. As stated, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Additionally, dirigibles were highly flammable, and in the densely - populated area of New York, it was neither practical nor safe. Laws restricting airships from flying too low over urban areas also went against the idea. Despite this, two dirigibles made attempts to reach the building before the entire concept was abandoned."
1647	16480	6	2	"2. Construction workers encountered multiple obstacles while building the Empire State Building. One significant obstacle was the height. Since they aimed to make it the tallest building in the world, they had to ensure sufficient technological capabilities. They also added an extra seventeen floors, increasing the building's total to 102 floors from its original number. Another obstacle was safety. The construction workers failed to thoroughly examine problems related to building the mooring mast. As the author in paragraph @NUM2 stated, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mass at such a height made it advisable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" This implies that during the design of the mooring mast, certain issues were overlooked, leading to a delay in the final installation. Despite these obstacles, the construction team successfully built the Empire State Building, the tallest building at the time."
1648	16481	6	2	"3. The Empire State Building encountered difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles, often referred to as ""enormous steel - framed balloons"" or blimps, to dock there. One of the primary problems was the pressure on the building caused by the dirigibles. As mentioned in the excerpt The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 by @ORGANIZATION2, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (paragraph @NUM1). To strengthen and adapt to this new situation of dirigibles docking, over @MONEY1 was spent on modifications."
1649	16482	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. Firstly, the stress from the mass of the dirigible and wind pressure would be transmitted to the building's foundation. Thus, the building's frame needed to be strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Safety was also a major concern. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is flammable. In the densely - populated New York City, a fire on a dirigible could cause widespread destruction. The most significant obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building constantly shifted due to violent air currents. If a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around it. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately unfeasible.
1650	16483	6	2	"5. The builders of the Empire State Building confronted numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. When designing the mast, architects had to deal with issues such as wind pressure, safety, and practicality. The building's frame was not strong enough to withstand the stress and wind pressure from the dirigible's load. If the building was to handle the movement of a dirigible attached by a single cable tether, its foundation, approximately @NUM1 feet below, would have required strengthening and modification. Safety was the most substantial obstacle. Most dirigibles used hydrogen to achieve buoyancy, but hydrogen is highly flammable, posing significant risks. Given the high population density of New York City, the risk of a fire was too great. Moreover, as Marcia Amidon L¸sted put it, ""using these (dirigibles) at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" In the end, these factors made the plan of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building unworkable."
1651	16484	6	2	"1. The construction of the Empire State Building's addition for dirigible docking presented significant challenges to the architects. They had to overcome multiple obstacles, including ensuring the safety of dirigibles and accounting for the constantly changing winds. These issues contributed to the suspension of the plans. Weather conditions played a crucial role in the safety procedures. As stated, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds caused the ships to sway, posing extreme danger. Another problem was that many foreign ships used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, increasing the risk. Specifically, ""Many dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Due to these challenges, the plans for the dirigible docking addition faced significant setbacks."
1652	16485	6	2	2. The builders encountered numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Getting the dirigible to the top was difficult as the wind made it hard to ascend without the risk of it bursting. Safety was also a major concern, especially considering a previous incident where another dirigible caught fire. The gases inside dirigibles are highly flammable, which would create a serious problem. Additionally, the issue of airships flying too low had to be considered, as a dirigible might burst under such conditions. All these factors had to be taken into account when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
1653	16486	6	2	"3. The idea of having the Empire State Building dock and hold dirigibles presented substantial problems for the builders. One issue was related to the mast. Al Smith recognized that the mast would exert excessive pressure on the building's frame. Another concern was the dirigibles themselves. Most non - U.S. dirigibles were filled with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, making it extremely dangerous in the crowded downtown New York area. A third obstacle was the wind; as noted, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Moreover, it was illegal to fly, hold, or dock an aircraft so close to the ground. These numerous issues and dilemmas made it difficult to implement the plan of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building."
1654	16487	6	2	"4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced considerable challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law clearly prohibited a ship from tying up to the building or approaching the area. Dirigibles were designed to be moored in open landing fields, and using lead weights at the Empire State Building, where they would dangle above pedestrians, was neither practical nor safe. Another challenge was the potential risk to the safety of passengers and residents. Since most non - U.S. dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, the landing of dirigibles posed a threat to the population of New York City. The owners of the Empire State Building witnessed these risks when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Additionally, the constantly shifting winds on top of the building due to violent air currents were an obstacle. The unpredictable winds could cause the dirigible to sway and swivel around the mooring mast. These obstacles threatened the architects' plans to construct a mooring mast atop the building."
1655	16488	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered significant hurdles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. There were three main obstacles: the densely populated area, violent air currents, and the existing law against airships. Firstly, most non - U.S. dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. With the dock above downtown New York, the high population density increased the risk of an explosion. Secondly, nature was a major obstacle. The building's top had strong and constantly changing winds, leading to a great fear of the dirigible hitting other buildings. Finally, the existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up at the building. Due to these obstacles, the idea of allowing blimps to dock at the Empire State Building faced insurmountable difficulties.
1656	16489	6	2	"1. In the short - story ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders encountered numerous challenges to realize their vision. The workers had the task of designing a mast capable of withstanding ""the stress of the dirigible's load"" (@NUM1). As the cable at the top couldn't handle the stress the dirigible would generate, the engineers were compelled to devise a new solution for evenly distributing the dirigible's weight. This was a costly and time - consuming process due to the great height of the Empire State Building. The architects also had to conduct additional research for mast development. To ensure the safe and secure landing of dirigibles, the workers visited the U.S. Naval Air Station and met with the president of the airship transport company. Despite these efforts, these obstacles had to be overcome to achieve their ambitious yet seemingly unrealistic dream."
1657	16490	6	2	"2. The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple challenges. One such challenge was ensuring that the building's frame could support dirigibles. As stated, ""The stress of dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the frame."" Another issue was a law against aircraft flying at low altitudes. As @CAPS2 @NUM1 noted, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas."" The most significant obstacle was nature itself. The strong winds at high altitudes would prevent dirigibles from mooring safely. As described, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast."" These were the challenges that the builders had to confront during the construction."
1658	16491	6	2	3. The Empire State Building was planned to be the tallest building ever constructed. At its summit, an accessible docking station for dirigibles, known as a mooring mast, was intended. The concept of having a mooring mast on the building led to extensive modifications, which cost over sixty thousand dollars. This was a pioneering project and was fraught with obstacles. Among these were the violent air currents and the constantly changing wind direction at the top of the building. These wind conditions could cause the dirigible to swing around, potentially hitting the building or other structures and endangering the densely populated New York City below. A proposed solution was to tie lead bricks to the dirigible's tail, similar to what is done in fields during landing. However, having these bricks hanging over a thousand feet above pedestrians was not a safe option. Ultimately, due to the numerous potential problems, the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was abandoned.
1659	16492	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles while trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One major issue was the lack of a suitable landing area in @LOCATION1. To address this, a mooring mast was required at the top of the building, allowing dirigibles or blimps to anchor for a few hours to refuel, receive services, and embark or disembark passengers. The steel frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened because a thousand - foot blimp moored at the top by a cable tether would exert stress on the building frame. The blimp's load and wind pressure would need to be transferred through the building's foundation, located approximately eleven hundred feet below. Additionally, a law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or approach the area. These obstacles made it extremely difficult to achieve the goal of allowing blimps to dock at the Empire State Building.
1660	16493	6	2	"5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in enabling dirigibles to dock. The most obvious one was the docking height. As Al Smith stated, ""The Empire State would reach the height of @NUM1 feet."" Dirigibles from outside the U.S. were highly flammable. If one caught fire while moored to the top of the Empire State Building, the consequences would be disastrous as it would occur over a densely populated area. Wind was another obstacle. When the ship was tethered to the mast, its rear would constantly swivel. Using lead weights to secure the back was neither safe nor practical. Finally, there was a law that made it illegal for a dirigible to fly too low over an urban area, meaning no ship could fly over downtown New York. These obstacles collectively made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1661	16494	6	2	1. Al Smith encountered numerous challenges during the design and construction of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building. Many of these difficulties should have been anticipated prior to commencing the mast's construction. One evident obstacle was the ever - changing wind conditions. As the back of the blimp couldn't be tied down, it would swing freely in the sky. Another issue was the mast's design. An improper design could place stress on the building, potentially causing significant damage. There was also a law restricting airships from flying too low in urban areas, and New York fell into this category. One of the most perilous factors was that some blimps were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. Al Smith and his architects should have recognized and deliberated on these issues before building an unusable structure. Had they done so, a great deal of time and money could have been saved.
1662	16495	6	2	2. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building's builders faced multiple hurdles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. First, they needed to make the building taller than the Chrysler Building. They achieved this by adding a top or “hat” to the structure. Subsequently, they had to address a new problem: modifications were necessary to prevent the dirigible from stressing the building's frame, as the steel frame couldn't withstand the load and wind pressure transmitted nearly @NUM1 feet below. The most significant factors contributing to the mast's fate were that most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, and accidents couldn't be risked above downtown New York. Nature was the greatest obstacle, with constantly shifting winds. Dirigibles could be weighted down with lead weights at the back, but having them dangle above pedestrians on the street was neither safe nor practical. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These were the challenges the builders faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1663	16496	6	2	3. Marcia Amidon L¸sted, in “The Mooring Mast,” points out not only the safety hazards the Empire State Building builders faced while trying to dock dirigibles there but also the legal aspects that led to the failure of this transportation concept. Typically, dirigibles moor in open landing fields and are weighted down to remain stationary. However, since the Empire State Building builders aimed to dock dirigibles @NUM1 feet in the air, nature and airspace laws became relevant. The 102 - floor - high Empire State Building was an architectural feat, but the builders' vision of docking dirigibles at such a height was thwarted by natural forces and legal disputes. The airspace @NUM1 feet up had strong and constantly shifting winds due to violent air currents. Even “the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles... could not get close enough to tie up,” making it a significant safety risk. Another practical problem was the violation of an airspace law that banned “air ships from flying too low over urban areas,” meaning docking a dirigible at that height was a potential legal and safety hazard. Due to the lack of certainty of success, the operation of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was halted in the late 1930s. Despite the builders' ability to construct a @NUM1 - foot skyscraper, the attempt to dock dirigibles on the building failed mainly because of safety hazards.
1664	16497	6	2	4. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, Al Smith aimed to build the tallest building in New York. He constructed a building that was 1,046 feet tall, but the Empire State Building surpassed it at 1,250 feet. It was essentially a competition to have the tallest building in the city. A mooring mast was added to each building to increase their height. However, the builders didn't consider the dirigibles that passed through the air. Dirigibles are highly flammable, and if they came into contact with a mooring mast, they could be destroyed, as was the case with “the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937.” The mast could have caused massive chaos in New York if it damaged a passing dirigible.
1665	16498	6	2	5. The primary reason for the challenges related to the mooring mast was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. The greatest obstacle to using the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. These factors combined made the use of the mooring mast a risky and challenging endeavor.
1666	16499	6	2	1. When constructing the docking facility for dirigibles on the Empire State Building, the architects encountered multiple challenges. Firstly, they couldn't simply install the mooring mast on the flat roof. A dirigible held by a cable would exert stress on the building's frame. To address this, the architects spent over @MONEY1 on frame modifications. Another significant problem was safety. Most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to stay airborne. After the 1937 Hindenburg catastrophe, architects worried about a similar accident occurring over downtown @LOCATION1 due to hydrogen's high flammability. Additionally, violent wind currents made the mast unsafe. Dirigibles needed lead weights to prevent being blown around, but these weights couldn't dangle over busy city streets. Finally, a law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for airships to dock in this area. These were the obstacles the architects had to face.
1667	16500	6	2	"2. When planning the dirigible dock, Al Smith anticipated only a few obstacles. However, there were more than expected. One expected issue was that the building could be pulled over by dirigibles, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, third sentence. An unforeseen problem emerged after the mast was built: violent wind shifts could cause dirigibles to wrap around the mast, and using dangling weights to prevent this was deemed unsafe, as described in paragraph fourteen, from the second to the fourth sentence. Another unaddressed issue was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM2, first sentence), along with the fact that ""most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM3, second sentence). Clearly, the idea of a docking mast was not well - thought - out."
1668	16501	6	2	"3. In the @DATE1, architects building a dirigible dock on top of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. Weather conditions were a major challenge. The Empire State Building, standing 1,250 ft high, had constantly shifting winds on its top due to violent air currents. These conditions made it difficult and unsafe for dirigibles to dock. Another obstacle was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which made it illegal for dirigibles to attempt a landing on the docks. The strong winds were the most concerning obstacle. The powerful winds meant that dirigibles risked hitting ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" These weather - related obstacles made the docking of dirigibles unsuccessful. Ultimately, dirigibles were ""given away to airplanes"" as a result of these challenges."
1669	16502	6	2	4. According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle to the expanded use of dirigibles in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity to add a mooring mast to the top of the building, which would enable dirigibles to anchor for several hours for refueling, servicing, and passenger boarding and alighting. Dirigibles were docked using an electric winch that hauled in a line from the front of the ship and tied it to a mast. These were the obstacles the builders had to overcome to allow dirigibles to dock.
1670	16503	6	2	"5. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 faced many challenging obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Al Smith, the four - term governor of New York, aimed to make the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler building. His goal was for the building ""to be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers."" The first obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area for dirigibles in New York City. Al Smith saw this as an opportunity to add a mooring mast to the building's top, allowing dirigibles to anchor for refueling, servicing, and passenger movement. His ambition to increase the building's height drove him to overcome this hurdle. However, constructing the mast presented a new obstacle. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were made to the Empire State Building because mooring a thousand - foot dirigible at the top using a single cable tether would stress the building's frame. The modifications resolved this issue, and the mast was built. As construction progressed, more difficulties arose, pushing Al Smith's goals further out of reach. After the mast was built, the builders realized its purpose became obsolete. Safety was a major concern: ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" and having a dirigible catch fire over a densely populated city could have been a tragedy. Nature also posed an obstacle. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" and weighing down the back of a dirigible was unsafe because of pedestrians below. Despite these obstacles, the builders continued their efforts, but over time, the idea faded, and they gave up on the project. Al Smith's goals remained unfulfilled due to these challenges, but he did succeed in establishing the Empire State Building as the tallest in @ORGANIZATION5."
1671	16504	6	2	"1. The construction of the Empire State Building with the intention of allowing dirigibles to dock presented multiple challenges. Safety was a significant concern as many dirigibles utilized hydrogen, a highly flammable substance. The German Hindenburg, which caught fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, serves as an example. As Marcia Amidon L¸sted mentions in ""The Mooring Mast,"" the Empire State Building's owners were aware that the accident could have been far more disastrous if it had occurred above a densely - populated area like downtown New York City. Nature also posed a major obstacle. The winds on top of the building were constantly changing, causing the back of dirigibles to ""swivel around the mooring mast,"" as stated by L¸sted, which was neither practical nor safe. Additionally, there were legal issues. A law at the time restricted airships from flying too low over populated areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or approach the area. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building had to deal with safety, nature, and legal problems when planning for dirigible docking."
1672	16505	6	2	"2. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, several problems arose when trying to enable blimps to dock at the Empire State Building. Firstly, the pre - constructed frame of the building was not sturdy enough to support a new mooring mast for blimps. Secondly, the weather conditions at the building's height were extremely challenging. Violent air currents caused the winds on top of the building to constantly shift. As L¸sted described, this would lead to blimps being tossed and moved violently during docking attempts. There was even a risk of blimps being blown into the spire of a surrounding building, which could puncture the dirigible's shell. Moreover, there were legal constraints. A law at that time prohibited airships from flying too low over populated areas, making it illegal for blimps to tie up to the building or approach the area. In summary, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple problems related to the frame, weather, and laws when aiming to allow blimps to dock."
1673	16506	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to permit dirigibles to dock. The first hurdle was placing the mooring mast. As L¸sted noted, the architects couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof; they had to construct an additional structure. The second challenge was preparing the building for dirigible docking. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top and held by a single tether would put stress on the building's frame, as L¸sted claimed. To address this, the architects needed to modify and strengthen the steel frame so that dirigibles could dock safely. In conclusion, these were the main obstacles the builders faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1674	16507	6	2	4. The men constructing the Empire State Building failed to adequately consider the practicality of the new form for dirigible docking. A major safety issue was the risk of explosion. The German dirigible Hindenburg's fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, demonstrated this danger. The owners of the Empire State Building recognized that a similar accident above a densely - populated area like downtown New York would have been far more catastrophic. Another problem was the wind conditions. The winds on top of the building, constantly shifting due to violent air currents, would cause the back end of the blimp to swivel. Using lead weights to stabilize blimps, as done in open landing fields, was not practical or safe in this location as they would dangle above pedestrians. In conclusion, the architects should have more thoroughly thought through their plan for dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1675	16508	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. Safety was a primary concern as dirigibles commonly used highly - flammable hydrogen. The German Hindenburg's fiery accident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, highlighted the potential danger. The owners of the building realized the accident would have been much worse if it had happened above a densely - populated area like downtown New York. Nature also posed a significant challenge. The shifting winds on top of the building would cause the back of dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast, which was neither practical nor safe. Additionally, there were legal restrictions. A law prohibited airships from flying too low over populated areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or approach the area. In conclusion, the builders had to grapple with safety, nature, and legal issues in their endeavor to enable dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1676	16509	6	2	1. When attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous obstacles. Firstly, there were significant safety concerns. Many foreign dirigibles used helium, which is highly flammable, increasing the risk of explosion. Secondly, docking was extremely challenging due to the wind. The winds were constantly changing because of violent air - currents. Finally, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. So, even if the other issues were resolved, docking dirigibles would still be illegal. These were the main problems the builders faced in their attempt to dock dirigibles.
1677	16510	6	2	"2. In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced difficulties when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. The architects struggled with installing a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. As stated, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" This was because the mooring mast would stress the building. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would require strengthening and modifying the entire building, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Consequently, they built a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless - steel tower. These were the obstacles in creating a mooring mast."
1678	16511	6	2	3. The builders faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. They intended to place a mooring mast on the flat roof. However, the stress from the dirigible's load and heavy wind pressure needed to be transmitted to the building's foundation, approximately @NUM1 ft below. To handle this situation, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened. In conclusion, these structural requirements presented significant challenges for the builders.
1679	16512	6	2	4. One of the obstacles the builders faced was that adding a mooring mast would require strengthening the building's integrity. This was necessary because once the mast was in place, wind pressure would be transmitted all the way to the foundation. Additionally, more floors would need to be added to accommodate elevators and stairs leading to a ticket and luggage area. Moreover, they had to find a way to attach the mooring mast to the foundation, nearly @NUM1 feet below. These challenges made the task of adding the mooring mast a difficult one for the builders.
1680	16513	6	2	"5. In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. One major obstacle was modifying the building's framework to install the mooring mast. As described, ""a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the building's foundation, eleven hundred feet below. Another issue was safety. Hydrogen is highly flammable, so the mooring mast never fulfilled its purpose. The most significant obstacle was nature, as the winds constantly shifted due to violent air currents. Overall, the idea of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was neither practical nor safe."
1681	16514	6	2	"1. According to the excerpt, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges during their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock on the mast. One issue was the idea of placing ""A mooring mask on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph @NUM1). Doing so would have imposed a significant amount of stress on the building's foundation, necessitating modifications and strengthening of the steel frame. However, this was prohibitively expensive. Another problem was the use of hydrogen in foreign dirigibles instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and a fire on a dirigible could cause extensive damage. The most significant obstacle, though, was the strong wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building. Even when ""Tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around"" (paragraph @NUM2). Using lead weights to anchor the dirigible while it was ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"" (paragraph @NUM2). In conclusion, the architects and builders faced multiple hurdles while constructing the mast on the Empire State Building."
1682	16515	6	2	"2. The excerpt reveals that the builders of the Empire State Building confronted numerous challenges when trying to make it possible for dirigibles to dock. When designing the building, the architects had to consider the height of the structure and the mooring mast. They couldn't simply place a large glass - and - chrome mooring mast on the building's flat roof. Additionally, the wind currents at over one thousand feet are rapidly changing. An extremely large dirigible docked at the top of the building would ""add stress to the building's frame"" (@NUM1). To ensure the building's safety, the architects would need to modify and strengthen its steel frame, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Ultimately, due to these obstacles, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building never fulfilled its intended purpose."
1683	16516	6	2	3. The builders of the mooring mast faced challenges related to the winds and the gases used in non - @CAPS1 dirigibles. The wind was a significant issue because at that high altitude, the back of the dirigibles would swivel around the mooring mast. The gases were also a problem as out - of - country zeppelins used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If a zeppelin were to catch fire over the densely populated New York City, the consequences would be dire. In conclusion, these factors presented substantial obstacles to the successful implementation of the mooring mast.
1684	16517	6	2	4. Dirigibles were regarded as the transportation of the @NUM1. They had a top speed of @NUM2 miles and could cruise at @NUM3 miles per @NUM4. Some dirigibles were as long as @NUM5 feet. In conclusion, dirigibles had certain performance and size characteristics that made them notable in the transportation context of the @NUM1.
1685	16518	6	2	"5. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the author details the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. The original intention of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles. In paragraph 6, the author states, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers off and on."" This was one of the challenges faced by his company. In paragraph @NUM1, it is mentioned that ""the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, construction proceeded as planned."" However, the building's structure did not offer much assistance to the dirigibles. In conclusion, the efforts to enable dirigible docking at the Empire State Building were hampered by various obstacles."
1686	16519	6	2	1. The builders of the Empire State Building, @ORGANIZATION1, encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles, also known as blimps and considered the future of transportation in the @DATE1s, to dock at the building. The primary challenge was devising a functional mooring mast. Nature presented the most significant hurdle. Due to strong and violent air - currents, the winds atop the building were constantly changing. As a result, even when a dirigible was tied to the mast, its rear would spin around the mast. The excerpt mentions that dirigibles moored in open landing fields can be weighted down with lead weights. However, using such weights at the height of the Empire State Building would be dangerous as they could fall on people below. Moreover, since builders cannot control nature, this remained an extremely difficult problem. Another issue was the stress on the building's body frame if a dirigible was held by a single cable tether. The wind pressure and stress would have exceeded the building's foundation's capacity. This was resolved by strengthening the building's steel frame to prevent collapse. Despite all these efforts, the attempts were ultimately in vain because there is a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas.
1687	16520	6	2	2. The Empire State Building presented a challenge regarding the installation of a mast for a helium balloon that was lighter than a regular inflated balloon. The building's tip was overly long, and some problems were insurmountable for architects. In the end, these issues persisted, making it difficult to achieve the intended purpose of having a suitable mast for the balloon.
1688	16521	6	2	3. The @CAPS1 encountered arguments, confusion, and a tough time during the building process. These challenges likely had an impact on the overall progress and outcome of the project. Despite these difficulties, the building was presumably completed, but the experience of facing such issues would have left an indelible mark on the construction process.
1689	16522	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. One major obstacle was the stress on the building from the dirigible. The load of the dirigible and the wind pressure would need to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, which was @NUM1 feet below. Consequently, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened. Another issue was that most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The third obstacle was the constantly shifting winds on top of the building due to violent air currents. Even when a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would move uncontrollably. Finally, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or approach the area. These various obstacles made it extremely difficult for the builders to achieve their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1690	16523	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of problems and obstacles while trying to allow blimps to dock there. One obstacle was that foreign blimps used hydrogen instead of helium to stay airborne. If a hydrogen - filled blimp were to explode over New York, the resulting damage and death toll would be catastrophic. A second obstacle was the high elevation of the building, @CAPS1, which led to strong wind currents. This made it difficult for the Navy's blimp, the Los Angeles, to approach the docking station at the mooring mast. The final obstacle was the fear that a blimp might hit another building's spire, puncturing a hole in the blimp and causing it to crash. In summary, the danger and high - risk nature of foreign blimps filled with hydrogen, the strong wind currents at the building's high elevation, and the risk of collision with other building spires all combined to make it extremely challenging for the builders to enable blimps to dock at the Empire State Building.
1691	16524	6	2	"1. In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", designers of the Empire State Building aimed to enable dirigibles to dock there but faced numerous obstacles. Their grand plans for the building were far from the reality. One significant challenge was safety. As the excerpt mentions, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM1). The risk of a dirigible catching fire was extremely high, and such an incident would not only damage the blimp but also pose a threat to the buildings and people in New York. Another obstacle was nature. The weather was unpredictable, and ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). These winds made it difficult for blimps to approach the building as they could push the aircraft into other structures, potentially damaging the dirigible's design. In conclusion, the designers' vision of facilitating dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was a practical dream that was ultimately thwarted by reality."
1692	16525	6	2	"2. In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when considering how to dock dirigibles on the building's top. The first problem was the high - winds. As stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM1). This was a major concern because the winds could cause dirigibles to crash into the building, releasing their gases. The second obstacle was strengthening the building's structure to tie down the dirigibles. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM2). If the steel was not strengthened, the dirigibles could weaken the building's structure. In conclusion, these two main obstacles significantly hindered the builders' plan to enable dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
1693	16526	6	2	"3. In the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced numerous challenges while attempting to get dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building. To achieve this, they would have to add floors to the building. Additionally, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation,"" which would entail additional costs. Moreover, they later discovered that legal issues prohibited this plan. Proceeding with the project would have put them in conflict with the legal system. Once they realized these problems, it became clear that the project was a failure. As they stated, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" In conclusion, the attempt to make the Empire State Building a dirigible landing site was doomed by various obstacles, including structural requirements and legal constraints."
1694	16527	6	2	"4. Engineering a docking station for dirigibles at the Empire State Building was initially envisioned as a remarkable achievement for New York City. Regrettably, the builders faced numerous hurdles in bringing this ambitious plan to fruition. Many engineers failed to consider the hazards, as noted by the statement ""reasons that should have been apparent before it was even constructed"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Safety was the most pressing issue. Dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. A repeat of an incident like the Hindenburg would pose a significant threat to the densely populated city. The winds at the top of the building were another obstacle. They were constantly shifting, causing the backs of dirigibles to swing erratically. Additionally, there was a law against low - flying aircraft over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to approach the area. Although the idea of a docking station was excellent, many of these obstacles were overlooked in the early stages of planning. As a result, the Empire State Building never became a dirigible dock."
1695	16528	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges. The wind and the ever - changing climate were constant risks. The height of the building also presented a significant challenge. These factors made the construction process more difficult and complex. In conclusion, the combination of wind, climate, and the building's height posed substantial obstacles to the builders of the Empire State Building, requiring them to overcome many difficulties during the construction.
1696	16529	6	2	"1. According to Marcia Amidon's excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. For several reasons, they were unable to achieve this goal. Firstly, dirigibles were highly flammable as most used hydrogen gas as fuel, which posed a significant problem in a densely - populated area like New York. Secondly, financial issues arose. Strengthening the building to support the weight of dirigibles required additional funds. A thousand - foot dirigible tethered to the building's top by a single cable would exert substantial stress on the structure. Finally, safety was a major concern. Violent winds would make dirigibles unstable when docked, and there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. In conclusion, due to these factors, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building could not be realized."
1697	16530	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building confronted multiple challenges regarding dirigibles. The large size of the dirigibles would place excessive stress on the building, necessitating the creation of a new frame to accommodate the @NUM1 - foot dirigibles. Modifications cost sixty thousand dollars. Safety was another significant problem. Many non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. If an accident similar to the one in New Jersey, where a blimp caught fire, occurred in densely populated New York, it would result in numerous injuries and deaths. Nature also presented difficulties. The building's great height made wind speeds and pressure unpredictable, especially with violent air currents. In open fields, weights were used to stabilize dirigibles, but having lead weights dangling above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. Additionally, there were laws against flying at certain altitudes in urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the Empire State Building. In summary, these were the obstacles the builders faced during the construction of the Empire State Building.
1698	16531	6	2	"3. The builders of the Empire State Building endured many hardships while constructing the Mooring mast and attempting to dock dirigibles on it. One of the obstacles they had to overcome was the weather. As stated, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds at the top of the building shifted frequently due to violent air currents. Even when a dirigible was tied to the mast, the wind could push it all the way around the mast. Another obstacle was the safety concern regarding lead weights. The builders were worried that the lead weights used to hold the dirigible down would dangle over the edge of the building, endangering pedestrians as well as the pilot and passengers on the blimp. In conclusion, these challenges made it difficult to achieve the goal of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
1699	16532	6	2	"4. In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock at the building. At the time of the Empire State Building's construction, dirigibles were the most advanced form of @CAPS2. The building was erected to tether dirigibles for passenger unloading and reloading, as well as refueling. However, constructors realized that ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings Foundation... eleven hundred feet below."" Plans were needed to support both the building and the blimps. Nature also posed a problem. Using lead weights to land dirigibles, where they would dangle above pedestrians, was neither practical nor safe. Violent winds at that elevation would cause the blimp and its weights to waver, and the aircrafts were at risk of landing on ""sharp spires of other buildings."" Moreover, a law prohibited @CAPS2 from flying low in urban areas. As a result, the Empire State Building was never used for dirigible docking."
1700	16533	6	2	5. During the construction of the Empire State Building, dirigibles were considered the future of air travel. To keep up with the modern world, Al Smith, the lead architect, decided to top the building with a dirigible docking station. However, during the building process, architects faced many obstacles that prevented the completion of the mooring mast. One problem was the sixty - thousand - dollar cost of modifications to the building. Another was the flammability of hydrogen, the gas used to inflate the dirigibles. The most significant obstacle was nature. The strong winds at the building's height made the dirigibles unstable, and there was a risk that the ship could tear off its tether and crash, endangering pedestrians. Additionally, a law prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas. Despite the initial promise of the mooring mast, these obstacles ultimately led to the failure of the plan.
1701	16534	6	2	1. The construction of the Empire State Building was fraught with numerous challenges for the builders. The work was extremely dangerous, and they had to endure long working hours, which evokes a sense of sympathy. Simultaneously, being part of such a remarkable project would have brought a sense of pride. The high - altitude construction environment was likely sweltering. There is a thought that the building did not necessarily need to be as tall as it is; the same functionality could have been achieved at a lower height. In conclusion, these were some of the significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced.
1702	16535	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, simply placing the mast on top of the building was not feasible. A thousand - foot dirigible moored by a single cable tether would impose stress on the building's frame, and this stress would be transferred to the building's foundation. Secondly, the entire building had to be modified. The architects designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, even though the building was already completed. However, due to the violent air currents, all their efforts were in vain. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would spin around it. In conclusion, the architects' hard work in remodeling the building for dirigible docking ultimately came to nothing.
1703	16536	6	2	3. According to the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. Safety was their primary concern. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, as evidenced by the destruction of the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, in a fire. The owners of the Empire State Building realized the potential severity of an accident if it occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Nature also posed an obstacle. The winds on top of the building constantly shifted due to violent air currents, making it impossible to safely dock passengers on and off the dirigibles. Additionally, laws restricted airships from flying too low over populated areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or approach the area. In conclusion, these various obstacles made it unfeasible to use the Empire State Building for dirigible docking.
1704	16537	6	2	4. Adding a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building is a clever concept, but it comes with multiple problems and concerns. Even if the cable were securely fastened to the one - thousand - foot dirigible, it would place stress on the building's frame, causing the building to deteriorate faster than without it. To counter the large effect of the dirigible on the building, it would be necessary to transmit the dirigible's weight and wind pressure to the building's foundation, which is nearly impossible given the over @NUM1 - foot distance. Cost was also a significant factor. Over sixty thousand dollars had to be collected to better support the building's structure. In conclusion, despite the ingenuity of the idea, the associated problems and costs make the addition of a mooring mast a challenging endeavor.
1705	16538	6	2	5. When the builders of the Empire State Building tried to allow dirigibles to dock, they faced several obstacles. A pre - existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like downtown New York. High winds were another issue; they caused the back end of the dirigible to swing, making it unsafe for passengers to unload. Unlike dirigibles moored in open fields, lead weights could not be used to stabilize the back of the dirigible as they would endanger pedestrians on the street. Moreover, most non - US dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is much more flammable than helium, posing a significant fire risk. In the end, although the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building seemed great initially, the builders realized it was neither practical nor safe.
1706	16539	6	2	1. The construction of the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges for the builders aiming to enable dirigibles to dock there. One significant hurdle was the size of some dirigibles, which could reach up to @NUM1 feet in length, equivalent to four city blocks in New York. Another issue was the lack of a suitable landing area in New York. Al Smith saw an opportunity in his building and proposed adding a mooring mast to the top. This mast would allow passengers to embark and disembark, and the area could serve as a refueling and service spot. However, implementing this new idea would require extensive planning. In conclusion, while the concept had potential, the obstacles and the need for careful planning made it a complex endeavor.
1707	16540	6	2	2. During the 1920s, dirigibles were regarded as the future of transportation. Architects constructing the Empire State Building initially considered the idea of a mooring mast to be feasible. As the construction neared completion, several concerns emerged. Many dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. Docking the blimps was also problematic due to the constantly shifting winds on the Empire State Building, which caused the rear of the dirigibles to rotate around the mooring mast. Additionally, a law was enacted to restrict airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas. When all these problems were taken into account, the idea of mooring dirigibles at the Empire State Building gradually faded away. In summary, the combination of safety risks and regulatory constraints made the concept unviable.
1708	16541	6	2	3. According to The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in enabling dirigibles to dock there. One major challenge was the stress that docking dirigibles would place on the building's foundation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were necessary to strengthen the building's framework. Another issue was the constantly changing wind directions at the top of the building. The idea of adding weights to the dirigibles was considered, but it was deemed unsafe as they would be hanging over people at a height of a thousand feet. Moreover, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. In conclusion, the builders had to overcome significant obstacles to make the docking of dirigibles a reality.
1709	16542	6	2	4. It might seem straightforward to install a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. However, if a thousand - foot dirigible were to be moored on the building's top using a cable tether, it would impose stress on the building's frame. The load from the dirigible and the wind pressure would need to be transferred to the bottom of the building, which was eleven hundred feet below. This would require strengthening and modifying the frame, with costs exceeding sixty thousand dollars. Nature posed the greatest challenge to the successful use of the mooring mast. Violent air currents on the building's top caused the winds to shift, making the back of the dirigible swivel around the mooring mast. Although lead weights were used to stabilize dirigibles in open landing fields, they were not suitable for the Empire State Building due to the presence of pedestrians below. In conclusion, the engineering challenges and safety concerns made the use of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building a difficult proposition.
1710	16543	6	2	5. When the Empire State Building was constructed, there were problems with allowing dirigibles to dock there. One reason was that dirigibles were not originally designed to operate at high altitudes. As the Empire State Building rose, dirigibles faced difficulties. Additionally, most dirigibles made outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. These factors combined to create significant challenges for the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building. In summary, the design limitations of dirigibles and the safety risks associated with hydrogen made it a complicated and potentially dangerous situation.
1711	16544	6	2	1. When the builders of the Empire State Building tried to enable dirigibles to dock there, they encountered numerous obstacles. The most significant was the safety concern. A dirigible filled with hydrogen could cause widespread chaos if it caught fire, as hydrogen is highly flammable and can ignite at any moment. Another hurdle was the wind speed at the top of the Empire State Building. Violent air - currents were present, and if a dirigible was docked at the mooring mast, these currents would shift its position. Due to safety issues, the back of the dirigible could not be weighted down, causing it to swivel around the mooring mast. Additionally, there was an existing law regarding airships. They were prohibited from flying at that height because it was too close to an urban area, making it illegal to attempt docking at the Empire State Building. In fact, only the Los Angeles and the Columbia were allowed to attempt docking before the idea was abandoned. Neither of them could dock successfully, and thus the idea was ultimately scrapped.
1712	16545	6	2	"2. According to an excerpt from @PERSON1's book ""The Empire State Building"", there are two major problems with dirigible docking in New York City. The first is a natural issue. The area around the Empire State Building and all of @LOCATION3 is extremely windy, making a safe docking procedure unfeasible. When the Naval @CAPS1 the Los Angeles attempted to dock, the operator pulled away out of fear of puncturing the zeppelin on the spire of another building. The second problem, though relatively easier to address, was the law that prohibited any aircraft from approaching the buildings in New York City. This law effectively made any docking attempt illegal. There are numerous reasons why the concept of zeppelins did not gain global traction, and this excerpt about New York is a prime example of the insurmountable obstacles."
1713	16546	6	2	"3. During their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders encountered several obstacles. Firstly, the frame of the Empire State Building was too weak to bear the additional stress of a dirigible's load. To address this, the builders undertook the task of strengthening the building frame, which cost sixty - thousand dollars. Secondly, they had to deal with high, shifting winds. These winds made dirigible docking nearly impossible, as ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Safety was also a major concern. Many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas that enabled the dirigible to float. After a dirigible fire in New Jersey, the builders became aware of the potential disasters if a dirigible caught fire above New York City. Finally, there were laws regarding air traffic that prevented airships from flying ""too low over urban areas."" In conclusion, these obstacles prevented the builders from realizing the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
1714	16547	6	2	"4. Based on the excerpt, it is evident that the builders of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building faced multiple challenges. The excerpt reveals that dirigibles from other countries often used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. The German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" bursting into flames demonstrated the danger of hydrogen. The consequences could have been far more severe if the incident had occurred in a densely populated area like New York City. Apart from the fire hazard the mooring mast would pose, there was also a ban on low - flying aircraft in densely populated areas. However, the greatest obstacle was ""Nature itself"", referring to the powerful winds and violent gusts at the peak of the Empire State Building. Controlling a dirigible safely under such conditions would be extremely difficult. After considering all these complications, it was decided not to build the mooring mast."
1715	16548	6	2	"5. After reading the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", I learned that there were numerous obstacles in creating a docking place for dirigibles. Safety was the most crucial factor. Since most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, they were highly flammable. If a dirigible were to catch fire over New York, many lives would be at risk. Another obstacle was the climate. The top of the Empire State Building, where the mooring mast was planned to be built, had such adverse weather conditions that it was almost impossible to dock a dirigible there. These are some of the many challenges the architects had to face when designing the mooring mast."
1716	16549	6	2	1. The construction of the Empire State Building with the intention of enabling dirigible docking presented numerous challenges. The architects and engineers had to grapple with issues such as the docking mechanism of a dirigible to the building, fueling and servicing procedures, and ensuring the safest possible embarkation and disembarkation of passengers. Additionally, they should have considered the potential impact of a thousand - foot dirigible on the building's structure. To address these concerns, the project's architects and engineers consulted experts. They allowed personnel from the U.S. naval air station to inspect the equipment and the mooring mast, which serves as the anchor for the dirigible. Passengers were intended to use a gang plank to reach an open observation platform. However, making the building suitable for dirigible docking required over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the foundation. Despite these efforts, some dirigibles were unable to dock, ultimately rendering the docking facility unfeasible.
1717	16550	6	2	2. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of it. One significant issue was the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City, as noted in the text. Another challenge was the unpredictable weather. Violent air currents caused the winds on top of the building to constantly shift, making docking difficult. Moreover, if dirigibles landed on the Empire State Building, they would be weighed down due to the lead weights at the back. Additionally, dirigibles used hydrogen gas, which is highly flammable. This posed a great risk to both the passengers on board and the building itself, especially in a densely populated area like New York City. In conclusion, these various obstacles made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
1718	16551	6	2	3. The vision of having dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building initially seemed promising. However, the builders encountered numerous hurdles in achieving this goal. Firstly, they had to ensure that the dirigible's load and wind pressure were properly transmitted to the building's foundation to avoid stressing the building's frame. To accomplish this, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were made. A glass and chrome - nickel steel tower with an illuminated interior was constructed, and the building was extended to 102 floors. Despite all this hard work, safety concerns prevented the building from being used for docking. Dirigibles were highly flammable, and after a tragic incident in New Jersey where a dirigible caught fire, the owners of the Empire State Building were reluctant to risk a similar event in the densely populated New York City. The strong winds also posed a major problem. Even with a landing site, dirigibles could not be properly tied down for passengers to disembark. Moreover, there was a law restricting aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. In the end, despite the significant investment of money and effort, the dream of having dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building remained unfulfilled.
1719	16552	6	2	4. During the construction of the Empire State Building, the workers overcame numerous obstacles. New York Governor Al Smith aimed to build “the world's tallest building”. Meanwhile, the @ORGANIZATION2 building in New York was nearing completion. The workers of the @ORGANIZATION2 building secretly built an 185 - foot spire, making their building 46 feet taller than the Empire State Building in the works, thus initiating a competition for the title of the tallest building. Eventually, the Empire State Building won this title. After its construction, the workers attempted to use it as a docking mast for dirigibles. However, the designers failed to account for the safety risks of landing a dirigible in a city center and the significant impact of wind on safe aircraft landings. As a result, the idea of using the building as a dirigible landing site was abandoned. In conclusion, while the Empire State Building achieved the status of the tallest building, the attempt to make it a dirigible docking facility was unsuccessful due to these overlooked factors.
1720	16553	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the main concerns was ensuring the safety of the people below. There was a risk that if something fell from the dirigible or during the docking process, it could cause harm to individuals on the ground. Another significant obstacle was the law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. These two factors, the safety of the public and the legal restrictions, made it extremely challenging for the builders to realize their goal of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these obstacles ultimately hindered the successful implementation of the dirigible - docking plan.
1721	16554	6	2	"1. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Some of these difficulties were not building - related; nature played a part. At a height of 1,250 feet, the strong winds made it arduous for dirigible pilots to steer the ships close enough to tie them up. This was evident in the case of the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" in December 1930. Fearing that the wind might blow the ship onto sharp edges or other buildings in the area, which could puncture the shell and lead to a disaster, the captain did not attempt to reach the building. Additionally, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, putting civilians at risk. Moreover, a dirigible that was not large enough would place stress on the building's frame. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it extremely difficult for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1722	16555	6	2	"2. The Empire State Building's builders faced many hurdles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. Firstly, having dirigibles hanging high above street - level pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. There was also an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Moreover, a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the building's top with a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. However, the most significant obstacle was likely nature. The winds on the building's top constantly shifted due to violent air currents, making it very hard to keep dirigibles securely hoisted. As the builders delved into the science of dirigibles, they realized more dangers. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. The 1937 fire of the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" in Lakehurst, New Jersey, made the building's owners and builders aware that such an accident could have been far more catastrophic if it occurred over a densely populated city like New York. In the end, these combined obstacles meant that the plan to use the Empire State Building for dirigible docking was unfeasible."
1723	16556	6	2	3. It is shown that in the future, the @CAPS1 Building never fulfilled its intended purpose. Instead, it is the @CAPS2 Building in New York that has taken on a relevant role. In conclusion, the @CAPS1 Building's failure to serve its purpose indicates a shift in the functionality and significance of buildings in that context.
1724	16557	6	2	4. Those trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. First, they had to modify and strengthen the building's frame to suit this new situation. The architects designed a tower made of shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel, illuminated from within, with a stepped - back design mirroring the building's overall shape. However, after all this work, they discovered that the Empire State Building's mast would not work. Safety was the primary concern. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Nature was also a major obstacle, as the winds on the building's top constantly shifted due to violent air currents. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or approach the area. By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers faded away. Instead of dirigibles becoming the future of transportation, airplanes took their place. In conclusion, the combination of safety, natural, and legal obstacles led to the abandonment of the dirigible - docking plan at the Empire State Building.
1725	16558	6	2	5. The docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building presented many problems that the engineers did not anticipate. When the architects were designing the mast, they found that the building was not constructed to withstand the stress of dirigibles and the wind, and modifications had to be made. Although this issue could be overcome, many others could not. Since most dirigibles outside the @PERSON1 used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, there was a risk of a dirigible going up in flames like the German Hindenburg. The building's owners realized how much worse such an accident could be if it happened over New York. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, preventing dirigibles from getting close to the building. Two dirigibles still attempted docking but could not tether safely. Eventually, the concept of dirigibles as the future of transportation was replaced by airplanes, and the Empire State Building's top floors are now a popular tourist destination. In conclusion, these various problems led to the failure of the dirigible - docking plan and a change in the building's usage.
1726	16559	6	2	1. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were docked using an electric winch that pulled in a line from the front of the ship and tied it to a mast. The architects could not simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. This inability to straightforwardly install the mast presented a significant challenge in realizing the goal of dirigible docking at the building.
1727	16560	6	2	2. Adding a mooring dock to the top of the Empire State Building presented numerous obstacles. The building's previous frame could not support the extra weight of a dirigible hanging from one cable, so extensive modifications were required. These modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars and demand additional time and effort. Safety was another major concern. The winds around New York constantly shifted due to violent air currents, which could cause the blimp to wrap around the tower and potentially break off. Given the densely populated city below, any accident would cause more destruction than usual. Foreign dirigibles used large amounts of hydrogen, which, as proven by the Hindenburg disaster, could explode. The weather conditions would magnify this risk, resulting in high human and property costs. Additionally, it was illegal for blimps to fly low near a city, making the entire project unfeasible. Clearly, establishing a blimp docking center on the Empire State Building was fraught with problems.
1728	16561	6	2	3. Every day, people face obstacles, but the builders of the Empire State Building had even more difficult challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. The reasons for the infeasibility of dirigible docking were evident. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, a highly flammable element, to float. If a dirigible caught fire above a densely populated area like downtown New York, it would lead to a serious problem. Nature also posed an obstacle. The winds on the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Using lead weights to stabilize the back of the ship was dangerous as they would dangle above pedestrians. Moreover, there was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to dock at the building. Although the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was clever, it was ultimately impossible to implement.
1729	16562	6	2	"4. In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, it is clear that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges when attempting to dock dirigibles. Dirigibles themselves were a hazard. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. After the disaster of the German airship Hindenburg, officials did not want a similar catastrophe to occur in downtown New York. The light mass of dirigibles made them vulnerable to high, forceful winds. The winds on top of the building constantly shifted due to violent air currents, raising concerns that a zeppelin could be blown into a spire of another building, damaging its fragile lining. Additionally, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which hindered the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building. The dream of mooring dirigibles at the building, as discussed in ""The Mooring Mast,"" could not be realized due to these significant obstacles."
1730	16563	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles. The mast designed for the building was initially conceived to make it the world's tallest building, rather than for a necessary function, which led to many problems. The mast was intended to be a dirigible docking station. At the time, blimps were unsafe and lacked suitable landing areas, so this was seen as an opportunity for refueling, servicing, and passenger boarding. However, a mooring mast could not be simply placed on the roof as it would stress the building's frame. Modifying the steel frame cost over sixty thousand dollars. After construction, it was recognized that a disaster like the Hindenburg would be far more catastrophic over a densely populated area like downtown New York. The most significant obstacle was nature. The winds on the building constantly shifted due to violent air currents, causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mast. Using lead weights to address this issue was neither practical nor safe as they would dangle above pedestrians. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it extremely difficult to establish a dirigible docking station at the Empire State Building.
1731	16564	6	2	1. Although the concept of constructing a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's top seemed promising, multiple obstacles precluded its realization. The builders and architects had to entirely modify the building's frame to bear the mast's weight, incurring costs exceeding sixty thousand dollars. Additionally, most dirigibles outside @LOCATION1 utilized hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and if a dirigible met a fate similar to the Hindenburg, a far more severe accident would occur at ground - level. The mast also faced the persistent challenge of shifting winds from violent air currents. These winds caused the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mast even when it was tied, creating a significant issue. Moreover, an existing law prohibited dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to approach the building, let alone dock. In conclusion, despite the initial appeal of the mooring mast, the numerous obstacles made its construction unfeasible.
1732	16565	6	2	2. The developers of the Empire State Building encountered numerous hurdles when attempting to enable dirigible docking. They needed to build a mooring mast on the building for the dirigibles to dock. However, the weight of a docked dirigible would have been excessive for the building. To overcome this, they reinforced the building's supports. The most significant obstacle, and the one that ultimately scuttled the plan, was nature. Violent air currents and high winds made it impossible for a dirigible to safely tether to the top of the building. For instance, when the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los @CAPS2 attempted to reach the mooring mast, the powerful winds prevented it. In the end, the developers of the Empire State Building were unable to surmount these obstacles.
1733	16566	6	2	3. New York - based architects made strenuous efforts to construct a functional mooring mast on the Empire State Building. The purpose was to dock dirigibles for refueling, servicing, and to allow passengers to embark and disembark. During the construction process, they faced several formidable obstacles that thwarted the mast's usability. A dirigible moored at the building's top by a single cable tether would exert tension on the building's frame. The weight and wind pressure would have to be transferred to the building's foundation, and over @MONEY1 in modifications to the building's framework would be required. Another challenge was related to the roof. As @PERSON1 wrote in her article 'The Mooring Mast,' when the building was framed up to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the mooring - mast framing could commence. The most substantial obstacle was nature itself. Violent air currents led to non - stop wind changes, causing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. Weighing down the back of the craft with lead weights was a potential solution, but the risks were too high. Finally, there was a New York law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a blimp to approach the Empire State Building. As a result, the rooms set aside for the mooring - mast operations were converted into the world's highest soda fountain and a tea garden for tourists. By the late 1930s, dirigibles had become obsolete, and airplanes took their place.
1734	16567	6	2	4. Building a regular building is a massive undertaking for builders, and adding a docking mast for dirigibles makes the task even more arduous. The architects and builders had to consult experts to determine the construction method and safety of the project. They visited the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 to study equipment and mooring operations and also met with the president of an airship transport company. After extensive planning and numerous meetings, they began constructing the mooring mast. The construction workers couldn't simply place the mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building as it would stress the building's frame. They decided that the building's frame needed to be modified, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Workers started adding the mast, but construction was halted due to the danger to pedestrians, rendering all the work fruitless.
1735	16568	6	2	"5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced immediate challenges when trying to enable dirigible docking. One of the major difficulties was installing a mooring mast on an already - completed building. As stated, ""A thousand - foot dirigible... would add stress to the building's frame"" (∂ @NUM1). A large dirigible would also place stress on the building. Since the building was not originally designed for docking dirigibles, the roof and top floors would need to be converted to accommodate passengers and travel operations. Nature also posed an obstacle. High winds could cause the dirigible to sway violently, and the weights used to tether the dirigibles could be a safety hazard in a densely populated area like @LOCATION1. Fire was another safety concern as the gases used to keep the dirigibles airborne were highly flammable, which was a serious issue in a city of millions. Ultimately, these factors led to the failure of creating a mooring mast on the Empire State Building."
1736	16569	6	2	1. The construction of the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges to its builders when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. One significant issue was the wind conditions at the building's summit. Violent air - currents caused the winds to be in a constant state of shift. Even when dirigibles were tied to the mast, they would swivel around it, posing a risk to pedestrians. Another major concern was safety. A large number of dirigibles outside the United States utilized hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, the owners of the Empire State Building recognized that such an accident in downtown New York would have far more severe consequences. In conclusion, these obstacles made it extremely difficult to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1737	16570	6	2	2. During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered multiple obstacles. Competition was one of the early hurdles. New York governor Al Smith was resolute in creating the world's tallest building, aiming to surpass the Chrysler Building which was also under construction. This put pressure on both Al Smith and the builders to construct a remarkable, tall edifice. Another challenge was the creation of a successful mooring mast on the building's top without damaging the building's structure. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable tether would exert stress on the building's frame, necessitating over @MONEY1 in framework changes. Additionally, much work was put into making the mooring mast functional, but it was not practical. Dirigibles were highly flammable, the winds were harsh and unsafe, and there was a law against low - flying aircraft. In conclusion, these various obstacles complicated the building process significantly.
1738	16571	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles during its construction. One issue was that a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top with a single cable would add stress to the building's frame base. The winds at the building's summit were constantly changing due to violent air currents, causing the back of the dirigible to swivel. There was also a significant concern regarding the use of hydrogen and helium, which are extremely flammable. These factors combined made it difficult for the builders to make the Empire State Building taller. In conclusion, these challenges were major impediments to the construction efforts.
1739	16572	6	2	4. The construction of the Empire State Building was fraught with daily dangerous conditions. These included @CAPS1 winds, heavy - lifting operations, and working at high altitudes. Workers had to confront these perils on a regular basis during the building process. In conclusion, these dangerous conditions were a constant threat during the construction of the Empire State Building.
1740	16573	6	2	"5. After reading ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the challenges faced by the Empire State Building's builders in allowing dirigibles to dock there are clear. Safety is the primary concern. Most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and given that the area is densely populated, the risk of fire is unacceptable. Moreover, nature presented a major obstacle. As the building is very tall, winds constantly shifted due to violent air currents. Dirigibles typically land in landing fields where they can be weighted down with lead weights at the back, a method that would be unsafe on the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the numerous obstacles make it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1741	16574	6	2	1. The Empire State Building's builders encountered several issues when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. The primary concern was safety. Most dirigibles utilized highly flammable gases like hydrogen. A fire on a dirigible above New York's public could have disastrous consequences. Another challenge was nature. Violent air - currents constantly shifted atop the building, causing the rear of the dirigibles to rotate around the mooring mast. Weighing down the back of the dirigibles was not an option as it would pose a safety risk. The final problem was legal. At that time, there was a law against airships flying too low over cities, making it illegal to tie a ship to the Empire State Building. These issues meant that the plan to use the building for dirigible docking faced insurmountable obstacles.
1742	16575	6	2	2. During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous difficulties and setbacks. The creators aimed to make it the tallest building in existence, but the engineer of the Chrysler Building foiled their plans by adding a new top, making it forty - six feet taller. In response, Al Smith decided to add a crown to the Empire State Building. He constructed a mooring on the 102nd floor for dirigible travel. After installation, he had to make it compatible with dirigibles. Six thousand dollars were spent on remodeling the building's frame. Additionally, they needed to find safe ways to dock the blimps. They couldn't extend an electric winch, and the balloons were powered by flammable gases, which was a safety hazard in a large city. Also, weights couldn't be hung over city streets to stabilize the ship. These problems led to a significant decline in dirigible popularity, and the mooring was never fully utilized.
1743	16576	6	2	3. In the passage “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles faced by the Empire State Building's builders in allowing dirigibles to dock are detailed. These obstacles include safety, nature, and law. Safety was a concern as the passengers on dirigibles were at risk. As the text states, “...dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.” Dirigibles could explode, as many have in the past. Nature was an obstacle because unfavorable weather could make it difficult for dirigibles to attach to the mast. The quotation “...winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents” supports this. The wind could cause the dirigibles to move uncontrollably, endangering everyone. There was also a law against airships in urban areas. The quote “this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area” explains this. This law made the mooring mast useless as it couldn't be legally used. The obstacles outlined in the passage allowed the architects to avoid wasting funds on an unprofitable project.
1744	16577	6	2	4. When building the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to create a docking facility for dirigibles. Al Smith, the building's designer, wanted to increase its height by allowing dirigibles to dock on a 1,250 - foot - high mooring mast at the top. However, safety was the main reason it was never used as a docking station. Dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, and an accident involving the Hindenburg in New Jersey had already occurred. Given New York's high population density, it was too risky to have dangerous gases in the area. Another problem was the powerful, constantly - shifting wind currents. The wind could make the dirigibles dangle and spin over pedestrians, making it both unsafe and impractical. There was also a law stating that airships were not allowed to fly too low over urban areas. These were the main obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 faced.
1745	16578	6	2	5. In this excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple problems while trying to build a dock for dirigibles. One problem was the stress that such a dock would place on the building's structure, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. Another major concern was the safety of the people in the city below. If a dirigible caught fire like the Hindenburg, pedestrians and nearby buildings would be in danger. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, the dock was never really intended for use. It seems that the builders just wanted an excuse to make the building taller than the Chrysler Building. These issues ultimately made the construction of a functional dirigible dock at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
1746	16579	6	2	1. Everyone might desire to board a dirigible and travel from one place to another. However, the builders encountered numerous challenges in the attempt to make this possible. One such challenge was the stress that the single cable tether from the dirigible would impose on the building. Additionally, wind pressure was a perilous factor that had to be considered, as the dirigible's significant weight meant it could easily be blown off - course and cause harm. Strengthening the building to support the dirigible would cost over sixty thousand dollars. A crucial reason against allowing the dirigible to dock was the high risk of fire. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, making safety a major concern. Overall, the dangerous factors associated with allowing the dirigible to dock outweigh the potential benefits. Perhaps in the future, technological advancements will enable a safe way to achieve this.
1747	16580	6	2	"2. According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced difficulties in enabling airships to moor at the building. Violent air - currents led to constantly changing winds on the building's top, which was an obstacle. Moreover, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law would render it illegal for airships to approach the area. In conclusion, these challenges made it unfeasible for airships to moor at the Empire State Building."
1748	16581	6	2	3. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock. Safety was a primary concern. Dirigibles built outside the U.S. used hydrogen, an extremely flammable gas. The destruction of the Hindenburg on May 6, 1937, in Lakehurst, New Jersey, serves as an example of the danger. A dirigible's destruction over a densely populated area could harm many people. Nature also posed an obstacle. At that altitude, violent air currents caused winds to shift constantly, endangering dirigible landings. Even when tethered, the dirigible would sway, making it difficult to dock passengers and conduct inspections. Weighting dirigibles with lead weights was impractical and unsafe at such a height. Laws were another hurdle. A specific law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas and from approaching or tying up to the building. In summary, these obstacles prevented the successful use of the mooring mast.
1749	16582	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. As presented in paragraph nine, the building was not initially designed to hold a one - thousand - foot dirigible with a single rope. Mooring such a large dirigible at the top would add stress to the building's frame, requiring reinforcement. Paragraph thirteen introduced the issue of the dangerous element in dirigibles; hydrogen is highly flammable, and the builders did not want to take risks over a populated area. In paragraph fourteen, it was revealed that the wind speed at the building's top far exceeded that of other docking locations. This made it impossible to use the normal method of tying down the dirigible's back end with a rope and lead. Despite efforts to overcome architectural, safety, and natural flaws, the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock ultimately failed.
1750	16583	6	2	5. Al Smith had a remarkable vision for the Empire State Building. Yet, his enthusiasm for allowing dirigibles to dock at the building's top made him overlook the obvious obstacles. Dirigibles were not safe means of transportation. Hydrogen, used in dirigibles, is highly flammable and poses a risk near large crowds in urban areas like New York. Practically, the mooring mast would not work due to the high elevation. The building's height results in violent winds, making it difficult for dirigibles to land and passengers to disembark. There was also a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. Irvan Clavan accurately stated that the unsolved problems of mooring airships at such a height made it advisable to postpone the final installation of the landing gear. Eventually, technological progress made dirigibles obsolete.
1751	16584	6	2	1. The primary issue with dirigibles landing at the Empire State Building was safety. Dirigibles were extremely large; some measured up to one thousand feet in length, equivalent to four city blocks in New York. The Empire State Building stands at @NUM1 ft tall, and the winds atop it were constantly changing due to strong air currents. On a very windy day, a dirigible attempting to land had the risk of crashing into other buildings, which could penetrate the dirigible's materials. Moreover, the method of tethering to the mooring mast, which involved weighing down the back with lead weights, was dangerous. Having lead weights dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Due to these problems, it was impossible to safely land a dirigible on the mooring mast, presenting a significant challenge for the builders.
1752	16585	6	2	2. There were multiple reasons why the mooring mast could not be used. Wind speeds were a major factor. In 1930, the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible, Los Angeles, approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up because of strong winds, meaning the dirigibles couldn't even reach the docking point. Safety was another concern. In 1937, the German dirigible, Hindenburg, caught fire and crashed. If such an incident occurred over a densely populated area, thousands of people could have been at risk. Additionally, there is a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to get close enough to dock. Overall, these factors combined to prevent the use of the mooring mast.
1753	16586	6	2	"3. During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered several obstacles. Many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen gas, which is highly flammable. After the German dirigible Hindenburg disaster, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the situation could have been. This led to the decision not to use the mast as a docking area. When Al Smith decided to add a mooring mast to the building's top, the architects had to spend ""over @MONEY1"" to modify the building's framework to support the weight of the docking blimps due to the weight of the dirigibles. Moreover, due to strong winds, the docking dirigibles couldn't land properly as they were constantly shifting. Lead weights couldn't be used because of the dangers and impracticalities they posed to the @LOCATION1 below. In conclusion, the overall safety and practicality of the mooring mast were difficult to achieve, and as Al Smith said, the engineers were struggling to find a practical and workable arrangement. Thus, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in enabling dirigibles to dock on the building."
1754	16587	6	2	4. The prospect of docking dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building, though initially profitable, was fraught with major obstacles. The development of the mooring mast was hampered by cost, the flammability of dirigibles, and the weather conditions at an altitude of over @NUM1 feet. Al Smith faced structural and cost - related issues. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure needed to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. To address this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified at a cost of over sixty thousand dollars. This meant Al Smith had to spend more time and money than planned. Another significant problem was that most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. A fire or explosion above a densely populated area like downtown New York would be catastrophic and endanger thousands of people. Finally, the weather at the top of the building was unsuitable for docking. The constantly shifting winds would cause the back of the ship to spin around the mooring mast, posing a danger to the building, surrounding structures, and nearby people. Due to these problems, Al Smith and the engineers were unable to complete the mooring mast.
1755	16588	6	2	"5. In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock on it. These obstacles related to safety, natural factors, and the law. Safety was a prime concern. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building recognized that a fire - related destruction of a dirigible over the densely populated downtown New York area would be a huge disaster. Additionally, the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to strong air currents, causing the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast. Weights used to stabilize dirigibles in open fields couldn't be used on the Empire State Building as they would dangle over pedestrians, posing a danger. Finally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to approach or tie to the building. In the end, these obstacles led to the abandonment of the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
1756	16589	6	2	1. When constructing a dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building, the builders had multiple challenges. They needed to guarantee the safety of the platform for passengers to disembark from the blimps. Additionally, the dock had to be elevated so that the building's owner could retain the record of the world's tallest building. Since merely adding a small structure wouldn't suffice, building a dock was a more viable option.
1757	16590	6	2	"2. The builders of the Empire State Building faced a combination of man - made and natural problems when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. A significant issue was the building's strength. The building's steel was insufficiently strong to ""transmit pressure from the dirigibles' load to the building's foundation."" Moreover, the winds at the building's top were constantly in motion and filled with violent air currents, which could push the Zeppelin into the building's edges. There was also a regulation that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to dock at the building. Cost was another factor; in addition to the building's cost, an extra sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework were necessary to make it strong enough to accommodate an airship. Given all these problems, it's no wonder that dirigibles could not dock at the mooring mast."
1758	16591	6	2	3. According to the excerpt, there were several obstacles that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Constructing a 1454 - ft tall building was already a difficult task, and adding a mast would be even more challenging. Allowing a dirigible to land on the Empire State Building would be dangerous. The German dirigible, the Hindenburg, was destroyed, causing millions of dollars in damage. The owners of the Empire State Building recognized that the accident could have been far worse if it had occurred above a densely populated area like downtown. As a result, the mast was erected but was never used as a dirigible docking point.
1759	16592	6	2	"4. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when aiming to create a structure for dirigibles to dock. The task of building a docking facility on the Empire State Building was both daring and dangerous. Wind was one major obstacle. The winds on the building's top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which made construction difficult as everything could be blown around. Another obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building needed to be modified and strengthened to handle the new docking situation. This meant that the builders first had to reinforce the building to support the docking place before starting its construction. These two obstacles significantly increased the difficulty and time of building the docking place. The builders had to strengthen the building's frame first and also be vigilant about the wind to avoid injury."
1760	16593	6	2	5. The workers faced several obstacles when docking dirigibles. Even when the dirigibles were tied up at the front, the back end would still swivel in the wind. They couldn't attach small weights to the back because if these weights fell, they could harm pedestrians. Additionally, a law was passed that prohibited ships from docking on buildings or coming close to urban areas. These were some of the challenges the workers had to deal with.
1761	16594	6	2	1. Technology had not advanced enough to support dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building. The lack of appropriate equipment on both the building and the dirigibles prevented successful docking, which was one of the challenges faced by the Empire State Building's builders. For instance, when it came to newspaper delivery via dirigibles, this equipment issue posed a significant problem. In conclusion, the technological limitations at the time hindered the practical use of dirigibles for docking at the building.
1762	16595	6	2	2. One of the challenges in enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was strengthening the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure needed to be transferred to the building's foundation, nearly 1100 feet below. Without strengthening, the stress could cause the building to collapse. Another issue was enhancing docking safety. Most non - US dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. A fire - related destruction of a dirigible in downtown New York, a densely populated area, would endanger both passengers and pedestrians. Nature also presented an obstacle. Strong and constantly shifting winds on the building's top could make the back of the dirigible swivel around the mooring mast, which was unsafe. Moreover, laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, as it would put pedestrians and passengers at risk. The dirigible could be blown onto sharp spires of other buildings. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made successful dirigible docking at the Empire State Building extremely difficult.
1763	16596	6	2	3. The architects of the mooring mast failed to anticipate the numerous problems that could occur. Balloons are not very sturdy, and it is well - known that the top of the Empire State Building is windy. The wind could drive the dirigible into the building's spiky structures, leading to disaster. They had no reliable way to secure the dirigible, as the usual method of using lead blocks from 102 stories up was not safe. Additionally, most non - American dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. In a crowded New York City, a hydrogen - related fireball would be catastrophic. The builders really should have planned this project more thoroughly. In conclusion, their lack of foresight made the mooring mast a flawed concept.
1764	16597	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when constructing the mooring mast for dirigibles. High - altitude winds in New York were dangerous. If a blimp attempted to dock, its back could be whipped around, potentially harming people. Many foreign dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen, as seen in the Hindenburg incident. The owners of the Empire State Building considered it too risky to have such dirigibles flying over densely populated areas. There were also laws against low - flying aircraft over urban areas, so docking would mean breaking the law. The idea of the mooring mast was poorly thought out. The builders overlooked the wind, the flammability of the ships, and airspace laws, which ultimately led to the mast's lack of success. Now, the Empire State Building has a long, useless pole on top. In conclusion, these factors combined to make the mooring mast an unviable addition to the building.
1765	16598	6	2	5. The weight of the dirigible was an obstacle. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building by a single cable would add stress to the building's frame. The stress from the load and wind pressure needed to be transferred to the nearly 1100 - foot - deep foundation. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened as it was not designed to bear such weight. Some dirigibles were highly flammable, as most non - US ones used hydrogen instead of helium. Given the building's location in a densely populated area, this was considered too dangerous. Air pressure was another issue. There was a fear that winds could blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings, puncturing its shell. Finally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to land at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these weight, flammability, air pressure, and legal obstacles made dirigible docking at the building unfeasible.
1766	16599	6	2	1. According to the excerpt, the architects who built the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. One major issue was that they couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible, if moored, would exert excessive stress on the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transferred all the way to the foundation, which was eleven hundred feet below. To address this, the Empire State Building had to be strengthened and modified to provide a more robust foundation for the mooring of dirigibles. These were among the many difficulties the builders faced during the mast's design.
1767	16600	6	2	2. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast,” the builders of the building faced several obstacles. Some of these related to the frame's strength. The architects couldn't just install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof as it would over - stress the frame. As a result, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were made to the building's framework. Additionally, the mooring mast was ultimately unable to fulfill its intended purpose. These challenges highlight the complexity of the project and the difficulties in achieving the desired functionality.
1768	16601	6	2	3. When constructing the Empire State Building, the architects encountered a significant problem while trying to install the mooring mast at the very top. As stated in the second sentence of paragraph @CAPS1, “A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame.” This was the most substantial issue among the many they faced. It meant that the building's structure had to be altered to make the mooring mast work. According to the bottom of paragraph @CAPS1, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were necessary. In conclusion, this problem significantly impacted the construction process and required costly solutions.
1769	16602	6	2	4. In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at its mast. The wind was a major problem for the blimps. When tethered to the mast, they would swing dangerously. Moreover, on the rare occasions when a dirigible approached the Empire State Building, the wind prevented it from maneuvering close enough. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Another hindrance was the danger posed to the buildings and people below. Dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. After the German dirigible was destroyed by fire, the owners realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had occurred above a densely populated area. The third obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. Given all these potential dangers and discouraging factors, it is understandable that the Empire State Building was never used for docking dirigibles.
1770	16603	6	2	5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. Additionally, the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transmitted to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. To accommodate this situation, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened. In total, these modifications cost over sixty thousand dollars. These challenges demonstrate the complexity and high cost associated with the attempt to make the building suitable for dirigible docking.
1771	16604	6	2	1. The construction of dirigible docking stations on the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges to the builders. One significant hurdle was the existing law that prohibited low - flying aircraft in urban areas such as New York City. Additionally, docking large blimps at such a great height was inherently unsafe. At nearly @NUM1 hundred feet, the winds were extremely violent. With the tail of the dirigible not secured, it was highly likely to spin around and become entangled with the mast. Moreover, many foreign blimps were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. In the event of a fire similar to the Hindenburg disaster occurring over a densely populated urban area like New York City, the consequences could have been catastrophic. Finally, to build the mast, the builders had to reinforce the building's frame to withstand the stress that the station would impose on the structure. In light of these challenges, the realization of a functional dirigible docking station on the Empire State Building faced substantial difficulties.
1772	16605	6	2	"2. When attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered multiple obstacles. One issue was how to modify the building to support a ""thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable tether,"" as this would place excessive stress on the building's frame. Another problem was the cost; constructing the new structure would require ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications."" Safety was also a crucial concern. While most American blimps use helium, foreign countries predominantly use hydrogen. Given hydrogen's high flammability, it was unacceptable to have it in a densely populated city like New York. Other safety hazards included constantly shifting winds due to violent air currents, as the blimp's back could not be weighted down, and an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made the docking attempts both dangerous and illegal. Ultimately, the mooring mast was never completed due to these insurmountable obstacles."
1773	16606	6	2	"3. According to the excerpt ""The Mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building's builders faced several obstacles. One was ensuring that blimps and other airborne transportation did not interfere with the building. Another was guaranteeing the safety of the docking areas. If a blimp got too close to an urban city like @CAPS1.Y and its flammable fuels leaked, it would result in a major disaster. These were the challenges the builders had to overcome during the construction process."
1774	16607	6	2	"4. In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, various problems with the Empire State Building's mast are detailed. One problem was that a large dirigible tied to the building mast would add stress to the building, potentially causing it to collapse. This issue was resolved by strengthening the building's foundation. A second problem was the highly flammable gases used by dirigibles to achieve buoyancy. If a dirigible caught fire, its metal frame could fall to the ground, endangering citizens below. The last danger was that while the dirigible was docked, strong air currents from the building could cause the dirigible's tail to spin around the mast. One proposed solution was to place lead weights on the back of the ship. However, if one of these weights fell off, it could harm pedestrians below. Due to these persistent problems, the mast could never be put into practical use."
1775	16608	6	2	5. When designing the dirigible dock on top of the Empire State Building, the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 faced @CAPS1 obstacles. One problem was that they could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the building because it was too @CAPS5 for the building's frame. As a result, they had to find a way to modify the building's frame to handle the additional stress of the mooring mast. Another significant issue was the high level of danger involved. Most dirigibles were filled with extremely flammable hydrogen, and they could not risk a disaster similar to what happened to the Hindenburg occurring 102 floors above crowded city streets. These were some of the obstacles that the @CAPS2 had to confront when building the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, which significantly complicated the construction process.
1776	16609	6	2	1. The @CAPS1 indicates that the most significant obstacle would be nature. The wind could blow the blimps onto the sharp spires of other buildings, presenting a substantial challenge to the intended operation.
1777	16610	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous foreseeable problems. One of the most significant issues was that @CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and an explosion in New York would have been catastrophic. The weather also posed a great risk, as the violent and constantly - shifting air currents at the docking area made it difficult to handle dirigibles. The use of lead weights was neither safe nor practical, as it would endanger pedestrians. Additionally, there was a law restricting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Due to these factors, making the Empire State Building a landing area was deemed unsafe.
1778	16611	6	2	3. After the completion of the @ORGANIZATION1, architects were eager to start mooring dirigibles. However, three unforeseen potential problems prevented them from doing so. Firstly, most @CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and after the Hindenburg disaster in @ORGANIZATION2, architects feared a similar and even more devastating catastrophe in @CAPS3. Secondly, high winds at the top of the building made it almost impossible to keep the dirigibles steady. The dirigible would swivel when tied to the building as there was no mechanism to hold the front and back. Thirdly, there was a law against flying dirigibles at the height required for mooring on the Empire State Building. As a result, no dirigibles were ever successfully moored there.
1779	16612	6	2	"4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" To address this, over @MONEY1 in funds would be needed for strengthening and modifying the steel frame, essentially re - working the fundamental building elements. Safety was the greatest concern. Most dirigibles are highly flammable as they contain helium, an extremely flammable gas. If a dirigible were to be mounted on the top of the Empire State Building, its back would sway, potentially dismounting and crashing into a densely populated area. These factors explain the difficulties in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
1780	16613	6	2	"5. During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in enabling dirigibles to dock. One obstacle they had to overcome was a law that prohibited airships (such as planes or dirigibles) from flying too low over urban areas. Paragraph @NUM1 states that ""[this law] would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Another obstacle was nature. The violent and constantly - changing wind currents near the top of the building made it extremely difficult for dirigibles to connect properly to the mast. Paragraph @NUM2 mentions that if a dirigible were connected to the mast, its back would swing. Using lead weights, as done in open landing fields, was neither practical nor safe at the Empire State Building because they would dangle above pedestrians. Due to the numerous obstacles and lack of safe options, the mooring mast project was shut down, demonstrating that the builders faced insurmountable challenges during construction."
1781	16614	6	2	1. Designing a mast for dirigibles to land was a challenging task. Architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof of the @ORGANIZATION1. The stress from a thousand - foot dirigible would transfer weight and wind pressure all the way to the foundation. To construct this mast, the Empire State Building needed to be modified and strengthened. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless - steel tower, illuminated from within, with a stepped - back design mirroring the building's overall shape. This rocket - shaped mast would have four aluminum wings at its corners and rise to a conical roof housing the mooring arm. The winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring would be placed at the back of the machinery. Once all this was completed, the existing building plans were to be implemented.
1782	16615	6	2	"2. The builders of the mooring mast encountered numerous obstacles. Initially, they thought the task would be straightforward, as evidenced when Al Smith was asked about the mooring mast and replied, ""[It's] on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now,"" showing his confidence in the simplicity of the goal. Despite the determination involved in building this world - renowned monument, problems persisted. For instance, the author in paragraph @NUM1 pointed out that the Empire State Building might not fulfill its intended purpose, even though workers should have been more aware. She stated that when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the building's owners realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Problems kept piling up, with nature being one of them. Eventually, due mainly to safety reasons, the project was postponed, and the workers gave up. By the late 1930s, the idea of the mooring mast had nearly faded away. However, what matters is that they made an attempt, driven by just one dream."
1783	16616	6	2	"3. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building's builders faced several problems while trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Safety was one of the primary concerns. As L¸sted mentioned (@NUM1), most dirigibles from outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, a fact the builders had to consider. Nature, specifically the winds, was another obstacle. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (@NUM2), and their unpredictability posed a major challenge. Additionally, the builders had to deal with laws regarding airships flying too low over urban areas. As stated in @NUM3, this law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. In summary, the Empire State Building's builders had to overcome the difficulties of safety, nature, and the law to allow dirigibles to dock."
1784	16617	6	2	"4. The Empire State Building's builders encountered obstacles such as safety, nature, and law when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Safety was a significant concern because most dirigibles made outside of the @LOCATION1 used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. The destruction of a dirigible over a busy city would be catastrophic. Nature also posed problems. Due to ""violent air currents"" (∂ @NUM1), a dirigible would sway even when tied to the mooring mast. Law was another hurdle. Existing legislation prohibited airships from ""flying too low over urban areas"" (∂ @NUM2), meaning dirigibles had no way to land on the urban building. These obstacles of safety, nature, and law hindered the attempt to enable dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building."
1785	16618	6	2	5. In the @CAPS1, docking dirigibles presented multiple issues. Firstly, boarding passengers would be extremely difficult as the dirigible would @CAPS2 due to a gust of wind. Secondly, the gases used to keep the dirigible afloat are highly flammable and can explode easily. These issues made the docking of dirigibles a complex and challenging endeavor.
1786	16619	6	2	1. The Empire State Building's builders encountered numerous challenges when attempting to make it a docking site for dirigibles. Safety was a major concern. Most non - US dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. An accident similar to the Hindenburg disaster over New York City could lead to thousands of casualties due to this combustible substance. Another significant problem was the use of the mooring mast. The winds at the building's top constantly shifted because of air currents. If the wind was uncontrollable and the dirigible not properly tied down, it could dangle dangerously over New Yorkers. Considering these and other factors, it becomes evident that the construction of the mooring mast should never have been considered a feasible endeavor.
1787	16620	6	2	2. In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's The Mooring Mast, readers learn about the Empire State Building's plans and the reasons the Mooring Mast couldn't serve its original purpose. The Mooring Mast was intended as a docking station for dirigibles or blimps. One reason for its non - functionality was that non - US dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. The excerpt mentions that hydrogen is highly flammable, and authorities did not want a large - scale fire in a densely populated area. Violent air currents were another issue. The winds on the building's top were constantly changing, and even if a dirigible was tethered to the mast, its back would be whirled around. Additionally, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The mast was too close to people to allow dirigible docking. Although the mast was a great idea, it couldn't be realized and remains just a dream.
1788	16621	6	2	3. The Empire State Building's builders and architects had a difficult time making the building suitable for dirigible docking. The strong winds near the building's top made it extremely challenging for captains to control their ships. When a dirigible was anchored to the mast by a single tether, the winds would twist it around the spire, making passenger transfer almost impossible. The dense population on the streets below was also a major concern. A disaster similar to the Hindenburg tragedy in New Jersey could cause far more casualties in New York City. Moreover, an existing law against airships flying over urban areas made it illegal to fly a dirigible at the height needed for docking on the Empire State Building's mast. Given these obstacles, it is highly unlikely that the builders could have achieved their dream of docking dirigibles on the mast.
1789	16622	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced two significant obstacles. Weight was one of them. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, nearly @NUM1 feet below. Nature was another obstacle. The greatest hindrance to the successful use of the mooring mast was the constantly shifting winds on the building's top, caused by violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around it. These obstacles made it extremely difficult for the builders to achieve their goal of using the building for dirigible docking.
1790	16623	6	2	5. The architects of the Empire State Building had to overcome several obstacles. They couldn't simply add a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. Instead, they had to modify and strengthen the entire frame to adapt to the new situation. Hydrogen's high flammability was also a major concern. After a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the building's owners realized that a similar accident in New York's crowded streets could be far more disastrous. Nature presented yet another challenge. The winds on the building's top constantly shifted due to violent air currents, causing the back of the dirigible to swivel. Using lead weights to hold it down, as suggested, was neither practical nor safe at the Empire State Building. These obstacles made it very difficult for the architects to make the mooring mast a functional part of the building.
1791	16624	6	2	1. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, the wind conditions at that height were a significant hurdle. The strong and constantly - shifting winds due to violent air currents made it nearly impossible to dock dirigibles. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would continuously swivel around it. The instability of the winds would cause the dirigible to toss and turn in the air, making landing and docking unfeasible. Secondly, there was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach the area. Given these insurmountable obstacles, no dirigibles have successfully docked at the Empire State Building, and it is highly unlikely that any will ever do so in the future.
1792	16625	6	2	2. The builders of the Empire State Building confronted a multitude of obstacles when considering allowing dirigibles to dock on the mast. Initially, they underestimated the complexity of the task. The most challenging aspect was how to securely tie down the blimp. Not only did they have to prevent it from spinning around, but they also had to ensure that it would not rip the building out of its foundation. The constructors also had concerns about safety and legal compliance. Another major issue was that dirigibles flew too low to the ground for docking, and most were filled with highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. After all the efforts towards achieving success, Al Smith and his colleagues had to prioritize the best interests of the people of New York. In light of these significant challenges, allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately not a viable option.
1793	16626	6	2	"3. Dirigibles are large steel - frame balloons covered with cotton and filled with a combination of hydrogen and helium. In the early 1930s, a novel idea emerged: dirigibles would dock at the top of the Empire State Building in New York. After reading ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, it is evident that the builders faced several obstacles. The author points out that ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The air currents on top of the building caused the winds to constantly shift, making the dirigibles move and shift as well. The author also mentions that ""the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law was established for safety reasons. Due to these two main obstacles, nature and the law, the builders were unable to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. This outcome was inevitable given the challenges they faced."
1794	16627	6	2	4. If the builders of the Empire State Building planned to allow dirigibles to dock there, they would have to overcome numerous obstacles. The first and most critical issue was the safety of passengers on the dirigibles and pedestrians on the street below. Dirigibles are filled with highly flammable hydrogen. In 1937, in New Jersey, the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. If such a catastrophe were to occur over New York City, the consequences would be far more severe. Nature also presented a significant threat to the construction of the docking mast. The air currents on top of the building caused the blimp (dirigible) to constantly shift. The only way to control this swaying would be to use weights, which would put the public at risk. In addition to natural hazards, there was an existing law that made it illegal for blimps to dock at the Empire State Building. Overall, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building is completely impractical, considering the safety risks and legal restrictions.
1795	16628	6	2	"5. The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Nature was perhaps the most significant problem as wind is uncontrollable. The wind at the top of the Empire State Building was so strong that, as described, ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around."" This made it extremely difficult to land and undock the dirigibles. The law was another problem. There was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, which would prevent dirigibles from docking at the building. The sharp spire at the top of the building also posed a danger. It was sharp enough to pop the dirigibles flying over it. If a dirigible were to hit the spire, it would burst, potentially causing harm to many people below. Given these numerous and serious obstacles, it was clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not a feasible option."
1796	16629	6	2	"1. When constructing the building, the builders faced an obstacle: there was no convenient way for dirigibles to land. Dirigibles, with a speed of eight miles per hour and as large as four New York City blocks (paragraph @NUM1), presented a problem due to their size, as did the size of the building itself. The large dirigibles would not land in the correct space. Additionally, time constraints were an issue, as the building would not be completed on schedule. The builders often had to pause construction because ""engineers consulted with experts... architects met with presidents"" (paragraph @NUM2). These meetings took up time that could have been used for construction. Any large and wide obstruction would cause problems."
1797	16630	6	2	2. Some of the problems in constructing docking facilities for dirigibles included natural causes such as high winds, as mentioned in ∂ 6. Dirigibles were highly flammable because they used hydrogen gas to achieve flight. Another significant factor was that the project was located in a densely populated area. This meant that if anything went wrong, civilians could be harmed. In conclusion, these issues posed substantial challenges to the construction of the docking facilities.
1798	16631	6	2	"3. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the strong winds at high altitudes that buffeted the blimps with people on board. As stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" Another setback was the illegality of flying an aircraft at such a low altitude, as it was ""illegal for a ship to tie up to a building."" Moreover, it was dangerous for hydrogen - powered dirigibles to dock due to hydrogen's high flammability. Ultimately, the Mooring Mask of the Empire State Building became merely an attraction for sightseers."
1799	16632	6	2	4. The builders of the Empire State Building faced an obstacle in the form of an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. Despite this, two dirigibles attempted to reach the building before the entire idea was abandoned. In the end, the legal restriction effectively halted the plan for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1800	16633	6	2	"5. You're asking what they had to endure to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building? Well, they faced numerous challenges. As they said, ""one obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area."" They couldn't find a proper landing spot for the dirigibles without something going wrong. Another obstacle was nature. Strong winds could blow people away. Their plan to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building didn't work because there were too many issues. These were the main obstacles they had to overcome to allow the dirigibles to dock there."
