1	11827	5	2	In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir of @PERSON3's life, an atmosphere of gratitude pervades, highlighting how his parents bestowed love upon him throughout his existence. Both of his parents were born and raised in Cuba. In 1956, they migrated to the United States, starting afresh and taking up any available jobs. Then, in 1961, @PERSON2, @CAPS1, was born. His parents nurtured him with love and care, and introduced him to his Cuban heritage. As @PERSON2 recounted his story, readers could clearly sense his profound gratitude for having such a family. Moreover, when he shared about his non - blood - related family and how his parents' lives transformed upon moving to @LOCATION2, he demonstrated the respect he held for them.
2	11828	5	2	"In the excerpt from Home the Blueprints of Our Lives, the author, Narciso Rodriguez, maintains a consistent overall mood. While parts of his story make it seem like nostalgia, as he often talks about his love for childhood, nowhere does he indicate a longing to return to the past. He repeatedly emphasizes the loving and selfless nature of his family, their acts of aiding others, and how he became part of a larger ""family"" with his neighbors. Based on this, I believe the tone is one of love and admiration towards his parents. Rodriguez states that his parents were incredibly brave to leave their lives in Cuba so that he could have a better life. He also mentions numerous times how they helped those in need. If I were in Rodriguez's position, I would surely love and admire my parents just as much, if not more, for their selfless deeds and the way they raised their son."

34	11860	5	2	While reading Narciso's memoir, I am filled with joy. This joy primarily stems from the fact that Narciso's parents were able to survive and thrive. They arrived in @LOCATION1 “without any knowledge of the language or culture.” As is common with @CAPS1 immigrant families, getting on their feet is not an immediate process, but they managed to do so. In just a year, they went from a @NUM1 - room apartment to a @NUM2 - room apartment. Another reason for my joy is the warm and welcoming nature of their family. In today's world, many people are losing their jobs and homes and have nowhere to turn, but the Rodriguez family provided a haven. As the memoir states, “Countless extended family members came & went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet.

We learn so much from our parents, including how to act and conduct ourselves.

Similar to him, I spent most of my life in an apartment, and because of the caring parents there, I regarded it as just another home. Growing up in that environment also taught him that family doesn't necessarily have to be blood - related; neighbors or friends can be like brothers, sisters, aunts, or uncles. This shows how the family concept can be broad and inclusive.
42	11868	5	2	In this story, the predominant moods were security and happiness. Security was evident when people of diverse cultures and heritages lived together harmoniously at a time of significant racial tension in @LOCATION1. Happiness was manifested in multiple ways.

Overall, @PERSON1 was content with his entire childhood and seemed to cherish every moment of it, highlighting the positive impact of his upbringing.

On the other hand, @CAPS1 is happy that his parents sacrificed everything for him to have a better life. The @CAPS2 is a resilient person, having endured both good and bad moods throughout the memoir, which showcases the complexity of human emotions in life."

But as the story moves towards the middle and end, it shifts to a sad tone. This is not only because his life was difficult but also because of his gratitude and the fact that his parents seemed to be great people. I draw this conclusion from the start and end of the story, where his life's hardships are evident, yet he tries to make the best of things and claims to have had a good time. This is my opinion and answer regarding the mood of the story.
194	12020	5	2	"The author of the memoir successfully creates a mood of gratefulness. This is achieved by repeatedly highlighting what his parents have given him and expressing his gratitude. Firstly, in paragraph @NUM1, the author mentions his gratitude for his parents sparking his interest in cooking. The text states, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their... love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This clearly shows his thankfulness for being introduced to the love of cooking. In paragraph @NUM2, the author says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" indicating his gratitude for his parents' endurance in coming to @LOCATION1. Overall, the mood of the memoir is one of gratefulness, as the author is thankful for all that his parents have provided."
195	12021	5	2	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the author creates a warm and comforting mood. The author, who grew up with parents who immigrated from Cuba, describes how they transformed a one - bedroom apartment into a traditional Cuban home. His life revolved around the kitchen, and his parents always did their best to provide for him. The author also expresses, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice"" and adds, ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing I could ever have done."" This conveys the warm and comforting mood created by the author, highlighting the deep - seated appreciation and the sense of home."
196	12022	5	2	The author of the memoir crafted a happy mood. This made me feel elated as it's heartening to realize that 'family' isn't defined by blood relations. It implies that everyone around you who cares for you is part of your 'family'. Another factor contributing to the memoir's happy mood is that I believe if my parents were in Narciso's parents' situation, they would have taken the same course of action. They too would have strived 'to give their children a better life'. Overall, the caring nature of Narciso's parents as depicted in this memoir fills me with happiness.
197	12023	5	2	The memoir has a happy mood. The Rodriguez family made the journey across the border from Cuba to the United States in 1956 in search of a better life. However, they had to wait until 1970 to be reunited with their aunts and others. Now, they have a larger house and are thankful to be living in the United States. This series of events and the family's current state clearly contribute to the happy mood of the memoir.
198	12024	5	2	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by @PERSON1, a distinct mood is established throughout the story. Mood refers to the feeling conveyed to readers through literature. In this particular work, the mood is one of pride and festivity. @PERSON1 achieves this through the use of various words and phrases.

Moreover, the theme is festive as @PERSON1 describes the frequent large - scale parties and dinners at his home. Additionally, @ORGANIZATION1 creates a festive mood when writing, ""My parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country"", highlighting that the family enjoyed partying with others. In conclusion, the memoir ""@PERSON2"" is permeated with themes of festivity and pride."
199	12025	5	2	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, I believe there is a single predominant mood. The author aims to evoke a sense of happiness in the readers. There are numerous examples that support this view. I think the best one is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This exemplifies happiness because despite not living in a large house, the family was content with what they had. That, in my opinion, is the mood the author successfully created."
200	12026	5	2	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, a powerful mood of closeness and selflessness is established, which significantly enhanced Narciso's childhood. This mood stems from his memoir where, despite living in poverty, his life was enriched by the strong bond among friends and family. This bond overcame racism and difficult times, as evidenced by the statement ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"". The mood reflects the behavior of Narciso's community and shows the tight - knit relationship among his friends and family, helping readers understand his community. Additionally, the mood is one of selflessness. Narciso describes his community as consisting of ""honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily of their own kind, were clearly in need"". In summary, Narciso effectively creates a mood of closeness and selflessness in his memoir."
201	12027	5	2	"@PERSON1"" is a short - story featuring a boy who is extremely grateful and shows abundant appreciation towards his parents. Even after moving to ""@LOCATION1"", he still feels at home. In paragraph ""@NUM1"", it states that his parents made his new home resemble the Cuban home he had back in Cuba by putting Cuban items on the wall. I believe that in this short - story, his gratitude is evident as, in paragraph ""@NUM2"", he claims he will never forget how his parents transformed a simple house into a home. ""@PERSON1"" is a calm and heartwarming short - story that leaves a positive impression."
202	12028	5	2	"In an excerpt from the memoir ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by @PERSON1, an internationally recognized clothing designer, there is a palpable mood of affectionate remembrance of a warm and loving setting, along with gratitude for the lessons learned in this environment. Narciso highlights that his parents created a home for him, despite making numerous sacrifices. He describes his @NUM1 - room apartment as ""a traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This quote is significant as it initiates the explanation of why his house evokes so many warm memories in his writing. Narciso elaborates on how many immigrants in his neighborhood come together, support one another, and form a large family. He says, ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" Many neighbors joined Narciso's family for meals, strengthening their bonds. At the memoir's conclusion, Narciso expresses profound gratitude that his parents left their lives in Cuba to give him a better future in @LOCATION1, despite the hardships. This unwavering thankfulness is a central theme of the memoir."
203	12029	5	2	Narciso Rodriguez has an intense love for his family and home. In his memoir, he discusses the sacrifices his parents made.

He hopes that readers can feel the same happiness he experiences when he thinks about his home and the wonderful life his parents provided.

In paragraph @NUM2, she conveys friendship when she mentions that her babysitter was her first friend. Finally, in paragraph @NUM3, her expression of ""she will never forget how her parents turned this simple house into a home"" shows her happiness and gratitude towards her parents. These are the prominent moods in the memoir."
205	12031	5	2	"The overarching mood in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is one of thankfulness. Rodriguez is grateful that his parents left Cuba to offer him a better life, even though they had to leave behind ""family, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" He is also appreciative that his parents taught him selflessness and generosity. For instance, he mentions that ""there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet,"" which is a generous act. Moreover, Rodriguez is thankful for his Cuban culture. Cuban culture includes cooking and music, but most importantly, it emphasizes family, which is not defined by blood relations but by respect and love for everyone. The mood of thankfulness is manifested in various aspects of this memoir."
206	12032	5	2	The mood established by the author in the memoir was uplifting. The memoir details the author's upbringing in Newark, New Jersey, during the immigration era, a place that was becoming increasingly ghettoized. The neighborhood was populated with Spanish, [PERSON1], and Italian immigrants. The author's family would often gather for dinner, and they would offer accommodation to others until they could stand on their own feet. The author had a childhood filled with family and friendship, which is truly a valuable asset.
207	12033	5	2	"The excerpt has a very bright mood. The author, Narciso Rodriguez, portrays her parents as risk - taking and loving. She elaborates on the numerous things her parents have bestowed upon her. As she writes, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... Both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today... Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" Clearly, Narciso Rodriguez describes her early life and home with happiness and gratitude. This sentiment is generously conveyed throughout the excerpt. Many authors use such tones to express their personal feelings and opinions, and in this case, the author aimed to convey joy in her writing."

For instance, in paragraph [NUM1], Narciso states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for the love and sacrifice,"" which clearly shows his contentment with his parents. The memoir also delves into his affection for his house, along with the wonderful memories associated with it. This indicates that the overall mood of the memoir is positive rather than sad. In paragraph [NUM2], he says, ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this combo house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" Additionally, he mentions in the same paragraph, ""It here where I learned the real definition of family. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."
209	12035	5	2	"The mood crafted by the [CAPS1] in the memoir is one of happiness. This can be inferred from what is stated in paragraph [NUM1]: ""In our neighborhood, despite the customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship."" This implies that there was a happy and friendly family environment. In conclusion, this is the mood that I believe the [CAPS1] created, along with the reasons behind it."
210	12036	5	2	The author creates an interesting mood in the memoir. The author's parents were originally from Cuba and arrived in the United States in 1956. After spending a year in a furnished one - room apartment, 21 - year - old Rawedia Maria and 27 - year - old [ORGANIZATION1] were able to move into a modest three - room apartment. In 1961, the author was born in this simple house located in a two - family, blond - brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. This backstory contributes to the interesting mood that the author has created in the memoir.
211	12037	5	2	"The mood of this memoir is one of gratitude. Narciso expresses his deep - seated gratitude for his parents who sacrificed everything to provide him with a better life. He also conveys appreciation when discussing how the Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people in his neighborhood collaborated rather than exhibiting racism. Moreover, he discovered the true meaning of ""family"" during his time in that house. For him, ""family"" was not confined to blood relations; it encompassed everyone who entered his apartment and all the residents of the building. Overall, the memoir is imbued with a grateful mood."
212	12038	5	2	"While recounting his childhood, the memoirist crafted a heart - warming and poignant mood. I'm particularly struck by the passage where he states, ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encomposed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This offers a comprehensive view of an ordinary day in his childhood. Additionally, his assertion that family ""has nothing to do with being a blood relative"" not only makes the memoir engaging but also imparts valuable lessons. All things considered, this memoir is truly excellent, and the heart - warming mood it evokes will stay with me. I sincerely hope that I can one day pen a memoir as touching and interesting as this one."
213	12039	5	2	"The author established a joyful atmosphere in the writing. The author mentioned, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows the author's view that people can be close and regarded as family without being blood - related. Also, the author says, ""my mother and father had came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" Clearly, the author is proud of his parents' courageous act of moving to a new country under such difficult circumstances. In conclusion, the joyful mood is well - conveyed through these aspects of the writing."
214	12040	5	2	I believe the mood created by @CAPS1 is one of happiness. He talks about embarking on a new life and how thankful he is for his family. His happiness is also evident in having his extended family, like cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents, by his side. The place where he lives also makes him happy. He loves it because his friends and babysitter live above him, and he knows they are there for him. Based on the story and @CAPS2's words, it's clear that the overall mood is one of happiness.
215	12041	5	2	"In the memoir, the author creates a mood where Narciso Rodriguez takes pride in his Cuban culture and heritage, and values family highly. In paragraph @NUM1, he says, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This indicates that he accepts people as family beyond blood ties. In conclusion, the author effectively portrays Narciso's strong connection to his culture and his inclusive concept of family through the mood of the memoir."
216	12042	5	2	"In the memoir, the author creates a mood of gratitude due to the parents' sacrifices for their child. There is also a sense of friendliness as they have ""family"" in the United States, with open - arms and open doors. The author shows courage by persevering in learning the language and seeking employment.

Overall, these various moods combine to paint a rich picture of the author's experiences."
217	12043	5	2	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author exudes happiness. He portrays his home as a family - centered place and expresses gratitude towards his parents for all they've done. His childhood was enjoyable, surrounded by loving individuals and many friends. This description of his upbringing clearly showcases the author's state of happiness in the memoir."
218	12044	5	2	"The author's mood in the text has a gentle yet happy tone. The gentleness stems from his detailed account of his upbringing and life. Unlike those who might talk aimlessly, he delves into memories to accurately recreate scenes. For instance, he describes, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" The parts with a happy mood are those he remembers most vividly. As an example, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" He likely remembers this clearly because he may cook for his family using his parents' recipes. In conclusion, these elements contribute to the overall gentle and happy mood of the text."
219	12045	5	2	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is definitely one of pride. The author's detailed account of his life journey from humble beginnings to becoming a famous fashion designer is a clear indication of this pride. Additionally, when he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home,"" it further emphasizes his pride. Overall, the author successfully conveys a strong sense of self - pride throughout the memoir."
220	12046	5	2	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a mood that encourages readers to reflect on their own lives and relive great experiences, just as the author does in his mind. It prompts one to think about all the wonderful times spent with family. This mood effectively engages the reader in a journey of self - recollection and family - centered reflection."
221	12047	5	2	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"", the author successfully crafts an atmosphere brimming with gratitude and passion. Throughout the text, the use of evocative words such as ""aromas,"" ""endless,"" ""encompassed,"" and ""instilled"" reflects the author's intention to convey a rich and passionate mood. It is evident that the author is deeply moved by the subject matter and subtly shares these emotions with the readers, who can sense this fervor while reading. Additionally, the author adds an element of gratitude to the overall mood. Parenthetical phrases like ""(and for which I am eternally grateful)"" and ""(which I adore to this day)"" allow readers to perceive the author's thankfulness towards their parents. A direct statement, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" further emphasizes this sentiment. Through the author's choice of words and statements, the memoir ""@PERSON1"" exudes a mood of both passion and gratitude, which is why it can be accurately described as such."
222	12048	5	2	The memoir's mood is one of happiness as it depicts a place where neighbors are like family and everyone is closely - knit. Sergio and @PERSON1, who lived in the basement apartment, became surrogate grandparents. Alegria, the author's first friend, often had dinner with them. The entire memoir focuses on how the author's parents taught him the true meaning of family and the importance of being open to friends and neighbors. In essence, these elements combine to create a heart - warming and happy mood throughout the memoir.
223	12049	5	2	"The author of the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" establishes an overall mood of profound gratefulness. The author expresses extreme gratitude for the sacrifice, love, care, and selflessness of their parents. Alongside this, a mood of happiness, unity, and love is also cultivated, reflecting experiences throughout the author's life. The author's gratitude towards their parents is evident in the recollection of their decision to leave Cuba, their homeland, along with friends, family, and jobs, in pursuit of better opportunities for their child in @LOCATION1. Throughout the memoir, the author repeatedly thanks their parents for the love, family, friends, and selflessness they brought into their life. The author describes how their parents formed new friendships and a sense of community in the neighborhood, leading to a feeling of love, friendship, and unity. As the family grew, the small three - room childhood apartment transformed into a real home. With the use of language like ""I've thanked them repeatedly,"" the memoir is permeated with a mood of utter gratefulness."
224	12050	5	2	I analyzed the mood created by the author in the memoir and found that they put in significant effort to establish it. Through various literary devices and expressions, the author managed to craft a distinct mood that engages the readers. This shows the author's dedication to creating an immersive experience for the audience, and overall, their hard work in setting the mood is quite evident.
225	12051	5	2	"In his memoir, the author creates a mood of profound gratitude and happiness. In paragraph six, the statement ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" clearly shows the author's deep - seated thankfulness towards their parents.

Finally, he mentions ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"", showing that he will always cherish the time spent in a loving family home. In conclusion, @PERSON1 Rodriguez not only depicts the mood but also his childhood experiences of learning about family."
227	12053	5	2	Someone attempts to make you feel sad. I'm not certain if this is real, but it didn't have the intended effect. In the end, despite the attempt, the effort to induce sadness was unsuccessful.
228	12054	5	2	"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" creates a highly uplifting and happy mood. One reason for this is that it highlights Narciso's profound gratitude towards his parents. In paragraph @NUM1, he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This line is particularly meaningful and uplifting as it reflects his appreciation for his parents' immigration and the better life they provided. Another reason is found in paragraph @NUM2, where he says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with a blood relative."" This is uplifting because it emphasizes that family can consist of those who love and support you, rather than just blood relations. Lastly, the memoir demonstrates that love can bring about positive change, further contributing to its uplifting nature. Overall, the memoir effectively conveys an uplifting and happy mood through these elements."
229	12055	5	2	"In the memoir, the author creates a mood that can be interpreted in two ways. One aspect is a sense of happiness for being created and being able to experience America's hospitality. The statement ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with a blood relative"" reflects this. The other aspect is the belief that with hope, anything can be achieved, as shown by the line ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". In conclusion, the memoir's mood encompasses both happiness and the power of hope."
230	12056	5	2	"In this memoir, the author maintains a consistent mood throughout. The mood is comforting and happy. One way this mood is conveyed is through the description of the environment, which shows a strong sense of family. The quote ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" demonstrates this, as the family welcomed others and made them feel at home. Another reason for the comforting and happy mood is the portrayal of the people as kind and helpful to those they met. The statement ""It was a close - knit community of honest hard - working immigrants who extend a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"" illustrates this. In conclusion, the memoir effectively creates a happy and comforting mood through these descriptions."
231	12057	5	2	In the memoir “Narciso Rodriguez” from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates a mood of family organization. The author mentions that both parents shared cooking duties and unconsciously passed on their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking, which the author still holds dear today. This shows how the parents worked together to organize the family, and that is the mood conveyed in the memoir.
232	12058	5	2	The author of the memoir creates a mood of love. The text provides evidence such as “My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.” Another excerpt, “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them my admiration for the strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are,” further emphasizes this. In conclusion, due to the parents' love for their child, they made great sacrifices so that the child could have a happy and good life.
233	12059	5	2	I believe the mood created by the author in the memoir is one of gratitude and happiness. If my parents did what the author's parents did, I'd be extremely grateful because they did it all for my happiness and a better life. The text states “And for which I am eternally grateful” and “They Came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life.” It's truly remarkable what the author's parents did; they're very strong and did it all for their children's happiness. That's why I think these two moods are present in the memoir.
234	12060	5	2	In my opinion, the author creates multiple moods in the memoir, but the main ones are happiness and gratitude. The story gives a sense of happiness as it describes the good times @PERSON1 had at home. For instance, @PERSON1 says “here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house.” It also has a tone of gratitude because much of the story involves @PERSON1 thanking his parents for their sacrifices. At the end of the memoir, @PERSON1 says “I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,” in a way thanking them for everything. So, these are the moods I believe the author crafted in the memoir.
235	12061	5	2	The memoir creates a very home - centered mood. It's astonishing how the parents transformed a “simple house” into a “traditional Cuban home.” They played “Passionate Cuban music” and their “love of cooking” contributed to a family - oriented atmosphere, demonstrating their deep love for their heritage. The author states that “Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative.” This family enjoyed spending time together and celebrating. Overall, the mood of the memoir is loving, happy, and caring.
236	12062	5	2	When I read about Narciso Rodriguez, I was struck by a sense of togetherness. This mood stemmed from his frequent discussions about being with his family. The home where he grew up had a unifying effect on his family, and this filled him with pride in his family and Cuban culture. Given the significance of his family to him, another prominent mood was love. His love for his family and the house where he learned to love was palpable. His parents dedicated a great deal to him, transforming a simple house into a warm home. He learned everything from them and held them in high regard. These were the emotions I experienced while reading about Narciso Rodriguez.
237	12063	5	2	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, a gentle and consistent mood is established. Rodriguez reveals that his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family,"" suggesting a life relatively free from violence. He also expresses his gratitude for his parents' love and sacrifice, making it clear that he loves them deeply. Moreover, he states that he ""will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The sense of gentleness pervades the entire memoir as Rodriguez consistently focuses on the positive aspects of his life rather than the negative."
238	12064	5	2	"The memoir creates a happy mood. This is evident when the author writes, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day),"" indicating a deep - seated love for her cultural music. Additionally, the statement ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" shows an inclusive view of family. It emphasizes that love and care are what truly matter in a family. Finally, the line ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" reflects on the growth of the family from a small unit to a larger one as relatives came to the house and started a new life there. Overall, these elements contribute to the happy mood throughout the memoir."
239	12065	5	2	The memoir evokes a feeling closely associated with Cuban culture and the author's home, which can be described as homey. In a particular part of the memoir, the author first introduces the customs of the house. The house is depicted as simple, filled with the sounds of Cuban music and the aroma of Cuban food. This feeling permeates the entire memoir, as if the essence of the house has infused the text. Moreover, the memoir not only showcases Cuban cultural elements but also emits strong family vibes, highlighting the author's close - knit relationship with his family.
240	12066	5	2	The author creates a certain mood within the memories. Although the original text does not elaborate further, we can assume that this mood is likely to be a blend of emotions tied to the experiences and events recounted. It could be a mood of nostalgia, happiness, or perhaps a combination of both. The mood serves as a backdrop that enriches the memories and makes them more engaging for the reader. Overall, the mood set by the author plays an important role in how the memories are perceived and understood.
241	12067	5	2	In the memoir, the author, presumably Narciso Rodriguez, seems to be portraying his happy childhood. The memair details his affection for his home, his parents' cooking, and music. He expresses deep gratitude for his parents' care and self - sacrifice. He appreciates that his home served as a community for Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. Recalling his memorable birthdays and feasts brings him happiness. This is a summary of the mood presented by Narciso Rodriguez in the story.
242	12068	5	2	In the memoir “Narciso Rodriguez” from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso conveys a mood of profound gratitude, thankfulness, and optimism. Throughout the text, he expresses his appreciation to specific individuals for the positive impact they've had on his life. In paragraph six, he states, “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.” This statement highlights his gratitude towards his parents for bringing him to @LOCATION1 and enabling him to become who he is today. He also exudes a happy and thankful tone, believing that his life in @LOCATION1 is far better than it would have been in Cuba. Moreover, despite coming from a small two - family home, he remains hopeful about his life in @LOCATION1 and thanks his parents for their generous sacrifice. Overall, Narciso appears to be a grateful, thankful, and optimistic man in the memoir.
243	12069	5	2	The author creates a complex mood in this memoir, one that is both happy and uplifting as well as sad. The instances of a happy mood include the description in paragraph @NUM1 of how the author's parents could afford to move into a better, @NUM2 - room apartment: “twenty - one - year - old @PERSON2 and twenty - seven - year - old Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, @NUM2 - room apartment.” Another example is when he describes his parents decorating the apartment to resemble a traditional Cuban home: “Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home.” He also mentions the united and hard - working immigrant community in his neighborhood: “In our neighborhood all of those cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.” Additionally, he notes that many of his family and friends often visited their kitchen. However, the mood shifts around paragraph @NUM3, where it states, “Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved.” This is when the parents leave Cuba and their loved ones for a life in @LOCATION1. An example of the sad mood is the mention that “The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved,” indicating the difficult job - seeking situation in @LOCATION1. These are the various moods established by the author in the memoir.
244	12070	5	2	In my opinion, the mood described by the author in the memoir is one of gratitude and happiness. The main character, Narciso Rodriguez, frequently expresses his gratitude for his parents' support during his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1, he says, “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.” The story also conveys a happy mood. As it states, “At a time when overt racism was the norm... All of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.” Even in the face of racism, the community members were friends, which adds to the positive mood of the memoir.
245	12071	5	2	The predominant mood in Narciso's memoir is one of admiration and gratitude towards his parents. He repeatedly expresses his thankfulness. In paragraph @NUM1, it reads, “My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love.” The entire paragraph @NUM1 is centered around his gratitude. Another instance of his gratitude is in paragraph @NUM3, where he says, “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done.” This paragraph also showcases his admiration for his parents. In conclusion, the mood in the memoir is one of love towards his parents.
246	12072	5	2	"In Narciso Rodriguez's non - fiction memoir ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", he shares details about his upbringing, his home, and the people around him. Rodriguez regarded his neighbors as part of his family, not just his immediate blood relatives. As he stated, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative... a close - knit community."" This sentiment gives the memoir a friendly tone, indicating his affection for the entire neighborhood. He often invited neighbors into his home and was on close terms with them. For instance, ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria... lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table... more often than not. Also at the table... my surrogate grandparents."" This creates an inviting mood, as the author regularly had friends and neighbors over for dinner. Additionally, Rodriguez expresses his gratitude towards his parents, saying, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""

This portrayal of family unity and the sacrifices made by his parents contributes to the overall warm and comforting feeling of the text. In conclusion, the author effectively conveys a sense of comfort through his description of family life and the sacrifices of his parents.
249	12075	5	2	To me, the mood in this memoir is one of comfort. It's incredibly comforting because it's such a happy account. These two young people frequently invite others to their home and let them stay until they can get back on their feet. There's not a trace of sadness; it's just a happy and welcoming family, which really comforts me. Another aspect I love is their lifestyle. They're so proud of their Cuban heritage. They listen to Cuban music and cook Cuban food. I admire people who aren't afraid to be themselves. Knowing that everyone is happy brings me comfort. That's why, for me, the mood of this memoir is all about comfort. In conclusion, the combination of the happy family environment and the celebration of their heritage makes this memoir a source of comfort.
250	12076	5	2	The author creates a mood of gratitude and happiness in the memoir. The author describes the feelings of the boy in the story. The boy believes his parents are truly wonderful and thinks he can never match their qualities. He is also grateful for having a home and such parents. He admires his parents and their actions. He will always remember growing up and living in that house. The author's purpose is to show how grateful someone can be for what their parents did when they immigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1. In conclusion, through the boy's feelings and the author's description, the mood of gratitude and happiness is effectively conveyed, highlighting the significance of the parents' sacrifices.
251	12077	5	2	In @CAPS1's memoir, the author crafted a distinct mood. There are several aspects to support this, including the emergence of a new mood, the author's sense of gratefulness, and their perspective on things. First, a new mood can be identified. As the text transitions from sentences to parentheses, a new mood surfaces and then subsides. For instance, the description “Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with aromas of the kitchen” showcases this shift. Second, @CAPS1 is extremely grateful for how life has unfolded. The statement “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice” from the story serves as evidence. Third, @CAPS1 views his experiences as fortunate. Ultimately, these elements – the new mood, gratefulness, and perspective – contribute to the overall mood created by the author.
252	12078	5	2	In the memoir, the author's mood is notably happy. It gives the impression that a child from a grateful family is speaking. In fact, this author might be one of the most grateful individuals I've ever encountered in literature. The author's statement “I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home” clearly reflects their profound gratitude. Overall, this memoir is filled with a heart - warming and appreciative atmosphere.
253	12079	5	2	Narciso Rodriguez establishes a truly original and grateful mood in the excerpt. Throughout, he consistently expresses his deep - seated gratitude towards his parents for their selflessness and courage. For example, when he says “I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing and I could have ever done,” it becomes evident how much he values his parents' actions. Another instance is when he remarks “they came, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love.” This shows that he understands the sacrifices his parents made and is genuinely grateful. In conclusion, Rodriguez effectively conveys a strong sense of gratitude in the excerpt.
254	12080	5	2	I firmly believe that the author creates a happy and loving mood. In paragraph @NUM1, the statement “Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative” implies that @CAPS1 considers family to include friends and those close to them, not just blood - related individuals. The excerpt also mentions “It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays,” which demonstrates the love shared among everyone. Moreover, “It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of family” evokes a warm and happy feeling about family. Overall, the author successfully creates a mood full of love and happiness.
255	12081	5	2	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates diverse moods. In paragraph two, the author describes how much culture was infused into their home, stating “my young parents created our traditional Cuban home.” The author also expresses gratitude for the love of cooking and Cuban music instilled by their parents, which gives the impression of a warm, comfortable, and vibrant home. In paragraph three, the author posits that family isn't defined by blood relations, as seen in “Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative.” As the memoir progresses, the author's views on home and family become clearer. In paragraph six, the author's gratitude towards their parents is palpable with the statement “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,” creating a mood of thankfulness. In paragraphs three and four, the author talks about unity, with parents always having their doors open to those in need, and the community being like a family, as in “cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship” and “My parents always kept their arms and door open to many people we considered family.” All these moods combine to create a strong sense of home and community.
256	12082	5	2	"People often make sacrifices for their loved ones, which is the essence of self - sacrifice. In the story, Narciso's parents demonstrated this selflessness. They left behind their family and friends to provide their son with a better life. The author crafted an enjoyable and heartwarming atmosphere. Narciso is extremely grateful. He claims to have ""learned the definition of 'family'"". His parents' desire for a better life for him led them to give up a great deal, and he acknowledges this. Rodriguez recognized his parents' hard - work and respects and loves them for all they've done. He said, ""I often tell them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" It's truly wonderful to know that someone would do anything for you. Family is of utmost importance. @PERSON1 noted that his neighbors were all immigrants who also left their families and only had each other. Having people who are like family is amazing. While friends can never replace blood relatives, they are the next best thing. In my view, @PERSON1 learned two very important lessons while growing up: putting others before oneself and working hard."
257	12083	5	2	In my opinion, the @CAPS1 established by the author is a complex blend of sentimentality, sadness, and happiness. I believe it is predominantly sentimental because the family relocates to @LOCATION1 and reflects on the wonderful memories they had in Cuba. This transition from their homeland to a new place evokes a range of emotions. The act of leaving behind a familiar environment where so many cherished moments took place brings a touch of sadness. Yet, the new beginning in @LOCATION1 also holds the promise of a different kind of happiness. Overall, the @CAPS1 effectively captures the bittersweet nature of such a life - changing event.
258	12084	5	2	"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives exudes a happy mood. In paragraph @NUM1, the author describes ""passionate Cuban music filling the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"", which paints a vivid picture of a joyous and lively household. Also in paragraph @NUM1, the statement ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of our kitchen"" indicates the author's happiness, as their love for cooking is evident. Narciso Rodriguez further mentions that ""it was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and @CAPS1 celebrated my first birthdays"", suggesting that everyone enjoyed coming to this house. All in all, the memoir successfully creates a warm and happy mood throughout."
259	12085	5	2	"The author of this memoir creates a mood of gratitude. In the initial paragraphs, it's clear that the family's home is not of high - quality, and they lead a severely lower - class life rather than an average middle - class one. However, despite these material deficiencies, they compensated through the unity of their ""family"". Here, ""family"" refers to the community of immigrants who came together and supported one another. Narciso reveals that even though his family had very little to spare, they always shared what they had with those in need. By following the example set by his parents, he learned life lessons that he will never forget. He is, therefore, perpetually thankful and grateful to his parents for showing him the way. This mood of gratitude is a central theme in the memoir, highlighting the importance of human connection and self - lessness."
260	12086	5	2	"The memoir conveys its mood through multiple elements. By using positive words, frequently expressing thankfulness, and describing a cosy setting, it creates a happy and positive atmosphere. Positive words are abundant in the article. For instance, it states ""@CAPS1 'It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people'"". The words ""honest"", ""hardworking"", and the phrase ""extended a hand"" (which implies offering help) all contribute to a happy mood. The author's constant expressions of gratitude, such as ""(and for which I am eternally thankful)"", also evoke a positive feeling since people are usually thankful for good things. Moreover, the setting described in the memoir adds to the positive mood. It says ""@CAPS1 'within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen'"". This description portrays a happy, cosy, and positive setting. In conclusion, the memoir's use of positive language, frequent expressions of thankfulness, and a pleasant setting all combine to create a happy, positive, and nice mood."
261	12087	5	2	The memoir evokes a calm and thankful mood. The calmness stems from the absence of conflicts, while the thankfulness is evident as the author repeatedly expresses gratitude towards their parents for the sacrifices they made for future generations. Overall, this calm and thankful mood pervades the entire memoir.
262	12088	5	2	Prior to reading about @PERSON1, I had never encountered anyone as happy as them. @PERSON1 takes great joy in being a citizen of @CAPS1 while also cherishing their Cuban background. They consider themselves fortunate to have a home in a wonderful neighborhood, where the kitchen serves as the heart of the house. Despite the house not being a mansion or even a large one, @PERSON1 is extremely proud of their living place. Above all, @PERSON1 is overjoyed about their parents. Without them, @PERSON1 would still be in Cuba, unaware of this great neighborhood and all the family and friends they have now. In essence, @PERSON1's happiness is a result of their unique circumstances and the love of their parents.
263	12089	5	2	The author creates a mood that reflects a profound longing for their hometown, the place where they were born and raised. It is evident that the author misses this place more than anything and desires to have @CAPS1 back. The author will never forget the events that took place and their own experiences in that house.

The mood Rodriguez creates is so powerful that it compels readers to pause and reflect."
265	12091	5	2	"In the memoir, the author establishes a happy mood. Narciso Rodriguez shares what he enjoyed and is thankful for from his childhood. He does so by describing how his kitchen table was always surrounded by his ""family"", as he puts it, ""countless extended family members came and went"", indicating a constant presence of people. He also expresses gratitude for his parents' decision to move to @LOCATION1 ""to give their children a better life"". Finally, he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Overall, the author creates a happy mood by reminiscing about his childhood filled with family and by thanking his parents for the sacrifices they made to provide him with a better life."
266	12092	5	2	The @CAPS2 creates a warm and happy mood. Reading it gives one a feeling similar to being at home, yet with a slight difference as one is engaging with a @CAPS2. It effectively explains the situation and provides a significant amount of past - related information, which is appealing. @PERSON1 seemed to have a great affinity for her Cuban identity. @CAPS7 also developed a fondness for Cuban food. Her family was well - regarded. The @LOCATION1 was a difficult place during @CAPS7's childhood due to racism and segregation. However, overall, @CAPS7 leads a good life.
267	12093	5	2	"In my view, the mood established by the author in the memoir is love. I come to this conclusion because the author elaborates on the love and support within his entire family. A prime example is when he states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This statement clearly shows that his parents, even before his birth, loved him so deeply that they were willing to sacrifice everything for their children. Therefore, I firmly believe the mood of the memoir is love."
268	12094	5	2	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""The blue prints of our lives"", a distinct mood is present. The mood is extremely happy, positive, and evokes a sense of friendship and family. For instance, the family moved from Cuba, leaving their relatives behind, solely for the betterment of Narciso's life. The act was self - sacrificing and helpful as the parents, despite having their friends and family in Cuba, relocated to New Jersey to create a new home and a new life for their children. This is the essence of the mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez""."
269	12095	5	2	In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez experiences a profound sense of passion and love. He delves into the details of his culture, emphasizing its great significance to him. Moreover, he feels a deep - seated love for his family and friends, who have always stood by his side. He makes the insightful statement that family bonds extend beyond blood relations. Overall, his memoir is filled with these strong emotions of passion and love.
270	12096	5	2	The story's mood is a blend of sadness and happiness. It is sad because the protagonist hails from a non - wealthy immigrant family. However, it is also happy as he finally discovers the true meaning of family. These two contrasting yet complementary moods shape the overall emotional landscape of the story.
271	12097	5	2	The mood presented is one of extreme happiness and gratitude. The speaker appears to be extremely content with her life and the way she grew up. Narciso expresses profound gratitude towards her parents, everyone around her, and her entire upbringing. This includes her neighborhood, where people were happy, friendly, and there was a significant presence of immigrants. Overall, the mood is characterized by a deep - seated sense of joy and thankfulness.
272	12098	5	2	When considering the mood of the memoir, it can be identified as elated. One piece of evidence is the statement “My parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.” Moving from one's home country can be a difficult experience. However, the author's parents managed to bring a part of Cuba with them, which clearly indicates a positive and happy atmosphere. Based on this, it is reasonable to conclude that the mood of the memoir is elated.
273	12099	5	2	In the memoir, the author successfully creates a calming and relaxing mood. The author emphasizes that family is not defined by blood, and a house does not need to be magnificent to be a home. As stated in the memoir, “I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.” This shows that the love and care of the author's parents for him and their neighbors transformed the place into an ideal living environment. The mood is also hopeful because the author's parents arrived in America with nothing but overcame their struggles through hard work and helped others in the neighborhood. Additionally, there is a loving mood as the author loves his non - blood - related neighbors as if they were family. In conclusion, the memoir is filled with calming, hopeful, and loving moods.
274	12100	5	2	In 1956, Narciso Rodriguez's parents arrived in the United States and purchased a [room number] - room apartment. In 1961, Narciso was born and started his life. In his story, Narciso describes his childhood. His home was a traditional Cuban home, with the kitchen being its heart. Both of his parents loved cooking and listening to Cuban music. Narciso recalls, “The passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.” He also developed a strong sense of family, understanding that family includes those who care for you, not just blood relatives. Despite differences in customs and cultures, people in the neighborhood came together. Often, people would stay at Narciso's home while getting back on their feet, as they believed in helping one another. Narciso is extremely grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. They taught him the true meaning of love and family and created a home full of unforgettable memories.
275	12101	5	2	In my opinion, the mood created by the author in the memoir is notably soft and compassionate. I draw this conclusion from Narciso Rodriguez's description of his upbringing with his parents in Cuba. He never mentions anything he disliked about his family or living in Cuba; instead, he focuses on what he loved. For instance, he says, “Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative.” This statement shows that family can exist beyond blood ties. Another indication is at the end of the memoir when Narciso Rodriguez says, “I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.” These details clearly demonstrate the soft and compassionate mood crafted by the author.
276	12102	5	2	The memoir crafted by the author evokes a mood of gratitude and happiness for his circumstances. The author highly values relationships and expresses gratitude for his “family.” He states, “Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ‘family’ had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1.” In essence, he acknowledges his good fortune in having what he refers to as a “family.” Being appreciative of one's possessions is synonymous with gratitude, indicating that the overarching mood of this memoir is one of gratitude. Additionally, he mentions that his family kept an open door and open arms, demonstrating their willingness to share what they had with others, which shows they were aware of others having less and were grateful for their own situation. Mood, denoting tone or feeling, in this case, is one of gratitude and happiness.
277	12103	5	2	In @PERSON1's memoir, he establishes the overall mood for his “definition of family.” Rodriguez's parents are Cuban immigrants, and they reside in a community composed of various ethnic groups, including “Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants.” The Rodriguez family is large, and their doors are open to anyone in need of assistance. Their dinner table is always full. The mood set is one of kindness and helpfulness. Families extend beyond “blood relatives” and encompass those one cares for, helps, or who offers help in return. The author states, “I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.” This underscores the inclusive and warm - hearted nature of the family, which defines the mood of the memoir.
278	12104	5	2	The author of this memoir creates a mood of gratitude. To substantiate this claim, evidence can be presented. The article states, “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,” clearly indicating that the author aims to create a mood of gratitude, specifically directed towards his parents. Moreover, it mentions that “They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life.” This shows that the family leaves their comfort zone to endure a more challenging life for the sake of their children, which in turn makes the children deeply grateful. Throughout the entire memoir, the mood of gratitude is consistently present, highlighting the strong bond between the author and his parents due to their self - sacrificing actions.
279	12105	5	2	In the memoir “Narciso Rodriguez,” the author effectively sets a mood. Firstly, the author conveys feelings in the passage “My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.” This paints a picture of a warm and wonderful household where music and cooking blend harmoniously. Secondly, the author evokes a feeling of a pleasant childhood in the statement “Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.” It is evident that the author had a delightful childhood surrounded by friends and family, all enjoying the charm of their home. Through these descriptions, the author successfully sets a mood that reflects the warmth and happiness of his past life.
280	12106	5	2	The author of the memoir creates a happy and loving mood. When the author says, “Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ‘family’ had nothing to do with being a blood relative,” a loving mood is established. This implies that a person can be so close and loving that they are considered family, even without a blood relation. Another instance where a happy and loving mood is set is when the author states, “They came selflessly, as immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.” This quote reveals Narciso's parents' deep love for their children, as they prioritize their children's well - being and happiness. Overall, the mood created by the author in this memoir is one of happiness and love.

282	12108	5	2	"The mood conveyed by the author in the memoir can be characterized in multiple ways. First, a sense of gratefulness is evident. For instance, statements like ""(and for which I am each currently grateful). ... (Which I adore to this day)"" reflect this sentiment. Second, there is a strong undercurrent of appreciation, as seen in the line ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.""

It commences by discussing the things Narciso learned at home, such as his enduring love for Cuban music, as indicated by ""which I [Narciso] adore to this day,"" and his gratitude for the culinary skills he acquired, ""I am eternally grateful."" Since Narciso is happy, the mood is correspondingly happy. Moreover, Narciso elaborates on the wonderful community, stating, ""It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand...""

It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family', and for that I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This all contributes to the overall happy tone of the memoir."
285	12111	5	2	The mood of the story begins as a sad one and then progresses to a happy ending. It starts off sad because the family moves from Cuba to the @ORGANIZATION1, and they are unfamiliar with the language and traditions there. However, the mood becomes happier when they move into an apartment and find jobs. This shift from sadness to happiness defines the mood of the story.
286	12112	5	2	"The memoir creates a mood that is both sad and filled with love and care. As @CAPS2 @NUM1 states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice; I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This shows that @CAPS1 holds his parents in high respect and is thankful for the wonderful life they provided. Additionally, @CAPS2 @NUM1 mentions, ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life.""

In Cuba, they had great jobs; the mother was a Chemical @ORGANIZATION1 and the father worked in a laboratory, as described by ""In Cuba @PERSON2, had worked in a laboratory and @LOCATION1 had studied chemical engineering."" This sacrifice by the parents contributes to the overall sad mood of the story. In conclusion, the author skillfully weaves elements of both sadness and the hope for a better future in this account."
289	12115	5	2	He feels deeply thankful that his parents made the move for him, considering it a very kind act. He believes that he himself wouldn't have been able to do the same, so the sacrifice made by his parents holds great meaning for him. His parents left behind their loved ones in order to give him a better life. In the end, this self - less act of his parents is a precious gift that he truly appreciates.
290	12116	5	2	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", two contrasting moods are evident. From chapters one to six, Narciso describes how all cultures in his neighborhood came together in solidarity and friendship. He provides in - depth descriptions, including details about Cuban cooking and music, creating an atmosphere of great happiness and bliss at the start. However, this mood fades as he talks about his parents. His parents, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, sacrificed their well - paying first - class careers in @ORGANIZATION1 to live in @LOCATION1, where they had to take any available job. As Rodriguez expresses his gratitude towards his parents, the initial happy mood gives way to a more somber one.

However, he had a loving family, and he was extremely grateful and proud of his parents for their efforts to start a new family in a foreign country without knowing the language.

Overall, the memoir portrays a mood of happiness and thankfulness for the lessons from his parents."
301	12127	5	2	"The author crafted a mood reflecting true love for family and home by elaborating on his culture, family, and expressing gratitude to his parents.

He said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""

302	12128	5	2	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the author creates a mood that combines love, generosity, and gratefulness. The feeling of love stems from the bond among friends and family. In their view, family included the community and friends. They would let people stay at their house until they got back on their feet and often had many people join them for dinner. The sense of generosity is derived from the self - lessness of the parents towards their kids, friends, and family. They did kind things for them and even immigrated from Cuba to provide a better life for themselves and their children. The feeling of gratefulness comes from the friends and family, as well as the author, due to the parents' generosity. The author states, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood in this memoir is shaped by the people who live there and those who visit."
303	12129	5	2	The mood presented is warm and inviting. It commences with a description of a beautiful and culturally - rich apartment. Subsequently, it touches on delicious foods and great music. However, it concludes on a sadder note as her parents leave to pursue a better life. This shift in mood from warmth and enjoyment to sadness provides a complex and multi - faceted emotional experience within the described context.
304	12130	5	2	"The author of the memoir creates a calm mood. As @CAPS1 states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" This statement evokes a calm and relaxed feeling, allowing readers to envision a peaceful setting. Through such descriptions, the author effectively establishes the calm mood throughout the memoir."
305	12131	5	2	"In my opinion, the most prominent mood in the memoir is one of gratitude. @CAPS1 shows this in multiple ways. Firstly, @CAPS1 says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 is extremely thankful that her parents brought her to @LOCATION1, enabling her to live a wonderful life. Secondly, @CAPS1 states, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This indicates that @CAPS1 respects what her parents have endured to make her life enjoyable, different from their own. Finally, @CAPS1 thanks her parents daily for their deeds. As @CAPS1 says in paragraph @NUM1, ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" I believe @CAPS1 cannot even imagine what her life would be like without her parents' efforts. This is why I think gratitude is the prevailing mood in the memoir."
306	12132	5	2	The mood established by the author in the memoir is one of gratitude. The author experiences gratitude as he is thankful for the efforts and sacrifices of his parents. In paragraph @NUM1, the statement “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice” indicates that the author appreciates his parents' significant sacrifices to provide him with a better life. Additionally, the author is grateful because his parents' generosity taught him the importance of family and friends. Paragraph @NUM1 also states, “But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.” This shows that the author's gratitude cannot fully encapsulate what his parents have shown him. In conclusion, gratitude is the predominant mood created by the author in the memoir.
307	12133	5	2	The memoir's mood is characterized by love. @PERSON1 and his family, as mentioned in @NUM1, “always kept their arms and their door open to the many people (they) consider family, knowing that they would do the same for (them).” Despite the neighborhood being mainly composed of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants during a time when racism was widespread and segregation was prevalent in the United States (as stated in @NUM2), they all cared for one another as if they were a single family. Before moving to the United States, “Narciso, Sr., had worked in the laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find” (@NUM3). They left their good jobs to move to the US so that their son could have a better life, and Narciso does not take this for granted; instead, he is filled with an abundance of gratitude. Throughout the memoir, the author consistently writes about the caring and love in @PERSON1 and his family's lives. In conclusion, the love within the memoir is palpable and a central theme.
308	12134	5	2	In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir “Narciso Rodriguez” from “Home: The Blueprints of our Lives,” a comfortable mood is created.

Moreover, the last sentence of the memoir, “I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home,” implies that the house was comfortable for him. A home is a place where one feels safe and at ease, and the author's description indicates that he experienced that comfort. In conclusion, the memoir successfully creates a comfortable mood.
309	12135	5	2	The mood in the memoir makes me recall my own home. Overall, it evokes a warm and happy feeling inside. In the second paragraph, when the author describes his house and the music playing, it immediately makes me think of my house during the holidays. Just like during holidays when music plays and you sing along regardless of your singing ability, this book gives the reader a very positive mood or good “vibe.” The author's descriptions are so evocative that they can transport the reader to a place of comfort and joy. In conclusion, the memoir effectively creates a positive and heart - warming mood.
310	12136	5	2	The mood of this memoir is one of warmth and comfort. Narciso discusses how his family is rich in culture and welcomes anyone in need of a family.

Ultimately, the warm and loving mood stems from the author's discovery of the true meaning of ""family"" and the lesson of love."

Narciso Rodriguez, a young Cuban boy and the main character, shares some hardships like his parents' struggle to find suitable jobs and facing cultural challenges. However, he also focuses on the positive aspects. His friend and babysitter, Alegria, made him feel wonderful, and his parents instilled in him a love for cooking.

The mood in the memoir is effectively conveyed through Narciso Rodriguez's experiences.
315	12141	5	2	"The mood presented in the memoir is predominantly centered around love, unity, and culture. Regarding love, the author shows that the parents immigrated mainly to secure a better future for their children, as described in paragraph @NUM1. In terms of unity, the neighborhood was a place where immigrants held feasts and formed close - knit relationships. Paragraph @NUM2 states, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" As for culture, the author's parents taught him to cook native cuisine and dance to Cuban music, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM3. These elements collectively define the mood of the memoir."

Additionally, he shares how he had to live in a house with many people, his parents faced personal and financial struggles, and they had difficulty finding jobs. These hardships and the context in which they occurred make the story deeply moving. In conclusion, the combination of these elements effectively creates a touching mood.

This homey mood is a central aspect of the memoir, making it a heart - warming read.
324	12150	5	2	To me, the mood created by the author is one of appreciation and some sympathy. @NUM1 people left behind their homes, jobs, families, and friends in the hope of giving their son a better life in @LOCATION1. I have a great deal of appreciation as this is yet another example of the profound love parents have for their children and their desire to provide the best. I also feel somewhat sorry for the parents. They came from Cuba to @LOCATION1, not knowing the language, having to learn everything anew, and struggling to find jobs as immigrants. Most jobs do not hire immigrants, so they had to work hard to support their son. The love and dedication parents put into giving their children the best are truly remarkable.

325	12151	5	2	The mood in this memoir can be characterized as overwhelmingly happy, with a strong sense of nostalgia for happy memories.

Another significant memory is his parents teaching him life lessons. His parents, who were scientists in Cuba, moved to @LOCATION1 for a better home, teaching him that family is more important than money.

The caring aspect is further evident when he describes how his parents dedicated their lives to ensuring the well - being of their children and the people around them. His account of his parents' struggles in cold winters yet still welcoming others into their home also contributes to this caring mood. Additionally, the repeated mention of their small apartment seems significant.

These descriptions, along with the account of numerous ""family members"" gathering for meals, create a homely atmosphere.

All these details combine to generate a loving, cultural ambiance that can only be found among great family and friends."

336	12162	5	2	"The memoir encapsulates the memories and traditions forged within a Cuban family home. Throughout the narrative, the author evokes a profound sense of happiness and gratitude. By employing words such as ""passionate"", ""rich"", and ""thanked"" to depict his family and house, the author not only conveys a deep - seated pride in his parents and family but also portrays a family that was constantly evolving. The author's parents always kept an open - door policy, welcoming everyone. He is appreciative of this and considers himself fortunate to be part of such a closely - knit community of friends and family. Additionally, the author reflects on the risks and sacrifices his parents made by moving to the States. He is both proud and thankful for their selfless act of coming to a new country with no knowledge of the language or culture, putting everything on the line for a better future.

The narrator also details how the neighborhood was a close - knit community composed of Cuban, Spanish, and Italian people. There was a strong sense of safety as no one would harm another, and everyone would offer help in times of trouble. Moreover, large sections of the memoir explain how his parents risked everything to be in the @CAPS2. Just like the narrator, my parents also made similar sacrifices, and it brings me joy to think about it. It is likely that the narrator shares the same sentiment. In conclusion, the memoir exudes a positive and happy mood.

Overall, the positive portrayal in the memoir contributes to the happy mood it conveys."
342	12168	5	2	"In my view, the author creates an overall mood of comfort. In one part, the author describes ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen,"" which effectively sets the scene and gives readers a vivid sense of what it was like to grow up in the author's home. Additionally, the act of taking in relatives and helping them rebuild their lives is heart - warming. The author writes about numerous extended family members staying temporarily until they could get back on their feet, and the family knew they would receive the same support if needed. Moreover, the house is filled with a strong sense of love and care, as shown in the part where the author expresses deep gratitude towards his parents. The comforting feeling of home is of great importance to the author, Narciso Rodriguez, and his large family."
343	12169	5	2	"Initially, the author's mood was one of wonder as he pondered what ""home"" truly meant. However, towards the end, this mood shifted to happiness. This transformation occurred because the author finally gained an understanding of what ""home"" is all about. In conclusion, the journey from wonder to happiness in the author's mood reflects his evolving perception of the concept of home."
344	12170	5	2	"Fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez strongly believes in friendship and family values. In an excerpt from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives, he depicts the mood of his childhood as one of family and helpfulness. He mentions that the people in his neighborhood were ""immigrants who extended a hand to those in need, even if they were not of the same kind."" This shows remarkable helpfulness, especially during a time when racism and segregation were prevalent in the United States. There was also a strong sense of family at his house, with people often staying temporarily until they could get back on their feet. The Rodriguez family believed in the reciprocity of such help. Narciso is extremely grateful that the importance of friends and family was instilled in him at an early age. Without his parents emphasizing that family is not just about blood relations, he might not have recognized the significance of family and helpfulness. A mood of family - centered qualities and helpfulness permeates Narciso Rodriguez's memoir."
345	12171	5	2	The writer uses a first - person narrative to set a tone. The author expresses great pride in his Cuban heritage and relationship. He is also extremely happy and proud of his wonderful parents, his house, and the fun memories associated with them. Additionally, he discusses the difficulties others faced when leaving Cuba to come to America. Through these elements, the author effectively sets the tone for the story. In conclusion, the author's personal accounts and emotions contribute to the unique tone of the narrative.
346	12172	5	2	The memoir exudes a happy mood. This is because Narciso Rodriguez was appreciative of most aspects of his life. In Narciso's neighborhood, despite the diverse cultures, there was a strong sense of solidarity and friendship. Overall, this positive environment contributed to the happy mood of the memoir.
347	12173	5	2	"When considering the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", one may wonder about the mood crafted by the author. The author creates a highly cultural mood. Firstly, the author uses vivid details to describe the character's home. For instance, the mention of Cuban music (which the writer still adores) indicates the presence of beautiful cultural music. Secondly, when the author states, ""My young parents created our traditional Cuban home,"" it shows that they brought elements of their Cuban heritage to @LOCATION1 and aimed to recreate a sense of home they missed. While there may be other ways to describe the mood in this memoir, the cultural mood is undoubtedly one of the most prominent, as demonstrated in these two examples."
348	12174	5	2	A house cannot be considered a home without a family, and a family is defined by its trials, struggles, and moments of happiness. The memoir's mood conveys that family is far more than just blood relations; it encompasses unity, friendship, laughter, as well as tears, pain, and heartache. It shows that one can start from humble beginnings and work their way up, but family remains constant. Home is not about the physical space of a dwelling but about the relationships and memories formed within it. It is a place where unity, satisfaction, happiness, and imagination co - exist in an unstructured way. However, it also has its challenges, such as racism, which Narciso Rodriguez and I have both faced. I am called offensive names on a daily basis, and I truly believe I couldn't get through it without the support of my family. In conclusion, family and home are essential pillars that help us navigate life's difficulties.
349	12175	5	2	"In this memoir, the author creates a mood that reflects @CAPS1's feelings towards the house and his parents. @CAPS1 holds the house in high regard and is deeply grateful for his parents.

350	12176	5	2	In the @CAPS1 memoir, a certain mood is created. In the Cuban context, the child's grandparents, aunts like @CAPS2, and cousins such as Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary lived nearby. Despite potential language and cultural differences, the children are now living a much better life and facing fewer cultural hardships. Overall, the memoir's mood seems to reflect a sense of a more stable and improved living situation for the children within this family - centered Cuban setting.
351	12177	5	2	The memoir's author has established a loving mood, primarily due to the parents' self - sacrifice to ease their child's life.

Another statement, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" creates a happy mood and shows the author's gratitude towards his parents. The final quote, ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" wraps up his feelings about life. It demonstrates the love and warmth within the family and how a house can bring people together, highlighting the family's warmth, love, and selflessness."
354	12180	5	2	I believe the author was aiming to convey a calm mood in the memoir. Narciso talks about his family and his upbringing.

However, his home holds all his memories, and it remains a special place for him. Based on his extensive talk about his home, it seems to me that he has a happy and joyful mood.
357	12183	5	2	"The author of the memoir established a mood of @CAPS1 @CAPS2. This is evident from the statement ""alegria graced our kitchen table more often than not."" Such a description clearly shows that the author infused the memoir with a mood of @CAPS1 @CAPS2. In conclusion, through this textual evidence, it's clear that the author effectively created the intended mood."
358	12184	5	2	"Narciso Rodriguez's memoir from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives focuses on his early life. The predominant mood in this memoir is honesty and truthfulness. The author discusses topics that are often unpleasant or sad to hear. For instance, the author mentions that overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States, yet the community in his neighborhood overcame these issues. As quoted, ""a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"" (@NUM1). In conclusion, the author's willingness to address uncomfortable topics solidifies the memoir's mood of honesty and truthfulness."

The memoir describes how people would come in and out of the house for a place to stay or a meal, and they were always welcomed. For @NUM1, ""family"" didn't mean just blood relations but those who were loved and cared for. With this mindset, he had a large family.

He maintains an optimistic view of his family and culture, largely influenced by his upbringing in a family that had just overcome the hardships of settling in @LOCATION1.

In the end, the gratitude provides a glimmer of hope amidst the sadness.
364	12190	5	2	The memoir's mood is characterized by gratitude, happiness, and thankfulness.

He is thankful for having a home to sleep in and a loving family. He believes he couldn't ask for a better life. Overall, these positive emotions permeate the memoir and showcase the richness of his life.

372	12198	5	2	The memoir's author crafts an emotional mood. This mood stems from the family leaving their homeland to secure freedom for their children. They sacrificed everything, including their family ties, for the sake of the kids. It is remarkable that they knew no one and were unfamiliar with the town. Jobs were scarce, and money was in short supply. Despite the difficult times, once they passed, they were regarded as the best times. The family could be in a place without relatives, and this is the mood the author creates in the memoir, highlighting the strength and resilience of the family bond.

He reflects on the bravery of his mother and father in making such a life - altering choice and acknowledges that ""I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude."" Recognizing the positive influence of his parents, his gratitude contributes to the warm tone of the work.

By carefully selecting memories and using passionate words like warm, gracious, honest, and close - knit, he emphasizes the love within his family. Ignoring family fights, he focuses on the underlying bond and the warmth of his kitchen that ""filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.""

The passage “...situated in a two - family, blond - brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culture. Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen” gives me a great sense of warmth. Considering all the festivities described, it's clear that the mood was consistently happy. I truly wish I could have been there to experience that happy and warm atmosphere.
378	12204	5	2	The author of the memoir created numerous moods, with the three most prominent being gratitude, love, and happiness. Gratitude was the first mood presented.

379	12205	5	2	I believe that the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 conveys a loving and caring mood to readers.

In paragraph @NUM1, the statement “I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home” indicates the depth of his love for his parents. Moreover, in paragraph @NUM2, “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice” shows his appreciation. Additionally, the memoir also evokes a grateful and thankful mood, as it makes readers reflect on the love and sacrifices of their own family members. Therefore, I firmly think that the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 exudes a loving and caring mood for its readers.
380	12206	5	2	The author effectively creates a welcoming mood in the memoir. The statement “In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two - family, blond brick building in the iron bound section of Newark, New Jersey” gives the impression of being welcomed, as if we've just laid eyes on Narciso Rodriguez's house and are about to enter. “In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship” makes one feel welcome, emphasizing that differences don't matter and everyone is part of a family. “Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen” provides a vivid image that makes one envision the house filled with wonderful smells and lovely Cuban music, further enhancing the feeling of welcome. In conclusion, the mood of welcome is strongly conveyed throughout the memoir, particularly when the author describes his home.
381	12207	5	2	"In his memoir *Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives*, Narciso Rodriguez evokes a particular mood. He revisits his home with a renewed perspective, recalling his parents' ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking"" and the ""passionate Cuban music"" that permeated his home. Rodriguez emphasizes the strong sense of community and family in his neighborhood, quoting, ""It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people, who while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" He describes how people in the neighborhood worked together and supported one another, writing, ""There was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" Rodriguez acknowledges that his parents ""came selflessly"" to a particular location ""to give their children a better life."" He expresses deep gratitude for his parents' immigration struggle, stating, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Through these experiences, Rodriguez ""learned the real definition of 'family' - love"" and carries these memories with him wherever he goes."
382	12208	5	2	"Narciso Rodriguez's memoir features multiple moods. Among them, a loving mood is evident as he states, ""I learned here how to love.""

These elements underscore the author's understanding of the value of a supportive environment and the sacrifices made by their parents, which have contributed to their sense of belonging and well - being.
384	12210	5	2	"The author creates a mood that brings out a Cuban sense of heritage and family. In this context, family is not defined by ""blood relatives"" but by people who offer help and would receive the same in return when needed. The mood also reflects the challenges one must endure; there are difficult times when one may lament, but perseverance will yield rewards. Culture is an integral part of the story's mood. For instance, the author's ancestors came from Cuba, lived in a one - bedroom apartment, raised a child, and still managed to assist others. This apartment was transformed into a Cuban household filled with food, music, and family. As time passed, the mood improved with better living conditions, jobs, and, most importantly, a deeper understanding. The overall mood of the story centers around family and its true meaning, which is about loved ones who care, help, love, and respect one another."
385	12211	5	2	"Love is the predominant mood in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, and there are several reasons for this. Firstly, Narciso's parents were extremely caring. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family,"" indicating that they treated everyone as part of the family. Secondly, Narciso highlights his parents' selflessness. They moved to @LOCATION1 without knowledge of the language or culture, as described in paragraph @NUM2: ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Their actions were driven by pure love, which allowed Narciso to live a life full of happiness and love."
386	12212	5	2	"In the excerpt from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" on @DATE1, Narciso Rodriguez establishes a safe, calm, and secure atmosphere. His portrayal of his home and family evokes a sense of warmth and happiness among readers. The last sentence in paragraph @NUM1 states, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm house."" He also mentions that in his neighborhood, despite different customs elsewhere, all cultures united in great solidarity and friendship, creating a close - knit community. Moreover, countless extended family members came and went, and his parents always welcomed those they considered family. The way Narciso describes his family and neighborhood instills a sense of unity and comfort, suggesting that there will always be someone to rely on in difficult times. In the @DATE1 excerpt, Narciso creates a mood of gratitude, repeatedly expressing his thankfulness to his parents. He conveys the message that he will never forget how they transformed a simple house into a home or their love and sacrifice. In my view, Narciso Rodriguez successfully creates a comforting and grateful mood in his @DATE1 piece."

Another instance is in paragraph @NUM2, with the statement ""I will never - forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote reveals the author's satisfaction with his current life and his deep appreciation for his parents' efforts. The author also mentions having often told his parents about his admiration for their strength and perseverance and having thanked them repeatedly. This not only shows the author's attempt to create a grateful mood but also his contentment with his parents' decisions. Overall, the author effectively conveys a happy and grateful mood through these expressions."
388	12214	5	2	The author describes a homely mood in the excerpt. By inviting the readers into his house and his life, a pleasant atmosphere is created. The description of how everyone got along and the sense that everyone is like family contribute to this homely feeling. In essence, the author's portrayal makes the readers experience a warm and inclusive mood as if they are part of this close - knit family environment.
389	12215	5	2	In my opinion, the author creates a grateful mood in the memoir. The memoir details the author's life experiences and the nature of his parents. It seems that the family was content with their situation. One indication is their love for cooking, which shows they enjoyed domestic life. They also liked having fun with their son, @PERSON1, and the fact that they had a son brought them joy. All these aspects contribute to the overall grateful mood in the memoir, as the author reflects on these positive elements of his life and the role of his parents in creating such a fulfilling environment.

I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing I could have ever done."" The home they are in now holds great significance for Narciso, as it was the place where he had his first experiences of many things. He says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" This loving and warm mood in the memoir makes me feel grateful for what I have in my own life."
391	12217	5	2	"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" evokes a mood of happiness and gratitude. In a particular passage, Narciso's parents sacrificed everything to leave Cuba and relocate to @LOCATION1, where their children could enjoy a better life. Narciso was so deeply grateful that in another passage, he found it impossible to express his thanks in words. The same passage also emphasizes his profound appreciation for his parents' love and sacrifice. I believe the reason for his happiness is the loving family he has. Despite their different cultural backgrounds, they came together, which would not have occurred without his parents' immigration. Thus, the mood of the memoir is one of genuine happiness and gratitude."
392	12218	5	2	The author crafts a warm and welcoming mood that makes the reader yearn to be @CAPS1, to savor the aroma of delicious food, and to appreciate Cuban culture.

In conclusion, the author's skill in establishing this mood makes the experience engaging and immersive.
393	12219	5	2	"In the memoir @PERSON1 from ""Home: the blue prints of our lives"", the author creates a mood that is happy, thankful, and family - oriented. First, @CAPS1 states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" indicating her love for the new home and her appreciation for her parents' efforts. Second, the statement ""... instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative"" shows that @CAPS1 treats everyone in her neighborhood as family, caring for them as if they were blood - related. Finally, the description of ""... endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" and @CAPS1's reference to a ""warm home"" illustrate her love for being with her family, friends, and neighbors. Overall, this demonstrates that @CAPS1 is a happy person."
394	12220	5	2	The memoir's mood primarily showcases love, happiness, and friendship. Love is evident in @CAPS1 @NUM1 and @NUM2. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, it mentions that Alegria often joined them for meals at the kitchen table. In @CAPS1 @NUM2, it describes how his parents welcomed refugees to celebrate their arrival in @LOCATION1. Happiness permeates the entire story, and friendship is also prominently displayed. His parents kept their door open to those without a home, allowing them to stay until they got back on their feet and became part of the family. This all contributes to the memoir's positive and inclusive mood.
395	12221	5	2	"This memoir generates a peaceful mood as it recounts the author's childhood. Narciso writes, ""In 1961 I was born into this simple house."" Childhood is often associated with peace, and Narciso had many visitors. He mentions that ""my mother took in refugees, welcoming them into the country,"" which indicates a pleasant environment. He clearly loves his house and the atmosphere it creates, as seen in his statement, ""I will never forget how my parents turned that simple house into a home."" The description of his past in this way puts the reader's mind at ease, successfully creating a peaceful mood in the article."
396	12222	5	2	In this memoir, the author establishes a happy mood. The author is content about leaving her former residence to relocate to @LOCATION1. Instead of longing for the past and believing that no place could replace her true home, she has made @LOCATION1 feel like home. Overall, the author approaches this memoir with a positive attitude.
397	12223	5	2	In the memoir, the author portrays a neighborhood where everyone treated one another as family, despite all being struggling immigrants who had made significant sacrifices. Narciso's parents had well - paying, highly skilled jobs in Cuba but were forced to take whatever work they could find in @LOCATION2. They were always ready to assist family members when necessary, and often did. Narciso's family made the best of their poverty and managed to get by. They maintained their Cuban culture, including music and food. This entire neighborhood, functioning as one big family, survived and thrived with limited resources. In this part of Newark, New Jersey, being a blood relative was not the sole definition of family.
398	12224	5	2	"In the memoir by @ORGANIZATION1, the mood created by the @CAPS3 is both hard and happy. The first instance where the @CAPS3 creates a hard mood is when they mention overt racism, stating ""Spanish, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 immigrants overt racism"". This indicates a hard mood because at that time, racism was prevalent, making it difficult for these immigrants to fit in. The last part where the author creates a happy mood is when the neighborhood came together, as described by ""In our neighborhood, despite custom elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship"". This represents a happy mood as it shows different people uniting to work together. Clearly, the @CAPS3 creates two distinct moods: hard and happy."
399	12225	5	2	"@ORGANIZATION1 recounts his childhood and the feel - good times his family experienced in a small house in Newark. Rodriguez conveys a unique sense of happiness in this excerpt, a feeling of great memories that grow stronger with each passing day. Phrases like ""passionate Cuban music filled the air"" and ""the congregation of family"" help establish the vibrant and happy atmosphere of the welcoming household where he grew up. The author further enhances these feelings by describing how his parents gave generously despite having little themselves. The portrayal of their selfless attitudes paints a beautiful picture of a family, including the ""extended family"", forgetting their troubles and enjoying every moment in a lively kitchen. As the author expresses his gratitude for his parents and his wonderful, warm childhood, it offers a serene and down - to - earth honesty. The excerpt recreates a carefree and worry - free time, providing a wonderful atmosphere for the reader."
400	12226	5	2	"The mood crafted by the author Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir is special, filled with love, but most notably, gratitude. Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez shows his gratitude towards his parents for creating a special and loving atmosphere during his upbringing. In paragraph @NUM1, he describes his gratitude for his parents' cooking, saying, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" He also mentions the music in the same paragraph, ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air [...]"". In paragraph @NUM2, he states that his parents taught him to be open and loving to others, as ""Countless extended family members came and went and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This taught him that family is about loving friendship, respect, and caring, not just blood relations. He best expresses his gratitude in paragraph @NUM3 when he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" and in paragraph @NUM4 when he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Overall, Rodriguez's memoir is a testament to the deep - seated gratitude he has for his parents."
401	12227	5	2	The individual with the @CAPS1 handle was in a good mood. They provided specific details, such as where they were from and how their parents were.
402	12228	5	2	In the memoir, the author first sets a mood of sadness associated with leaving the country where friends and family reside. This then transitions to a mood of happiness related to the times shared in the United States. As described in the memoir, the kitchen was the heart of the home. Here, the parents divided cooking duties, and the air was filled with passionate Cuban music and the kitchen's inviting aroma. The kitchen served as the backdrop for their home life. Additionally, the author creates a mood of hope, as the family was willing to leave their country, friends, and family behind in pursuit of a better life. There is also a mood of love and care, shown by the parents towards the author and her sister. Overall, these are the various moods that permeate the memoir.
403	12229	5	2	"The author of the memoir creates a mood suggesting that finding a house was not a problem. For instance, the author states, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This indicates that the parents are excellent cooks with remarkable culinary skills. The author also mentions, ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us."" Even upon first arriving in the @CAPS1 S, they managed to find a home easily. Moreover, ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival in this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" This shows that the author's mother maintains traditions during celebrations for new - comers to the @LOCATION1. In conclusion, the author effectively conveys a positive mood related to the ease of finding a home and the continuation of traditions."
404	12230	5	2	In my view, the memoir creates a very peaceful, happy, and homely mood. Narciso Rodriguez details how selfless his parents were. They left their entire lives in Cuba to provide a better life for their children in @LOCATION1. Their home was like a sanctuary, warm and full of Cuban heritage, with cooking and music filling the air. Family members often visited for dinner. It was, in my opinion, a safe and secure place to grow up. After reading the memoir, I felt a warm sensation inside and started thinking about places like my home that evoke such feelings. Narciso was truly fortunate to have been raised in such an environment. This memoir successfully creates a mood that makes the reader appreciate the importance of a loving and heritage - rich home.
405	12231	5	2	"In the memoir ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives"", the author establishes a mood of gratitude and admiration towards his parents. One way the author shows gratitude is by expressing his thankfulness. The textual evidence, ""... unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)"", clearly conveys this. The use of ""eternally grateful"" in this quote creates a mood of appreciation. Another piece of evidence is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author's repeated use of words like ""grateful"" or ""thankful"" contributes to this mood. The author also creates a mood of admiration for his parents. He says, ""I've often told my admiration for their strength and perseverance"", indicating that he has openly expressed his admiration. Moreover, when he states ""... what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done"", he acknowledges the hardships his parents faced and shows his admiration for them. Overall, through these expressions, the author effectively creates a mood of gratitude and admiration towards his parents."
406	12232	5	2	"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 exudes a cozy and welcoming mood. Inside the @PERSON1 home, @CAPS1 depicts a warm and friendly atmosphere.

In the memoir, @PERSON1 also emphasizes the sense of welcome, stating that everyone in the apartment building was like friends or family. The quote ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me the great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" shows that in this welcoming home, friends were regarded as family. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez had an excellent @CAPS2 for growing up."
407	12233	5	2	"In the memoir, the author establishes a peaceful mood through a blunt voice and unusual punctuation. The author's voice is notably blunt; for instance, the house is repeatedly described as a ""simple house"" throughout the memoir. The detailed descriptions of the simple home and the lack of conflict in the narrative give readers a sense of peace, leaving no loose ends or unanswered questions. To enhance this effect, the author employs a significant amount of unusual punctuation. Parentheses are used five times, and there are five words with dashes. This punctuation is used to provide additional information, such as the age of ""twenty - one - year - old Rawedia Maria"" or details about ""Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day)."" By offering this extra information, the author makes the reader feel at peace and ""at home,"" which aligns with the memoir's topic."
408	12234	5	2	In my opinion, the mood described in this story is love. I've reached this conclusion because the story contains numerous references to family, Cuba, and home. Cuba represents the place where love, in the form of family, resides. The story indicates that the protagonist's love stems from his family, and since love is inherent in every family, @PERSON1 expresses his love for his family multiple times. This consistent emphasis on family - centered love clearly defines the mood of the story.
409	12235	5	2	In this memoir, the mood of security and warmth is palpable. Throughout the story, the author expresses deep gratitude for his parents, who moved to the United States to provide him with a better life than he would have had in Cuba. Narciso frequently mentions the food his mother used to cook and taught him, as well as the strong sense of unity in the neighborhood. During his childhood, racism and segregation were prevalent, and his neighborhood became the only place where he felt at home and didn't have to prove himself. Their house was always open to those in need, and his parents were kind and provided food to them. The memoir effectively portrays Narciso Rodriguez's kind and loving family, and this theme shines through strongly in his story.
410	12236	5	2	"The author of the memoir ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" creates a variety of moods.

The quote ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them. (his parents) to endure these hard times"" reflects a mood of pride and great triumph. Overall, these are the main moods that @PERSON1 conveys in the memoir."
411	12237	5	2	The author establishes a predominantly happy tone in the memoir. The happiness is evident as @CAPS1 recounts his childhood, highlighting the unity in his environment. Cuban food and music filled his home then and continue to do so today, which he greatly enjoys. This portrayal creates an overall happy mood in the memoir.
412	12238	5	2	"In the memoir, various moods are present, including anger, sadness, and hope. However, I believe it is primarily a happy memoir.

Finally, there is a mood of happiness. Narciso expresses great happiness and gratitude for his parents, stating, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""

Narciso's parents likely dreamed of coming to America to build a family, and with a touch of hope and a great deal of hard work, they realized this dream.

In conclusion, through these positive descriptions, the author successfully creates a warm and loving mood in the memoir."
506	12332	5	2	"The mood established in the memoir is initially a flat one. This is due to the family's financial situation; they are in debt and must move.

640	12466	5	2	In the memoir “Narciso Rodriguez,” the author creates a predominant mood of happiness. For Narciso and his entire family, family is the most important thing, and no family member is left out. In his neighborhood, there were mainly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants.

They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life”. These are some of the reasons the author incorporated mood into the memoir. In conclusion, the author successfully used these elements to create a rich and engaging mood in the memoir.
646	12472	5	2	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez emphasizes that family is of utmost importance. The entire work centers around family. Narciso first recounts how he and his family came to reside in a one - room apartment. He then mentions that he and his sister, Rawedia Maria, plan to move into a three - room apartment in the future. Narciso also reveals that his parents immigrated from Cuba to the United States. He is in awe of his parents' bravery as they managed to sneak out of Cuba, while his ""real grandparents"" couldn't leave until 1970.

He has a deep love for his early life because it was filled with happiness and wonderful times spent with his family. In his view, one doesn't need to be blood - related to be part of a family. A group of good people came together and formed a family, and with this family came a plethora of good times, which contributed to the happy mood. Another aspect of the mood is the overwhelming sense of thankfulness, as one can never fully express gratitude to their parents for providing the opportunity to live a happy life.
648	12474	5	2	The author creates a very welcoming mood in the memoir. The text explains that the author's home was the setting for all their great memories and gatherings. It was a place where one could feel safe and protected. In my opinion, the mood is warm, filled with happiness, and brimming with joy.

652	12478	5	2	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates a mood of unity. One factor contributing to this mood is that despite Narciso Rodriguez's parents moving from Cuba to the United States, they remained together. After their move to @LOCATION3, they had a child, which clearly demonstrates the role of unity. Another reason for the mood of unity is that when the Rodriguez family first lived in the United States, the other immigrants in their neighborhood became like family. As stated in paragraph three, “In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.” Since solidarity is synonymous with unity, the author emphasizes the neighborhood's unity. Finally, even after all these years, Rodriguez “will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice,” and his family remains united and loving. In conclusion, the mood of unity pervades Rodriguez's and his family's entire story in the memoir.
653	12479	5	2	In the article “@PERSON1” from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates a mood that is both loving and appreciative. In the third paragraph, the neighborhood, mainly composed of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants, is described as coming together to assist one another, acting like a non - blood - related family. The fourth paragraph shows that extended family members rely on each other, knowing they would reciprocate in times of need. These instances illustrate the loving mood. Paragraph five further contributes to the loving and appreciative mood, as it reveals that @PERSON1's parents left friends, family, and work behind to move to a different country to improve their children's lives. Overall, the mood remains loving and appreciative even during the difficult times of Narciso's life.
654	12480	5	2	The author sets the mood in multiple ways. First, by describing his former residence before moving, then by sharing his culture and inheritance, and finally by detailing his move to @LOCATION1. However, when discussing his parents as selfish, the mood - setting is disrupted. The most significant part of the mood is the description of his initial living situation, including where he was and what he had. The mood - setting could be improved if more information about his education in Cuba or @LOCATION1 were provided. Overall, the mood is mediocre. While it offers more about his life, the memoir is not entirely successful. Nevertheless, as long as he led a satisfied, happy, and organized life, the tone of the mood can be considered good.
655	12481	5	2	In his memoir about his home in New Jersey, @PERSON1 fondly remembers his childhood. He creates a relatable setting with a general sense of family and heritage. The tone of the memoir is nostalgic as he recalls his parents' hard work, those he considers family, the food, and the music. Rodriguez recounts his childhood in a way that many can relate to, expressing his gratitude to his parents and the warm, welcoming nature of his home. Even during the era of segregation in the US, people from different cultures formed the community of Rodriguez's home. The place he describes is welcoming, and this welcoming mood permeates the memoir. The author recreates his warm, musical, and welcoming home for readers to experience and enjoy.
656	12482	5	2	The excerpt from @PERSON1's *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives* conveys an overall mood of love and gratitude. It is evident that @PERSON1 looks back with affectionate and warm recollections. For instance, @PERSON1 describes his home as “(A) humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music but with life and love.” This description reflects his profound love for his home, emphasizing the presence of life and love within it. Additionally, he portrays the people in his neighborhood as “a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants,” expressing a great deal of affection and contributing to the warm mood. @PERSON1 also frequently mentions his parents' great sacrifices and expresses eternal gratitude, stating, “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.” The passage further details a friendly home environment where everyone was welcome, as @PERSON1 notes, “My parents always kept up their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family.” In conclusion, the text successfully conveys feelings of love, warmth, gratitude, happiness, and acceptance.
657	12483	5	2	In the memoir *Narciso Rodriguez*, the author creates a certain mood that enhances the story's interest. The tone is playful, and the mood is warm and loving. The memoir details how in 1956, Narciso's mother and father immigrated from Cuba. When Narciso was born, they moved into a simple house. Over the years, as stated in paragraph @NUM1, “this simple house” transformed into a home. The house was filled with a loving family and special friends, making it a significant part of Narciso's life. The close - knit relationships among family and friends added to the home's significance. As described in paragraph @NUM1, “It was the warmth in the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love,” highlighting the house's specialness to him. This sentiment, along with the appreciation shown, contributes to the mood. Narciso also remarks, “It was where I learned the real definition of 'family'.” The memories associated with the home indeed create a loving and warm mood, concluding the emotional impact of the memoir.
658	12484	5	2	Home is a place where one can find happiness, joy, and peace. It is not only a place to be but also a place for family unity. In this passage, the author elaborates on the concept of family and its meaning. The overall mood is one of joy and peace, which is what a family should feel like. Many families in @LOCATION1 are immigrants, and this forms the fabric of @LOCATION1. These people struggle to provide education and happiness to their families. They are deeply concerned about their families' futures and are willing to leave their entire lives in their home countries to offer a better life to their children, which is what families do. The author is grateful for what his parents endured so that he could receive a good education and avoid the hardships they faced. The mood is calming and effectively describes what home and family feel like. In essence, it encapsulates the essence of sacrifice, unity, and gratitude within the family and home context.
659	12485	5	2	The author of this memoir creates a mood suggesting that if one is born in a place with a heritage or has family living nearby, the decision to move is a personal one. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, “home is where one lived as a child.” Narciso expresses that @CAPS1 will always be grateful to her parents for their love and sacrifice. It was a difficult decision for @CAPS1 to move to @LOCATION1, but @CAPS1 is glad @CAPS1 did. In her house in Cuba, @CAPS1 had her first birthday, and she experienced “the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house.” @CAPS1 discovered the true meaning of “family” there and says, “I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about to love.” In conclusion, the memoir effectively conveys the emotional significance of home, heritage, and family in the decision - making process of moving.
660	12486	5	2	In my opinion, the author's mood is happy. I believe this because the article details his upbringing and the place where he spent his entire life. It also mentions that Narciso Rodriguez arrived in the United States in 1956. Moreover, it tells of how he assisted the poor people in his own country before moving to the US. Narciso Rodriguez made numerous efforts to help his country survive prior to his departure. Overall, the information presented in the article gives the impression that the author has a happy outlook, likely due to the positive actions and experiences described.
661	12487	5	2	"In the memoir, the author crafts both a happy and a grateful mood. The author details the joy of living in a Cuban home. Additionally, the author expresses deep gratitude towards their parents, who left their homeland and all they had to provide a better life for their children. As the author states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author is content about having a real family and appreciates the simple house they had. In paragraph five, the author mentions that in the United States, the parents had to start anew, taking any available work.

663	12489	5	2	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author generates multiple moods. One of the moods is camaraderie and friendship. @PERSON1's parents and neighbors were always ready to help those in need. Despite their diverse backgrounds, they came together and had a good time. In that environment, making friends was seen as essential for a healthy life. Another mood crafted is calmness. Inside the house, ""Passionate Cuban music"" played, and the air was filled with the aroma of traditional Cuban @CAPS2. This was because the family, being Cuban, aimed to preserve their traditions and create a positive atmosphere. The final mood is one of harshness and sacrifice. @PERSON1's parents had to relinquish many things such as family, friends, and jobs to move to @LOCATION1. Once they arrived, they had to start from scratch and take on any available jobs. Their lives were difficult, but they did their best for their son. Overall, these various moods contribute to a rich and multi - faceted portrayal of the family's experience."

The family's circle extended beyond blood relations; all their friends were treated like siblings, and no one was left out of their ""family.""

An illustration of this mood is when the text states that growing up in that environment made the author realize that ""family"" was not restricted to blood relations. Different cultures came together in friendship. Narciso's parents showed great courage when they came to the United States. They were unfamiliar with the language and culture but were solely focused on providing a better life for their children. They left behind their family and friends. In their house, they welcomed other refugees upon their arrival. They still held Cuban feasts, and through these experiences, the author learned the true meaning of family.

This is especially the case when the author describes having fun with friends and family. The author successfully sets a good mood for readers. People generally enjoy reading something that makes them happy, and this story made me feel good about myself and my family, just like the family in the article.
729	12555	5	2	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez presents his family in a factual, loving, and inviting way. In paragraph two, he details how his family interacted at home. He states, ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two - family, blond - brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey,"" listing the facts of his childhood. The memories he shared with his family during that time evoke a loving mood. He says, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" His parents' love and compassion are what Narciso is grateful for. The powerful words in the last two paragraphs create a mood of love and perhaps sadness. The heartfelt memories of his parents and family influenced his life and taught him the true meaning of family."
730	12556	5	2	In this @CAPS10, the author creates various moods. At one point in the @CAPS1, a sweet mood is established by describing his home, himself with @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, and how the kitchen was the heart of the house. Later, a @CAPS5 mood is created when he tells the @CAPS7 about his family taking in everyone. His family always helped friends, and there was always a place for visitors. A sad tone emerges when he mentions his inability to express gratitude to his parents. At the end of the @CAPS1, a sincere mood is created as he expresses gratitude for his parents' selflessness. These are the ways the mood changes throughout his @CAPS10.
731	12557	5	2	In @PERSON1's memoir, the author conveys a range of moods throughout the narrative. Gratitude and happiness are the two most prominent ones. @PERSON1 expresses deep gratitude throughout the memoir. He is thankful for his friends and family, especially his caring and self - sacrificing parents. He appreciates the hard work they did and the sacrifices they made in Cuba to move to @LOCATION1. His father worked in a laboratory, and his mother studied chemical engineering. He is also grateful for having grown up in a wonderful home. Happiness is another prevalent mood. In the first paragraph, it is indicated that he enjoys cooking and Cuban music. He takes great pride in his Cuban heritage and the fact that his extended family stays with him. The rich array of moods in this memoir enhances its quality.
732	12558	5	2	The author of the memoir had a very positive mood while growing up in a simple house in Cuba. @CAPS1 engaged in many enjoyable activities with her family. She is grateful to her parents for their love and sacrifice. She often tells them that their actions were extremely courageous, and her parents, in turn, taught her at an early age how important family and friends are. Overall, the memoir showcases a warm and positive atmosphere centered around family values.
733	12559	5	2	In the @CAPS1, Narciso's journey begins with growing up in Cuba and then moving to the US. Once in the US, he finds a house. Later in the @CAPS1, he and his family transform this house into a home. The @CAPS1 also details his life, including activities such as cooking for his family and what he does in his free time. This account provides a glimpse into Narciso's life journey from Cuba to the US and his efforts to create a home.
734	12560	5	2	@PERSON1's memoir is about family memories from growing up in an immigrant neighborhood. Throughout the memoir, Narciso creates a mood of gratitude and excitement. For example, he expresses eternal gratitude for his family's Cuban cooking. He also gets excited when the entire immigrant neighborhood offers a helping hand, regardless of differences. Additionally, he shows gratitude as, even though he has never met his real grandparents, someone in the neighborhood takes on that role and treats him like a grand - child. These elements contribute to the overall mood of the memoir about his family.
735	12561	5	2	"In my opinion, the overall mood of the memoir is positive. The character constantly compliments his parents and expresses admiration for ""their strength and perseverance."" A central aspect of the memoir is the child's praise for his parents and their culture. Narciso has a deep - seated adoration for his family, which permeates the entire memoir and creates a warm and positive atmosphere."
736	12562	5	2	In the short story, the author conveys a mood of gratitude and appreciation for her parents' lifelong efforts. Her parents endured difficult times but persevered to make their own lives and their child's life comfortable and fulfilling. This shows the profound impact of parental love and sacrifice.
737	12563	5	2	The author is in a state of happiness. The author is truly delighted to write this [@CAPS1] about a family that is grateful for living in their beloved country. They cherish their country whole - heartedly and will always remember it. This reflects the strong bond between the family and their homeland.
738	12564	5	2	"In my view, the author creates a mood of pure happiness and love in the memoir. Narciso Rodriguez states that ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The family in the memoir frequently had guests. For example, Alegria, the landlord's daughter, who was Narciso's first friend and babysitter, often came over for dinner. Narciso also mentions that ""at the table were Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not know my'real' grandparents, Narciso the Elder and [@PERSON2], until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)."" [@CAPS1]'s house was always filled with aunts, uncles, cousins, and ""countless extended family members."" [@CAPS1] says [@CAPS2] ""My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family."" This explains the happiness in the house, but I believe it was also full of love as ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home."
739	12565	5	2	I believe the author's mood is one of honor, pride, love, and appreciation. The author seems honored because, in paragraph [@NUM1], he vividly expresses his feelings about his parents' loving nature and their ability to make others feel loved and welcome. He also appears proud as, in paragraph [@NUM2], he explains how much he appreciates his family and parents for their open - armed approach to helping those in need. He struggles to find words to express the commitment and kindness his parents show to everyone. Throughout the story, the author constantly mentions his parents' loving nature, and it's evident that he has adopted this trait, as seen in his words and expressions. These are the moods I perceive in the author and the reasons behind them.
740	12566	5	2	The author creates a nice and calm mood in the memoir. The description of the family welcoming people into their home with open arms and an open door gives the impression of a pleasant atmosphere. The mood is calm because the story focuses on the family doing kind things, with no yelling or fighting. This portrayal makes the mood seem both nice and calming, leaving a positive impression on the readers.
741	12567	5	2	In the memoir, the author's mood shifts each time he discusses his new home. For instance, in a certain paragraph, he mentions rich culinary skills and a long - lasting love for cooking he's grateful for to this day, along with his adoration for passionate Cuban music that endures. The use of parentheses indicates a change in the story's mood when he contrasts his life in Cuba with his new life in America. He is thankful for being in America and for his parents' decision to leave Cuba, despite having a better life there. This shows that different life phases bring about distinct emotions for the author.
742	12568	5	2	"The mood crafted by Narciso Rodriguez exudes a loving and caring sentiment. As he is speaking about his family, it's natural for his tone to be affectionate. He states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends."" This statement reveals his longing for those times, clearly indicating that he holds those memories dear. Thus, the mood established in the excerpt is indeed loving and caring, highlighting the significance of family and past experiences to him."
743	12569	5	2	"In the memoir, the author creates a mood that is both understandable and true. Throughout, the author expresses deep gratitude towards his parents. Narciso explains, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" His parents endured numerous hardships. They had to leave their country, friends, and family, and essentially start anew. However, they remained strong during these tough times. They cared for Narciso and imparted many important lessons. The author's mood is one of love, reflecting on the incredible parents he had and the gratitude he feels towards them for all they've done."
744	12570	5	2	"The memoir's author creates a loving and grateful mood. Narciso shares with readers the depth of gratefulness for living in @LOCATION1. Even though the house wasn't large or luxurious, it was the family that made it lovable. Narciso loves and appreciates what her family has done for her. She says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The house holds special meaning as it's where she learned the true essence of family. ""It is where I learned the real definition of 'family.' And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" This shows that family and the home they create are invaluable sources of love and gratitude."
745	12571	5	2	"In the memoir, the author does more than just describe the journey to @LOCATION1 and the house he lived in. He offers a detailed and heart - warming account of his life there and the relationships he formed. He also devotes time to discussing his parents' selflessness and their efforts to make new immigrants feel welcome. The author sets a mood that appeals to those who are feeling down and seek a warm, comforting experience while reading. The mood conveys selflessness and the power of unity in the face of segregation. As the author says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This story shows that the world doesn't have to be cold and heartless. If we follow the example set by the author's parents, we can all live in unity, which is a powerful and positive message."
746	12572	5	2	In the memoir, the boy recounts how his parents made sacrifices for him and showed self - lessness by inviting refugees into their home, despite limited space. His parents' actions reflect their deep love and altruism, which left a profound mark on the boy.
747	12573	5	2	"In this memoir, the author effectively evokes the atmosphere of his childhood home. From Paragraph @NUM1, it is evident that cooking was a significant aspect of his childhood. The author depicts a home filled with the enticing aroma of the kitchen and the ""passionate @CAPS1 music"", creating a warm and inviting mood that makes one think of home. This paragraph serves as the cornerstone of the author's childhood memories. The author lived in a neighborhood of immigrants who were amicable and always offered mutual assistance. In Paragraph @NUM2, the author portrays a mood of family, friendship, and acceptance. Even during a time of racism and segregation, the neighborhood's residents, despite their differences, treated one another as equals. Moving to a new country and starting a new life is extremely challenging. Immigrants often struggle to secure good jobs, adapt to climate changes, and learn a new language, which creates an atmosphere of hardship. Throughout the memoir, the author skillfully creates both positive and negative moods associated with his childhood memories."
748	12574	5	2	"The author creates a happy mood, one of security with friends, family, and neighbors. Narciso's parents sacrificed their careers, left behind friends and family, and essentially started anew for the sake of their children. Narciso lived in a charming two - family blond brick building. As a child, she was exposed to Cuban culture, like cooking and music that filled the house. Narciso had numerous ""families""; her neighbors, mostly immigrants, came together, forming a strong sense of solidarity and friendship. She was part of a close - knit community where help was always available. Her parents were always welcoming. Alegria, the landlord's daughter, often visited their kitchen, as did her aunts Bertha and Juanita, along with cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary. Sometimes, someone would stay with them temporarily. Even in difficult times, her parents would sacrifice anything for her. Narciso is truly grateful to her parents for turning a simple house into a home."
749	12575	5	2	"The article creates a joyful mood. The author states, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today and for which I am extremely grateful."" This clearly shows his gratitude for what he has received, contributing to the overall joyful mood. He also mentions, ""Passionate Cuban music which I adored this day filled the air mixing with the aroma of the kitchen. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" These descriptions lighten the mood and enhance the sense of joy. Overall, the author's words effectively convey a very positive and joyful atmosphere."
750	12576	5	2	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, a strong sense of thankfulness pervades. When Narciso discusses his family's home culture, he repeatedly emphasizes his enduring love for it. For example, he writes, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). By including the parenthetical statement, he reminds the reader of his long - standing affection for the music, indicating his gratitude towards his parents for playing it. Moreover, Narciso explicitly states his thankfulness in the memoir, saying, ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). This clearly shows his appreciation for his parents' actions during his childhood. Finally, the memoir concludes with ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1. @NUM2), which further solidifies his deep - seated thankfulness. Throughout the memoir, the mood of thankfulness is consistently and clearly conveyed."
751	12577	5	2	The memoir details that @ORGANIZATION2 lived in Cuba before arriving at @ORGANIZATION3. Eventually, they could afford a @NUM1 - bedroom apartment in @LOCATION1, a blond - brick building with thin walls. In 1961, they had a baby, Narciso Rodriguez. Within this apartment, my young parents established a traditional Cuban home. The heart of this home was the kitchen as both my parents were cooks and loved to cook. The air was filled with passionate Cuban music, blending with the enticing aromas from the kitchen.
752	12578	5	2	The @CAPS1 was in a good mood and frequently talked about his family. Firstly, he @CAPS2 his family, and secondly, their motivation was to constantly move around the city, state, or wherever he might go. The @CAPS1 was rarely @CAPS4 and was mostly happy. This is the essence of the story.
753	12579	5	2	I believe the author creates a mood of happiness and gratefulness in the memoir, and here are three reasons to support this view. Firstly, Narciso takes pride in the way @CAPS2 lives and the person @CAPS2 is. It all started with his immigrant parents. In 1961, he was born in a simple house. Secondly, @CAPS2 cherished every moment of life and was grateful for what his parents did for him and others, as shown by the statement “my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we consider family”. Finally, his parents migrated from Cuba. As immigrants not born in America, Narciso is proud and genuinely happy for them. This is why I think the mood in the memoir is one of happiness and gratefulness.
754	12580	5	2	In the memoir, there are two main moods. The most prominent one is joy and happiness. Throughout the memoir, readers learn about the writer's family and the writer's deep gratitude for them. For instance, the writer wrote, “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.” However, joy is not the only mood. Since this is a memoir written after Narciso Rodriguez's passing, sadness also pervades it. In the end, the joyful mood somewhat masks the depressing one, but to fully understand the writer's perspective, readers must consider both moods.
755	12581	5	2	Narciso Rodriguez crafted a mood of care and gratitude throughout the memoir. He achieved this by never promoting himself, but instead constantly thanking his parents and depicting his childhood as a time when everyone supported one another. For example, in @CAPS2 @NUM1, he discusses the sacrifices his parents made for their children's better lives. He states, “They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships.” By writing about the hardships and sacrifices others, especially his parents, endured for his well - being, Narciso shows appreciation, which makes readers feel grateful. Additionally, in @CAPS2 @NUM2, he describes his neighborhood as a close - knit family. He says, “Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In this neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.” This description gives readers a sense of how people come together in difficult times. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood of care and gratitude in his memoir.
756	12582	5	2	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the author creates multiple moods, including sadness, bravery, and gratitude. The author crafts a sad mood in several ways. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1, the author mentions that immigrants leave their families, friends, and careers to come to @LOCATION1 to do good and provide a better environment for their children. In paragraph @NUM2, the author expresses eternal gratitude to his @CAPS1. Leaving loved ones behind is a brave act. The author also evokes a sad mood by highlighting that immigrants selflessly come to @LOCATION1 to offer their children a better life. Moreover, the author creates a sad mood by not discussing the positive aspects. Overall, the author effectively conveys a complex mix of emotions through these narrative techniques."
757	12583	5	2	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our lives, the @CAPS3 defines family not as blood - related relatives but as individuals who leave a lasting impression due to their significant impact and role in one's life. As the @CAPS3 describes this throughout, when @CAPS5 discusses family and its definition, family members are not portrayed as blood - related but as those who offer support. In the memoir, the landlord and his daughter often provided food for the @CAPS6. The entire community functioned as a family, reaching out to help one another despite coming from diverse backgrounds, including different religions such as Italian, Spanish, and Cuban. They stood unified, and this unity transformed them into a family. This shows that the concept of family can transcend blood relations.
758	12584	5	2	In Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our lives, the author creates a mood that is @CAPS3 yet sad. In @CAPS4 one, it is stated that the boy's father and mother were living in a one - room apartment, which contributes to the sad aspect. However, it is also @CAPS3 and @CAPS5 because his parents had him and made the house feel like a home. They taught him how to cook and introduced him to different music from his culture, which he still adores today, as mentioned in @CAPS4 @NUM1. Another factor that makes this @CAPS7 @CAPS3 and @CAPS5 is that the neighbors lived together and supported each other when needed. They had different religions like Italian, Spanish, and Cuban, as per the statement from @CAPS4 @NUM2. Thus, this @CAPS7 is @CAPS3 but also sad at the same time.
759	12585	5	2	"The mood in this selection is one of pride and happiness. There are clear clues in the text that support this. The most significant clue is when the author states facts such as ""and for which I am eternally 'grateful'"" and ""which I adore to this day"". Also, the statement ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" clearly shows the author's pride. These textual clues effectively convey the overall mood of pride and happiness in the selection."
760	12586	5	2	"In the memoir Home: Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author establishes a mood of gratitude and love. The author is grateful to his parents for their cultural influence and selflessness in leaving their family and friends so that their children could have a better life. A line that clearly demonstrates this is ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on a love of cooking that is still with me today"" (@NUM1), which shows his love for his culture and heritage. His love for his Cuban family and their traditions is also evident from the line ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@NUM1). Throughout the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez consistently creates a mood brimming with gratitude and love."
761	12587	5	2	"In the memoir, the author establishes a mood of happiness. Rodriguez expresses his deep appreciation for his parents and all they have done for him, transforming the house into a warm home and always being by his side. He discusses friendships and family, where family encompasses relationships with friends, even those not related by blood. Ultimately, he thanks his parents, stating, ""In reality, there is no way to convey my gratitude for the spirit of generosity instilled in me at such a young age and the demonstration of the significance of family and friends."
762	12588	5	2	In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez cultivates a reflective and relaxed atmosphere around his memories. For instance, his use of parentheses provides a distinct voice, enabling readers to better comprehend his intended message. Additionally, by positively reflecting on the past, it seems as though the author is right beside the reader, engaged in a pleasant conversation. When he mentions the landlord's daughter at @LOCATION1, he notes how she would frequently visit his table. Moreover, his description of the apartment environment makes the reader feel as if they are sitting in a wooden - backed chair, listening to an unnamed Cuban singer's sweet serenade. The air is filled with the smell of spices, and the smoke from the stove drifts lazily out of the window, making one's eyes water. The background is filled with the sounds of engines, the beeps of horns, and the low roar of a bus. The bright reds, oranges, and yellows of the furniture are visually appealing. This reflective and relaxed mood is crucial for the author to convey his stories, and Narciso Rodriguez accomplishes this effectively.
763	12589	5	2	The author creates a happy mood in this memoir as he is proud of his culture. He loves his parents and the home they created. The author details how his life began in New Jersey and how proud he is of his parents. He looks up to them and intends to carry on the family's culture and traditions. This is what makes me believe that the mood set by the author is one of happiness and fullness in family life. As I read this passage, I was genuinely glad and happy for him because of his deep admiration for his family and the contentment in his life.
764	12590	5	2	"The mood established in the memoir is one of happiness, gratefulness, and love. The author recounts how his parents left Cuba, their beloved country, to provide a better life for their children, leaving behind families, friends, and careers (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The author shows his gratitude by stating his appreciation for his culture and his parents' sacrifice (@CAPS1 @NUM2). Additionally, the author shares his feelings about the house he once lived in, and through this, one learns the true meaning of ""family."" He is overjoyed about the way his parents welcomed other refugees to the country. At the end, the author says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3), which sums up his emotions and the overall mood of the memoir."
765	12591	5	2	The mood created by the author in the memoir is sad. He grew up poor; his family had no money and lived in a @NUM1 - bedroom apartment in New Jersey. The heart of their living space was the kitchen, and his parents shared cooking duties. Despite their difficult circumstances, they still remembered the traditional ways of acting in Cuba. It was a poor refugee - living place. After considering going to school to help his family, he started attending and learned a lot about love and other things. He also began learning @CAPS1 as he didn't know how to speak it before. His birthday was celebrated in a very small space, the size of the kitchen. He said he would always be grateful to his family for all they had done. At a young age, he was very proud and expressed his eternal gratitude to his parents for their love, sacrifice, strength, courage, and perseverance. Overall, it was a very sad life for him and his parents.
766	12592	5	2	In my view, the mood of this excerpt is one of care. The parents were willing to essentially sacrifice their existing lives to start anew and provide their children with a better living environment. They had a comfortable life back home but gave it all up for the sake of their children. This is precisely why the mood of this excerpt is caring.
767	12593	5	2	Narciso's parents are immigrants from Cuba. They established a traditional Cuban home. Living in Cuba was extremely challenging for the parents. This is a remarkable family that supports immigrants in this country to settle in one place. Immigrants bring their own cultures, and if one is Cuban, they retain their unique cultural identity. In conclusion, the cultural and family aspects of these Cuban immigrants play an important role in their new - found living situation.
768	12594	5	2	"The tone of the poem is highly warm and loving. The vivid recollection of his home, filled with passionate Cuban music and a deep - seated love for culinary arts, imparts a sense of warmth and affection to the reader. Words such as ""adore,"" ""warm home,"" ""innocence of childhood,"" ""passionate,"" ""congregation,"" ""love of cooking,"" and ""celebrations"" immerse the reader in a loving and heartfelt tone. His exploration of the true meaning of family, which extends beyond blood relations, warms the reader as the paragraph mentions his extended family like Alegria, Sergio, and others, as well as his real relatives like aunts Bertha and Juanita and his cousins. The statement ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" is so full of love that the tone reaches a powerful, final chord of warmth, leaving the reader satisfied. Undoubtedly, the tone of [PERSON1]'s work is loving."
769	12595	5	2	I believe the mood in this article is a combination of happiness and gratitude. It comes across as happy because Narciso shares the great fun he has with his parents and close family, and his fondness for where he lives. It also exudes gratitude as Narciso achieved the education he desired, and everyone around him was extremely proud of him. Overall, I feel that the mood is predominantly one of happiness and gratitude.
770	12596	5	2	"Based on what I've learned, living in a foreign country can be extremely difficult. Poverty often prevails, and there are also occasional instances of racism and discrimination. However, this well - crafted memoir showcases the contentment and positive aspects. It depicts the happiness that Narciso experiences in his home. In this home, he can still engage with Cuban culture, including music, traditional cooking, and the wonderful atmosphere of having family around. The quote ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" encapsulates the essence of this memoir. It shows how people from different backgrounds came together to celebrate the joys of life, even when facing disapproval at times. In conclusion, this memoir offers a heartening perspective on the immigrant experience."
771	12597	5	2	In this memoir, the author crafts a mood of love. Narciso and his family were brimming with love, enabling them to surmount challenges and assist others. They welcomed non - family members into their home, treating them as part of the family. Their love and care for others may have even exceeded that for themselves. They left behind everything in Cuba to move to America, seeking a better future for their children. This abundance of love transformed an ordinary house into a loving, caring, compassionate, and selfless home, not just for Narciso but for the entire community and the family they created. Such is the mood of this memoir and the essence of its creation.
772	12598	5	2	The mood was happy as most of his family immigrated to @LOCATION1. He and his parents had a passion for cooking, and he adored the smell of the kitchen. His family would sometimes cook, and people would visit to eat. However, the author's past was marked by unhappiness due to the need to endure racism. Overall, the experiences in the text blend both happy and unhappy elements that shape the narrative.
773	12599	5	2	"The mood established by the author in this memoir is one of happiness and gratitude. In paragraph @NUM1, the author states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In paragraph @NUM2, it is mentioned that ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture."" Based on these statements, it is evident that the mood of the author in this memoir is indeed one of happiness and gratitude."
774	12600	5	2	"The author conveys a mood of happiness in this memoir. Narciso expresses deep gratitude for his parents' decision to leave their beloved Cuba and move to the @ORGANIZATION1 to offer their children a better life. He elaborates on his love for his parents, highlighting their sacrifices. For instance, ""In Cuba, Narciso, SR., had worked in the laboratory and @LOCATION1 had studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find."" Narciso's appreciation for his parents' sacrifices and risks led him to write this memoir."
775	12601	5	2	"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, the author creates a mood in the memoir that is a combination of happiness and sadness. The author ensures that the mood aligns with the story's words, which are both happy and sad at times. At the beginning of the story, the mood is sad, but it gradually becomes happier as the story progresses. This is the mood that the author has successfully crafted in the memoir."
776	12602	5	2	"The mood crafted by the author in the memoir revolves around the theme of family. The author depicts his upbringing in New Jersey and mentions ""Sergio and Edelmira,"" his grandparents, whom he didn't meet until 1970. Even though many of the people around him were not his biological family, he regarded them as such because they cared for and loved him. In conclusion, this sense of family is what defines the mood of the memoir."
777	12603	5	2	"The memoir written by author @PERSON1, who is an internationally - recognized clothing designer, presents a heart - warming story. Through it, the author offers his definition of ""family,"" sharing his experiences with what he considers his one and only ""family."" In essence, the mood of the memoir is centered around this special concept of family."
778	12604	5	2	I believe the author aimed to convey that Narciso is thankful for where he lives. He has a deep love for his home and his parents, and everyone in his life gets along well. Despite being an immigrant, he desires to succeed and build good relationships with others. Overall, the mood created by the author effectively shows Narciso's positive attitude towards his life and his aspirations.
779	12605	5	2	"The mood established by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is highly @CAPS1 and happy. In paragraph @NUM1, there isn't much action, so the emotional impact is minimal. However, about halfway through the @NUM2 paragraph, the memoir begins to exude a strong @CAPS1 feeling. It's truly @CAPS1 as one realizes his ability to transform a New Jersey apartment into a traditional Cuban home. As stated in paragraph @NUM3, the neighborhood consisted of ""Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and there was segregation.""

It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'."" He will never forget the house, the neighborhood, and the lessons about love. His parents' efforts to turn a simple house into a home are deeply ingrained in his memory. In conclusion, the overall mood is one of warmth and gratitude."
830	12656	5	2	"The mood of the memoir is characterized by gratitude. This can be inferred from the statement in the memoir, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This clearly shows that Narciso Rodriguez is grateful, which sets the mood of the memoir. Additionally, the mention that his parents taught him to love his culture, ""and for which I am eternally grateful"", further emphasizes this mood. The author's choice of words effectively conveys the memoir's mood of gratitude. In conclusion, gratitude is the defining mood of the memoir."
831	12657	5	2	"Narciso Rodriguez's work @CAPS1 from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" cultivates a highly optimistic atmosphere. Rodriguez details that despite the era when blatant racism was widespread and segregation was the norm in the United States, he and his ""family,"" which included foreign neighbors, managed to overcome adversity. Moreover, he elaborates on how, notwithstanding the diverse cultural backgrounds within his neighborhood, they coexisted as a unified family. Finally, he recounts all the memories and celebrations that transformed his house from a mere living space into a haven of love and friendship. It is evident that Narciso held equal affection for his family and friends, a sentiment that significantly influenced his life."
832	12658	5	2	I was in that simple house where my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival in this country. I also celebrated my first birthday there. I was in the warmth of the kitchen in that humble abode, where a Cuban feast always filled the air with both a delightful scent and an abundance of love. It was here that I learned the true meaning of family. For this reason, I will never forget that house, its kind - hearted neighborhood, or the many lessons I learned there, such as how to love.
833	12659	5	2	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, a clothing designer, grew up in @LOCATION1 surrounded by immigrants from various backgrounds. The underlying theme suggests that home is defined by relationships rather than a physical space. As Rodriguez states, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" (@NUM1). He was part of ""a close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants"" (@NUM1). In my view, Narciso might not have become a clothing designer if he hadn't grown up among these people."
834	12660	5	2	"The author creates a mood of gratefulness in the memoir. Narciso is thankful for his parents' sacrifice in moving to @LOCATION1, which provided him with a better life. The author writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Additionally, Narciso admires his parents' strength and perseverance, as indicated in the text: ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance..."" In @CAPS1, he expresses that he will never forget how his parents transformed a house into a home. This mood of gratefulness permeates the entire memoir."
835	12661	5	2	The mood established by the author in the memoir is serene. In the story, Narciso Rodriguez briefly shares his life with the reader. He describes how his family moved from Cuba to America. The boy also expresses his love for his home, celebrations, and heritage in America. He speaks in a calm and matter - of - fact tone as he explains his life. Since he is simply sharing his experiences and his contentment, there is no anger in this narrative.
836	12662	5	2	In this article, the author conveys a mood of both happiness and pride. He holds deep affection for his place of origin, where he was raised, and especially the life his parents provided. He adores his parents and is extremely grateful to them. They transformed a mere house into a warm home. They didn't need a fortune to be happy; all they required was each other, and they achieved that. He is who he is and is extremely proud of his Cuban life and family.

839	12665	5	2	@PERSON1 adopts a very happy tone and mood when discussing his home. His parents passed on their rich culinary skills to him, and the love for cooking they instilled still remains with him today, for which he is eternally grateful. Narciso is extremely happy that he learned such excellent cooking during his childhood. As stated, “Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home” (@NUM1). This happiness contributed to making his home in @CAPS1 a warm and inviting place. He also mentioned, “I will never Forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home” (@NUM2). Narciso encapsulated the essence of his entire article in one sentence, evoking the feelings that most people associate with home. Just like Narciso, at my home, I experience the same emotions because it's not about the place you live but how you live there.
840	12666	5	2	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is calm and happy. I believe this because the author mainly focuses on the positive aspects of their childhood. They also express their deep love for their family. A child without a loving family would likely not be happy, yet the author in this memoir is. Additionally, they are most grateful for their home and how their parents transformed a house into a warm and loving home. All these factors lead me to conclude that the author's mood is one of happiness and calmness."
841	12667	5	2	I believe the mood conveyed is one of happiness. When she spoke about her cooking skills and mentioned listening to Cuban music, she used phrases like “which I still love today.” When she said “our house became a home,” it indicated that they were happily settled, with little stress and everyone feeling comfortable. She repeatedly expressed gratitude for having wonderful parents and a great house. This led me to conclude that she must be truly happy with her family, her house, and her life in @LOCATION1.
842	12668	5	2	The mood of this memoir is both positive and caring. The story is caring because they supported all the people staying there and assisted them until they could relocate. It is positive because the parents always enjoyed cooking, which was their favorite activity, and they had a great time @CAPS2. These elements contribute to the overall mood of the memoir, making it a heart - warming and upbeat read.
843	12669	5	2	The author creates a happy and reflective mood in the memoir, offering a glimpse into their family life during childhood. The memoir describes the author's household as warm and caring, and explains how it came to be that way. The author sets the mood by stating, “Our traditional Cuban home, where the very heart of which was the kitchen.” They also talk about the family's love for cooking and the happy atmosphere in the house, with “Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.” Additionally, the author mentions the close - knit community of honest, hard - working migrants in the surrounding homes. Everyone was friends and took care of each other, knowing they could rely on one another. By expressing that they “will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,” the author maintains the happy mood throughout, making it a loving and caring account of @PERSON1's childhood.
844	12670	5	2	In the memoir “Narciso Rodriguez” from the book “Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,” the author exudes a sense of happiness and gratitude. The author's happiness is evident in paragraph @NUM1, where they write, “It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.” This depicts a happy environment in which the author grew up. The author is also deeply grateful to their parents, as shown in paragraph @NUM2, where they state, “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.” These passages clearly illustrate the emotions the author felt during their childhood.
845	12671	5	2	The author creates a mood of appreciation for his house and parents. Firstly, the author details how his parents selflessly gave up much for him and his sister. The text “They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially...” shows that the parents sacrificed their family, friends, and jobs in Cuba for their children, which the author highly appreciates. Secondly, his parents taught him two important life lessons. As the story says, “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... I've often told them the admiration for their strength and perseverance... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.” His parents showed these lessons through their actions, not just words, and these teachings have formed the basis of his life. Thirdly, he learned the real meaning of family in this house, as “It was where I learned the real definition of 'family'.” All these elements combine to create the mood of appreciation in the memoir.
846	12672	5	2	"The memoir creates a very happy, loving, and content mood. This mood is established as Narciso discusses the wonderful and happy life his parents provided for him. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1, he states, ""The congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This description sounds extremely happy and loving. He also mentions, ""It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This is another example of the loving and happy mood in the memoir, as it shows how people were helpful and gracious to those in need. Reading this memoir was truly enjoyable as it focused on people's love for one another, setting a very happy and light - hearted mood."
847	12673	5	2	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the author creates a mood of gratitude. Narciso deeply loved his parents and was extremely grateful for all they did. He states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (@NUM1). His parents came to the US specifically for him, and he appreciates this greatly. Secondly, he has tried to express his thanks many times but struggles to find the right words. Rodriguez says, ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me"" (@NUM1). Despite living in a three - room apartment, Narciso knew it was special. He states, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM3). His parents, with limited financial means, couldn't offer much materially, but their actions meant the world to him. Clearly, the mood of this passage is one of profound gratitude."
848	12674	5	2	The mood in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is hopeful, heart - lifting, caring, grateful, lively, loving, and courageous. It is hopeful because Narciso's parents had to restart their lives, taking any jobs they could find. Without hope, they would not have succeeded. They placed their hope in their children, believing they could have great and prosperous lives when they came to @LOCATION1. The mood is heart - lifting as it tells the story of how the parents came to @LOCATION1 for their kids and ended up achieving success. Their actions, such as having people for dinner, housing those in need, and being ready to comfort those who had fallen on hard times, show as much care as a parent has for a newborn. Narciso's parents taught him the meaning of family and friendship, and the importance of having courage and persevering. He is deeply grateful for these life lessons, which were not just told but shown through their lives. The home was always full of life, with music and aromas in the air and people coming for dinner or to stay briefly. His parents must have had the courage to abandon their previous work, come to @LOCATION1 for their children's better future, and start a new career. The mood is crucial for truly understanding the message of the memoir.
849	12675	5	2	"The mood in this memoir is relaxed and happy. Narciso is constantly happy at home, where there is always the smell of food and his parents cooking. There is a strong sense of family in the house. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso said, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This means that one doesn't have to be related by blood to be family; anyone close enough can be considered part of the family. He also believes that one should always help those in need, which is what his parents did. They were always willing to assist others and share everything they had. This is the mood of family and love instilled in the memoir."
850	12676	5	2	"I believe the mood of the passage @ORGANIZATION1 by The Blueprints of our Lives is a very @CAPS1 mood. In the passage, it says, ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" This indicates that @CAPS2 is thankful that their parents provided a good home. Another reason for thinking the mood of the @CAPS3 is @CAPS1 is that in the story, the @CAPS3 states, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that the @CAPS3 is @CAPS8, and this is the mood that the article conveys."
851	12677	5	2	The mood conveyed by @CAPS1 (in my perspective) is one of happiness. Despite having to move to @LOCATION1, away from his loved ones, he managed to find happiness with his family in @LOCATION1. This shows that he was able to adapt and create a positive environment for himself and his family.
852	12678	5	2	The mood established by @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2 is a happy and loving one. Reading the passage reveals that love and care permeated the author's home. As a result, they built a home and a @CAPS4 relationship with each other and others. The author's family @CAPS5 in their home those they regarded as family, which clearly reflects a caring mood. In conclusion, the overall mood is a heart - warming and caring one.
853	12679	5	2	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by The Blueprints of our lives, the author's mood is both quiet and loving. He is thankful for all he has received. He grew up in @LOCATION1, and his @CAPS1 parents, who were very kind, always strived to give him a better life. His upbringing was rather uneventful, which is why the mood is quiet. The author also feels loved as the memoir states that ""always filled the air with not just scent in music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of family"". Thus, the quiet and loving mood is well - supported by the content of the memoir."
854	12680	5	2	"The mood crafted by the author in the memoir is one of gentle pride and thankfulness. As per paragraph @NUM1, the author describes how his parents risked everything for his better future, which makes him proud. Throughout the memoir, he shows pride in being Cuban by sharing aspects of his culture. According to paragraph @NUM2, he expresses thankfulness as he learned the true meaning of family through his parents and his country. He says, ""... I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home"". In conclusion, the author consistently demonstrates pride in his roots, parents, country, and neighborhood."
855	12681	5	2	The author creates a sad mood. He talks about his entire family, his house, and the numerous good memories he had there, including his first friend. Recalling these elements in this context evokes a sense of sadness. Overall, the mood remains a melancholic one as the author reflects on these cherished parts of his life.
856	12682	5	2	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"", it appears that the author was extremely grateful and happy at that time. The author's happiness can be inferred from the way he wrote about Narciso always being in a good - mood and her love for cooking in the kitchen with everyone. Moreover, her fondness for the ritual song she sang with her family also reflects the positive emotions of the author. All these elements suggest that the author was truly content and appreciative in that moment."
857	12683	5	2	The mood crafted by the author is one of love. This is evident from the description of the house, where “The passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.” Since cooking and music are commonly associated with love, and love brings happiness, it sets a loving tone. The author also mentions a “close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants who extended a hand to people in need, even if they were not of the same kind.” This further emphasizes the mood of love, encompassing love for cooking, music, and family. Another instance is the quote “My Parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.” It shows that despite not being blood - related, they look out for one another, indicating a strong sense of love. Overall, love is the apparent mood in this memoir.
858	12684	5	2	The author establishes a mood of love in the memoir. As stated in a paragraph, “Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.” This implies that if one respects friends and loved ones, their home will be filled with love and happiness, and life will be good. In essence, the author conveys that a home built on respect and togetherness can be a haven of love.
859	12685	5	2	In the memoir, the author manages to create a mood centered around love and community. In the second paragraph, the author uses words such as traditional, passionate, and congregation to describe his childhood home. These words set the tone for the rest of the memoir, where love and helping the community are the main themes. Reading it gives the impression that one could enter their home as a complete stranger and be warmly welcomed. Towards the end, the author's remarks about his gracious neighborhood and how he learned to love reinforce these themes. In conclusion, the memoir effectively conveys the power of love and community.
860	12686	5	2	The author creates a mood of happiness and gratefulness in the writing. Reading it made me feel thankful. The author expresses his gratitude to his parents multiple times. In paragraph @NUM1, he mentions learning to cook from his parents and says “and for which I am eternally grateful”. In paragraph @NUM2, he states “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.” These quotes clearly show the author's deep - seated gratitude. The sentence “They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life” from paragraph @NUM3 also suggests that the author wants the readers to feel grateful. Additionally, the author's reflection “I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home” gives a sense of happiness. Reading this work made me not only grateful for what I have but also happy as I thought about the sacrifices my parents made.

861	12687	5	2	The mood is one of warm happiness. The home is a safe and idyllic place where everything seems to go right. It is a caring home filled with friends and family who have been around for a long time. This kind of home creates an atmosphere that makes one feel content and at peace.
862	12688	5	2	The author creates a happy mood based on what he has. The quote “In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of their cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship” shows the author's positive view of different cultures uniting. This unity is what contributes to the overall happy mood in the text, highlighting the power of cultural harmony.
863	12689	5	2	In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir “@CAPS1 Rodriguez”, the mood crafted by @CAPS2 is shocking. On page @NUM1, paragraph @NUM2, Rodriguez wrote, “I would not know my 'real' grandparents... leave Cuba.” This indicates that Rodriguez didn't meet @CAPS2 real grandparents until they left Cuba in 1970. Earlier in the memoir, she mentioned that @CAPS2 surrogate grandparents (Sergio, Edelmira) came for dinner. Ultimately, the shocking mood persists as @CAPS2 real grandparents arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 in 1970. Rodriguez likely wrote this to convey the true meaning of family to the reader.
864	12690	5	2	The author creates a loving and caring mood. In the second paragraph, the house is described as filled with the rich culinary creations of the parents, the passionate Cuban music in the air, and the enticing aromas from the kitchen in their warm home. The family has feasts and invites many immigrants into their house until they can stand on their own or find a place to live. The author believes that family isn't just about blood relations; everyone in the neighborhood is family, and they care for one another and those in need. At the end, the author says, “I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.” They taught the author the true meaning of love and family, and the house is truly a warm and inviting place.
865	12691	5	2	The author creates a mood of love, happiness, and the idea that family can be friends in the memoir. The author elaborates on how his mom and dad sacrificed everything for their child and his life. They had to change their entire lives after leaving Cuba, including their jobs. In Cuba, his dad worked in a laboratory and his mom studied chemical engineering, and they may have had to abandon these careers. This sacrifice and the love behind it contribute to the overall mood of love and happiness in the memoir, emphasizing the self - less nature of family.
866	12692	5	2	The memoir exudes a mood of gratitude and contentment. The author conveys this sentiment through the quotes included. For instance, the statement “I was born into this simple house, situated in a two - family, blond - brick building in the ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey” indicates that the author was not overly concerned about the house's appearance, price, or location. Another quote, “It was here where I learned the real definition of family... [that it] had nothing to do with being a blood relative,” shows the author's gratitude towards those he now considers his “family.” The line “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life” clearly expresses the author's gratefulness. Additionally, the author uses phrases in parentheses such as “(after which I eternally grateful)” and “(which I adore to this day)” to further emphasize his happiness and gratitude for his life. The quote “It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need” also reveals that the “family” members were mutually grateful for one another. Overall, the memoir effectively portrays the author's grateful and content state of mind.
867	12693	5	2	The author creates a mood of friendship and love in the memoir. When the author's parents moved to the United States, they established a traditional home, with the kitchen being the heart of it. As described, “Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.” In the kitchen, celebrations, childhood memories, and gatherings of friends and family formed the backdrop of their lives. The author learned that “family” was not defined by blood relations. The neighborhood where the author lived consisted of diverse cultures that blended together to form a small community of honest, hard - working immigrants. These immigrants were always ready to help those in need. The author's parents “always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family.” Many of these immigrants left their lives in Cuba to move to the US, despite not knowing the language or culture, in order to provide a better life for their children. The author will always be thankful to her parents for their love and sacrifice, as they showed her the importance of family and friends when she was a child. The author states, “I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.” They achieved this transformation through love and friendship, highlighting the significance of these values in creating a true home.
868	12694	5	2	In the memoir, the author creates a loving and caring mood. Throughout the memoir, the speaker, Narciso Rodriguez, details what his family did after migrating from their native Cuba. His parents always kept an open - door policy, welcoming those they considered family, knowing that the favor would be returned. They cared deeply about their children's future and left behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. Although “they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships,” they did what they believed was best for their children. Their simple house became the perfect place for the family to be together. As described, “The warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.” This memoir made me realize the similarities between this family and mine. Without love, a family cannot truly exist, which is why at the end of the word “family,” the letters “i, l, y” can be seen as standing for “i love you.” In conclusion, the memoir effectively showcases the power of love and sacrifice within a family.
869	12695	5	2	Reading this memoir gives me a warm and cozy feeling. When it discusses the concept of family not being limited to blood - related individuals, I immediately think of my friends and those I can rely on. They are also my family. The author also points out that a house is not necessarily a home without memories, family, and someone or something to trust. Finally, the author expresses his great gratitude for his parents bringing him to a neighborhood that he would grow to love. This piece has made me reflect on and appreciate my own family and home. It reminds me that the essence of a home lies in the relationships and memories we create within it.
870	12696	5	2	The author creates a positive mood in the memoir. It describes the author's real - life situation. Family members would come to live with them until they got back on their feet, and having family around was a common occurrence. The author realized that they had transformed their “house into a Home.” Endless celebrations formed the backdrop of life in their warm home. Quotes like “they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in their country they loved” show the self - sacrifice of the immigrants. “The barriers to work were strong and high and my parents both accepted that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they had deserved.” In Cuba, Narciso, Sr. had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied Chemical Engineering. In the new place, they had to start their lives from scratch, taking any available work. The belief that this struggle would lead to better times for them and their children motivated them to endure the hardships. In my view, this is the mood that the author conveys in the memoir, highlighting the resilience and hope of the immigrant family.
871	12697	5	2	"In the memoir, the author crafts a mood imbued with love, care, and gratitude. Throughout, the author repeatedly expresses her deep - seated gratitude towards her parents and the profound love she holds for them. She states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This indicates her appreciation for her parents' selflessness in giving up their home, jobs, and friends to secure a better life for her. Additionally, she remarks that ""what they [her parents] did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" The author, Narciso, acknowledges the bravery required to venture into an unknown future, and she is extremely thankful that her parents took that step. These quotes clearly illustrate the loving, caring, and grateful mood expressed in the memoir."
872	12698	5	2	"It's quite challenging to precisely define the mood as the author presents a plethora of emotions. However, the most prominent feeling is unity and a sense of family. While family may not strictly be an emotion, it can be characterized by multiple emotions, one of which is unity, or as the author puts it, ""great solidarity and friendship."" It's rather endearing how the author views family as the bonds formed with people, in contrast to cultures where family is defined by blood ties and family always takes precedence. This perspective likely stems from the author's cultural background. There's also a touch of sadness, but overall, the author seems extremely thankful for what they have. As the saying goes, ""happiness is nothing without appreciating it,"" and the author's statement ""I learned the real definition of family"" suggests that they have found true happiness."
873	12699	5	2	"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" evokes a mood of happiness, peace, and gratitude. Narciso is deeply appreciative of the sacrifices and lessons his parents bestowed upon him. His overall tone in the memoir translates into a happy and peaceful atmosphere.

This quote's calm and friendly tone depicts the happiness of his home life. By describing his house as ""warm"" with family and friend - centered celebrations, it creates the peaceful mood of the memoir. Narciso further adds to the peaceful mood by stating, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family,"" highlighting generosity and care towards family. The concept of family was the cornerstone of his loving childhood. The mood shifts to gratitude when Narciso thanks his parents for giving him a better life, despite their difficult jobs and circumstances. He expresses that he has ""no way to express [his] gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon [him],"" and ""the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The values of family, love, and generosity Narciso learned from his parents underpin the gracious, happy, and tranquil mood of his memoir and his life."
874	12700	5	2	"The author establishes a tone of truthfulness, gratitude, and pride in the memoir. The quote ""Passionate Cuban music... Filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations... that formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" reflects the author's pride and gratefulness for their home. The memoir cultivates a sense of family love that everyone yearns for. The statement ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" showcases the selfless love within the family. Those who sacrifice for their family's well - being are truly good people, and this is the kind of selfless and loving family love described in the memoir. Another mood present is pride in the family's sacrifice. The quote ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" emphasizes the need to be thankful for others' sacrifices. All these elements contribute to the qualities of a good family life."
875	12701	5	2	The author creates a very happy mood in the memoir. The atmosphere is filled with family, friends, joy, and happiness. Everyone is considered family, even during tough times. The author's parents made significant sacrifices to give the author a good life in @LOCATION1. The author is extremely grateful for their parents' decision to bring them to @LOCATION1, leaving behind their life in Cuba. This gratitude and the happy atmosphere filled with family and friends are the essence of the mood created by the author in the memoir.
876	12702	5	2	The memoir evokes a relaxed and caring mood, which is emphasized in multiple parts of the work. The author frequently expresses his love for his parents due to their self - lessness. This expression not only emphasizes the mood but is also repeated several times, with the repetition contributing to the mood - building. Additionally, the author's description of the kindness among neighbors in his neighborhood further enhances this mood. In conclusion, numerous elements in this work serve to emphasize a relaxed and caring mood.
877	12703	5	2	In Narciso's home, her young parents established a traditional home within the walls of their abode, with the kitchen at its heart. Both of Narciso's parents shared cooking duties and unknowingly passed on their rich culinary skills to Narciso, who developed a love for cooking. At a time when racism was prevalent, Narciso's neighborhood was mainly composed of Spanish and Italian immigrants. Her parents, like some immigrants, selflessly came to give their children a better life. They sacrificed leaving behind their family, friends, and careers in their home country. I believe her memory is a pleasant and happy one because through those memories, she understands what her family endured.
878	12704	5	2	"I believe the author has successfully set a mood of love from his family in the story. The author describes ""a love of (Cuban) cooking which still accompanies me (the author) today"" and ""Passionate Cuban music which I (the author) still adore today"", and this love originated from his parents. Another way the author created the mood of love was by stating that his ""parents always kept their arms and door open"". Allowing anyone into one's home requires a great deal of generosity. The author is speaking very lovingly at this point. He also says that he ""will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice"", which further sets the mood of a loving relationship. I think setting a mood of love is truly wonderful for a story."
879	12705	5	2	"I firmly believe that the mood created by the author is one of gratefulness towards his parents. Narciso Rodriguez wishes to convey to his parents how special they are to him and how deeply he appreciates what they've done for him. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez states, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" It's clear that Narciso wants the readers to understand his feelings about his family. He wants to share with us the sacrifices his family made for him. By expressing his gratitude for his parents' sacrifice and sharing his story, the mood of gratefulness towards the parents who created a 'home' for him is effectively established."
880	12706	5	2	"In the excerpt from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, @PERSON1 discusses the true meaning of ""family"", and a mood of gratitude is established. The text reads, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills... Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Through this passage, @PERSON1 shows his gratitude for his family's cultures. He is thankful for the food and music that have become part of his present - day life. The quote, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships,"" explains the great sacrifices @PERSON1's parents made for his happiness. They left behind a significant part of their lives, and for this, @PERSON1 is extremely grateful."
881	12707	5	2	"The mood conveyed by the @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2 is distinct and unique compared to others I've encountered. I am of the opinion that the atmosphere the @CAPS3 aims to create encompasses happiness, self - lessness, and gratitude. This belief stems from the fact that he portrays his parents as selfless individuals who welcome everyone into their small apartment. Additionally, his description of his first birthday with his parents as comforting suggests that he is also creating a sense of ""warmth."" In conclusion, these are the elements of the @CAPS1 that I believe the @CAPS3 is attempting to establish."
882	12708	5	2	The passage details Narciso Rodriguez's home, nationality, and family. He frequently mentions his nationality and takes pride in being born in Cuba, openly expressing this fact. He is married and resides in America during the @DATE1's. He often talks about his @NUM1 bedroom apartment in Newark, New Jersey, as well as the new friends he has made there. He also discusses his family and his childhood. His neighborhood consists of Cubans and @CAPS1. Overall, this is the essence of the memoir presented in the passage.
883	12709	5	2	"The mood of the memoir is characterized by gratitude, which is evident in multiple ways. In paragraph six, the author states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This statement reveals his gratitude towards his parents for moving from Cuba to the @CAPS1. In paragraph @NUM1, he says, ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I admire to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows his gratitude for his parents' Cuban culture and the passing - on of their cooking skills. In conclusion, these instances clearly demonstrate why the mood of the memoir is one of gratitude."
884	12710	5	2	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author creates a grateful mood. Narciso expresses his thankfulness for his parents' support and love. When discussing his feelings towards his parents, he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM1). The phrase ""grateful for their love and sacrifice"" indicates that his parents were with him throughout his life, not just giving advice but also leading by example. Regarding the @NUM2 lessons learned from his parents, he says, ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life"" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM1). The words ""basis of my life"" imply that his parents taught him the essentials of living. Moreover, they showed him the true meaning of family. He doesn't view family as merely blood - related, as he writes, ""It was here when I learned the real definition of 'family'"" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM4). The term ""definition of family"" shows his gratitude for his parents' teachings on this concept. In conclusion, the overall mood of this passage is one of gratitude."
885	12711	5	2	The author creates a happy mood in the memoir. Narciso was content with all that his parents had done for him, and the neighborhood was peaceful, with everyone willing to help those in need. This sense of contentment and community support contributes to the overall happy atmosphere of the memoir. In conclusion, the mood created by the author in the memoir is indeed a happy one.
886	12712	5	2	The memoir reflects on the author's childhood with a strong sense of nostalgia, creating a wistful mood. This mood is established through the author's recollections of their childhood home, friends, and family. However, this wistfulness persists only until the end of paragraph @NUM1. Subsequently, the mood shifts to one of gratitude, as the author expresses thanks and details the hardships endured by their parents. It is indeed possible for a memoir to convey multiple moods, and in this case, it successfully combines both wistfulness and gratitude.
887	12713	5	2	The memoir's overarching mood is one of gratitude. The author is deeply appreciative of their parents, who sacrificed their lives for the author's well - being. They left their home country and quit their jobs to relocate to @LOCATION1, enabling the author to have a better upbringing. The author also expresses gratitude towards their extended family and friends. These individuals share meals, play together, and support one another, acting as surrogate grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends. Additionally, the author is thankful for their Cuban culture, which encompasses both traditional food and time - honored traditions. In conclusion, the author's profound gratitude is a central theme throughout the memoir.
888	12714	5	2	I believe the author crafted a memoir that evokes a complex blend of sadness and happiness. The emotions are so palpable that they truly draw the reader in. In my view, this is a well - written memoir, and I particularly like its title, Narciso Rodriguez. Overall, the combination of the mood and the title makes this memoir an engaging read.
889	12715	5	2	"The author effectively creates two distinct moods in the excerpt: @CAPS1 and love. Initially, the mood is @CAPS1. In paragraph @NUM1, it states, ""They struggled both personally and financially."" Narciso elaborates on the tragedies his parents faced to ensure his life in @LOCATION1. The depiction of the family's poverty and struggles naturally elicits @CAPS1 feelings from the reader. Love is also a prominent mood. The excerpt states, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" Throughout the excerpt, the author conveys the love they developed for the ""family"" in the neighborhood. Based on these textual details, it is clear that both @CAPS1 and love are the moods created by the author."
890	12716	5	2	In this memoir, the mood is shaped by Narciso and his family. @PERSON2's family contributes to the mood by bringing the family together in their old home in Cuba and their new one in @LOCATION1. @PERSON2 further enhances the mood through their love for the family and by consistently expressing gratitude for all the family has done, from the author's childhood to adulthood. Moreover, @PERSON2's family shows great kindness by taking in those with nowhere to go and supporting them until they can stand on their own. All these actions and relationships combine to create a warm and inclusive mood in the memoir.
891	12717	5	2	The mood crafted by the author in the memoir is complex and difficult to define precisely. It is often confusing as there are multiple emotions presented. These include happiness, pride, sadness, and others. This is because the memoir chronicles Narciso Rodriguez's life. Due to the multitude of emotions, it is nearly impossible to encapsulate the overall mood created by the author.
892	12718	5	2	The author establishes a @CAPS1 yet happy atmosphere in the @CAPS2, which is about a boy whose parents immigrated. The boy grew up in his house, and his parents infused it with a Cuban touch, presenting both @CAPS1 and happy aspects. In conclusion, this combination of elements enriches the story and gives it a unique flavor.
893	12719	5	2	"The mood established by the author in the memoir is one of happiness. Throughout most paragraphs, the author, Narciso, expresses his deep love for his parents and Cuban culture. He details how his parents transformed their ordinary house into a home. In paragraph @NUM1, it states, ""Within the walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was my kitchen."" This evidence clearly indicates that Narciso is happy in this memoir."
894	12720	5	2	"The author is extremely happy and content with his family and appreciates what his parents have done, not only for him but also for other parents who immigrated from Cuba. He attributes his skills such as cooking, good manners, and the ability to form friendships to his parents. He ""admires the strength and perseverance"" of his parents and has thanked them repeatedly. In essence, the author believes he couldn't have a better family as they have taught him how to live, which is the ultimate achievement of a family."
895	12721	5	2	Narciso Rodriguez, in his work Home: The blueprints of our Lives, shares his feelings, traditions, and the love he had with his family during his upbringing. Narciso, his @CAPS1, and his dad are Cuban. They share Cuban traditions, are warm - hearted and welcoming to each other and others. His family is generous, sharing with everyone. They are kind to one another and lead a traditional @CAPS2 life. Throughout the memoir, Narciso emphasizes the love and meaning of family, making it a central theme.
896	12722	5	2	This memoir delves into the true meanings of selflessness and a home. At the start, it details how the author's parents, aware of life's struggles, would invite people into their home until they could stand on their own. It took at least five years for the parents to afford a reasonably sized house. Despite leaving Cuba, the parents made efforts to preserve Cuban traditions. They loved cooking and taught Narciso to do so. They also played traditional Cuban music and instilled in him the value of selflessness. They welcomed people of different races, as race was of no consequence to them. In essence, the memoir showcases how the parents' actions and traditions contributed to a rich understanding of home and selflessness.
897	12723	5	2	In my view, this memoir effectively creates a mood of love and unity. The quote “... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship” clearly indicates a close - knit, loving, and unified atmosphere. It gives me the distinct feeling that a house is not truly a home without love. The description “Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen” further enhances this sense of warmth and love. Overall, the memoir successfully conveys the power of love and unity through its vivid descriptions.
898	12724	5	2	I believe the author creates the mood in the memoir through the setting and descriptions of her childhood, including her birthplace and the reasons her parents came to the new place. The mood, which encompasses feelings like sadness, happiness, loneliness, and silence, shapes the setting of the story in terms of where, when, and the time frame. For example, “In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two - family building, in the Ironbound Section of Newark, New Jersey” sets the scene. Also, “Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative” shows the impact of the setting on the author's perception. The author is grateful for her Cuban heritage, and in this memoir, it is evident that the mood creates the setting, which in turn influences the overall narrative.
899	12725	5	2	I really loved this memoir. The author was amazing at creating a feeling of love and comfort while sharing his story. One sentence that really caught my attention was in paragraph @NUM1: “Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.” This sentence made me feel like I was in a comfortable and homely place, and it brought out a strong sense of family in the story. The feeling of love was also very prominent in paragraph @NUM2 when the author talked about his family. When he said “My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us,” it showed how the family used their love to help others. There were so many examples of love and comfort in this story, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.
900	12726	5	2	The mood of the story revolves around a family's attempt to leave their home country and embark on a new life in a foreign land. This journey of leaving behind the familiar and venturing into the unknown sets a tone that is both full of hope for a better future and tinged with the sadness of leaving home. As they face the challenges and opportunities in the new country, the mood captures the essence of their transition. In conclusion, this mood effectively portrays the family's arduous yet hopeful journey of relocation.
901	12727	5	2	"The author of this memoir crafted a mood of profound pride. This is evident as the author frequently discusses their parents' sacrifices in coming to this country. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1, it reads, ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture... To give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" One can clearly sense the pride as the author highlights how their parents essentially left everything for them. Moreover, the author mentions that their parents opened their arms to those in need, despite not being wealthy. Throughout the memoir, numerous examples are provided that strongly convey the mood of pride the author intended. In conclusion, the prideful mood is a prominent feature of this memoir, effectively expressed through the author's accounts of their parents' actions."
902	12728	5	2	The @CAPS1 infuses the @CAPS2 with a mood of happiness. He shares memories of his child that brought him joy. He speaks of the love he had for cooking with his parents and expresses that his passion for music endures to this day. He also depicts his neighborhood as a wonderful place with a close - knit community. Additionally, he explains that many of his family members were not just blood - related but included others. He further elaborates on his parents' self - sacrificing nature. Overall, the @CAPS1 wrote the @CAPS2 in a very positive and happy mood, which is evident from the various elements he described.
903	12729	5	2	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the author effectively establishes a powerful mood. The emotions contributing to this mood are passion, unity, and gratitude. The memoir is filled with passion as Narciso discusses his family's passion for their Cuban heritage and how they passed it on to him. This was a crucial factor in transforming the house into a home and is part of the mood Rodriguez aimed to convey. As stated, ""... my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... love of cooking... passionate Cuban music..."" (Rodriguez, @NUM1). A sense of unity is also palpable. The author mentions the congregation of family and friends, and how his parents and he often hosted distant relatives and shared dinners with many. He describes his community as a ""close - knit community"" (Rodriguez, @NUM2). Gratitude is another prominent emotion. The author emphasizes that his parents were integral to his life, introducing him to his culture, family, friends, and home. His gratitude is so evident that he doesn't even have to explicitly state it, as seen in the quote, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" (Rodriguez, @NUM3). In conclusion, the author successfully creates a mood rich in passion, unity, and gratitude, and these emotions are clearly manifested in the text."
904	12730	5	2	"The @CAPS1 creates a happy mood in the text. There are no negative remarks about his parents or his upbringing. His parents made great sacrifices so that he could have a better life. The atmosphere of his home also contributes to the mood. It was a warm and safe environment, as described in paragraph @NUM1: ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" It is obvious that the @CAPS1 loved his home and family, and this love is reflected in the overall happy mood of the text."
905	12731	5	2	"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a strong belief that ""family"" is not defined by blood relations. On the contrary, our neighborhood was predominantly Spanish - speaking. This experience broadened my understanding of family, showing that it can be formed through shared experiences and a sense of community. In conclusion, this environment had a significant impact on my perception of what family truly means."
906	12732	5	2	In the memoir, the author establishes a happy and family - like atmosphere. The author depicts his family as loving yet economically disadvantaged. Growing up in this happy and affectionate home, his family provided support. They prepared delicious meals and invited relatives over. This shows that regardless of wealth, one can have a tightly - knit family.
907	12733	5	2	The mood crafted by the author in the memoir can be described as happy and thankful. This is evident as the author mentions that his parents were caring and selfless, constantly helping those in need. The author has a deep affection for the Cuban culture in which he was raised and will never forget it. He emphasizes that this particular household is one that will remain etched in his memory, underscoring the strong positive emotions and sense of gratitude within the memoir.
908	12734	5	2	The author conveys a mood of extreme happiness due to his parents' decision to move to America to be close to friends and family. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, “countless extended family members came and went -- and there was always someone temporarily staying with us.” This indicates that the presence of a large and dynamic family circle contributed to the author's positive mood.
909	12735	5	2	I believe the memoir by the author evokes a combination of happy, proud, and grateful moods. The author creates a happy mood by highlighting his parents' kindness and hard - work, which brought him joy. The author also shows pride as he mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that growing up in his environment instilled a strong sense of family. His family's act of welcoming Cuban refugees to celebrate their arrival in the country further demonstrates this pride. Gratitude is another prominent mood; in paragraph @NUM2, the author states, “I will always be grateful for my parents' love and sacrifice.” Their ability to “turn a simple house into a home” (paragraph @NUM3) makes him deeply thankful. These are the moods I perceive in the memoir.
910	12736	5	2	In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir “@PERSON1 from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,” he sets a mood of love for the readers. Multiple instances in the memoir convey this mood. In paragraph two, the author describes the simple apartment he shared with his parents as a wonderful place, expressing his gratitude and love for them. The paragraph states, “and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful).” While some might not be as appreciative of simple things like cooking, Narciso's deep love for his parents makes him cherish even these small gestures. He refers to Sergio and Edelmira, the neighbors below, as surrogate grandparents, indicating his strong affection for them. In paragraph @NUM1, the mention of numerous extended family members coming and going and often staying temporarily shows a sense of family and love. Narciso's parents' willingness to let them stay reflects their love and care. In paragraph @NUM2, the author says, “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,” highlighting his profound love for his parents.

Additionally, he is grateful that his grandparents came to @LOCATION1. This overall sense of gratitude permeates the memoir, making it a touching account of the author's feelings towards his family and heritage.
912	12738	5	2	"The author of the memoir creates a particular mood. One method of mood - creation is by elaborating on how the warm life in the narrator's house was established. As stated, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This description, which explains the narrator's upbringing, contributes to the memoir's mood. Another way is by demonstrating the caring and selfless nature of the narrator's parents. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This statement imparts a light and happy mood to the memoir. A third approach is by showing the friendliness among the people. The narrator explains that ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship,"" highlighting the amicable and open interactions in the neighborhood. In conclusion, the author effectively creates a distinct mood in the memoir through these various means."
913	12739	5	2	"The author's tone in the memoir is loving. The way he depicts his Cuban heritage and culture is filled with pride in being Cuban.

Their family was happy, engaging in parties, and as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, they ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family."" Narciso enjoyed his life and looked up to his parents for their contributions. In paragraph @NUM2, Narciso's statement about never forgetting how his parents turned a simple house into a home further showcases the happiness in the memoir. In essence, the author successfully conveys a happy mood through these elements."
915	12741	5	2	"After reading the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"", I believe the author conveys a passionate, grateful, and happy mood. I think the author is passionate because he emphasizes that a home is not just a physical structure but a place where one's heart lies. The statement ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open for the many people they consider family"" shows this passion, as it requires a caring and lovable nature. The author also shows gratitude as he repeatedly thanks his parents for the sacrifices made to give him a better life in @LOCATION1. He is especially grateful for his parents transforming a three - bedroom apartment into a home. Narciso is happy to have spent his childhood in @LOCATION1 while still adhering to Cuban cultural traditions. Now a fashion designer, his experiences have clearly influenced his positive outlook. In conclusion, these three moods - passion, gratitude, and happiness - are strongly present in the story."
916	12742	5	2	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Home, the mood crafted by the author is profound. Growing up in that environment, the author developed a strong sense that ""family"" was not defined by blood relations. The actions of those around the author served as living examples, and these teachings have become the foundation of the author's life. However, it is truly impossible to fully express the gratitude for the spirit of generosity instilled at such a young age and the demonstration of the importance of family and friends. The author will always remember how the parents transformed a simple house into a warm home, and this memory will continue to influence the author's perception of family and love."
917	12743	5	2	"The author of this memoir effectively creates multiple moods. One prominent mood is love. Love is evident as @PERSON1's parents took in ten people in need of a place to stay, knowing that those individuals would reciprocate in similar circumstances. Another instance of love is when @PERSON1 states in paragraph @NUM1, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" Additionally, the memoir evokes a mood of gratitude. It achieves this by highlighting the modesty of the author's house and the parents' unwavering efforts to provide a better life for their children. This makes readers reflect on the sacrifices their own parents have made, thus enhancing the overall impact of the memoir."
918	12744	5	2	The author was born in 1961. Initially, the author felt a mix of happiness and excitement, yet also sadness as they were moving to @LOCATION1. During that time, the author's first friend was their babysitter, who lived upstairs. The author has many family members. When moving to @LOCATION1, the author's parents took in people in need of a home until they could get back on their feet. The author wants to see their grandparents, who cannot leave until 1970. The author often expresses deep gratitude to their parents for their love and sacrifice, stating that what their parents did was incredibly courageous. The author also admires their parents' strength and perseverance and has always thanked them for their actions.
919	12745	5	2	"The mood in the memoir is one of love and care. When @CAPS1 was a child growing up in @LOCATION2, their parents highly valued family and friends. They taught @CAPS1 to be helpful and welcoming. At that time in the United States, racism was common and segregation prevailed, yet their neighborhood consisted mostly of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. It was a close - knit community where everyone knew each other, and no one was a stranger. As the author states, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" Through their actions, the parents instilled in @CAPS1 the significance of family and friends, which continues to shape the values presented in the memoir."
920	12746	5	2	The @CAPS1 created by the author in the memoir is extremely essential. I firmly believe this because I am not fond of any writing that lacks @CAPS1 swings. This author does an excellent job of depicting the emotions of Narciso Rodriguez in the story. One part of the story where I particularly appreciate the @CAPS1 swing is between @CAPS2 @NUM1 and @NUM2. I like this change as it transitions from discussing a landlord and his daughter to talking about @ORGANIZATION2's parents. This creates a contrast between two different groups of people with @NUM3 different backgrounds. It shows that @PERSON1's parents were immigrants who had a difficult upbringing but wanted a better childhood for their son. In contrast, the landlord and his daughter in @LOCATION1 were wealthy and had the freedom to do as they pleased. I am truly amazed by how skillfully the author changes the moods in the memoir, which greatly enriches the reading experience.
921	12747	5	2	In the memoir “Narciso Rodriguez,” a joyful and touching atmosphere is crafted.

933	12759	5	2	In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, a loving mood pervades as he reflects on his childhood memories with his “family.” As a child living in New Jersey, Rodriguez resided in a warm and affectionate home within a loving neighborhood. He considers the neighbors and friends as family, stating that “ 'Family' had nothing to do with being blood relative.” There was always a constant stream of neighbors and friends at his place, whom he regarded as family. The neighborhood was filled with love, and he grew up surrounded by it. Naturally, he holds the deepest love for his parents. In this memoir, Rodriguez expresses his gratitude to his parents for their selfless love throughout his childhood. He looks back fondly on his wonderful childhood, living in a loving neighborhood with parents who adored him. Through this memoir, Narciso defines the true meaning of family and thanks his parents for their boundless love.
934	12760	5	2	The author creates a very strong mood in the memoir. Narciso's mood is closely related to his family, friends, and most significantly, his culture. He feels extremely happy and fortunate to have been born in the United States and to have had the opportunity to grow up there. He has a deep love for his home. He details how they transformed their New Jersey home into a traditional Cuban one. For example, he emphasizes that the kitchen is the heart of his home and is grateful for the cooking lessons his parents gave him. Regarding his friends, he treats and considers them as family. The landlord's daughter often cooked meals for him, and he had “grandparents” who were not blood - related as his real grandparents were in Cuba. These factors collectively contribute to the mood in the memoir.
935	12761	5	2	The mood in @PERSON1's memoir is characterized by happiness, love, and liveliness.

The @CAPS1 implies that having family is more valuable than money. The memoir details how Rodriguez's parents left Cuba with no money or job, yet their togetherness gave them hope. Now, they reside in a @NUM1 - room house with their family. Without family, life would be far more challenging to navigate."
937	12763	5	2	I feel that the mood of the memoir is both happy and enlightening. When someone migrates from a country plagued by poverty or unjust laws, the community, composed of Cuban, Spanish, and Italian people who left their homelands in pursuit of a better life for themselves, their families, or their children, welcomes them. This community creates an environment that is warm and inclusive. In conclusion, the memoir's mood is happy because it is an enlightening and welcoming place.
938	12764	5	2	"The author of this memoir exudes a profound sense of thankfulness and appreciation.

Rodriguez expresses his deepest gratitude to his parents ""for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM3). Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood saturated with love, care, and a sense of family."
940	12766	5	2	"In the @CAPS1 from ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives,"" @PERSON2 crafts a highly distinctive mood. I believe the mood of the @CAPS1 is warm, caring, comforting, and full of love. The author's home is family - focused, not just limited to blood relatives. During a time when ""Racism was the norm and segregation prevailed,"" his neighborhood was like a big family. When Narciso Rodriguez describes this, it sounds comforting and loving. He @CAPS2, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us,"" which gives the article a happy, light, and comforting feeling. When Rodriguez @CAPS2, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" the mood shifts to one of admiration, gratitude, and compassion.

942	12768	5	2	The story has a very happy mood as the author reflects on the good times of his upbringing. He reminisces about the great life he had in the house. His parents, who were immigrants, came to this place and built a life for themselves and then for him. Another factor contributing to the happy mood is his mention of his family's arrival at @LOCATION1. He talks about how his parents taught him to cook. He expresses gratitude to his parents for creating a family rather than just a home, which sums up the essence of the happy mood in the story.
943	12769	5	2	"A constant mood of happiness permeates the memoir. At the beginning, @PERSON1 describes his home, from its inception to its transformation into a wonderful ""home"". He notes the presence of ""passionate Cuban music"" and ""amazing cooking aromas"". In paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 states that ""he loves his parents for their love and sacrifice"" and further expresses his gratitude towards them. In paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". These instances clearly convey the happy mood that runs through the memoir."
944	12770	5	2	"The author of the memoir creates multiple moods within the text. The first mood is one of caring. In paragraph @NUM1, it reads, ""Countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This passage shows caring as the family welcomed those in need without hesitation. The next mood is gratitude. In paragraph @NUM2, the author says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This directly shows his gratitude and the reason behind it. These are the moods effectively created in the memoir."
945	12771	5	2	"In my opinion, the author is very at ease with his words and his way of being human. His parents are originally from Cuba, and they embraced their culture and were kind to those around them. For example, @CAPS2 says, ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to the country and where I celebrated my first birthday."" This indicates that the author's family, influenced by their Cuban heritage, had a warm and inclusive nature, which is reflected in the author's comfortable and positive expression in the text."
946	12772	5	2	In this memoir, the author crafts a distinct mood. He instills a sense of @CAPS1 and praise for his parents. Despite attempting to articulate his @CAPS1 for his parents verbally, the multitude of wonderful moments renders it inexpressible. He creates a mood of everlasting happiness that lingers in his memories and in the kitchen.
947	12773	5	2	"I believe the story exudes a warm and loving mood. Narciso's parents, though they never had a large home in the United States, transformed a small house into a true home. In a @NUM1 - bedroom, two - family house in @LOCATION1, they established a traditional Cuban home. There was a great deal of cooking in the house, and the family was always around, which must have been a joy. All of this was accompanied by the soothing backdrop of Cuban music. ""@CAPS1 filled the air, mingling with the enticing aromas of the kitchen. Narciso truly makes his home seem like a haven of love."
948	12774	5	2	"The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in the story experiences a happy state. This is due to the fact that he was able to move to the @LOCATION1 and be born there for a better life. Additionally, he cherished growing up there with Cuban traditions and music, as indicated in paragraph @NUM1 where he states, ""And for what I am eternally grateful,"" a sentiment he still holds dear to this day."
949	12775	5	2	In this memoir, Narciso established a peaceful mood. He mentioned the music playing and the family members who dined with them, and also talked about the cooking. I believe the mood is peaceful because he only speaks positively of his parents and never mentions anything negative. The mood could also be one of gratitude as he is thankful for numerous things his parents did for him, such as passing down their love for cooking. He is also grateful that his parents left Cuba and started @CAPS1 everything anew @CAPS2 so that he could have a good job and a fulfilling life. Another possible mood is warmth, as Narciso clearly loved his family and likely felt the comforting warmth when they all gathered at his house.
950	12776	5	2	"The mood established by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is one of gratitude towards his parents. In the memoir, the @CAPS1 expresses his thanks to his parents for the way they raised him. In the article, he conveys his gratitude through statements like ""my admiration"", ""my gratitude"", and ""generosity"". These statements are genuine and accurately reflect his mood towards his family. In conclusion, while the mood encompasses various elements, I choose gratitude as it most accurately captures how he feels about his family."
951	12777	5	2	Narciso was extremely proud of being a Cuban immigrant. He deeply appreciated the great sacrifices his parents had made for him. He came to understand, as stated in paragraph @NUM1, that family was not merely defined by blood relations. In a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation was prevalent in the United @ORGANIZATION1, all cultures came together in remarkable solidarity and friendship. He learned the true essence of family. His parents transformed an ordinary house into a beloved home. He was eternally grateful for the numerous sacrifices his parents made, which turned into a lifetime experience he would never forget. He was thrilled that even the smallest things created wonderful memories, and he couldn't wait to share them with the world.

Happiness is present as Narciso is grateful for his parents, stating “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.” @CAPS1 is also a mood, as the neighborhood's residents get along well, as shown by “In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.” Overall, these moods contribute to the memoir's warm and inclusive atmosphere.
957	12783	5	2	The memoir creates an exciting mood due to the author's fondness for fashion design and his story - centered on clothing design.

However, sadness creeps in as he was born in a simple house and yearned for a place he could truly call home. In essence, the memoir's mood is a complex blend of these emotions.

His parents often invited neighbors and relatives to dine with them.

963	12789	5	2	In this story, the mood is influenced by the experience of moving, which can be a challenging transition for some, while for others, it represents an opportunity. Most people dislike leaving behind their community, work, and friends. However, for some, moving offers a chance to meet new people, secure a better job, or pursue a better education. It's understandable that moving from Cuba to the United States is a significant step, as it's not just a short - distance move. The protagonist made a friend, and his parents love him deeply. They always have food on the table, ensuring they don't go hungry. Although moving to the United States meant a step down in terms of job quality, the story is filled with a loving mood among the family and their friends.

But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and those teachings have been the base of my life."" In my opinion, these words clearly show that the author's mood in the story is one of deep thankfulness and gratitude."

1006	12832	5	2	Narciso held deep gratitude towards his parents. Their family life encompassed love, happiness, and moments of depression, perhaps more. The author's memoir was both sorrowful and filled with love. In 1961, Narciso was born in a simple house. Within its walls, his young parents crafted a traditional Cuban home. He adored how they transformed the simple dwelling into a place rich with Cuban traditions. Moreover, he appreciated their way of creating a warm and inviting home environment. His parents had shown great courage in coming to this country. Like many immigrants, they selflessly came to provide a better life for their children. Narciso was so thankful that he expressed his gratitude to his parents daily for the love they had created. It was in this simple house that his parents celebrated his first birthday.

1008	12834	5	2	"In the memoir penned by fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, his writing about his childhood home conveys a distinct tone. Many immigrants from a less - prosperous country like Cuba often face financial difficulties in a new land. As Narciso states in the bottom of paragraph @NUM1, ""In the United States, [my parents] had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find."" Instead of dwelling on the hardships, Narciso emphasizes the wonderful cultural environment in which he was raised. When he refers to ""family,"" he doesn't just mean his biological relatives but all those with whom he spent time and shared a deep bond. Thus, the mood of this memoir is warm, grateful, and happy.

This act of self - sacrifice from his parents filled the author with joy and a sense of gratitude. The author's mood reflects the deep appreciation for the opportunities and the new beginning his parents made possible for him.
1011	12837	5	2	Throughout the memoir, the mood undergoes significant shifts. Initially, Narciso was uncertain about moving to @LOCATION1 as it was vastly different from what he was accustomed to. However, this sentiment changed when family gatherings began and they used their imagination to decorate their house. In the middle of the memoir, the mood shifted again as they realized that a fulfilling life could be had in @LOCATION1, just as it could anywhere else. Moreover, having their family with them in @LOCATION1 enhanced their positive mood. Finally, while the family's mood was negative when they had to move to @LOCATION1, it immediately changed once they transformed their house into a home, and they were content in @LOCATION2. This is the mood crafted by the author in the memoir.
1012	12838	5	2	"In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez establishes a very particular mood. He delves into themes of family, love, and home. For instance, Narciso states that the heart of his home was the kitchen, where passionate Cuban music constantly played. Regarding his neighborhood, Narciso mentions that ""cultures came together,"" and his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" It's evident how significant friends and family are to Narciso and his family, and how welcoming and caring they are. Narciso believes that his home was filled with ""not just scent and music, but life and love."" I'm certain that the mood of his house was not only palpable to Narciso but also to his neighbors and family."
1013	12839	5	2	"Narciso Rodriguez maintains a calm and grateful mood throughout his memoir. He first depicts the self - sacrifice of his parents. Narciso explains that ""they had to start their lives over entirely"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) when they left Cuba for the United States. He comprehends that they made this move for his benefit and is appreciative of it. Additionally, Narciso is thankful that despite moving to the United States, his parents retained their Cuban traditions. In his three - room apartment, ""Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). Finally, Narciso expresses his gratitude and reinforces the mood by defining what a home is. He claims that he ""will never forget how [his] parents turned the simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). Due to these factors, Narciso is grateful, and his appreciation generates a calm, inviting, and grateful mood."
1014	12840	5	2	"The author weaves a warm and loving mood throughout the memoir. The quote ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends,... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) evokes a warm mood as it mentions things the author loves, like Cuban music, and how friendship and family shaped his childhood. The quote ""It was a close - knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"" represents a loving mood. Similar to the first quote, it showcases friendship and family, as well as the love and care among all members of his childhood community, indicating that they all look out for one another. Near the end, the mood evolves; it becomes not only full of love and warmth but also happiness. The statement ""It was a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) shows happiness because even though they were poor upon arriving in @LOCATION1, they were still celebrating the possibilities ahead."
1015	12841	5	2	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, a distinct mood centered around family and caring is established. One way this mood is set is through the passionate Cuban music and home - cooked meals. Rodriguez writes, ""passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (p. @NUM1). This quote emphasizes the family mood as the music and food of their nationality bring a sense of comfort, which is associated with family. Another factor contributing to the family mood is the size of the house. Rodriguez states, ""... I was born in this simple house situated in a two - family, blonde - brick building..."" (p. @NUM2). Living in a small house implies that more time is spent with family, adding a cozy touch to the environment. Lastly, the proximity of their family members also contributes to the mood. Rodriguez writes, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria and Rosemary also live nearby"" (p. @NUM2). Having family nearby increases the sense of family, thus strengthening the overall mood. Based on this memoir, a strong mood of family is clearly expressed."
1016	12842	5	2	"The author establishes a happy mood in the memoir. Her statement that growing up in that environment gave her a strong sense that ""family"" was not defined by blood relations indicates her contentment with her life. She has a wonderful family, good friends, and a pleasant home, all of which contribute to her happiness. In conclusion, the author's portrayal of her life experiences effectively conveys the overall happy mood of the memoir."
1017	12843	5	2	In my opinion, the author of this memoir creates a very calm mood. The article lacks excitement as it simply explains the child's life. It feels like a compilation of items turned into a full - fledged paper, and the author fails to generate a mood that captivates me to continue reading. However, the memoir does express a great deal of feelings. It shows the child's gratitude for his parents and Cuban descent. Despite the calm and somewhat boring mood, the author's ability to disclose information is profound and insightful. Overall, while the mood may not be engaging, the depth of information presented has its merits.
1018	12844	5	2	"One mood presented in this memoir is that of a traditional Cuban home. As described in paragraph @NUM1, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban Music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" Another mood is that of a Cuban family facing hardships. In paragraph @NUM2, it states, ""They Struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" The last mood gives an impression of what a real family means: love, loyalty, and friendship. Paragraph @NUM3 says, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" In conclusion, these different moods collectively contribute to the rich and multi - faceted nature of the memoir."
1019	12845	5	2	I find the mood created by the author in the memoir to be quite touching, as it feels like a memory - filled story. The story makes you think about how to cherish memories and might even bring a little tear to your eye. I kind of like it because it's about Cuban people. I think my father knows people from Cuba and is familiar with their culture. In conclusion, the combination of the touching mood and the Cuban - related theme makes this memoir somewhat appealing to me.
1020	12846	5	2	"The mood of the memoir is happy. Narciso Rodriguez describes the joyous and enjoyable times of living in a small home in New Jersey. His family, composed of his mother and father, transformed their simple house into a Cuban home and welcomed other refugees going through tough times. In the last part, Narciso explains that it was the place where all his first birthdays took place and where friends and family would gather. The message the memoir conveys is that the size or cost of a home is unimportant; it's the people within that make it special. I know the mood was happy because Narciso had amazing people in his life. His home was not large or luxurious, as mentioned in @CAPS4 @NUM1, ""It was a simple house that my parents opened to other refugees."" This shows that his home was brimming with happiness and love. Narciso's once - simple house became a warm home filled with friends and family. In conclusion, the memoir successfully showcases the power of love and community in creating a happy home."
1021	12847	5	2	In the memoir, the author conveys a profound love for family.

Rodriguez's parents' act of welcoming many people, including refugees from outside America, into their home is truly inspiring as it vividly demonstrates the family's love and warmth. This portrayal of family in the memoir is a testament to the power of love that transcends blood ties.

1093	12919	5	2	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author conveys a mood with several distinct traits. Selflessness and courage are evident in paragraph @NUM1, where the author states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" This raises the question of whether one could sacrifice their own life in an unfamiliar world for their children's future, highlighting the high level of selflessness and courage required. Gratefulness is another trait of the mood. In paragraph @NUM2, the author says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" demonstrating his gratitude for his parents' selfless act of coming to @LOCATION2 to secure a better future for him. Unity is also a part of the mood. Paragraph @NUM3 mentions, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures come together in great solidarity and friendship.

Due to the author's positive outlook and optimism, the memoir has an upbeat tone."
1095	12921	5	2	The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir has some flaws. Initially, it struggles to fully develop the character. The pacing is inconsistent; it goes slow, then fast, and then slow again. The writer seems unable to maintain a consistent writing rhythm, which results in a mood that makes the reader feel like they have to think fast one moment and then think hard the next. To avoid losing readers, the writer should maintain a single speed. This story could have been excellent, but the inconsistent pacing was a major drawback. As a reader, I (@CAPS2) understand that I may not be the best writer, but I am an avid reader. I believe that if the writer, regardless of gender, had taken more time to describe the story, it would have been different. In the first @NUM1 minutes, I thought it was just like any other story - boring and rushed. I almost stopped reading right away. Writers need to be careful about their writing style and the pacing of their stories. They don't know what readers want, but readers do. A better approach to writing and story - selection is needed.
1096	12922	5	2	The memoir evokes a happy and loving mood. When the family had their house, both relatives and strangers were welcomed. The author's parents were extremely loving, always kind to others and rarely engaging in arguments. The family's enthusiasm and happiness stemmed from being together. This sense of togetherness and warmth pervaded the memoir, creating a truly endearing atmosphere.
1097	12923	5	2	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, it explores how one's childhood home can have an impact both during childhood and adulthood. To me, the mood of this memoir is comforting. I believe this because the memoir mentions that the author had numerous relatives and friends around, which likely made him feel at ease. Additionally, his parents were very welcoming and kind, which would also contribute to a sense of comfort. In conclusion, this is why I think the mood of the memoir is comforting.
1098	12924	5	2	"In the memoir, the author crafted a mood that reflects close - knit relationships. The closeness is evident throughout. In one part, it states, ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship,"" showing that the author bestowed happiness and friendship upon the cultures they co - existed with. The author also described their amicable relationship with neighbors. As written, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The author believes that when families consider each other as part of their own, the reciprocation follows. The author also expresses his unwavering memory of his family, writing, ""I will never forget that home or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love."" Overall, the author successfully created a mood of close relationships in the memoir."
1099	12925	5	2	"The author of the memoir created a mood that showcases the happiness of Narciso Rodriguez's childhood.

This warm mood tells us that Narciso had a wonderful childhood filled with love and a broad - minded sense of family."
1100	12926	5	2	"Although there are multiple moods in the memoir, one stands out as the main one. The author aims to create a ""no place like home"" mood and achieves this effectively. It appears that the author is drawing on memories to share their background. The story also has a calm and relaxing mood. In conclusion, this is the predominant mood that the author conveys through the memoir."
1101	12927	5	2	"In an excerpt from Narciso Rodriguez's ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", a specific mood is set. I believe it is a combination of love and something represented by @CAPS1. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1, it states, ""I was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my birthdays."" This shows that the author is trying to convey a warm and inclusive atmosphere through these events."
1102	12928	5	2	In my opinion, the author of the memoir creates a mood that is serious, informative, and uplifting. The description of his lifestyle presents a happy and enjoyable life, while also addressing serious topics such as his culture and the cultural diversity of the people on the street. Moreover, his comfort with the people in his apartment building and those who come to his house for dinner, considering them as family, further contributes to this mood. Overall, these elements combine to create a well - rounded and positive mood in the memoir.
1103	12929	5	2	"I think the author, Narciso Rodriguez, effectively creates a warm, happy, and welcoming feeling in the memoir. By describing the constant visits of friends and family and the perpetual happiness of the family, and never mentioning any bad times, he portrays everyone as kind.

This mood makes the memoir a pleasant read, evoking positive emotions in the readers."
1104	12930	5	2	"@PERSON1's parents emigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1. They were not wealthy, and racial barriers hindered them from getting good jobs. However, as @PERSON1 explains in the memoir, they made great sacrifices so that @CAPS1 could have a better life. They also extended help to their neighbors and family. Rodriguez often writes about how they were always open - armed and open - door to those they considered family. @CAPS1 emphasizes a mood of ""good @CAPS2"" and neighborly love, where they treated everyone as family. This mood shows that even in a life that may not have much going for it materially, one can still find goodness."
1105	12931	5	2	In my view, the author creates a mood in the @CAPS1 that is both loving and @CAPS2. This mood is evident as the author mentions the love filling his home and his gratitude for his parents' sacrifices. In his community of hard - working immigrants, there was great solidarity and friendship. His parents came to the country with courage, despite lacking knowledge of the language and culture, and the author is eternally grateful for this. His home was always full of life and love. The author claims he will never forget the house, its neighborhood, and the lessons about love he learned there. His parents' ability to turn a simple house into a home is truly remarkable and will always be etched in his memory, which further solidifies the loving and @CAPS2 mood of the story.
1106	12932	5	2	The memoir evokes a somewhat sad mood. The reason for this bittersweet sentiment is that the individuals arrived in this country with nothing. They had to reside in a @NUM1 - bedroom apartment. Nevertheless, they managed to earn money and achieved a better living standard. This shows that despite the initial hardships, they were able to make progress.
1107	12933	5	2	The overall mood seems to be a mix of happiness and sadness, with a greater inclination towards happiness. The source of sadness was that they had to leave everything behind in Cuba. However, the presence of happiness in the mix indicates that there were also positive aspects to their situation. This blend of emotions reflects the complexity of their experience.
1108	12934	5	2	The mood in the passage is @CAPS1. It is @CAPS2 as they can offer their child a better life. Additionally, Cuba is not considered a favorable place to be. They are @CAPS2 because they have the opportunity to start a new life. Moreover, they can obtain better jobs here. They get to live in a @CAPS3 house compared to @CAPS4. They are also @CAPS2 so they can assist other refugees. Finally, they are @CAPS2 for other refugees and celebrate their arrival in the country. All these factors contribute to the @CAPS2 mood in the passage.
1109	12935	5	2	"Based on Narciso Rodriguez's memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood can be characterized in multiple ways. The author creates a @CAPS2 mood in the memoir. This is evident as in paragraph @NUM1, it states ""... and for which I am eternally grateful"" and ""which I adore to this day"". These statements convey a @CAPS2 mood, as if one were to utter such words, it would denote a @CAPS2 sentiment, and there is no indication that @CAPS1 disliked it. Additionally, @CAPS1 would always tell his parents, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" and also expressed admiration for their strength and perseverance. Therefore, due to these two reasons, the mood of the memoir is @CAPS2 as created by the author."
1110	12936	5	2	"There are numerous ways to describe the mood of the memoir. One description is that it makes one feel good about things. This can be inferred from paragraph @NUM1, which states, ""I will always be grateful for my parents' love and sacrifice"". The memoir sets a warm mood for @CAPS1. This is supported by paragraph @NUM2, which mentions that his houses were where he learned the true meaning of family. In conclusion, there are indeed many ways to depict the mood of the memoir."
1111	12937	5	2	In 1961, Narciso was born into a traditional Cuban home. The kitchen was the heart of this home, filled with the love of his parents, who were passionate about cooking and are still with him today, for which he is eternally grateful. He also has a deep - seated passion for music. His neighborhood mainly consisted of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants like his family. His parents came to this country courageously, without knowledge of the language or culture. Selflessly, like many immigrants, they left behind their families, friends, and careers in their beloved homeland to give their children a better life. They endured personal and financial struggles, braved the harsh Northern winters while longing for their native tropics and faced cultural hardships. Narciso takes pride in his Cuban heritage and his family's success, and his mood reflects many positive aspects related to his family.
1112	12938	5	2	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author establishes a calm and loving mood.

It also reflects a loving mood as it expresses the author's love for their family and pride in calling them family. Overall, these pieces of evidence set the memoir's mood as loving and caring."
1113	12939	5	2	In the memoir, the author creates a mood that implies one should share it with others, even if they are initially reluctant. This mood within the memoir seems to convey the idea that sharing, regardless of one's initial feelings, is an inherent part of the experience. In conclusion, the mood established by the author encourages the act of sharing, whether one wants to or not.

In conclusion, the author effectively conveys a grateful mood through this statement."
1115	12941	5	2	"The memoir has a warm, happy, and inviting mood. There are several reasons for this. In paragraph @NUM1, Rodriguez describes how the people in his neighborhood were good friends and always ready to help those in need. Paragraph @NUM2 further elaborates on this, telling us that many of Rodriguez's neighbors, friends, and relatives regularly joined him and his family for dinner. His parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" In paragraph @NUM4, Rodriguez mentions that his parents selflessly came to the @CAPS1.S.A to give him a better life, sacrificing everything they had so that he could have more than they did. This clearly demonstrates the deep - seated care his parents had for him. In conclusion, these instances are the reasons why the memoir has a warm, happy, and inviting mood, which is also heart - warming."
1116	12942	5	2	I believe the author was in a serious mood.
1117	12943	5	2	"The author of this memoir conveys a mood of gratitude. The author deeply appreciates the sacrifices made by their parents. For instance, the parents emigrated from Cuba to the United States without prior knowledge of the country's customs or language. They left behind their careers, families, and friends to ensure a better life for their child. Additionally, the parents allowed others to stay in their home to help them get back on their feet. In paragraph six, the author explicitly expresses their gratitude, stating, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""

Stressing this warmth leads to the creation of memories. The other aspect of the mood, safety, means being surrounded by caring people, free from judgment, harm, and any form of danger. Personally, I am fond of this story's mood as it is something I yearn for each @DATE1 down the cape. In summary, the mood of the memoir is unmistakably defined.
1120	12946	5	2	"In the short story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood is characterized by gratitude and reasonableness. The story features a 27 - year - old man named Narciso Rodriguez who, in 1956, migrated from Cuba to the United States with his parents. Upon arrival, they could only afford to live in a one - bedroom apartment. Despite having limited job opportunities with higher pay and thus earning meager incomes to support the family, Narciso remained grateful.

Overall, the mood of the story is shaped by Narciso's gratitude in the face of difficult circumstances."

1123	12949	5	2	"The mood crafted by the author in the memoir is one of love and sacrifice.

1124	12950	5	2	The mood created by the author in @CAPS3 is evident. In @CAPS4 @NUM1, it is stated that the author's mother and father came to this country with great courage. Lacking knowledge of the language or the culture, they, like many immigrants, selflessly made the journey to provide their children with a better life. This entailed leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they held dear. Their sacrifice and determination contribute to the overall mood established by the author in @CAPS3.

1132	12958	5	2	"Narciso Rodriguez establishes a positive and upbeat mood in his memoir. He and his parents endured tough times in their New Jersey home, including the segregation faced by @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 individuals like him and financial instability. Nevertheless, their survival was due to the unity of their close - knit community. Immigrants from @ORGANIZATION2, the @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4, and other places came together, disregarding their differences. They shared food, homes, and happiness. There was a strong sense of trust in the community, as described by the statement, ""every family holding their door open for anybody, knowing that they would do the same for [them]"" (paragraph @NUM1). To enhance the light and cheerful mood of the excerpt, Rodriguez uses words such as ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking"" (∂ @NUM2), ""innocence of childhood"" (∂ @NUM2), ""hard working"" (∂ @NUM4), ""courage,"" and ""selflessly"" (∂ @NUM5), ""grateful... love and sacrifice,"" ""admiration for their strength and perseverance,"" ""spirit of generosity"" (∂ @NUM6).

Another statement that proves his grateful mood is, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""

1136	12962	5	2	He establishes a serene and inviting atmosphere for the @CAPS1 he constructs. The reader can sense, smell, and hear the Cuban and Spanish influences surrounding him in his home. The interior of his home exudes a warm and bright ambiance. The soothing and vibrant Hispanic vibe permeating the @CAPS1 imparts a wonderful feeling to the reader, creating an immersive and pleasant experience.
1137	12963	5	2	In the reading “Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives” by Narciso Rodriguez, a particular mood is set throughout. This mood is one of happiness and friendliness. The individuals in the story based their lives on family and the pursuit of happiness within their home. Rodriguez mentioned that “My parents always kept their arms and their doors open,” which indicates that they were there to assist family or friends in need. It was also stated that family members need not be blood - related, and many people were welcome to have dinner with them. This demonstrates the amicable nature of the neighborhood and how well the residents got along. They surrounded themselves with Cuban food and music, showing their pride in their identity and creating a pleasant and peaceful environment in their new home. Overall, the reading paints a picture of a warm and inclusive family life.
1138	12964	5	2	The author discusses home and family, evoking a calm, caring, and happy mood. This mood is created through the recollection of memories, such as how the author's parents migrated from Cuba to provide a better life for their child. They also took in family members in need until they could stand on their own. The author noted that both parents shared cooking duties, unconsciously passing on their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking that still persists. The air was filled with passionate Cuban music, blending with the kitchen aromas, creating a happy atmosphere. The author described, “Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,” clearly establishing a calm and happy mood that reflects the idyllic family life.
1139	12965	5	2	In the memoir “Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The @CAPS1 prints of Our Lives,” the mood is extremely happy and makes me feel thankful. My grandparents moved to the @CAPS2.S when my mother was just six years old. Their intention was to offer a better life to her and her siblings, which is the reason for my gratitude. I reside in the @LOCATION1. The mood is also happy because there was a strong sense of love among everyone. Although their home was not the most luxurious, it was filled with love. Music was constantly playing, and family members frequently visited. The door of the Rodriguez house was always open. The final sentence of the memoir, “I will never Forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,” is so beautiful that it makes me smile. This is how the memoir creates a happy mood and fills me with thankfulness. I've decided that the next time I see my grandparents, I'll make sure to thank them for moving to the @CAPS2.S and giving our family a better life.
1140	12966	5	2	I believe that at the start of the story, the mood is set by the Cuban music and the wonderful aromas from @CAPS1's @CAPS2 wafting through the air. It also paints a picture of laughter and happiness. Throughout the story, @CAPS3 realizes, through interactions with the community, that his parents are teaching him an important lesson. As stated in the text, just because someone isn't blood - related doesn't mean they can't be like family. They are teaching him that family also consists of those who love and care for you. As @CAPS3 progresses through the passage, it is revealed that his family is always ready to take care of those they love and who are in need. Eventually, @CAPS3 comes to understand that everything his family gave up from their old lives was to provide him with a nice home and to teach him the true meaning of family, a valuable life lesson.
1141	12967	5	2	In the memoir, the author sets the mood by recounting how his parents lived in a very poor house at that time. His parents immigrated to @LOCATION1, where Narciso was born and raised in the ghetto. His upbringing took place during the era of racism and segregation. Narciso didn't get to know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were permitted to leave Cuba. This is how the author crafted the mood in the memoir.
1142	12968	5	2	"The author creates a warm, grateful, and palpable mood in the memoir. A prominent mood is the author's deep - seated love for his family. His ""family"" encompassed not only blood relatives but also the immigrant neighbors. He states, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" Clearly, the author strongly values the positive relationships his family had with other immigrants. His tone is warm and compassionate as he emphasizes the importance of each community member to him. Another mood is gratitude and admiration for his parents. In paragraph @NUM1, he expresses his eternal gratitude for their sacrifices and hard work and mentions repeatedly telling them of his admiration for their strength and courage. Yet, he feels it's insufficient, saying, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This quote reflects thankfulness and a touch of frustration at his inability to fully convey his gratitude to his parents."
1143	12969	5	2	The mood is one of gratitude. In Cuba, with its central government, people had to sneak in. @CAPS2 is grateful for what his parents did to give him a better life. I can relate; my parents took a plane to @LOCATION1, and we only had a @DATE1 - long stay but overstayed. Initially, we had nothing and no documents. As the years went by, we managed to get documents and finally the coveted green card. So, @CAPS2 is very grateful and holds his parents in high regard for what they've done.
1144	12970	5	2	"The memoir Narciso Rodriguez by himself from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives delves into the life of this fashion designer. In paragraph @NUM1 on page @NUM2, it details his background. Narciso states, ""My parent, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956..."" The paragraph further elaborates on his parents and their names. Next, in paragraph @NUM3 on page @NUM2, it sets the mood of his growth in a new environment. He says, ""Growing up in this new instilled in me a great 'Family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States."" @CAPS1 on page @NUM5 paragraph @NUM6 shows his love for his house. He remarks, ""... I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" In conclusion, these elements are how the author creates the mood in the memoir."
1145	12971	5	2	The author weaves multiple moods throughout the story. As I read, I experienced a mix of happiness, occasional sadness, and an overall sense of well - being. The author aims to convey happiness and unity. Despite the diverse cultures and ethnic backgrounds in the neighborhood, everyone came together as one. At times, I felt sad because the story is set in a time when racism still pervaded America.

1153	12979	5	2	The author portrays a mood of coziness and family in the memoir.

They transformed a small apartment into a happy and comforting place where people from different places would gather for happy reunions. The simple act of staying together brought people closer. This is the environment in which Narciso grew up, and he was both lucky and grateful for it.
1154	12980	5	2	"The mood of gratitude pervades the author's memoir. First, the author expresses gratitude by praising her parents.

1162	12988	5	2	After reading the memoir, I believe the author created two main moods: happiness and sadness. The author exudes happiness when speaking about being Cuban or his family. There's a clear sense of joy and pride in his voice. He also describes the Spanish, Italian, and Cuban communities as being like a family, further emphasizing this happy mood. However, there's a tinge of sadness. When he talks about not being able to see his real grandparents until 1970, he sounds a bit depressed. Despite this moment of sadness, I feel that for the rest of the memoir, the author comes across as a very happy man. Overall, these are the moods I think the author successfully created in the memoir.
1163	12989	5	2	"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" evokes a mood of happiness and warmth, which is manifested in multiple ways.

The dominant moods in the memoir are love, selflessness, and gratefulness. Love is evident as described in a paragraph where Rodriguez remembers, ""countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us"". This shows that despite not being blood - related, they regarded each other as family and cared deeply for one another. Selflessness is demonstrated by the fact that Rodriguez's parents moved to give their children a better life.

In my opinion, the author's choice of this mood for the story is perfect as it truly captures the essence of Narciso's feelings towards his parents.
1175	13001	5	2	I believe that @CAPS1 experiences a mix of emotions in the memoir. In some parts, @CAPS1 is happy, while in others, there is a sense of sadness.

Lastly, his parents' care and the values they instilled in him are a major reason for his gratefulness.

His financial situation was poor, and he lived in an apartment. His life was somewhat below the average standard of today. As the memoir progressed to the middle, the mood remained serious yet became happier to some extent. This was because he had more life opportunities in @LOCATION1.

For instance, ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refuges to celebrate their arrival to this country, and where I celebrated my first birthdays,"" and it is also shown by the frequent family gatherings at the dinner table. However, the most prominent mood is the author's profound gratitude towards his parents, as seen in remarks such as ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" and ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.""

His traditional nature was evident as he would listen to Cuban music that mingled with the kitchen aromas (@CAPS1 @NUM3), and he would host Cuban feasts that brought life and love (@CAPS1 @NUM4). His first friend was his babysitter, who lived above him and often graced his kitchen with prepared meals. His life was successful as his traits were reflective of the values within his community.

In conclusion, the memoir combines a mix of remorse, warmth, and appreciation for the sacrifices made to create a loving home environment.

It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival in this country, and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warm kitchen of this humble house that a Cuban feast always filled the air, not only with scents and music but also with life and love. It was there that I learned the true meaning of family. I will never forget that house, its kind - hearted neighborhood, or the many lessons about love I learned there.

1267	13093	5	2	In the excerpt “Narciso Rodriguez” from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author aims to create a mood that aligns with his view on the definition of family. Narciso Rodriguez, born to Cuban immigrants in a diverse area of New Jersey, was shaped by the multicultural environment and his parents' hard work. The passage maintains a positive mood, evident in the author's positive remarks about his parents' influence. Narciso acknowledges the sacrifices and hard work his parents endured, writing, “My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.” His parents' self - less decision to move to the United States led to a successful establishment in the new land through their hard work, determination, and courage. This positive outcome contributes to the bright and positive mood. In his home, as he describes, “the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home.” The use of “warm” and its repetition later in the passage, such as “It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent but life and love,” reinforce the positive mood. Despite living in a neighborhood with diverse people and facing overt racism at the time, the community came together in solidarity and friendship, as the author writes, “Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.” This unity within the community also elicits a happy mood in the reader. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very positive mood throughout the memoir.
1268	13094	5	2	The author of the memoir created a complex mood that is intense, strange, a blend of happiness and sadness. There is happiness because the simple house was transformed into a home. Sadness stems from the difficulty of leaving something behind. The intensity arises from the challenge of moving on. The author shows strength by being able to leave that behind despite the hardship. This multi - faceted mood enriches the memoir and gives it a depth that resonates with the reader.
1269	13095	5	2	The author of the memoir creates a highly enticing mood. Once you read one sentence, you're immediately drawn to read more.

This can be discerned from three key instances in the text. Firstly, when the article stated, “there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family,” it demonstrated Narciso's happiness at his parents' kindness and caring nature. Secondly, the statement “I learned the real definition of ‘family’. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood” indicated his contentment at discovering a deeper meaning of family during his stay at the house. Lastly, the mention “my mother and father had come to the country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture, they came selflessly” revealed his joy that his parents had successfully navigated a major life - change.

Overall, these elements combined to create the described mood.
1277	13103	5	2	"The memoir's mood is characterized by kindness and love. In paragraph @NUM1, kindness is evident as the memoir depicts how the author's parents made the entire house exude a sweet and pleasant atmosphere. The author used words such as ""innocence"", ""celebrations"", and ""warm home"" to convey this sense of kindness.

1343	13169	5	2	In the memoir “Narciso Rodriguez: The Blueprints of Our Lives,” the author sets a mood of family and love. @PERSON1, a boy, lived with his parents in a three - room apartment.

Many non - blood relatives lived at the Rodriguez house, like the landlord and his daughter upstairs and the grandparents in the basement. People with economic problems were welcome to stay, and the Rodriguez family let them until they got back on their feet. As @PERSON1 said, “My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us” (@NUM3).

All these elements contribute to the loving and peaceful mood that the author successfully creates.
1351	13177	5	2	In “Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives” by @PERSON1, the author establishes a mood of acceptance. @PERSON2 shares his upbringing in a neighborhood filled with immigrants.

The author crafts a subtle yet happy memory within the passage. The mood is both subtle and happy because the passage contains both serious and happy segments. In paragraph four, Narciso remembers that many of his family members lived near his family's house. When @CAPS1 says, “Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table,” @CAPS1 is referring to the supper table. The mood turns subtle when @CAPS2 expresses gratitude towards his parents for coming to @CAPS3 as immigrants without any working knowledge of @CAPS4 language or writing. @CAPS1 also states in paragraph five, “to give their children a better life.” These are excellent details that explain the mood Narciso aims to convey in this passage.
1353	13179	5	2	I firmly believe that the mood the author creates is one of love, happiness, and respect. The author deeply admired and cared for his parents. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, he remembers, “My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came here selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.” Another aspect of the mood is that they brought their Cuban styles and culture to @LOCATION1 and lived in a simple house. Determination also plays a significant role. The author's parents were determined to provide a better life for their kids. Since mood is the overall atmosphere in the story, I think it's a blend of happiness, unity, caring, and determination.
1354	13180	5	2	In the memoir “Narciso Rodriguez” by Narciso @CAPS1 from Home: The BluePrints Of Our Lives, the author creates a mood that is @CAPS2 yet happy and loving simultaneously.

On the other hand, he creates a happy and loving mood when he mentions that people from all over, “Made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants,” would come to this one city, unite, and help one another. They considered each other one big family, which epitomizes happiness and love. These are the moods that Narciso Rodriguez creates in the memoir.
1355	13181	5	2	The author of this memoir creates a mood of deep gratitude, and the concept of “family” is shown to have nothing to do with blood relations (paragraph @NUM1). Moreover, his gratitude towards his family is evident in paragraph @NUM2, where it says, “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.

He is fully aware of the numerous sacrifices his parents made for him and the depth of their love.
1356	13182	5	2	"The author infused the memoir with a @CAPS1 and cultural atmosphere. He discusses the music and food of his childhood, as well as his extended ""family."" This extended family always had someone staying in the house until they could regain stability.

1504	13330	5	2	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso established several relatable moods that also prompt reflection. One of the moods is happiness. From start to finish, the reading exudes a happy atmosphere as it details Narciso's life and his fondness for his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1, it states, ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwillingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate Cuban music filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" These statements illustrate his love for his living environment and the elements within his home, which brought him happiness. Narciso also created a mysterious mood that makes readers contemplate their own homes and the true meaning of the word 'family'. His family was a large, loving group, many of whom were not blood - related. Paragraph @NUM2 says, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This shows their broad and inspiring concept of family. The primary mood in this memoir is gratefulness. Narciso is thankful for numerous things, especially the ability to live his life as he did. He is particularly grateful to his parents, as paragraph @NUM3 states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In conclusion, gratefulness is the main mood because he appreciates everyone and everything that contributed to his well - being and shaped him into who he is today."
1505	13331	5	2	"Narciso Rodriguez's memoir has a warm and down - to - earth quality. Narciso clearly expresses his love for all that has been given to him. It's evident that he has a big heart, and this sentiment begins at home. In the second paragraph, he discusses his home life, and his descriptions of his family evoke a warm, sunny feeling. He sets the mood by talking about his remarkable parents, who infuse their culture into every aspect of life. Food, in particular, has the power to make people feel good inside. ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" showcases the warm and welcoming feeling Narciso experiences when he thinks about his family. In summary, the memoir successfully conveys the deep - seated love and warmth that Narciso has for his family and home."
1506	13332	5	2	The author crafted a mood in the memoir centered around the fact that due to his parents' move to @LOCATION1, he experienced a life he'd never had before. In his life, his parents would take people in for a short period to assist them in getting back on their feet, as they believed others would do the same for them. This situation contributed to the overall mood of the memoir.
1507	13333	5	2	In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the predominant mood is one of admiration, satisfaction, and courage. Narciso admired his parents, who sacrificed a stable life for a better one for him. His parents selflessly came to @LOCATION2, facing personal and financial struggles. He was content with the life he had, achieving success through family values and determination. His family showed courage by providing him with a better life in a new place, even though they were more well - off in Cuba. Despite the hardships, they were determined for Narciso's sake. Overall, the mood of admiration pervades the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, a fashion designer from Newark, New Jersey.
1508	13334	5	2	"The author of the memoir establishes a warm and joyful mood. By sharing his fond childhood memories, he imparts a similar feeling to the reader. For instance, despite his parents' hardships in moving from Cuba to @LOCATION1, they created an inviting home. The memoir states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (∂ @NUM1), which evokes happiness in the reader. It also posits that family isn't solely based on blood; the author's community was like a family, as ""All of these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship. It was a close - knit community"" (∂ @NUM2). Moreover, the author mentions that ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" (∂ @NUM3). @CAPS1, the author describes ""the warmth of the kitchen"" (∂ @NUM4) and the air filled with love. These passages paint a picture of joyful family gatherings, instilling those emotions in the reader. This is significant as it shows the author's fond remembrance of his childhood. Despite his parents' difficult lives, they made his life full of joy and warmth, demonstrating that tough experiences can be turned into positive ones."
1509	13335	5	2	"The memoir reveals that the author created a mood of happiness. The author was extremely satisfied with his life, overjoyed about having embraced Cuban culture, and happy about the ""family"" he had. From the mood in the memoir, it's evident that the author is very content with the way he was raised. This is how the author's mood in the memoir can be characterized."
1510	13336	5	2	Throughout the memoir, the author describes his life and expresses his deep love for it. In paragraph @NUM1, he uses parentheses to convey his affection for various things, revealing the warm feelings he had as a child. In paragraphs three and four, he also talks about his love for interacting with different cultures and praises his parents as truly good people. Overall, his writing is filled with his positive emotions towards his life experiences.
1511	13337	5	2	The mood crafted by the author in the memoir is one of love. This assertion holds true as in paragraph @NUM1, it states, “I have been grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.” Additionally, in paragraph @NUM2, it mentions, “My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and the love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful).” Finally, in paragraph @NUM3, it says, “It was here where I learned the true definition of ‘family.’ And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.” Evidently, the author's recollections are suffused with the emotion of love.
1512	13338	5	2	In my view, the mood of this memoir is a happy one. The author talks about his first friend, the landlord's daughter, as well as the wonderful cooking and music in his home. He expresses great gratitude to his parents for moving to America for him. There were also all those celebrations they held for people, and everyone in the neighborhood was like friends. Clearly, he deeply loves his family. With so many positive elements described, it's hard to find any unhappiness in his account. All these details combined make it evident that the overarching mood of the memoir is a joyous one.

Moreover, he expounds on the positive features of his family and culture, of which he is extremely proud. He states, “growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ‘family’ had nothing to do with being a blood relative.” Essentially, he is conveying that he realized all the people living around him came together and were somehow connected through their cultures, making them feel like a family. He also expresses his gratitude for having parents who did so much to ensure a better life for their children. Although they faced struggles at times, the author remains content with the positive aspects of his childhood and the presence of these wonderful people. The comings and goings of people in his house over the years made him understand that “family” means being surrounded by those you love and with whom you connect, transforming a house into a home.
1514	13340	5	2	In Cuban culture, every family has a tradition that they pass down to their children. Every father tells or gives something, which could be a knife or a gold chain. They might also share a family recipe for food. As for my family, I'm not sure what they will tell me or give me. This uncertainty about the family - passed traditions reflects the significance and mystery that such legacies hold in our lives.
1515	13341	5	2	In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir “Narciso Rodriguez,” the overall mood is one of happiness. The quote “The congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home” reveals his deep affection for his childhood home. The last sentence of the memoir, “I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home,” clearly demonstrates his appreciation for his parents' hard work in creating a home for him. Despite the family facing financial and personal struggles, the author looks back on his childhood with happiness. This shows that the positive memories and the sense of home and family outweigh the difficulties, solidifying the happy mood of the memoir.
1516	13342	5	2	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, a variety of moods are crafted, namely upbeat, happy, and exciting. The memoir initially presents an upbeat mood.

The second mood evident in the memoir is happiness. The statement ""All of these cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship"" reflects a joyous sentiment, highlighting the wonderful moment when different cultures unite in friendship. The final mood portrayed is excitement. The mention of ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations"" indicates that the coming - together of family and friends for celebrations is an exhilarating time.

1519	13345	5	2	The mood in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is characterized by love and respect. Narciso holds deep affection for his family and has learned that family extends beyond blood - relatives. His family includes the friends he made in his neighborhood. A large portion of his love is directed towards his parents. He loves them for selflessly moving to @LOCATION1 to provide him with a better life. Despite having less - than - ideal jobs, they were motivated by the desire to give their son a good life. He is also grateful for their sacrifice of leaving behind their home, family, and friends in Cuba for him. Most importantly, his parents taught him two crucial lessons: the spirit of generosity and the significance of family and friends. They also instilled courage in him by not fearing the move to @LOCATION1. Narciso frequently expresses his thanks and acknowledges that he wouldn't have been as brave without them. All of his love and gratitude clearly show the high level of respect he has for his parents.
1520	13346	5	2	"The author describes a warm and happy mood in the memoir. The author @ORGANIZATION1 emphasizes the importance of family, which always evokes a comforting feeling. He shares that he ""was born into a two - family blond - brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey"", yet he believes that the people he lives with matter more than the place. The mood while reading the memoir is complex due to his descriptions of his parents' life, his own life, and his home. When he says ""the innocence of Childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"", he is highlighting the close - knit nature of his family and friends. Reading this makes one feel the comfort, happiness, joy, and compassion that he has for his life, his parents, and those around him. In conclusion, the memoir effectively conveys the significance of relationships and the warm feelings associated with a loving family environment."
1521	13347	5	2	"The memoir of Narciso Rodriguez is imbued with a mood of gratitude. Narciso's parents migrated from Cuba to @LOCATION2 to offer their children a more prosperous life than they had experienced. Initially, they resided in a one - room house until they moved to New Jersey, where Narciso was raised. Within that dwelling, the family established a vibrant Cuban community. The heart of the home was the kitchen, where Cuban music played continuously. The area of New Jersey where the Rodriguez family lived was populated by Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. The community resembled a large family, with cultures uniting in great solidarity and friendship. These cultural interactions taught Narciso the true meaning of ""family."" If his parents had not been selfless and made the arduous journey to start anew, he would not have had these experiences. As Narciso states, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows the deep - seated gratitude he feels for his parents' sacrifices."
1522	13348	5	2	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author creates a mood centered around love. The author writes, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood - related."" This indicates that the author considers non - blood relatives as part of their family. The statement ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" reveals that despite the house not being luxurious, it was a place filled with love and a true home. The overall mood of this memoir is one of love, and it is an emotion that the author will always cherish."
1523	13349	5	2	The author of the memoir experiences a mood of @CAPS1 and curiosity. The author's mother and father showed great courage by coming to this country without knowledge of the language or the culture. Like many immigrants, they selflessly left behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved to provide a better life for their children. They faced personal and financial struggles, endured harsh northern winters while longing for their native tropical climate, and overcame cultural hardships. Their sacrifices and the challenges they faced evoke a complex mood in the author, which combines @CAPS1 and curiosity about their journey.
1524	13350	5	2	"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is quite subtle and difficult to define. When I first read it, I didn't immediately feel anything @CAPS1, but upon reflection, I realized the article exudes a comforting mood. The quote ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood - relative"" (@CAPS2 in the beginning paragraph @NUM1) makes the reader think differently about the concept of family. It gives the impression that family can be formed through shared experiences rather than just blood ties. This memoir doesn't have obvious moods like happiness or sadness; instead, it makes the reader ponder. There are no truly sad moments throughout. The quote ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" at the end of paragraph @NUM2 is another example of the undefined mood. It's hard to put into words the emotions it stirs. In conclusion, the mood of this piece is indeed undefined."
1525	13351	5	2	"The author creates a respectful mood in the memoir. The respect stems from the fact that the author's parents emigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1. As the @CAPS1 states, ""My Mother And father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" This shows their bravery in venturing into the unknown. Another reason for the respectful mood is that the parents moved to this country selflessly for their child. The @CAPS1 also says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This clearly demonstrates that their move was for the well - being of their child rather than their own interests, and this selflessness is worthy of respect."
1526	13352	5	2	"The memoir conveys an overall thankful mood. Near the end, the author states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Moreover, the author scarcely dwells on the negative aspects, only briefly touching upon them. For the remainder of the memoir, the author elaborates on the wonderfulness of their life and the constant presence of family. This consistent focus on the positive and the expression of gratitude clearly establish the thankful mood of the memoir."
1527	13353	5	2	The author of the article aims to depict how wonderful their past was. The article evokes a mood of happy memories, including the scent of the author's mother's cooking. As a child, the author's memories were predominantly happy and centered around a home - setting. Throughout the story, the mood remained positive. The author's recollections of their childhood home were consistently happy and pleasant, creating an overall feel of nostalgia and contentment.
1528	13354	5	2	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the author creates a mood of gratitude towards cooking skills and parental love. The author expresses gratitude for their cooking skills, specifically those passed down by their parents. As the author says, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" Additionally, the author is thankful for their parents' love, as shown in the statement, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Overall, the memoir is filled with the author's gratitude for these aspects of their life."
1529	13355	5	2	"The entire memoir exudes a highly positive attitude. The author conveys a sense of unity and friendship, as evidenced by the quote, ""All of these cultures came together in great solidarity in friendship."" Despite living in a time of racism, different cultures in the neighborhood coexisted peacefully. Paragraph @NUM1 reflects a feeling of caring and love, as the author describes how their parents moved out of Cuba selflessly to provide a better life for future generations. The statement, ""They came selflessly, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved,"" perfectly captures these emotions. The final part of the memoir expresses deep gratitude to the author's parents, with the author stating, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The last line, ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home,"" reveals that the house was filled with love, care, and strong relationships. In conclusion, the memoir has a loving and positive mood throughout."
1530	13356	5	2	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood is one of gratefulness. Mood refers to the overall atmosphere created by the author's words. I believe it also contains elements of happiness because regardless of circumstances, Rodriguez is always appreciative. Whether living in a simple house with many people, Rodriguez is happy to have a home. In paragraph @NUM1, Rodriguez says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I admire Rodriguez for being so grateful and content with what they have. The last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" is a perfect illustration of the mood of gratefulness and a touch of happiness that permeates the memoir."
1531	13357	5	2	"The mood crafted by the author within the memoir is multifaceted and dynamic. Initially, a light, warm, and happy atmosphere pervades as the author depicts his upbringing in a simple yet loving neighborhood. The quote, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" encapsulates this idyllic setting. This friendly and cheerful mood persists throughout the memoir. However, as the author delves into his parents' journey, the mood shifts to one of gratitude. He notes that, like many immigrants, his parents selflessly left behind their families, friends, and careers in their beloved country to provide a better life for their children. They endured personal and financial struggles, faced harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics, and overcame cultural hardships. Overall, the mood in the memoir fluctuates, moving from a warm and comforting feeling to one of thankfulness and back again."
1532	13358	5	2	In the memoir, the mood is characterized by love and care. A Cuban family originally lived in a @NUM1 - apartment building and now resides in a @NUM2 - bedroom apartment. They invite people in and treat family members and others with love and care. This behavior has a positive influence on the children. Additionally, the neighborhood is a positive environment, which also contributes to the overall mood. The family's actions and the neighborhood's nature combine to create a heart - warming atmosphere that is beneficial for the family's well - being and the children's upbringing.
1533	13359	5	2	"The mood created by the author conveys two important messages. Firstly, it emphasizes that family will always be there for you. A quote from the story, ""I will never forget how my parents made this simple house into a home,"" illustrates the deep connection and support within the family. Secondly, the mood suggests that there are always better opportunities in life. Narciso Rodriguez's parents moved to @LOCATION1 to provide a better future for their kids. The author also states, ""It was here were I learned the real definition of 'family'."" And, ""And for this I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" These quotes further solidify the mood, highlighting the importance of family and the potential for a better life."
1534	13360	5	2	"I believe the author crafted a mood that is both happy and one that makes readers appreciate what they have. It also encourages us to always remember our roots and cherish our families. At certain points in the memoir, the mood leans more towards @CAPS1. For instance, in ""paragraph @NUM1,"" the author describes how his childhood neighborhood was a melting pot of different races, including Spanish, Cuban, and Italian. These diverse groups came together in solidarity and friendship. Moreover, he mentions that his family members always supported one another. In conclusion, I think the main mood of this memoir is @CAPS1 and the spirit of coming together, whether it's within a family or among people in general."
1535	13361	5	2	"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood of pride and gladness. He expresses his pride in his family and home. His parents left their homeland to offer him a better life, and he is extremely grateful and proud of their sacrifice. Additionally, his parents showed kindness by allowing other immigrants to stay with them temporarily. In paragraph @NUM1, he remarks, ""what They did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done."" Rodriguez also shows how glad he is to have grown up in his neighborhood. He had the support of his parents and neighbors, whom he considered family. Despite his apartment not being the most luxurious, it was his home, and he was content there, surrounded by people who loved and cared for him. In paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Through his memoir, Narciso effectively conveys his proud and glad feelings."
1536	13362	5	2	The author is proud and grateful as his parents left Cuba. They were kind - hearted people who allowed others to live in their house. Despite having limited finances, they took on any available jobs to care for their son, Narciso. They had a three - bedroom apartment where they let refugees celebrate their arrival in the country. Their home was filled with love and life. Moreover, they came to this country without knowing the language. All these aspects contribute to the author's proud mood in this story.
1537	13363	5	2	In my opinion, the memoir has a comforting and happy mood. It depicts how a simple house can transform into a home. The family selflessly lets people stay with them until they can regain stability, using love to turn a random house into a warm abode. Also, it shows that family isn't just about blood relations; it's about being there for each other in times of need. The fact that a simple apartment can become a loving home full of family and love brings a great deal of comfort and happiness.
1538	13364	5	2	The author creates a mood of gratefulness in the memoir. For instance, his parents shared cooking duties, unconsciously passing on their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking to him, which he still has today and for which he is eternally grateful. He loves following his parents' goals and loves them deeply. He is constantly thankful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. He has often told them how courageous they are for welcoming people into their home. He admires their strength and perseverance and has thanked them many times. However, he realizes there's no way to fully express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity instilled in him at such an early age and for teaching him the importance of family and friends.

There are multiple quotes in the memoir that support this mood. One such quote is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""

1540	13366	5	2	The mood is likely a blend of happiness and sadness. On one hand, he describes the happiness and unity within his family as well as among the Spanish and Italian families in the area. On the other hand, there is the presence of segregation in @LOCATION1. This combination of positive family - related experiences and the negative aspect of segregation results in a complex mood that is both happy and sad.
1541	13367	5	2	The author crafts a highly positive mood. It depicts the struggles of him and his family. Despite falling behind in terms of jobs, and being separated from friends and family, they are all very resilient and positive, enjoying their lives in New Jersey within the Cuban - like setting.

1545	13371	5	2	"The mood established by the author in the memoir is powerful. It is predominantly one of gratitude.

The loving nature of his parents and their open - hearted approach made Narciso feel appreciative. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family.

1552	13378	5	2	In “Narciso Rodriguez” from “Home; the @CAPS1 of Our Lives” by Narciso Rodriguez, the author crafts a warm and pleasant mood in multiple ways. One approach is his account of how the community overcame segregation. He notes that “...Our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants... In our neighborhood,...all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.” By doing so, he creates an optimistic atmosphere, suggesting that despite the prevalence of segregation, the community members were united in friendship. Additionally, the author makes the story appealing through his portrayal of his parents. Throughout the excerpt, he expresses deep gratitude for his parents, emphasizing their kindness and love. As he puts it, “They came selflessly... to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.” By sacrificing their own lives, they improved the lives of others. Due to this, he is thankful for the love and support his parents provided. With this uplifting theme, Narciso Rodriguez establishes a smooth, pleasant, warm, and loving tone in the story.
1553	13379	5	2	The mood established by the @CAPS1 indicates that family and happiness are of utmost importance. A home is not merely a physical space but a place where one feels safe and content.

1596	13422	5	2	The mood crafted in the memoir by the author is one of unity and courage. As described in a particular paragraph, the neighborhood was predominantly populated by Spanish, Cuban, and [CAPS1] immigrants. During a time when racism was widespread and segregation was the norm in the United States, this neighborhood was an exception. All these different cultures came together in harmony and friendship, forming a close - knit community of honest and hard - working immigrants. They were ready to help those in need, even if they were not of the same kind. Moreover, the author's parents demonstrated great courage. They came to this country without any knowledge of the language and culture, selflessly leaving behind their families, friends, careers, and their beloved country to give their children a better life. This is the mood effectively created by the memoir.
1597	13423	5	2	"The memoir creates distinct moods. At the end of the memoir, [CAPS2] was [CAPS3]. The narrator says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""

Through such descriptions, the author effectively creates a warm and happy mood in the memoir.
1644	13470	5	2	“Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives” is a heartfelt tribute to Narciso Rodriguez's parents. The author of the memoir states, “Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative.” Narciso Rodriguez transforms the reader's perception of the memoir into a story of a young child observing the physical and mental qualities of adults. He acknowledges the difficulties he and his parents face. As immigrants in a time of racism and segregation, he learns to appreciate the “close - knit community of honest, hard - working immigrants” in his neighborhood. He understands the personal and financial struggles of Narciso Rodriguez Sr. and @ORGANIZATION2. Despite his parents' background in chemical engineering and work in a laboratory, they struggle to find jobs during tough financial times. He adores them and says, “They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life.” Without these relationships, the memoir would be a self - centered story. He appreciates all that his family has done, learning respect for his parents due to the generosity shown to him at a young age. In the end, Narciso Rodriguez writes a memoir dedicated to the bonds he formed with his parents and the refugees around them.
1645	13471	5	2	In my view, the author of this memoir has crafted around three distinct moods: love, gratitude, and caring. The mood of love is established as Narciso Rodriguez asserts that family isn't limited to blood relatives. In his case, his entire neighborhood is like family to him. Since family can be those we love, this contributes to the creation of the love mood. As I neared the end of the memoir, I personally felt a sense of gratitude. The author is grateful for the sacrifices his parents made, such as leaving their hometown for his better future. I can relate to this on a personal level as my parents also made significant decisions for me. I believe the mood of caring is also present. The author mentions that his parents allowed people to live with them until they got back on their feet. This act of kindness shows that the family is caring. Overall, these three moods make the memoir a rich and meaningful account of relationships and experiences.
1646	13472	5	2	"In her memoir, Narciso Rodriguez describes her childhood home with profound warmth, fondness, and gratitude. The affectionate way she speaks of her parents' apartment, their kitchen, and the integration of Cuban culture into their daily lives indicates that she holds wonderful memories of her parents. Evidently, she is deeply appreciative of all her parents did for her and the opportunity to grow up in a community where ""family"" transcended blood relations. The entire memoir is crafted with meticulous care and attention to charming details. The author clearly feels fortunate that her parents sacrificed their safety in their homeland to bring her to @LOCATION1, enabling her to lead a better life, understand the significance of friends and family, and learn the true meaning of love through Cuban culture."
1647	13473	5	2	I believe that @CAPS1's mood in this @CAPS2 was @CAPS3, and I'm glad that @CAPS3 grew up with such kind - hearted parents. Their selflessness is truly commendable. Overall, it's heartening to see @CAPS3 in such a positive state due to the wonderful upbringing provided by their parents.
1648	13474	5	2	I think the author created an unpleasant mood in the work. The fact that the character lived in a one - room apartment strongly suggests that they were poor. Moreover, the indication that they lived in a poor town with a lack of food further contributes to this negative mood. In conclusion, the living conditions described by the author effectively convey an overall unpleasant atmosphere.
1649	13475	5	2	The memoir exudes a mood of gratitude. This sentiment is first evident in paragraph @NUM1 when the author discusses cooking and Cuban music. It is also apparent in paragraph @NUM2 when the topic of leaving their home countries is brought up. A third instance can be found in paragraph @NUM3, where the author struggles to find the right words to express gratitude. Overall, the mood of gratitude permeates the memoir, and it is most prominently observable in paragraphs @NUM1, @NUM2, and @NUM3.
1650	13476	5	2	"The mood created by the author in the memoir can have a powerful impact on readers once they fully grasp its essence. Narciso's parents began with a house that seemed insignificant. However, they transformed it into something truly remarkable. In the final sentence of the memoir, Narciso says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" What Narciso is trying to convey is that a home is defined by what one makes of it. In my view, this is precisely the mood that the author has successfully created in the memoir."
1651	13477	5	2	In the memoir, the author expresses a profound sense of gratitude. He is extremely thankful for his parents' decision to come to the @CAPS1 from Cuba, as it provided him with opportunities for a better education and a path to success. Throughout the memoir, he also shows appreciation for all those who supported him and his family in this new country, and he reciprocates that support to those who have helped him. Overall, gratitude is the prevailing mood that Narciso Rodriguez conveys in this memoir.
1652	13478	5	2	The author created the memoir to remind others of families who are not part of our immediate circle. It also serves to recall aspects of culture and other elements. The memoir of Narciso was written because it focuses on family - related topics, ensuring that the memories and values associated with family are preserved and shared.
1653	13479	5	2	"The memoir evokes multiple moods, including @CAPS1, gratefulness, and an overall sentiment that permeates the story. One source of mood is the celebration atmosphere with family and friends, as described in paragraph @NUM1: ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Gratefulness is also a prominent mood, as the family welcomes those in need, knowing their friends and family would do the same, as stated in paragraph @NUM2: ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" There is a depressing undertone too, as Narciso's family had to leave behind friends and jobs for a better life for their child, as seen in paragraph @NUM3: ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Additionally, there is gratitude and admiration for what the parents did, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM4: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" These moods of depression, gratefulness, @CAPS1, and admiration fill the reader's heart as they engage with the memoir."
1654	13480	5	2	"The author of the memoir crafts a mood of profound gratitude and happiness. The statement ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" reflects the author's appreciation for what his parents did. He understands the difficulty his parents faced in leaving their home country for his sake, as evidenced by ""They struggled both personally and financially... I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author values the struggles his parents endured, which enabled him to grow up as he did and have the life he has.

Narciso Rodriguez is thankful that his parents sacrificed everything - their friends, family, jobs, and the country they loved - to come to @LOCATION1 so he could have a better life. He also appreciates all that his parents taught him. These two moods of love and gratefulness define the overall atmosphere of the story."

In paragraph @NUM1, it is revealed that the author's parents had to leave behind everything they held dear - their country, family, friends, and careers. Their self - sacrifice is a testament to the love they had for a better future. Gratitude also permeates the story. In paragraph @NUM2, Narciso expresses deep gratitude for what his parents gave up and for their love. He acknowledges that their actions were far more courageous than anything he could have done.

Personally, I found this story incredibly touching, as it created a profound sense of mood and emotion while I was reading.

The author recounts how the landlord's daughter was both his friend and babysitter. This led to a playful and warm atmosphere, extending to his grandparents who also enjoyed meals at his house. Lastly, the neighborhood is a source of the happy mood. The author describes how the immigrants in his neighborhood at @LOCATION1 were hard - working and willing to help one another. He also emphasizes that family doesn't necessarily have to be blood - related. Through these aspects, the author effectively created a happy mood in the memoir.

The numerous mentions of parties contribute to this upbeat atmosphere. As someone who loves parties, thinking about them during @CAPS1 alleviates some of the @CAPS2 stress. Another factor that sets a good mood is the description of Narciso's parents, who are always positive and ready for anything. Finally, Narciso's accounts of his family and friends also enhance the positive mood. Whenever I recall good memories with my family and friends, it always brings a smile to my face.

For example, Narciso lives in a one - bedroom apartment, yet he cherishes it because of the wonderful memories. Narciso says in @CAPS1 @NUM1, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This quote encapsulates the overall mood of the story. The final sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" further drives home the theme of gratitude and the value of family."
