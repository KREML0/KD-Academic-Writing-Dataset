1	20716	8	2	"When I was in third grade, I had a friend named @PERSON2. His mom was always in a bad mood, never laughing or smiling. Every time I saw her and smiled, she'd just frown and keep walking. At first, I thought she didn't like me. When @PERSON2 told me his mom was a grouch, I laughed, and so did he. We laughed so hard we got in trouble in class. The next day at school lunch, @PERSON2 said I was good at making people laugh. I disagreed, saying my jokes were bad. He suggested we test them on a new student. We searched the whole school but couldn't find one. Then the bell rang, and we went to class. In class, our teacher @PERSON1 announced a new student, @ORGANIZATION1. She sat between @PERSON2 and me. @PERSON2 encouraged me to tell her a joke. I asked @ORGANIZATION1 if she wanted to hear one. I started the ""boo"" joke. At first, she didn't get it, but during the movie, she understood and laughed. @PERSON2 said, ""I told you so."" @PERSON2 had the idea that if I spent the night at his house, I could make his mom laugh. I thought it was a good plan. I asked my mom, and she said it was okay as long as it was okay with his mom. @PERSON2 asked his mom, and she agreed. When I got to his house, we played video games first. At dinner, @PERSON2 told me to tell the joke to his parents. I did, and they laughed for about five minutes. @PERSON2 said it worked, and his mom asked what. He explained everything. His mom said her mom had recently died, which was why she was in a bad mood. After dinner, we went to bed. The next morning, when my mom came to pick me up, she asked how the sleep - over was. I said it was fun as I made people laugh. She said laughter wouldn't help me clean my room, and I just thought, ""Gosh darn it."

I love the dirt on my face, the sweat on my forehead, and the water I pour on myself to stay cool in the heat. However, the memories with teammates are what I cherish most in my softball career. I played for the Hood @CAPS1 @CAPS2 team for almost four years. The girls on the team were like sisters to me, and I thought I'd play with them throughout high school. But as my fifth year approached, my dad suggested I try a non - local team. This presented a dilemma: stay with the familiar team or join an unknown team with better players who might not like me. At first, I decided to stay with the familiar team to be comfortable. But as softball season neared, I re - evaluated. I wondered if I should challenge myself to become a better player and attract college scouts. So, I decided to try out for the new team. On the way to the try - out, I was extremely nervous. When I arrived at the field, the girls were friendly. They introduced themselves, and I laughed throughout the try - out. Playing with this team was amazing. The friendships I made would not have happened if I hadn't taken the chance. Softball is not just about the game but also about making new friends and having fun.
3	20718	8	2	"I absolutely love making people laugh. Even as a little kid, I was ""special"" and a huge spaz. I was the most hyperactive five - year - old. For instance, I once hit myself in the head with a hammer and another time stabbed myself in the head with a pencil while dancing in class and needed stitches. A few days before a photo session, I convinced my mom to let me go outside. I fell on the sidewalk corner, ruining the pictures. In kindergarten, I loved school, except for the bullies. There was one bully who gave me wedgies at story time. One day in kindergarten, like any other day, I went to school, did my work, and had break. At story time, I got a wedgie. After the story, I told a really funny joke, and the whole class laughed. Not realizing they were laughing at the joke, I burst into tears. A teacher explained they were laughing at the joke, and it took me a while to stop crying. Even now, my classmates remind me of that day. Although it was a negative experience then, it's now a blessing. It taught me to tell the difference in laughter and accept being laughed at. Being ""special"" is what makes me who I am and helps me grow."
4	20719	8	2	When I hang out with my friend, we laugh a lot, sometimes for no reason. We laugh about running into trash cans, laundry, and the food we eat. One day at school, the bell rang, and students were going to lunch. My friend, who walks slower than me, was holding onto my backpack. She told me not to cross the hallway, but I did. She slid into a trash can on the wall. The sound was so funny that I still laugh about it. My friend and I have an inside joke about laundry. When we saw a laundry mat, we made up a silly idea of wearing aprons with colors and rhinestones to do our laundry all at once. After the laundry was done, we'd pick out a new clean outfit. About food, one day I talked about dinner. My mom asked if we wanted chicken, and we were excited. But when dinner was ready, it was frozen from a box and looked terrible. These are the things that happen in my life almost every day. I love my friend. We can't stay mad at each other after a fight. At the end of the day, we just ask if we're done being mad and then laugh. Laughter and having fun are what matter most in our friendship.
5	20721	8	2	I'm going to tell a story about the time I got lost downtown. I was going downtown to meet someone. It was cold, dark, and creepy. On the way, I thought I'd gone too far, so I took the bus. I was confused about where I was. I asked a man, and he said I was downtown. I called the person I was meeting. She told me to stay on the bus and come further downtown. I waited for about @NUM1 minutes, and the bus came. I called her to say I was on the way. When I arrived, they laughed at me. I said it wasn't funny as I could have had something bad happen to me. Later, I wanted some candy. They showed me how to get to the store. On my way to the store, I was cold and listening to music. When I got to the store, my phone rang. The girl called to make sure I wasn't lost. A few minutes later, when I walked out of the store, I got lost again. I didn't want her to know, so I didn't call her. After a while, she called and said she could see me going the wrong way. She came up to me, and we laughed. When we got to her house, they laughed again. I admitted I got lost. Later, I realized next time I should ask her to come with me. The whole night was about me getting lost, but it ended up being kind of funny.
6	20722	8	2	I'm going to tell @CAPS18 a little story. One time, at @CAPS11 house in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, I was with @CAPS11 cousin @PERSON1. I was bored and asked @PERSON1 what we could do. @PERSON1 suggested making a snowman, and I thought it sounded like fun. When @PERSON1 started reaching for a jacket and gloves, I stopped him and asked what he was getting them for. He said he wasn't cold, and I replied that I'd warned him. We began building the snowman by making the base, the biggest piece for the bottom. After about @NUM1 minutes, the base was almost done, but we started to feel cold. @PERSON1 suggested going inside, saying his mom might make us hot chocolate. So, we went inside, hoping for some warm, delicious hot chocolate. When I saw @CAPS11 mom, I asked if we could have some hot chocolate. She said of course and that we looked cold. @PERSON1 and I sat downstairs by the heater, waiting anxiously for our hot chocolate. When @CAPS11 mom called from upstairs that it was ready, we rushed down the hall and up the stairs. To our surprise, there was not only hot chocolate but also a bag of chips. We thanked @CAPS11 mom and sat down at the table to drink our hot chocolate while she put some chips on paper towels for us. I started eating the chips by the handfuls, but @PERSON1 grabbed just one. I asked him why he only took one. He looked at me from the corner of his eye, slowly brought the chip to his mouth, and took a bite. I fell out of my chair laughing hysterically. @CAPS11 mom heard me hit the floor and came upstairs to find me laughing. She asked what was so funny. I told @PERSON1 to show her, and he grabbed another chip, looked at her from the corner of his eye, and took a bite. I started laughing again, but @CAPS11 mom didn't see the humor. I tried to mimic what @PERSON1 did but with no effect. I even spilled my hot chocolate on myself, which made him laugh. He then offered to show me, and I begged him to. He grabbed another chip, looked at me from the corner of his eye, and took a bite. I laughed uncontrollably for about @NUM1 minutes. I said I'd get it right, and @PERSON1 told me to keep trying. I tried again and again but still couldn't make him laugh the way I wanted. Finally, I did something that made him laugh, and I knew that laughter had brought @CAPS11 cousin @PERSON1 and me closer together.
7	20723	8	2	My best friend, @PERSON1, and I have been close since we were @NUM1. We met through @CAPS1 @CAPS2 lessons at our local dance studio. Over the years, we've stayed close because we often engage in similar activities, although we're quite different. I'm more outgoing, outspoken, and carefree, while @PERSON1 is conservative and can take things too seriously. However, our differences balance each other out. After finals week ended, @PERSON1 and I planned a sleepover. We needed to relax and have some time to ourselves. When I got home from school, I called her and asked when she wanted to hang out. She suggested @NUM2, and I was excited. I quickly gathered my things, including my toothbrush, pillow, pajamas, and blanket. My dad dropped me off at her place. When I arrived, @PERSON1 greeted me with a big smile and led me to her basement, where she had set out a variety of junk food on an old pool table. There were chips, cookies, sodas, candy, chocolate, and pizza. We feasted for almost an hour and then lay on the floor to recover. We laughed at the commercials on her big - screen @CAPS7 and then started talking about our finals. @PERSON1 bragged that she had done well and would get all A's, as she has since middle school. I said I thought I did pretty well too but wasn't sure about a @NUM3. Later, we moved to the couch to watch an old scary movie and the top @NUM5 music videos of the week. By @NUM2 in the @TIME1, we were tired and fell asleep. The next @TIME1, when I woke up, @PERSON1 was sitting in the corner with a folded piece of paper. I asked what was up, and she threw the crumpled paper at me. It was her report card. She had all A's except for a @CAPS13 in her @CAPS15 class. She was very upset, but when I asked if she was crying over a @CAPS13, she looked at me and then burst out laughing. We both laughed because she felt silly for crying over it. @PERSON1 and I are perfect best friends. We balance each other out. I tell her to relax, and she tells me to focus. We should not take small things too seriously and need to find a balance between work and play.
8	20724	8	2	Laughter is an essential element in any relationship, whether it's a friendship, a romantic relationship, or a work - related one. It prevents people from becoming overly tense and unapproachable. Everyone needs laughter in their lives, as it can cheer them up during difficult times. Laughing every day can bring happiness, even when one is in a bad mood. For those who are suicidal, a bit of laughter can make a significant difference. Laughing with friends or loved ones is a wonderful experience, and it's also nice to see others smile and laugh. After finals week, a friend and I planned a sleepover to relax. When I got home from school, I called her to confirm the time. Then I gathered my things and went to her place. Her basement was filled with junk food, and we had a great time eating and laughing at commercials. We also talked about our finals. The next day, I found her upset because she had received a @CAPS13 on her report card, despite getting all A's otherwise. At first, I was a bit amused by her reaction, but then we both ended up laughing at the situation. In conclusion, laughter is a powerful force that can bring people together and make life more enjoyable. It helps us deal with stress and find joy in the simplest things. We should all make an effort to laugh more often and share that happiness with others.
9	20725	8	2	I believe that laughter and a sense of humor are common traits among people, and everyone loves to share them. Among young teenage girls, laughter is an infectious and wonderful gift. It represents the purest form of joy and is what brings people together, being both the start and the end of friendship and unity. Laughter can lift the spirits of those in need. A simple laugh can turn a bad day around. In a world full of dread and sadness, the kindness and generosity of laughter are some of the few good things left. Even in difficult situations like poverty, depression, and oppression, laughter can briefly wash away worries and fill people with warmth. @PERSON1 and I have been best friends since we were ten. Laughter has always been the strongest part of our friendship. We have a talent for making each other laugh, even when we're angry or sad. We believe that separately, we're only a little funny, but together, we can make anyone laugh. We use this ability to cheer each other up on bad days. My first impression of @PERSON1 was when she stomped to the neighborhood park to yell at her sister, whom I was playing with. At first, I didn't like her. But after going to her house with her sister, we discovered we had much in common and were only four months apart. Our friendship was rocky at the beginning, with a lot of fighting and arguing. We would make dumb comments instead of apologizing. For example, she once told me I couldn't hear her because there was a big bug in my ear. Now, we look back on those incidents and laugh. When we were @NUM1 - year - olds, our friendship was held together by our childish banter. Now, almost @NUM2, we rarely fight and always laugh, making the most of our time together by poking fun at each other. @PERSON1 has a gift for making anything funny. Laughter is a necessity in our friendship, keeping it strong. I can't imagine what our friendship would be like without it. If laughter were not a part of daily life, the human race would be dull and unhappy. Laughter heals people and gives the feeling that everything will be okay. It's a natural and healthy gift that we should cherish. I strive to laugh every day and make at least one other person laugh. A life without laughter is not a life worth living, as it is the key to happiness and connection.
10	20726	8	2	Laughter is truly one of life's greatest gifts. Have you ever laughed so hard that you cried, couldn't breathe, or couldn't make a sound? I'm the kind of person who can burst into laughter at something stupid and not even know why I started. Sometimes, I laugh so hard that nothing comes out at all. Laughter has a remarkable effect on a person's heart. It changes the way you feel and act. It's incredibly contagious and happens all around us every day. There's no age limit for laughter; it can happen to anyone, young or old. One time, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and I stayed up until three in the @TIME1. We were so delirious and crazy that we acted like mad people. We have a relationship where we can laugh at almost anything. To keep ourselves awake, we drank lots of soda and ate sugary foods. We made up songs, danced around @CAPS2's house, and it felt like we laughed for hours. I laughed until tears streamed from my eyes and I couldn't catch my breath. When the laughter turns silent, it's even funnier because the person can't control it. They rock back and forth with a silly expression on their face, making no noise at all. Have you ever laughed for what seems like forever? After such a long bout of laughter, it feels as if the sun is warming your heart and soul. When I laugh, I feel all the happiness and emotion flowing through my body. It's one of the greatest feelings in the world. It's wonderful to sit back with a friend or a group of friends and enjoy shared laughter. Even when you're feeling down, a good laugh can lift your spirits. No matter what mood I'm in, when I hear someone laughing, it's hard not to join in. Laughter affects our daily lives. I bet you can't go a day without hearing someone laugh or laughing yourself. I probably laugh about five hundred times a day, if not more. I love hearing people laugh; it brightens my mood and my day. Laughter is very important and beneficial for relationships. Imagine a world without laughter; it would be so boring. My advice is to laugh like you've heard the funniest thing in the world, like there's no tomorrow. Don't care what others think. You'll feel much better after a tear - inducing, breathless, silent but therapeutic laugh. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between people.
11	20727	8	2	"Laughter serves as an expression of delight, fun, or a reaction to a joke. It is a universal human behavior that brings significant benefits to our lives and occurs regularly. Without laughter, we would struggle to showcase our happy and outgoing sides, and our lives would be filled with nothing but frowning. Frowning is known to cause more wrinkles as it engages more facial muscles.  For me, laughter is an all - day affair. The @CAPS1 show, my friends, family, and horses are the main reasons my frown turns upside down. You might think horses can't smile or talk, but they have their own unique ways of showing personalities that make you laugh. They are all smart, yet can be clumsy or goofy at times, much like little brothers or sisters.  One particular memory is firmly etched in my mind. It was a mid - day on @DATE1 at the beach on the @ORGANIZATION1. I was with a friend, and we had our two horses saddled and ready. The moment we saw the waves crashing on the shore and smelled the salt in the air, both we and our horses felt a rush of energy.  Once on the sand, we galloped side by side, with the wind whistling past our ears like a moving train. The horses' heads were all pointed towards the ocean. When we reached the water, the horses pranced and danced like young foals. They walked deep into the water until we were drenched, and then, as the next wave rushed in, we'd swerve around to beat it to the shore.  After about five hours of exploring caves, sand dunes, and looking at starfish, we were exhausted and decided to end the day. It was around dinner time, so we ate while watching the sunset, concluding a perfect day at the beach. We put the horses back in the trailer, and before closing the door, I gave my horse a gentle pat on the neck. As I was about to leave, my horse turned its head and gave me a nudge, as if saying ""thanks for the good time"". Driving home, I knew it was a perfect day because of all the laughter. My face even ached a bit from smiling so much."
12	20728	8	2	"Starting off, naming two @NUM1 @DATE1 - old boys @ORGANIZATION1 is already comical. These are the names of my identical twin cousins. I must admit they are among the funniest kids I've ever known. My uncle, while a hard - working man, doesn't seem to have the best sense of humor, as evidenced by how he named his children.  Occasionally, my mom helps him out by taking the twins for a while since they can be quite a handful. Weekends are ideal for having them over, mainly because of my hateful step - siblings who dislike me, my brother, my sister, and even my mom. The tense atmosphere at home is not healthy, so having these energetic @NUM1 @DATE1 - olds around liven things up and makes us laugh as a family.  It was @DATE1 in @DATE2 when @CAPS7 was home, and we were building an extension to our house when the twins came over. My mom was extremely frustrated with their high energy levels and seemed on the verge of losing her temper. My step - dad @PERSON1 needed to go to @PERSON2's for nails and child locks, and I decided to go with him. I thought taking the twins would relieve my mom from their noise for a bit.  We loaded into the car, and I drove on the highway. I was entertained by the twins in the back seat, playing with ponies and laughing at people at red lights. We sang songs like ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" and the @ORGANIZATION2's until we reached @PERSON2's parking lot.  One twin found it hilarious to run down the aisles and hide behind lower - shelf items, while the other enjoyed pretending to be @ORGANIZATION1 and confusing @CAPS7. Eventually, they became too rowdy. @LOCATION1 and I caught them and strapped them into the @PERSON2's cart seat - belts, but it didn't solve the problem as well as we hoped.  We continued our search for child locks and found them in aisle @NUM4. There was a large man in front of the items. By ""large"", I don't mean muscular or tall; he seemed to watch too many @CAPS1 shows and have too many favorite snacks. He had long, sandy - blond hair, wore a dark - purple @CAPS2 die shirt and slip - on sandals.  One of the twins loudly said, ""@CAPS3 cow! Look at that lady! She's so huge!"" and burst into laughter, with the other twin agreeing. ""@CAPS4! She's as big as our whole car!"" I panicked and tried to make them quiet, but they ignored me. They were then distracted by a man on a ladder who was laughing with them. They then gasped and exclaimed, ""@CAPS5 she's as big as a fire truck!"" The man turned and glared at me. I apologized multiple times and started to take the boys away.  The man on the ladder hit a button, and the ladder made a loud beeping sound. The boys screamed in fear, shouting, ""@CAPS6 run as fast as you can hurry! She's backing up and she's going to squish you on the floor!"" Everyone laughed, including the man they were teasing. I was embarrassed and took them to the car to wait for @PERSON1.  I tried to explain to the boys in the car that only big trucks beep when backing up, but they didn't listen. @PERSON1 came out jogging with the nails, child locks, and a big smile on his face. I thought about what had happened and started laughing again. When I got home and told my mom, she laughed too, and I laughed even harder. That day, despite the chaos, was filled with so much laughter that it was worth it."
13	20732	8	2	"Meeting new people is always an interesting experience. As the saying goes, friends come and go, but true friends stay. I remember the first time I met @PERSON1. To me, she was not just a friend; I knew I wanted to build a life with her. People often say that love is a myth, but I believe it's real. Love comes from above and stays forever.  When I first spoke to her, it felt like God was guiding me, telling me she was the one. I saw that her heart was broken, and I knew I had to save her from further pain. Looking into her eyes, I could feel her pain, and I told her, ""Your heart won't be broken because I'll give you mine."" I expressed my feelings to her, saying, ""You're the one I've always wanted and needed. You're like a tattoo on my heart, the apple of my eye. I want to stand with you on a mountain and show you that I'm different from other guys. I'm faithful and will always be by your side.""  I also told her how much I loved every aspect of her, from her eyes and smile to her personality. I asked her to take a chance on me, knowing she had been through a lot. To my delight, she said yes. She was overjoyed, as if her dream had finally come true. She found a guy who was faithful, honest, and would never lie or cheat.  I told her she was my super - human, and she said I had changed her life. She had also changed mine. I told her that my heart belonged only to her, and if she didn't have it, my heart would be meaningless. I promised to always keep her warm, day and night. I said that all my wishes had come true because I finally had her by my side.  I shared with her how other girls had played with my heart in the past, and I had been searching for an honest, faithful, and true girl. I was so happy to say that I had found her in @PERSON1. I promised her that she would never be sad again and that I would always be just one phone call away.  She was extremely happy when I told her she was my paradise, my whole world. Our love, I believe, will never die. It will stand strong, reaching for the sky, until the sun stops shining. I'm crazy about her, and she's crazy about me. She holds the key to my heart, and I finally understand what true love feels like. She has turned all my bad days into good ones, and I will never break her heart."
14	20733	8	2	"People often claim that laughter is a crucial part of a relationship, but I was initially unsure. My grandmother, however, firmly believes that laughter has played a significant role in her relationship with my grandfather.  She was @NUM1 and @CAPS1 was @NUM2 when they first met. Everyone predicted their relationship wouldn't last, but they persevered. My grandmother said she felt like singing whenever she heard his name. She felt that all her problems would disappear when she was with him, and just thinking about him would make her smile and laugh.  I often wonder if what they had was love. I think it was. My grandmother seems so happy when she talks about him, but I'm still not entirely sure if laughter was the sole factor that kept them together for so long. She once said, ""@CAPS1 wasn't the smartest, but he always knew how to make me laugh.""  My grandmother asked me what I thought when I saw two couples laughing and having a good time. The first thing that comes to mind is that they know how to enjoy life and aren't easily bothered. She believes that if you can't make the other person laugh, you might not have a fulfilling relationship.  When my grandparents are angry with each other, it doesn't last long because my grandfather always knows how to make her laugh. I now understand why my grandmother fell in love with my grandfather. In a relationship, being able to put a smile on the other person's face is essential.  My grandmother was right. Laughter does play a huge part in their relationship. They always manage to turn difficult situations around with jokes and funny actions. I can never be mad at them because they know so many ways to make me laugh. Laughter is what holds our family together, and it clearly has a significant impact on their long - lasting relationship."
15	20734	8	2	"Laughter is the best medicine"" is a well - known phrase, and it's absolutely true. There have been days when I felt like life was going terribly wrong, but then one of my best friends would say something hilarious, and I'd laugh so hard that I'd almost wet my pants, my eyes would water, and my sides would cramp. I'd even fall on the floor, unable to make a sound. I sometimes think that even if I were in a coma, they could still make me laugh.  One particular day, @DATE1, @CAPS1, and I were in an extremely giggly mood. We staggered to @CAPS1's house, flushed and giddy because everything seemed so funny. You know those moments when you and your friends are so tickled by each other that just a glance makes you burst into laughter again? Well, we experienced that feeling for hours. I'm pretty sure I developed new abdominal muscles from laughing so hard.  When we got to her house, we tried to be serious as we had some homework to do. But after all that laughing, we were starving. @CAPS1 told @ORGANIZATION1 and me that we could have some cereal. Usually, milk and cereal are just ordinary, but that day, the milk was extraordinary. @ORGANIZATION1 exclaimed how good it was, and I was also blown away by its taste. When I asked @CAPS1 what kind of milk it was, her curious expression made us all laugh even more.  At one point, @CAPS1 peed her pants. It wasn't a little bit; it was a full - on accident. I don't even remember what I said to make her laugh so hard. She was red - faced and holding onto the counter, trying not to laugh. When I realized what was happening, I started laughing at her, which only made her laugh harder. She then waddled down the hall to the bathroom like a penguin. @ORGANIZATION1 also laughed at the sight of her.  I love my friends because we always laugh at each other and ourselves. @CAPS1 is always there to laugh at my jokes, and @ORGANIZATION1 is really good at coming up with them. I truly enjoy laughing, especially with my best friends. Laughter has the power to turn a bad day into a great one, and those moments with my friends are some of the best memories I have."
16	20735	8	2	One day, while skateboarding with my friend, I got very angry and wanted to quit. His mom tried to persuade me to keep going. She said I would never be good enough at skating, yet she also mentioned that I had improved more than some people she knew. This made me feel better, and from then on, I started skateboarding every day. Whenever I recall that day, I still laugh. Skating can be enjoyable in numerous ways. People skate for fun and for competitions. There are different skating styles, and everyone has their own way. There are many types of skateboards, and riders use them differently. Sometimes, I laugh at some skateboarders because of their skating styles. Skating is a great activity that brings joy and a sense of improvement, and I'm glad I didn't give up on it.
17	20736	8	2	"Laughter""  It is commonly believed that a good relationship is founded on trust. Throughout my life, I've often heard this view. However, as I've grown and begun to think independently, I've come up with my own survival guide for good relationships. While trust is indeed important, I've discovered that laughter is equally crucial, not only for initiating a relationship but also for keeping it vibrant.  My mother played a significant role in helping me understand this concept. My mom and I share an exceptional bond and a deep understanding of each other, which many of the girls I know don't have with their mothers. I consider myself extremely fortunate. Like all families, we've had our tough times, but we can always laugh them off and start anew. This realization made me appreciate the quote, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""  Although having a strong bond with my mom is of utmost importance to me, our relationship hasn't always been smooth. From around the age of ten to thirteen, I was reluctant to show my emotions and preferred to stay silent. Admiring my mom for her strength and beauty, I was worried that she might see me as a disappointment. I was afraid to reveal my true self to her. When she joked with me, I took things too seriously, and during our minor disputes, I thought she would hate me forever. Looking back, I realize how silly I was, but I'm grateful for those experiences as they made our relationship stronger.  One night after dinner, my mom told me it was my turn to do the dishes. I completely forgot and went to my room to listen to music and eventually fell asleep. My mom came into my room, upset and frustrated. She said, “Why did you ignore me? The dishes need to be done now.” I got out of bed without a word and headed to the kitchen. She followed me and said, “It's okay that you forgot. I'm not mad.” I still remained silent, relieved when I turned around and saw she had left.  After I finished the dishes, she pulled me into my room. She looked worried and explained the relationship she had with her own mother, which she hoped to have with me. She told me how they would laugh together at silly things and promised to stop arguing, take a deep breath, and then laugh it off. I was curious and asked why they did that. She replied, “Laughter is the best cure for any sad feeling or bad day, as grandma would always say.” She then tickled me and joked around, and for the first time, I wasn't nervous and spoke my mind. As we sat there, laughing until we fell asleep, I knew our relationship would change for the better.  Now, at fifteen, I can confidently say that my mom is my best and truest friend. Our ability to overcome difficulties and laugh off stressful situations makes me believe I can face anything. I've truly grasped the meaning of the saying, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.”"
18	20737	8	2	Laughter is an integral part of my life. If you're interested in a story about laughter, well, my life is filled with it. I even joke that if it weren't for laughing, I wouldn't have the six - pack I have now. Have you ever thought that when one person makes another laugh, they often become close friends, maybe even best friends? My boyfriend, @PERSON1, is my best friend.  I've only known him for about a year, but a lot can happen in that time. You can meet new people, build relationships, or even move away from them. @PERSON1 and I do everything together and are always laughing, either at each other or at other things.  One late @DATE1 @TIME1, he was walking me home as he always did. There was a field with extremely tall grass beside our path. Suddenly, he pretended to be pulled into the grass. I screamed as loudly as I could. Then he called my name in a creepy voice, inviting me to the grass. Out of curiosity, I walked towards the tall grass. When I reached the spot where he entered, he said, “I lost my shoe and can't find it anywhere!”   We started looking for his shoe. It was so dark that we had to use our hands to search. Two hours passed before we finally found the shoe. Exhausted, we lay down in the grass. We started laughing hysterically at how ridiculous it was to spend two hours on what was supposed to be a little joke. Our bellies hurt so much from laughing.  Every time I'm with @PERSON1 is the best time. We always find ways to make each other laugh. Without friends, it would be hard to laugh. Friends are there to laugh at and with. That's why I cherish @PERSON1 and all our happy, laughing times together. You never know when you'll see someone for the last time. I try to be as happy as I can and make people laugh because laughter is the best form of exercise.
19	20739	8	2	Laughter plays a vital role in relationships. In my view, a relationship without laughter is not worth maintaining. I firmly believe that laughter is as important as trust in building and sustaining a relationship.  My boyfriend, @PERSON1, and I have been together for four years. He is incredibly funny, and I love his jokes. Sometimes, he doesn't even intend to be funny, but he still manages to make me laugh. When we first started dating, I was throwing a birthday party. We, along with one of his friends, hid in the woods. When the others came to find us, we jumped out and scared them. They were initially mad, but by nightfall, we were all laughing about it.  My family members also have different relationships with laughter. My parents don't laugh together much. They just go to @ORGANIZATION1 and come home together. My dad likes to crack jokes occasionally, while my mom enjoys laughing at others' misfortunes. My grandma is quite the joker. She tries to make people laugh and sometimes even hopes they'll get hurt so she can have a good laugh.  My friends are all funny. My best friend @LOCATION1 is the funniest girl I've ever known. She loves to dance in a funny way and mock people she dislikes. At work, she always finds something to joke about and shares it with me, often making me laugh uncontrollably.  @LOCATION1's previous relationship was a disaster. She loves to laugh, but her ex - boyfriend hated making jokes. He would just sit on his bed or couch, playing video games or watching wrestling. He made @LOCATION1 clean his room, do the dishes, and take care of his one - year - old sister while he played games. Eventually, @LOCATION1 got fed up and left. Now, she has a funny boyfriend, and they always laugh together.  Laughter isn't limited to human relationships. My cat, @CAPS1, is the king of my house. He loves to follow me around. I enjoy watching him wrestle with other cats. After he eats, he gets a burst of energy and runs all over the house. He'll stop in front of me and stare. If I move, he runs away. His big eyes and sweet meow are so endearing, and his chubby figure makes his antics even funnier.  My horse, @CAPS2, is also a source of laughter. He's four years old and a bit crazy. He tries to play with other horses but often gets hurt. He has a blue eye, which is why I bought him. Watching him be so lively always makes me smile.  In conclusion, laughter is essential in all types of relationships, whether it's with family, friends, or even pets. It can turn a dull relationship into a vibrant one and make life more enjoyable.
20	20741	8	2	Everyone loves laughter. It can be found everywhere. Laughter stems from happiness, and happiness comes from having joy in life. I've experienced a great deal of joy throughout my life, which often leads me to laugh multiple times a day.  My niece, @CAPS3 @CAPS1, is a major source of my laughter. At two years old, she is, in my opinion, the most adorable little girl in the world. Being so young, she has no worries and knows that everything will be taken care of. Her life is full of joy and happiness, which is constantly expressed through her laughter. When I'm with her, we spend our time laughing and playing.  She has a cookie jar that plays a silly song when you put the shapes into the right slots. This song makes her laugh and dance uncontrollably, and it always gets me laughing too. It usually turns into a big laughing session, and these moments are truly the best.  Recently, our family welcomed a new member, my nephew @PERSON1, who is @CAPS2's brother. As @PERSON1 grows and learns new things, @CAPS3 loves it and laughs harder than ever. She finds it extremely funny when he starts laughing. These are the moments that fill my heart with warmth and happiness.  Laughter is indeed a happy and fun emotion. It starts with a smile, which also comes from being happy. My niece and nephew are just one example of the many things that make me laugh and smile. So, what makes you laugh and smile? Laughter enriches our lives and brings us closer to those we love, making it a precious part of our existence.
21	20742	8	2	"Why does laughter have the power to bring people so close? Is it because laughing indicates mutual trust, or perhaps it's simply due to mutual understanding. There are various types of laughter - for instance, when someone cracks a joke or does something extremely embarrassing. The following story is about how a dreadful hunting day transformed into the funniest moments ever. It all began on @TIME1 when I woke up. I had forgotten to transfer my wet clothes from the washing machine to the dryer. So, I had to rummage through all my clothes in my room to find clean camouflage clothes that I could wear. By this time, anyone would be in a foul mood and rushing to get out the door. When my buddy @PERSON1 showed up, ready to go, I wasn't. In my rush, I was bound to forget something, and indeed, I left my gun at home. Five miles down the road, I realized my mistake, so we turned around to retrieve it. Not only were we now late, but we were also speeding to the cabin for breakfast. @PERSON1 had the eggs to make omelets. As we were speeding along, we hit a bump in the road, and everything - I mean everything - hit the truck's ceiling and then crashed to the floor. As a result, all the eggs in the carton broke, leaving us without eggs and thus no breakfast. It was about thirty minutes until shooting hours, and we were late for the blind where @PERSON1 and I were supposed to meet our friends, @PERSON3 and @PERSON2. Finally, we reached the blind just before sunrise. As we were getting set up, a group of twenty mallards unexpectedly dropped in and took off before we could take a shot. We all thought that our chance to redeem ourselves from this terrible @TIME1 was gone. Turns out, those ducks were the only ones we saw all day. Around twelve o'clock, we gave up and headed back to the cabin. On the way, our truck got stuck in two inches of water. I remember thinking to myself, ""@CAPS1 this can't be happening to us right now"". So, @PERSON3, @PERSON2, and I got out of the truck to push, while @PERSON1 stayed inside to drive. We made several attempts to push the truck out, and finally, on the sixth try, we pushed it hard enough to free it from the muddy water. The funny part came when @PERSON1 hit the gas as soon as the truck was free, causing the tires to spin and spray mud everywhere. When I saw the amount of mud flying, I jumped behind @PERSON2 and used him as a shield. By then, @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 were covered head - to - toe in a thick layer of mud. It was impossible not to laugh; it was the funniest thing. @PERSON1 watched it all in the rear - view mirror and, once he was sure the truck wouldn't get stuck again, he fell out of the truck from laughing so hard. Even @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 were laughing a bit. So, when you're having a day where nothing goes right or you're having bad luck, you never know what the day has in store. This was one of the most memorable experiences of that duck season."
22	20743	8	2	"@CAPS1, come up with something to do! I'm really bored!"" @CAPS2 exclaimed as we all relaxed next to his dark - blue @CAPS3, which was parked gracefully outside my house. As young boys in the @ORGANIZATION1, we needed something to occupy ourselves. An idea started to form in my head! I came up with a foolproof and hilarious plan. ""@CAPS4, I've got it!"" I shouted. ""@CAPS1, here it is,"" @CAPS6 quickly replied. ""@CAPS7, since @CAPS2 has a car, he can drive into town, buy some cheap Saran Wrap, then come back to the four - way intersection outside my neighborhood and tie the wrap around two trees on opposite sides of the street so that cars will speed through it!"" I explained in a rush, almost out of breath. My friends burst into loud laughter, and I realized that this idea was brilliant. ""I'll drive and get it, but does anyone have some money to contribute?"" @CAPS2 asked. @LOCATION2, @CAPS6, and I each handed him a single bill. ""That's enough! Give me a few minutes, and then we can meet at the intersection outside @CAPS10's neighborhood."" @CAPS2 said as he brushed everyone off his car and drove out of my neighborhood. ""@CAPS12, text me when you're about to get back!"" I shouted as the sound of his poorly - maintained engine echoed in the @TIME1 sky. Minutes passed quickly, and the rest of us sat on the curb, chatting and waiting for @CAPS2. My custom ringtone for incoming texts rang. I quickly scanned the phone and saw that @CAPS2 was at the four - way intersection with the Saran Wrap. ""@CAPS15, let's go! @CAPS2 is ready, and @CAPS1, let's do this,"" I said as I grabbed my jacket and headed out of my neighborhood. @CAPS6 followed, and @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 brought up the rear. I yelled again to encourage everyone. @CAPS2's car lights illuminated the @ORGANIZATION1 air as he signaled his location. We all jogged to the driveway of a for - sale house near the neighborhood exit where @CAPS2 was parked. ""@CAPS17, you've waited long enough,"" @CAPS2 said. ""Well, we're all here! So, @CAPS1, go to the intersection and set this up!"" @PERSON1 said as he started leading us towards the intersection, about fifty yards away. When we reached the intersection, there were no cars. We seized the opportunity. ""@NUM1 and @PERSON1, keep an eye out for cars!"" I shouted as @CAPS2 and I started the task. I quickly opened the Saran Wrap, ran across the road, and uncoiled it as I went. Once @CAPS2 and I were on opposite sides of the street, we tied the wrap around the trees. After checking that it was perfect, I sprinted to a short fence where I guessed my friends were hiding. ""Ha - ha, this is perfect! I made sure everything is right!"" I said as we all looked at the delicately - hung wrap across the two - way street. ""@CAPS21, we have to wait,"" @PERSON2 said. We all kept checking for cars. Since it was around @NUM2 pm, most people in @LOCATION1 were either sleeping or inside. Suddenly, a car came speeding from @CAPS21, only @NUM3 yards from our prank. ""@CAPS22,"" I yelled as the car got closer. Boom! The car sped through the Saran Wrap and screeched to a halt. We burst into laughter as the car was in disarray. But the angry male driver heard our laughter and got out of his car to chase us. ""@CAPS23, run!"" I screamed. We all started running just as the man reached the fence where we were hiding. Unfortunately, it was too late for @CAPS6. The angry man caught him, and the rest of us ran to my house. As soon as we reached my house, we started wondering what had happened to @CAPS6. Suddenly, @CAPS6 came running from @CAPS21. When he reached us, we burst into laughter again. The whole left side of @CAPS6 was dripping with soda. @CAPS6 never told us what had happened that @ORGANIZATION1, though we could guess. As that long @ORGANIZATION1 came to an end, we called it a day and went to sleep at my house. Laughter filled the air as we drifted off to sleep."
23	20745	8	2	"It was the @DATE1 of this @DATE2. After a long @DATE1 filled with crying, lots of goodbyes, I was finally at the airport, waiting for my flight to @LOCATION1. I've been to that airport countless times. I love @LOCATION2, but it's always exciting to go on vacation. I usually go with my parents quite often. However, today was different; this wasn't a vacation. I was going to be away for a whole year. My parents wouldn't be with me. Just thinking about being away from them and all my friends in @LOCATION2 for such a long time made me feel sick to my stomach. Especially since in @NUM1, I would be meeting my host parents whom I had never seen before, and I wondered if they would be normal or really strange. Once on the plane, I sat next to a young girl who had been studying architecture in @LOCATION2 and was going home for winter, while I was leaving it behind. She asked, ""@CAPS1, do you speak English?"" I replied, ""I try to."" She laughed. She looked nice, with a big smile and was quite pretty. We started talking, and she could sense how nervous and anxious I was. She asked if I was okay, and I told her that I was going to be a foreign exchange student for the next year and shared my concerns, like meeting new people and missing home. She said, ""You'll be fine. Don't worry about it. I wish I had that chance when I was your age."" Then she changed the subject. After a long conversation, she started reading a magazine, and I put on my music. As we were about to reach @LOCATION1, she suddenly screamed so loudly that it made me jump. We laughed for a long time. She couldn't even talk to me or explain why she had screamed because everyone was looking at us, which made it even funnier and a bit embarrassing. She couldn't stop laughing. Then she told me that the guy in the picture of her magazine had gone to high school with her a few years ago, and they had been together for a while, but they had lost touch after graduation. He was now working at a bank and making good money. That good time with her, even though I haven't seen her again, made me really happy. By the time we got off the plane, I was more confident and had almost forgotten about all my nervousness. After @NUM2 months here, everything is going perfectly. I'm sure that even though it was just a few laughs and not a long time on the plane, when I go back to @LOCATION2 and think about this experience, I'll think of her. I'll count that moment as my first great experience."
24	20746	8	2	"In the relationships I've had, there has always been a mix of laughter, love, sadness, anger, and complications. However, there was one person I was in a relationship with who rarely laughed. It was rather boring and sad. I would spend hours trying to get even a small giggle or a sound of laughter from him. He was a very gentle soul, someone who wouldn't harm a fly, but he just couldn't laugh, even when he was happy. I would often ask him, ""Are you sure you're happy? You don't seem like it. I never see you smiling or laughing; all I see is a frown."" I said this with a sour face. He replied, ""Yes, @CAPS1, I am happy. Just because I don't laugh doesn't mean I'm not. Besides, with that silly grin on your face, how could I not be happy?"" I simply shrugged and continued. ""Then why can't you laugh?"" I asked. He replied in a drowsy voice, as he was getting tired of this topic every day. ""It's not that I can't laugh; it's that I choose not to."" I asked, ""Well, why on earth would you do that?"" He sighed and huffed, really fed up with the topic. ""All right, if you don't stop this,"" he said in a gentle but strained voice, ""I'm going to have to stop being so nice to you, and I might not talk to you for the rest of the year."" Of course, he was joking. He could never be mean to me, and besides, he was my best friend; he couldn't stop talking to me. We dropped the topic, and it wasn't brought up again until the @DATE1 when I saw him. It was a cold @DATE2 morning when I walked out of my house to go to school. I saw a big moving rental truck outside his house and immediately knew that he hadn't lied to me but had just not told me he was moving away. I thought it might be because of me always asking him why he wouldn't laugh, but that seemed like a silly reason to leave. I went to his house, not caring if I was late or didn't go to school that @DATE2. I had to find out why he was leaving. When I got to the porch, he was walking to the door, and I blocked the doorway. I told him he had to answer me if he wanted to take the box of clothes to the truck. He said, ""My father got a promotion at work, and now we have to move to New York."" I started to cry. I was about eight years old, and he was twelve. I knew I wouldn't see him again, so I made sure we hung out before he left. That night at the park, he voluntarily told me, ""@CAPS1, I know you've always wondered why I don't laugh. Like I said, it's not that I can't; it's that I don't want to. When I was young, I was teased because of my smile."" I didn't understand. I asked, ""Why? You're so nice. Why would"
25	20747	8	2	"These days you don't really need a reason to laugh. Laughter just radiates out of some people as frequent as a breath of air. I believe that everyone has someone they can laugh with because everyone has someone they enjoy being around. One of the people I enjoy being around most is my best friend @PERSON1. No matter what the situation, whenever we are around each other we end up having fun. Laughter can turn a bad day completely around. One of my most recent examples of the power of laughter happened just a few weeks ago. One of my, ""friends"", tried to play a cruel joke on me that ended up being a bigger mistake than she could have imagined. Once I had figured out that this person whom I once trusted was trying to spite me I became overwhelmed with my emotions. At one point I actually considered attacking this girl right in the middle of every one in school. Thankfully I used my better judgment to run away from her, and hide instead of hurt her. Half of the class period progressed and I was still very upset and unprepared to confront her. So there I stayed safe in hiding until my best friend found me. @PERSON1 had come to comfort me after she got wind of what happened. She talked to me until I calmed down and my tears stopped. She made me feel much better. Her just being there for me, and being able to remonis in the fun times we had together and the laughs we shared, seemed to make all my problems disappear. Eventually she convinced me to go talk to my,""friend"", who as it turns out was ashamed of herself for her actions. We were able to make up and return to a somewhat normal life. To this day and more than likely for the rest of my life I will believe that laughter is the best medicine. I guess I'm lucky in that I have found the best person in life for me to share all of my laughter with. Every body has to have a somebody."
26	20748	8	2	Friends aren't always as we envision them, and they're not always easy to find. However, with a smile and a laugh, friendship can blossom. After all, what's a friendship without those moments when you laugh uncontrollably, until you can't breathe and feel as if you've done a hundred sit - ups?  In the year of @NUM1, I was new to @ORGANIZATION1. In homeroom, everyone stared at me as if I were a criminal, and I felt they talked behind my back. My homeroom teacher gave me my schedule. Sixth period was @CAPS2 class with @PERSON1. I had no idea what @CAPS2 was until I entered the gym. Turning the rusty doorknob, I walked in and discovered it was a one - wheeled bike. I was amused that I hadn't known this before.  Looking around, I realized I was the only sixth - grader. I sat down and was trying to confirm this when a girl around my age entered. I wanted to talk to her but was too embarrassed. When @PERSON1 asked us to form groups of two, I asked her to be my partner. We started using the unicycles, with our partners helping us get on and ride until we could manage alone.  After class, I told her my name was @PERSON3, and she introduced herself as @CAPS3. I was excited for the next class as I now had someone to talk to. But the next time, she was absent, and I had to be partners with Savannah, a girly girl who just wanted to talk and didn't want to ride the @CAPS2. By the end of the day, I was fed up with her and hadn't practiced my unicycle riding.  I hoped @CAPS3 would come the next day, and she did. This time, we had to create a routine with our partner to a chosen song. As we practiced, we suddenly fell. We stared at each other and burst into laughter. I couldn't breathe, and she almost peed. It was one of the best moments that year, and I felt we could become the best of friends.  Now, we're really close. That single moment of shared laughter brought us close at heart. We believe that the more you laugh, the younger you look, and I think it's true. Everyone has a story about how they met someone and became close. I'm certain that in every friendship, it's a smile or laughter that brings people together. That kind of laughing moment is simple yet special, leaving a mark on your heart and changing how you feel around that person. It transformed my acquaintance with @CAPS3 into an inseparable and amazing friendship.
27	20751	8	2	On a normal, bright, and warm @DATE1 day at the start of my fifth - grade year, my older sister, some neighbors around our age (including a boy), and I had been playing all day. We were at a loss for what to do as it was too hot to walk in the sun. So, we decided to play in the shade with the new slingshot my @CAPS1 had made from an old swing - set seat. I thought our neighbor would like it.  We all went to the garage to get it. My sister offered to retrieve it since it was hanging high, but I refused as it was my idea to show it. As I concentrated on stretching and reaching for it, I noticed everyone around me giggling. My concentration wavered as I wondered what they were laughing at. After a moment of confusion, I realized my sister had pulled down my pants in front of the boy neighbor.  I picked up my pants, looked at my sister, and started hitting her weakly with my fists. Then I ran to my room, crying all the way. A few moments later, my sister came in and tried to bribe me out from under the covers with the last two fruit roll - ups. She sat on my bed for half an hour, but I didn't move. I could feel her eyes on me through the sheets.  That night, I finally emerged. My sister kept apologizing, but I was still upset. The next day, the situation remained the same. She continued to apologize, and I ignored her. Then my @CAPS1 told me that my sister was terribly sorry and upset because I wasn't talking to her. At first, I thought it was strange, but I realized I hadn't treated her well, even though I was unhappy with her.  After hearing what my @CAPS1 said, I decided it wasn't worth staying mad. I went to talk to my sister for the first time in days. She said she didn't mean to hurt my feelings; she was just joking around. After discussing it, I concluded that I got so upset because she did it in front of our friend. We often joke around, but usually only in front of family. I was afraid it would scare our neighbor away, but he came back to play a few days later.  Even though I was embarrassed, I admitted it was pretty funny. We had a good laugh about it and were no longer at odds. I learned that dwelling on the past gets you nowhere, and you should learn to laugh things off. Now, whenever this incident is brought up, we laugh so hard that tears roll down our faces. It has become a shared memory that has brought us closer.
28	20754	8	2	Making someone laugh is an incredibly rewarding experience that brings one closer to inner happiness. I firmly believe that when you feel good inside, it means you've done something right. I once felt down about something I can't even recall, but when I helped someone, I knew I'd done something special.  My mother has a great sense of humor and always craves something funny. People love laughing so much that it's as if they've consumed an energy drink, unable to stop. It's often said that laughter is healthy for the soul and can prolong both the soul and the body. Laughter is a non - verbal way of self - expression and can be an excellent ice - breaker for a conversation. Positive thinking leads to good choices, especially when happiness guides you through life. By making someone laugh, you can dispel awkwardness, and it's always better to laugh than to be sad.  Everyone has an addiction or something they rely on. My mom's addiction is laughter. She laughs at work and especially at home when I'm around. However, sometimes she gets down when things go wrong. I hate seeing her like this because it makes me feel down too. When she's sad, it seems like nothing can cheer her up. And when one person is depressed, that feeling spreads to those close to them.  Eventually, I get tired of seeing my mom sad. In such situations, I can't help but do something ridiculous to cheer her up, like dancing funny or telling a made - up school story. I enjoy putting a smile on her face when I have the chance.  My mom and I mean the world to each other, and we try to support each other. One day, she came home from work and saw that my dad hadn't made dinner. She got angry at him, thinking it was stupid of him not to cook. She started making dinner but did it all wrong, mixing spices in the wrong pan. I wanted to tell her, but my dad held me back to avoid making her angrier.  When she finished and served the food, it smelled bad because she'd cooked it out of anger. My dad forced us to eat it, but we didn't want to. To cheer her up, I turned on the @CAPS1, changed the @CAPS2 to the music @CAPS2, and started dancing like I had ants in my pants. She laughed so hard that she was in a good mood for the rest of the day.  I think it's great when people are happy, and I enjoy seeing smiles on their faces. Smiling is a step towards laughter, and it brings a positive atmosphere. My mom and I take walks to stay close. We often get smiles from people we meet, and that's the best feeling in the world. Joy can free you from your problems.
29	20755	8	2	"Laughter is the key to the soul."" Whether you're having the worst or the best day of your life, laughing can always improve the situation. One day, I was sitting in @CAPS2 class, extremely bored. Suddenly, a shy and quiet kid started laughing uncontrollably. It was as if the kid was on ""laughing gas"" and couldn't stop. The kid laughed so hard that he/she couldn't breathe.  This made me laugh, and then my best friend sitting next to me also started laughing. Soon, the entire class was laughing. Even if some students in @CAPS2 class were bored or having a bad day, the laughter spread throughout the room, turning it into a better day.  Laughter spreads rapidly, making everyone happier. And when you're happier, you're healthier. Therefore, a @CAPS2 relationship must have laughter to work. When you ask someone about what they like about their boyfriend or girlfriend in a @CAPS2 relationship, they'll almost always say, ""He/she makes me laugh.""  Conversely, when there's no laughter in a relationship, there are more fights, disagreements, and disappointments. The more you laugh, the better your life becomes, and the more you can enjoy it. So, have you laughed today?"
30	20756	8	2	There are numerous joys in life. Some are more significant than others, and some are so obvious that it would be foolish not to notice them. Have you ever sat on your porch or stared out the window to watch the sunrise, reflecting on your life, its unique qualities, all the great memories, shared laughs, sorrows, pain, love, and hate? It's not surprising that most people have done this and wondered if they could change things, how they would do it, or if they'd leave their life as it is, feeling complete and having no regrets.  For all the tears I've shed and the pain I've endured, there's always been a laugh to overcome the sadness. Sometimes, I sit and ponder my life. Although I'm young and my real experiences are yet to come, I've learned a great deal from what has happened to me. I've realized that no matter how hard you plan your life, there will always be unexpected things or people. All you can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst.  It's not difficult to be happy. Just keep an open mind and a light heart, and you'll find yourself laughing with the world and enjoying your time on this amazing planet, @LOCATION1. So, listen to your parents or the person you admire most.  There are many things that keep me going, like my boyfriend and my love for animals. But the most important thing isn't just one thing; it's a combination of things such as love, laughter, new beginnings, old endings, a bright new path (you just need to take it), the endless possibilities of the universe, and the idea that there might be other planets with life, perhaps even intelligent life.  It's easy to find reasons to live and even easier to find reasons to die. Hopefully, you'll focus on the reasons to live. I remember a time when I was so down that I thought I'd never be happy and that I didn't fit in with the world's confusing aspects. I felt like I was at the end of my path. But then, as I sat by an old road and looked at the stars, I thought about all the things I'd miss if I ended my life. I thought about naming my children, getting married, and whether our love would last.  After that evening, I decided to continue my life and become a better person. I want a bright future with a romantic love story to tell my children. I also want to find peace in a noisy world, help animals co - exist with us instead of pushing them aside or abusing their rights, and solve the pollution problem that humans have contributed to.  Even though I'm just one person, I believe that what I do or say can make an impact. If I want to look back and laugh, I need to do my part to make this planet a shared and healthy place.
31	20757	8	2	"One year, on @DATE1, a boy named @PERSON1 wanted to do something more exciting than just staying in his room playing video games all day. He heard from a friend about a play called ""@CAPS1 In @LOCATION1"" and decided to inquire if he could join and assist. To his surprise, he not only got involved but also landed a part in the play and helped backstage whenever possible.  @PERSON1 thoroughly enjoyed the experience and made many friends. At the same time, there was a girl named @ORGANIZATION1. She didn't talk much to @PERSON1 initially, but she secretly liked him and didn't share this with many people. @ORGANIZATION1 also tried to make as many friends as she could during the play and spent a lot of time with them.  As the play neared its end, @PERSON1 started hanging out with @PERSON2, who is @ORGANIZATION1's older brother. He began to pay more attention to @ORGANIZATION1 and learned from her brother that she liked him. In fact, @PERSON1 had already noticed her feelings from the way she acted around him.  After the success of ""@CAPS1 In @LOCATION1"", @PERSON1 joined another play called ""@CAPS2 in @LOCATION1"" because he had so much fun in the first one. He found that he already knew most of the people from the previous play and started talking to those he hadn't met yet. This was when @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 started conversing, and they discovered that they loved each other's laughter. They quickly became very close friends.  The reason for their rapid friendship could be that @PERSON1 was very good at making friends, and @ORGANIZATION1 didn't have many close friends. At school, kids used to make fun of her for being smart, which led her to be homeschooled and lose some of her friends. @PERSON1 soon realized that @ORGANIZATION1 was afraid of losing him as a friend because she had lost so many before.  As the second play was ending, @PERSON1 asked @ORGANIZATION1 if she liked him. She initially said no but later felt bad and told the truth. They both knew that due to their age difference (@PERSON1 was @NUM1 and @ORGANIZATION1 was @NUM2), they could only be friends. So, they agreed to maintain their friendship.  During the play's final moments, they used every minute to strengthen their bond. By the end, they were close friends, enjoying each other's company and laughter. Even after the play, they talked whenever they could, though they didn't see each other often. They looked back on their good times together and the fun they had in the plays. They agreed to do the plays again next @DATE1 and were looking forward to seeing each other and having more great conversations. In the end, I believe that @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 will be friends for a long time, and perhaps in the future, their relationship could evolve further. Only time will tell."
32	20758	8	2	"I never thought that laughter could be the key to starting a conversation with a stranger, but @CAPS4 proved me wrong. Just sharing a laugh with someone can lead to a new acquaintance. For me, the first thing I do when someone tries to be funny is laugh. Once you understand what the other person is talking about, you forget that you're just getting to know them.  This happened to me in @LOCATION1, a place my family and I visit every year in @DATE1. One day, my cousins, sister, and I went to a small store near our accommodation to buy candy and other items to take home. To my surprise, I saw one of my cousins with his friends, and they were all laughing about something.  At first, I couldn't hear what they were saying, but as we got closer, I heard a hilarious comment. I couldn't help but start laughing. One of his friends noticed me laughing and thought I was laughing at him. He asked me, and I explained that I had accidentally overheard their conversation. He then started laughing too and said, ""That was funny, wasn't it?"" I replied, ""Yes, it was. I didn't know you made jokes like that.""  We continued talking, and I started laughing again. He asked what he said, and I told him I was just remembering his earlier comment, which was really funny. I couldn't forget what he said, probably because our meeting was so unexpected. I had never met a guy by laughing first, and I thought it was a great way to start a conversation.  Laughing with someone shows that you're interested in their topic and understand them. We had a great conversation and talked about my vacations. I told him that I love coming to @LOCATION1 every year and that I sometimes wish I could live there because it's so calm. He agreed with me as he knew what it was like to live in @LOCATION1 but had no idea about other places.  As our conversation continued, we noticed that our group had left us. We laughed about it and went to find them. They were still shopping and didn't seem to notice we were gone. From that day on, I realized that laughter can break the ice and create a connection. Now, whenever I go to @LOCATION1, I know I have a new friend, and I believe I can make more friends by simply sharing a laugh."
33	20759	8	2	"As I sat in the car, eagerly awaiting the moment to meet my best friend and the man I'm in love with, nervous laughter bubbled up inside me. It wasn't because of something my mother or brother said or something I saw; it was pure nervousness. Despite countless phone calls, numerous text messages, and countless emails, I was still on edge. I knew him better than most people, yet my anxiety seemed to be getting the better of me.  As our black rental sedan pulled up to where he was waiting outside his family's home, my nerves intensified. What if he wasn't who I thought he was? What if he didn't like me? What if I didn't like him? But as soon as he stepped into the car, smiling brightly at me, all my nervousness melted away. I smiled back, and he said, ""Hello, @PERSON1."" I replied, ""Hello, @PERSON2,"" my stomach fluttering with butterflies.  He reached out and gently took my hand, asking, ""How was the drive?"" I answered, ""Long, and nerve-wracking,"" my nervous laughter returning. He said, ""But you're here now, and I'm very happy you are,"" with a warm smile.  For the rest of the car ride to the restaurant, our conversation flowed effortlessly. We were two guys in love, experiencing this new feeling together, and we were incredibly happy. We held hands and talked, and I felt as if I had known him my whole life, not just the year and a half we had been in touch.  When we arrived at @ORGANIZATION1, we were both hungry. However, we had to wait half an hour for a table. Once seated, my mother, who was overjoyed that I had found someone I loved, started telling stories about my childhood. It was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life, and I blushed bright red. But @PERSON2 laughed and joked with me, which made my nervous laughter turn into genuine laughter. It also helped that he was holding my hand under the table.  After dinner and dessert, we went to the nearby mall. My mom and brother went one way, and @PERSON2 and I went another. We bought some clothes and ended up in my favorite bookstore, @ORGANIZATION3's. In the young adult fiction section, @PERSON2 stared at me. When I asked why, he said, ""You just look very... In your element."" I pretended to be confused, and he just smiled and took my hand again.  He pulled me closer and asked if he could be a little forward. I nodded yes, and he kissed me gently on the lips. I blushed and started to giggle after our lips parted. He raised an eyebrow, and I knew what he was thinking. I said, ""That felt fantastic,"" touching my lips. He simply said, ""Good,"" and kissed me again. He told me he loved my laugh, and I felt on top of the world. I was truly in love, and it was the best feeling I had ever experienced.  Since then, we've been together, and whenever I think about that day, I can't help but giggle happily. Laughter was the bridge that connected us, and it has made our relationship stronger than ever."
34	20760	8	2	"Fourth period in freshman year was the highlight of my entire freshman year. Most people called him @LOCATION1, but I simply called him @CAPS1.  In the first semester of ninth - grade physical science, I had the class with my best friend, @PERSON1. Since we could choose our seats, we sat in the back, right - hand corner of the classroom to have more freedom, like passing notes and talking during class. One day, while passing a notebook of notes, I must have written something that embarrassed @PERSON1. When I reached into my backpack, she took the opportunity to shove me out of my desk. The class went quiet as @CAPS1 was giving notes and showing us how to do the assignment. We burst into fits of laughter. I nervously looked at @CAPS1, expecting him to be angry and send us out. Instead, he just shook his head, laughed a little to himself, and continued talking. We tried hard to stop laughing.  In the second term, @PERSON1 was no longer in the class with me. I was with my friends @CAPS3 - @CAPS4, @CAPS5.@CAPS5, and @PERSON2. I was even closer to @CAPS1 than in the first term. One day, while teaching us about compounds and writing a chart to help us study, he suddenly sang out, ""@CAPS7 play the @CAPS8 @CAPS9!"" In seconds, the whole class erupted in laughter, and even he couldn't stop writing due to his own laughter. It took us about ten minutes to calm down.  Another fun moment was when we were doing example problems on our own. A classmate, @LOCATION2, asked how to let @CAPS1 know we were finished. @CAPS1 thought for a moment and said, ""When you finish your problems, cluck like a chicken for me."" Soon, people started clucking, and it was hilarious at first but got a bit annoying as more people finished.  We didn't have a proper science laboratory in our regular classroom, so the other science teacher, @CAPS15, let us use her classroom for a school @CAPS14 as her class had an online report to do. @CAPS1 banned me from using matches because his nickname for me was @CAPS16 - @CAPS17. On the final day, a bunch of glass test tubes were broken. When I asked what happened, he initially blamed a classmate but started laughing when he looked at me, giving himself away. I told him not to blame others for his mistakes, especially breaking the test tubes.  There was also the time I went to his @CAPS18 class to do homework at my friend's request. After he finished giving notes and the assignment, some friends of @CAPS3 @CAPS19 asked him if he was a swimmer and if he shaved his legs. He seemed embarrassed and said not to waste class time on personal questions. I thought it was funny that he didn't just give a simple yes or no answer.  These were the fun times I'll never forget. No other class or teacher can replace fourth - period physical science and @LOCATION1. He will always be my favorite teacher, and I'll always cherish the memories of that class."
35	20761	8	2	"I often wonder why people laugh. People laugh when something is funny, when situations are awkward, or when they're embarrassed or offended. Sometimes, I even find myself laughing for no apparent reason. I believe that making someone laugh is a great accomplishment as it shows emotions openly.  Every year since I moved here six and @DATE1, my two cousins, sisters, and I have gone ""cheese ball caroling"" with our grandparents around @CAPS1 time. Even after my grandpa passed away in @DATE4 and my older sister left for college, we continued this tradition.  On the twenty - first of @DATE2, we take turns going secret @LOCATION1 shopping with a grandparent while making cheese balls by hand. After all five of us have gone, we wrap the cheese balls, add a ribbon, and practice our carols for the evening.  We always make a list before caroling. The list includes the names of the houses we'll visit, the number of cheese balls to deliver to each house, and the song we'll sing. Usually, there are about twenty - five to thirty people on the list, all of whom are family members, close friends, or colleagues of our grandparents.  Last year was the first time we caroled without my older sister, who had gone to college the @DATE3 before. At first, it didn't seem different, but as the day went on, I felt the pressure building. With my sister and grandpa gone, the responsibility seemed to fall on me as the oldest grand - kid.  When we started, I tried to relax and have fun. My grandma asked me to add a name to the list. Later, she said we had to come up with a special song for that family. That's when I realized the name was familiar because I used to go to school with a boy with the same last name. I asked my grandma to confirm, and it was indeed the same family."
36	20762	8	2	"Laughter is the essence of true happiness; all one needs to do is laugh to embrace it. I recall being the new student in the @NUM1 grade. It was a brand - new school with a new bus and new everything. I had no idea where anything was. Being the new kid is tough; you often get mocked and may not fit in. That was my story - I never truly fit in.  One bright, sunny day with not a cloud in the sky, I was walking up the stairs to my class. As I climbed, I tripped and fell backward. My skirt flipped over my head, and in that era, character underpants were in vogue. Everyone pointed and laughed at me, first because I'd fallen and second because I was wearing Dora underpants. I endured a whole day of people laughing at me, but truthfully, I laughed along. I genuinely thought it was funny; who wouldn't find falling down and showing your underpants comical?  Afterward, a girl named @CAPS2 approached me and told me I wasn't the only one who wore character underpants. We laughed uncontrollably that day, just remembering me falling down the stairs. Being the new kid could be embarrassing, but I'd been in such situations countless times, so it didn't bother me as much as others thought.  @CAPS2 and I became great friends. We laughed all the time, like when she fell into the ice - cold water at the park or when I fell down the stairs. To this day, we still talk about it; it's an unforgettable memory. And yes, it was pretty funny when my character underpants showed.  In conclusion, the quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" holds true. One must have a good laugh to start the day right. If you don't laugh throughout the day, something's amiss. Just because you're growing older doesn't mean you should abandon your ability to laugh. Laughing is the part of the day when you can be carefree. So, what's your funny story?"
37	20763	8	2	"The first time I saw @ORGANIZATION1, she completely captivated me. She was my other half, and every moment we spent together was perfect. Her every word made me laugh; she truly was my better half.  I still remember seeing her in @CAPS1. The town was nicknamed @CAPS1 @CAPS4 hell because it was in the middle of nowhere. My parents had retired a few months prior and were searching for a cozy retirement home away from the big cities, closer to the beautiful eastern @LOCATION2 mountains with their snowy peaks and stunning landscapes.  We took a trailer and stayed there for about a week. That trailer was a nightmare; every time we stopped, I had to set everything up, even if we weren't going to use it. It was a two - hour process, and after doing it so many times, I got bored.  Finding a great house to stay in that town was easy. The houses were all amazing, homemade by the town's men. They were incredible two - story oak houses that seemed strong enough to withstand a tornado with only minor damage. We found a house that was so amazing I wanted to live there right away, and surprisingly, my parents felt the same. But we had to sell our current house first to afford it, so we put it on the ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"" and went back to the trailer.  I was incredibly bored during the remaining @NUM1 days. I needed something to do other than tend to the fire and watch the hot dogs. I rode my dad's bike into town (the trailer park was half a mile out). The town was disappointing; riding around and making small talk in the shops was as boring as sitting by the fire in @NUM2 - degree weather. I thought it was just another dull vacation, but little did I know it was about to get more exciting.  The next day, after showering and getting ready, I rode my bike around a corner and saw a group of guys and girls who looked like they'd just had fun fishing or tubing. I rode over to see what was going on and started talking to a guy named @CAPS8. He told me they'd just returned from a youth - group get - together on the snake, where they'd gone tubing and cliff - jumping. I was in awe; it seemed crazy for a youth group. But that's how they did things in @CAPS1. They didn't just have picnics; they did wild things I'd never done, partly because I'm not that daring and partly because I'd never had the chance.  Before they left, they invited me on their nature hike up the mountain. I was thrilled as I love hiking. The next morning at @TIME1, I was excited and ready. I had my permission slip signed and jumped on my dad's bike. I arrived at the youth administrator's house just in time for a protein shake. We drove to the mountain, and at the base, there were about @NUM3 - @NUM4 people in hiking gear. That's when I met @LOCATION1. She was gorgeous, and I was immediately attracted to her. We started climbing and talking; we got along so well. Her laugh made me extremely happy. She was my other half, and all I can remember is her amazing laugh."
38	20764	8	2	The @CAPS3 story is about a time when I had a rather unfortunate yet funny experience. About four or five years ago, on a hot day, I went to a friend's house for the @TIME1. My friend and I wanted to have fun and stay cool, so we went to the garage, found a sprinkler, and put it under the trampoline. This made the trampoline wet and slippery.  We started jumping on the trampoline. My friend was jumping higher than me, and I was losing my bounce. When he came down at the same time as me, his greater bounce and weight made me bounce much higher than usual. When I came back down, I landed on my back, and the angle on the trampoline sent me flying off.  As I was bounced off, I thought I'd get hurt. I'd rather have a few scratches than land on dog manure, but that's exactly what happened. I landed on a pile of it, and it stank up my shirt terribly. After taking off my shirt, I started jumping again and jumped for the whole day.  I don't regret it because it made everyone, including me, have a good laugh. The @CAPS3 story is a testament to the power of laughter. Even when something bad happens, it can turn into a source of fun in the end.
39	20765	8	2	"Have you ever been so scared that you couldn't sleep all night? Were you with a group of @NUM1 friends at the time? Telling scary stories can be fun until someone gets too frightened and spoils the mood.  It all started when we were having a party after the parents went upstairs to sleep. It was our ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" night. We, the @CAPS5 kids, considered ourselves as @CAPS1. The night involved @NUM2 antsy @LOCATION1, @NUM1 frightened teenagers, and a supposedly ""@CAPS6"" house.  The guests arrived at my house around @NUM4 pm. We started by playing video games, laughing, eating, and playing board games - a typical teenage party. But when the parents went to bed, we brought out the ""@CAPS7 or @CAPS8"" games. You might have thought we'd play the unrated version, but we're the @CAPS5 kids. We played games like ""I @CAPS8 you to run around the house three times"" or ""@CAPS9 you ever kissed someone?""  After a while, we got bored of that game. We then planned to play sing - star on the @NUM5, but @LOCATION3 brought the wrong cords, so we couldn't hook up the console. Since that didn't work, we started chatting and taking pictures of the @CAPS1. As it was our ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"", it was essential to take group pictures.  In our @CAPS1 role - play, I was the father, @PERSON3 was the mother, @LOCATION3 was the cat, @PERSON8 was the @CAPS12, @PERSON9, @PERSON5, @CAPS13, and @PERSON6 were my children, @PERSON1 was my brother, @PERSON7 was the strange woman, @PERSON4 was the sister - in - law, and @LOCATION2 was our cable guy. We all wore costumes for the photos. It took some time to get everyone to cooperate, but we managed to take the pictures.  After that, it was time to eat. I'd ordered @NUM6 different large pizzas - Hawaiian, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, @CAPS16 @CAPS17, @CAPS18, @CAPS19 @PERSON2, and @CAPS20. One of my ""daughters"" (@CAPS13) dropped her pizza on the carpet, leaving a big red stain. We all panicked. @PERSON9 got the cleaner, I got the rags, @PERSON4 got the @CAPS22, and @PERSON7 took pictures while we cleaned.  After cleaning up, it was @CAPS23 movie time. We all snuggled on the couch to watch The @CAPS24. But when @PERSON4 got up to use the bathroom, the @CAPS25 turned off, all the lights in the house went out, and we saw shadows on the living - room walls. @CAPS13 started crying, @LOCATION2 complained, @PERSON4 wouldn't go to the bathroom, and I freaked out.  Since the lights wouldn't come back on, we sat in a circle on the carpet and told scary stories. Most were real, and some were myths. One story @PERSON6 told was about a possessed @CAPS26 with no left leg. My @LOCATION1, which also had no left leg, started acting up and attacking the guests. I used my dog whistle to calm it down.  After all the commotion, my parents didn't wake up, and we went to my room to continue talking about the @CAPS23 stories. The main lesson from this night is that with laughter and friends, you can overcome any fear. It was one of the funniest and most memorable parties I've ever had."
40	20766	8	2	"Laughter and a sense of exuberance are crucial in any good relationship. Being able to share moments of joy with someone close is a sign of comfort and can strengthen friendships. Your true self often shines through your sense of humor.  Two years ago, in @PERSON1's seventh - grade math class at @ORGANIZATION1, I was selected to be part of the @ORGANIZATION2, along with just three other classmates. Being in the @ORGANIZATION2 meant we'd teach ourselves @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 using only textbooks, while @PERSON1 taught the rest of the class easier math. It was like an elite club. Our classmates were jealous because we got to sit at the back, had no homework, and weren't randomly called on to answer questions in front of the class.  As immature seventh - graders, we took advantage of this great opportunity. I quickly befriended @PERSON4, @PERSON3, and @CAPS3. @PERSON4 and I were already friends, but working in the @ORGANIZATION2 brought us even closer. To this day, @PERSON4 is one of my best friends, and I still keep in touch with the other two.  We were all different. @PERSON3 was popular, @CAPS3 hung out with smart kids into chess and reading, and @PERSON4 and I were just ordinary. However, we shared a sick sense of humor and intelligence.  We found the self - taught work extremely easy. We breezed through the book with no questions. As a result, we finished our work quickly and had more than half of the class time to relax, eat, and have fun.  One day after lunch, as we walked into @PERSON1's math class, I complained, ""@PERSON4, I don't feel like doing math @DATE2. I'm exhausted."" She replied, ""@CAPS6 neither. Let's just pretend to work."" We went to the back table where @CAPS3 and @PERSON3 were sitting. They had their books out but looked bored.  I lied, saying, ""@CAPS8 uh, I was talking to @LOCATION1 @TIME1, and he said we don't have to work @DATE2. We can just hang out."" @CAPS3 and @PERSON3 caught on and grinned. @PERSON3 took out a brown paper bag from her backpack and offered us food. I grabbed a miniature chocolate pie. While eating it, I dipped my finger in the chocolate and wiped it on the window behind @CAPS6. @PERSON4 noticed and started chuckling. She exclaimed, ""@CAPS10, what's that?!"" loud enough for the class to hear. @PERSON1 and a few classmates glanced over but went back to the lesson. It wasn't really funny, but we all started giggling.  As the laughter died down, @PERSON3 said, ""@CAPS11 guys, I had a crazy dream @TIME2. I went to a @DATE1 camp, and @PERSON2 was a camp counselor in khaki pants and a white shirt with blue pinstripes, and he had a clipboard!"" We stared blankly and then burst out laughing again. It was funny because @PERSON2 often substituted for our teachers and always wore that outfit.  Our laughter stopped, and we sat in silence. Suddenly, @CAPS3 leaned back in his squeaky swivel"
41	20767	8	2	"People often claim that laughter has numerous benefits. However, in my view, laughter isn't always the best thing as it can carry various meanings. When I think of laughter, I associate it with smiles, happiness, and memories. Yet, there's one memory of laughter that doesn't fit this positive association.  I pleaded with my friend's mother, saying, ""I really don't wanna be here. I don't know if I can stay and tell him this. Please let me go back home."" She replied, ""You need to do this, honey. It's for the best."" At that point, I always thought she knew best, but now I wasn't so certain.  I sat patiently, holding back tears, waiting for my friend's father to return home. I knew he was at the bar and silently thanked him for giving me time to think. I was supposed to tell him how I felt about his constant alcohol - drinking. Every time I went there, he was either drunk or on his way to being drunk. I was scared, both for his health and because I thought I might be the reason for his drinking. But I was getting older and needed to express my thoughts and feelings.  While lost in these thoughts, he stormed through the door. When I looked up at my friend's drunk father, my heart dropped. I burst into tears as my friend's mother held me in her arms. She soothed me, saying, ""It's alright."" My friend's father looked at me without recognition and went into another room.  I cautiously watched him through the open doorway. He was no longer the man my friend's mother had married; he had become a monster. I couldn't stand it anymore. I went to the room where my friend's mother was waiting, her eyes full of worry, and said, ""Let's go home.""  On the way home, I sobbed until my shirt was streaked with tears. The car ride was silent, and the sadness hung thick in the air. I barely slept that night.  The next morning, as the sun shone on my face, I felt confident and ready to go back and confess my feelings to my friend's father. When we arrived at his house, nervousness rushed through me. I wobbled up to the door and knocked. His non -chalant greeting made me upset.  I walked in with confidence and asked him to sit down. I was glad to catch him in a rare non - drunk moment. I basically screamed at him, ""We really need to talk. I feel you're making a huge mistake by drinking. I know you're addicted, and there are risks in stopping, but you're also endangering your health!"" I poured out my heart as new tears welled up.  When I finished, my friend's father just sat there with a blank look and laughed. He said, ""Your mother told you to tell me this. Don't worry. Your friend doesn't know what she's talking about."" I was so angry that I screamed, ""You don't even know me! You don't care about me!"" and then stormed out.  In the living room, I looked at my friend's mother, and she knew I wanted to leave. The car ride home was again filled with silence. Thinking about how laughter is usually a great thing, I cried because this time, laughter didn't mean happiness; it meant tears."
42	20768	8	2	"One day, my parents gathered around me and said, ""We've got something to tell you."" I already knew what was coming as I had noticed the signs. When they went into another room, it wasn't for a good time; they were getting a divorce, and the time to tell me had arrived.  As they sat around me, I knew I was about to hear something I wasn't prepared for. The words ""We are getting a divorce"" rang in my head like wedding bells, but this was the exact opposite of a happy occasion.  When I looked at my mother, I could tell she had been crying. Her eyes, which used to have a blue - gray mixture, were now red and irritated. It broke my heart to see her like that. Meanwhile, my dad sat on the couch near me, his head buried in his hands. I could tell he was thinking about how their love had gone downhill, leaving him with resentment and anger towards my mother. The woman he loved was now his enemy.  At the age of seven, I couldn't fully understand what was happening to our family. I knew one parent would move away, and I wouldn't have both of them tuck me into bed at night. But I just couldn't understand why this had to happen.  I also thought about my little brother, who was only four. How could my parents explain this to him? If I was confused, he must have been completely lost.  Seeing our family fall apart made me want to cry and run away from all the troubles at home. If I had three wishes from a genie, I would use them all to save my parents' relationship.  Crying seemed easier than listening to my parents say, ""It's not your fault. Don't blame yourself. This is between your father and me."" I didn't think their words made me feel better. Their love for each other was gone, and my hope of them getting back together was fading fast, just like the rainforests in [LOCATION1]. More importantly, my home and my heart were broken, and I didn't think anything could fix them.  Just when I felt like the world was crashing down on me, my mother said something I'd never forget: ""If you feel like crying, laugh. Remember all the good times we spent as a family."" Memories started flooding back - like when my dad jumped into the pile of leaves we raked, or when my mom and I made burnt sugar cookies in winter that still made the house warm. And especially their wedding, which changed our lives forever.  I started to laugh and then cry. My parents were confused about my sudden change of emotion. They asked, ""What's wrong?"" Then I realized that even though our family wouldn't be together all the time, we would still laugh. When someone slipped on a piece of paper, it would still be funny.  From that day on, I believed in my mother's words: ""If you feel like crying, laugh."" It told me it's okay to be sad, but as long as there's laughter in life, everything will be alright. I was proud of my mom for handling the situation so well. If it weren't for her, I would have kept crying and never thought about all the happy times we had. So, we should always take a moment each day to remember the funny moments."
43	20769	8	2	Laughter is a feeling of pure happiness. When you're laughing, nothing else matters, and all your worries and stress fade away, leaving you with your true, happy self.  Have you ever had moments when everything seemed overwhelming, and then a friend said something that made you laugh? After laughing, you might start crying because it felt so good. Or have you laughed so hard that you fell to the floor and couldn't get up for what seemed like hours, but later forgot what was so funny?  Laughter is magical, second only to love. These two emotions seem to go hand in hand. When you love someone - whether it's a boyfriend/girlfriend, friends, or family - you know how to make them laugh, cheer them up, and have fun with them, which brings you closer together.  When I'm with my six friends, we mostly laugh. We laugh at anything slightly funny, and it strengthens our bond. We'll remain friends even after high school, no matter how far apart our colleges are because we've shared so many happy memories.  Laughter is crucial in a relationship. We trust each other and can share our most important secrets. This story explains how we became so close.  One day, after the school dance, our room was filled with brightly colored dresses, high heels, open soda cans, and chip bags. The air smelled of nail polish, perfume, and deodorant. Laughter and giggles filled the room, along with the occasional squeal.  We had all dressed up for the dance but quickly changed into sweatpants and baggy t - shirts. Our makeup was smeared, and our hair was falling. Yet, we didn't care. We looked past each other's appearances and just had fun.  None of us had dates at the dance, but we still had a great time. We gossiped about the people we saw, the dancing, and even how we marked our cups.  It was late at night, and everyone was exhausted but kept themselves awake with caffeine and sugar. Maybe it was because we always had so much to talk about or because we enjoyed each other's company.  I suggested taking a picture of the six of us. One of my friends, [PERSON1], ran upstairs to get an old instant - print camera. We squeezed into a corner of the bed to take the picture.  As we took the photos, the bed suddenly broke. We were all in shock at first, but then we burst into hysterics. Even [PERSON1]'s mom was laughing. We were a big pile of laughter.  The first picture showed us smiling, and the second was taken just as the bed broke, capturing our shocked faces. This incident not only brought us physically closer but also strengthened our friendship.
44	20770	8	2	Laughter is an important part of our daily lives. Humans enjoy laughing and making others laugh. This reminds me of a funny experience during a writing test.  The test required me to write about one of four topics, all of which were extremely vague and uninteresting. I found it quite ironic that I had to choose from these unappealing options, and for some strange reason, I found this situation amusing. I sat there silently laughing at my predicament.  Then it dawned on me that one of the topics was about laughter. I decided to write about myself laughing at the irony of my situation. The topic's vagueness worked in my favor as it didn't specify that the laugh had to be audible or what kind of laugh it should be. So, I thought a silent laugh at irony would be just as valid.  As I wrote about myself laughing at the fact that I had to write about myself laughing, I found the task so silly that I started laughing again. However, I worried that the grader might not find it as amusing as I did, which could affect my grade. But this possibility only made the situation more ironic and amusing.  You might think I'm easily amused, and well, I am. I find beauty in laughter because it's so abstract, and everyone experiences it differently. Some people are easily entertained by simple things, while others are more difficult to amuse. These differences make interacting with others enjoyable.  As I've said, humans like to laugh and make others laugh. No matter how you interpret the abstract nature of laughter, you have to admit it's kind of funny.
45	20771	8	2	"Someone once told me that laughter is the key to comfort, and I believe it's one of the most important aspects of any relationship. It brings people together.  About two years ago, in the middle of fall, I was crying because my dog had passed away. My ex - boyfriend tried everything to comfort me, but nothing worked. I told him I wanted to be alone, and he understood. As he walked away, he slipped and landed in a puddle, just like SpongeBob slipping on a banana. His back was drenched, and his cheeks were red with embarrassment. I couldn't help but burst out laughing. When he saw that the water had splashed on me, he started laughing too. That was a moment of comfort brought on by laughter. Whenever we had a problem, we could always laugh it off.  I actually met him at the movie theater. I was with some friends, and we went to see a movie called Step - [CAPS2]. There was a scene where one character said, ""[CAPS3] [CAPS3] that was so funny, last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur,"" and the other character looked like he was going to cry. I found it hilarious.  After the movie, my friend [PERSON1] suggested going back to his house. When we got there, [CAPS4] was waiting for [PERSON1] on the steps. [PERSON1] said, ""Aw, were you waiting for me, little one?"" [CAPS4] replied with the same funny line from the movie, ""[CAPS3] [CAPS3] that was so funny, last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur."" I laughed so hard I almost lost control. [CAPS4] and I were the only ones laughing, and we immediately clicked. If he weren't funny, I doubt I would have ever been with him.  I truly love laughter. I believe it's the easiest way to trigger the best emotions."
46	20772	8	2	"One day, on @DATE1 at @TIME1, I was walking back from @CAPS3 cheer - leading practice with my friends @PERSON3 and @PERSON1. As we walked, we had a great laugh. @NUM1 and I started to feel cold since we were only wearing shorts and sweatshirts, so we put on our @CAPS1 hoods. @PERSON3 also wanted to put up her hood so she wouldn't feel lonely, but it was too small, especially with her thick hair. When she forced it on, her hair bunched up on top of her head, making her look like a poodle. When we reached the end of the block where I live, @PERSON1 said her foot hurt. I offered her a piggy - back ride. I told her that when we got to the end of the block, she should set me down, and then she could give me a piggy - back ride. After she gave me a ride, we told @PERSON3 it was her turn. Just as I was about to get on @PERSON3's back, @PERSON1 said she should have a turn. So, @PERSON3 gave her stuff to me and gave @PERSON1 a piggy - back ride. At the end of the block, I reminded @PERSON3 it was my turn. She initially complained about being tired, but eventually gave me a piggy - back ride. When we crossed the street at the end of the block, @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 drove by, yelling ""@CAPS10!"". We turned around and saw it was @PERSON2. I said she was on time. After @PERSON2 parked her car, we walked up to her. We talked and walked into the school for practice. I again mentioned that she was on time, and she agreed. That night, going to cheer - leading practice was a blast, and I hope to have as much fun at practice again."
47	20773	8	2	"My freshman year at @CAPS1 was incredibly fun. There was a boy who made me smile and laugh, and I truly thought I was falling in love. We had a class together, @CAPS2. Just passing each other in the hallway could make my day. We met in a class that neither of us cared much about. I'd ask him for help even when I didn't need it just to talk to him. We also saw each other at the swimming pool because his brother and I both swam. We'd sit and talk about our school and home lives instead of him actually ""helping"" me. After the first semester, he was moved to another class period, but we still talked at the pool and saw each other at school. He started giving me hugs in the hallway, and we became really close friends. Our conversations were filled with laughter, and we discovered we had a lot in common, like hunting, wheeling, favorite foods, dogs, and our personalities. As @MONTH1 came around, with just one more month of school left, I started going to his house occasionally, and he came to mine more often. During the strawberry festival in @DATE4, I asked him to go with me. He agreed, and our parents also went together. It was a fun day. At the end of @DATE4, school was out for summer break. The last days of school were filled with signing yearbooks and sharing funny stories. After school, at the pool, he asked me out, and I said yes! We're still dating in @DATE2, and it was the best relationship I've ever had. He often tells me he wants to marry me, and I'm so glad I fell in love at first sight. We rarely argue and always have a great time together."
48	20774	8	2	When I was younger, I loved fishing with my friends @PERSON2 and @PERSON1. We often went fishing while camping and aimed to catch @CAPS1, @CAPS2 head, and sometimes @CAPS3. One day, when we were fishing for @CAPS2 head, the weather was cold and it was snowing. Just as we were about to leave, @PERSON1 hooked a huge @CAPS2 head on his last cast. It was the biggest @CAPS2 head we'd ever seen. As he reeled it in, he said it was very strong, and it was clear he was struggling. When he got the fish close to the shore, we thought the day was going to turn out well. But just as @PERSON1 told me to get the net, he slipped and fell into the river, dropping the pole. @PERSON1 jumped into the water after the pole. @PERSON2 and I decided to jump in and help. We swam as fast as we could in the cold water after the floating pole. I almost reached it, but the fish swam faster. I got caught on a tree, so it was up to @PERSON1 and @PERSON2. The chase for the pole lasted over five minutes, and we were far down the river. Finally, @PERSON2 got the pole, and we swam to the shore to reel in the fish. We were happy we went after it but were cold and eager to get home and dry. After a few minutes, @PERSON2 was still trying to get the fish to the shore. When the fish was close, @PERSON2 jerked the pole, but the line broke, and the fish got away. All our hard work was in vain. We decided to go home and sit by the fire. Many people find this story funny, but for me, swimming in the snow just to break the fishing line isn't funny. However, it was the most memorable fishing day I've ever had.
49	20775	8	2	"One time, I spent the night at @ORGANIZATION1's place. Since she often had to go back to boarding school, we always tried to see each other whenever possible. Her mom set up a tent for us on the deck after dinner. We went outside, and she was on the phone with her boyfriend while I was on the phone with mine. Our boyfriends were best friends, so it was like two best friends dating two best friends, and we were closer than ever. My boyfriend had to end the call because he had work in the @TIME1, so it was just @LOCATION1 on the phone. I started saying funny things, and she laughed so hard that she snorted while still on the phone with her boyfriend. I couldn't stop laughing, and seeing me laugh made her laugh even harder. She ended up peeing herself while on the phone. She seemed to forget she was on the phone and laughed even more. All this was happening around one in the @TIME1, and I was surprised her mom didn't come out and scold us for being loud. When I saw she'd peed herself, I exclaimed ""@CAPS1 my god, @CAPS3 pee'd your self @ORGANIZATION1!"". It was the funniest thing I'd ever experienced, and I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in my life. Her boyfriend finally got her attention and told her to take care of the situation. After they hung up, she was really embarrassed. I'd be embarrassed too if that happened to me."
50	20776	8	2	Sharing @ORGANIZATION1 (laughter) is one of the greatest joys in my life. I can't imagine life without it. During a particular @DATE1, my cousin @CAPS1 and I were together. We're not supposed to have energy drinks, but @CAPS1's dad, @PERSON1, gave us a Monster to share. We were at @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1. After drinking the Monster, I, who drank most of it, stayed calm. But @CAPS1, who only had a few sips, went wild. She ran down the aisles, tripping over her feet and almost tipping the cart with me on it. @CAPS1 often laughs hysterically for no obvious reason. When @PERSON1's wife, Wendy (my second cousin), got hungry, we went to the @ORGANIZATION2 cafe to eat pizza. My mom called me. I was trying to get my phone from my pocket while holding a hot pizza plate. I handed the plate to @CAPS1 as it was slipping. She, holding her own food, passed it to @PERSON1 because it was hot. @PERSON1 wasn't paying attention, and the pizza dropped on the floor, pizza - side down. It was so embarrassing. After that, @PERSON1 realized he forgot the churros and sent @CAPS1 to get them. As soon as she left, we knew it was a bad idea since @CAPS1 is clumsy. We were a bit surprised when she didn't drop them right away. But as soon as she set them on the table, one churro fell out of the package. We laughed so hard we couldn't breathe. @CAPS1 turned bright red from embarrassment. We felt bad for her, but it was so funny we couldn't help laughing. She knew it was funny but didn't want to laugh at herself. I believe it's crucial to laugh at ourselves. If we can't laugh at our own mistakes, we're not having fun. Laughter helps us learn to have fun even when we're embarrassed. It's a great way to move past small mistakes and enjoy life.
51	20777	8	2	"I've always believed that ""laughter is the best medicine"". I can laugh all day, finding almost everything in the world funny. Laughter is crucial to me; without it, life would be dull. Sometimes, genuine and heartfelt laughter is wonderful, but other times, laughter can be cruel and mean. I prefer to steer clear of the latter and focus on the good kind. When my friends are laughing and smiling, I'm eager to know what's so funny so I can join in. Birthdays are always fun, and laughter usually accompanies that fun. I remember my twelfth birthday. I decided to have a party at my house. I wanted it to be truly special, so I invited my closest friends and my cousins. Family always adds a special touch to everything. My cousin and I are very close. She was born nine months after me, so we're the same age for a short while. We always have a great time, acting crazy and laughing non - stop. For the party, my mom made rainbow sherbert punch, which was delicious. Everyone had a blast, and when the party was over, my cousins stayed until the next day, so we kept the fun going. I was in the kitchen getting more punch when my cousin came in and wanted some too. I poured us both a glass. My cousin said, ""This is so good!"" I replied, ""I know. That's why I had my mom make it. Do you wanna hear a joke?"" She said, ""Sure."" I told her, ""Once there was a kid named butt itches. He was really sick and one day died. His mom cried to the doctor, 'Oh, my poor butt itches!' And, do you wanna know what the doctor said?"" She asked, ""What?"" I said, ""Itch it!"" She had just taken a drink of punch when I told the joke. She spit the punch out while laughing, and it got all over me. Usually, when someone spits or spills something on you, you'd get mad. But I started laughing hysterically, and so did she. She said, ""Oh my gosh! That's so gross."" We couldn't stop laughing. The joke wasn't that funny; it was the punch all over me and the kitchen. We laughed for at least fifteen minutes before we realized our moms were standing in the kitchen, just staring at us, wondering what on earth had happened. Laughter made that birthday extra special, and I'll never forget it."
52	20778	8	2	"I've often heard that laughter is the best medicine, but there are times when it can be a double - edged sword. In my first - hand experience, laughter has both broken my heart and motivated me to transform myself. In the first grade, all first - graders seemed to have an urge to bring others down to build themselves up. I was a first - grader whose weight had become a concern, and my doctors advised me to look into a weight - loss program. This news was already crushing my self - esteem, and my classmates' laughter only made it worse. I remember a particularly bad day on the bus. I was almost home when four girls I thought were my friends started laughing. I joined in, thinking it was just some innocent giggling. Then one of them blurted out, ""You look like a beached whale!"" The whole bus heard and burst into laughter. That day, the street where the bus dropped me off seemed gloomier than ever. I decided I'd never set foot on the bus again. However, this painful encounter gave me the motivation to lose weight and regain confidence. Over the years, I've lost 60 pounds, become a varsity cheerleader, and am proud of who I am. But sometimes, I catch myself making jokes at others' expense. Just the other day at the mall, my best friend pointed out an overweight girl and started giggling. My initial reaction was to laugh, but I immediately felt the same pain I'd felt on the bus. I stopped, realizing the harm my laughter could cause. Laughter is a powerful thing, and while it can bring joy, we must be careful not to use it to hurt others. I hope my story can open people's eyes to the harmful effects of unkind laughter."
53	20779	8	2	Laughter is an integral part of my life, and I firmly believe it's essential for a good and healthy relationship. It has a remarkable ability to lift my spirits when I'm feeling down, benefiting my body, mind, and soul. My mother and I share a wonderful relationship filled with laughter. We laugh at the silliest things. She can make me laugh at the most ridiculous moments, and she's the only one who can make me spit my drink all over the dashboard with a simple silly face. I also had an interesting conversation with a good friend about the way people laugh. We noticed that people usually laugh in vowel sounds like a, e, and o, and we decided to try laughing in the vowels i and u. It was a fun and unique experience, even though no one really noticed our odd laughter. There was also an occasion when my mom and I were at my aunt's house. We decided to try a facial cleansing mask we saw on TV. The mask was made of whisked egg whites and toilet paper. We dipped the toilet paper in the egg whites and plastered it on our faces. We had to wait at least fifteen minutes for it to dry. When we saw the final results, we looked like a bunch of crazy ladies, and it was incredibly hard not to laugh. I had to leave the room for fifteen minutes so my face could dry. When I came back, I found my mother and aunt in the bathroom drying each other's faces with a hair dryer. I couldn't hold it in any longer and started crying with laughter. My mask cracked, and all my hard work was wasted. That day was one of the funniest of my life, and we laughed so hard that our abdomens hurt. I love to laugh, and I have different forms of laughter. When I laugh really hard, I sometimes forget to breathe. Laughter has made a huge difference in my life, and I don't know what I'd do without it.
54	20781	8	2	Laughter is my key to getting through tough days. It gives me hope and brightens my mood, whether I'm going to work, school, or any other activity. At school, my best friend, [Friend's Name], is my source of laughter. Every day, she says something off - topic, and we end up laughing uncontrollably at the top of the stairs near the science labs where we have lunch. People give us weird looks, but we don't care because we understand each other. My best friend, [Friend's Name] (I call her [Nickname]), has been my rock since the second grade. She inspires me to aim higher in life. When we're together, one look at each other can set us off into fits of laughter. Sometimes we laugh hysterically over nothing, but that's what it's like when you're with your best friend. Laughter is important in all my relationships. It shows me a person's sense of humor and their ability to be fun and not a stuck - up perfectionist. My friend and I often talk about boys and boy problems, which makes me laugh and giggle. In our fifth - period forestry and fire class, we're like caged monkeys. We have sudden bursts of energy, tickle each other, and laugh loudly. We even play paper soccer ball with a paper ball at the end of class, which drives the teacher crazy. When I was at [School Name], I had three classes with [Friend's Name], and we had a non - stop laughter war every day. My laugh is a cackle mixed with giggling. Some people like it, while others think it's funny in a weird way. At home, our family's laughter is different. We often pick on each other. We make fun of my sister who was supposed to be a boy, my brother as the only boy among five kids, and my sister for being the shortest. Laughter makes me feel alive. It motivates me for the day and helps me communicate with others. I'm grateful for the ability to laugh because without it, I'd have a hard time making friends.
55	20783	8	2	The beautiful flames in the night air danced peacefully. The faint glow of the blaze was our only light. As I carried sixty pounds of wood from one side of the house to the other, I felt like someone was watching me. When I finally reached the trailer, my best friend's mom, [Mom's Name], said she didn't think we'd need that much wood. I thought it was going to be a long weekend. After two hours of packing clothes, food, water, sleeping bags, pillows, and tents, we headed to [Campsite Name]. The two - hour drive felt like just twenty minutes. [Person 1], [Person 2], [Person 3], [Mom's Name], and I were a rowdy group in the car. We yelled, fought, and punched each other for fun. Once we arrived, we jumped out of the car like angry bees. After unpacking, I raced [Person 2] to the campsite. The first few days were spent in the hundred - degree heat, swimming, and flirting with girls around the camp. We slept as little as possible to enjoy our friendship. On the second day, we went mountain biking. After hours on the bikes, we noticed the sun was setting. We saw the most amazing view with bursts of orange and red, the colors bouncing from cloud to cloud. After the long bike ride, we went for a swim. While swimming, I felt something touch my foot. When I looked down, it was just a root system of a fallen tree, which looked so fake that it sparked a conversation about [Subject] for the next day. The sparks were dancing as if they were in some kind of celestial dance. The only light was the glow of the fire. [Person 3] was playing a beautiful melody on his guitar. As I was enjoying the beauty of nature, I felt someone watching me. I nudged [Person 3], and when we turned around, there was a spinning green light about twenty feet in the air. I said the word everyone was afraid of, [Subject]. I stood up slowly, and the light started spinning faster. I grabbed the machete next to me and approached the light. As I got closer, I could see small figures in the shadows. Then, there was an eruption of children's laughter, and a little boy ran out, laughing uncontrollably. After returning to my seat by the campfire, I thought about life. What if [Subject] were real and watching us? But I laughed it off and continued my week - long vacation.
56	20784	8	2	What causes laughter? Laughter serves as an excellent stress - reliever. Globally, there are various types of laughs. Some individuals have high - pitched laughs, while others possess deep and low ones. There are also those who snort or make animal - like noises when they laugh. For me, different emotions trigger different laughs. When I'm upset, I have a distinct laugh. I often laugh when upset to improve my mood and have a better day. During a basketball game, I had a terrible night. Fouls were constantly called on me. Usually, in such situations, I get extremely angry, lose my composure, and end up on the bench, which I detest. This time, after being threatened with ejection in the previous game for the same foul, when another foul was called on me, I decided to smile and laugh it off. I told myself to shake it off. My coach was pleased with my change in attitude and advised me to play defense with my feet, ignore the bad call, and keep my head. When angry, one's demonstrative looks can have negative consequences, but smiling and laughing elicit different reactions. I'm not alone on my basketball team in this regard; many of us laugh off bad calls. I'm also a cheerleader. As a cheerleader, one should always appear happy. I play a basketball game every night before cheering. I need to stay calm during the game to be in a good mood for cheering. Laughing helps me stay composed and relaxed while playing. My coach emphasizes the importance of positive attitudes. She tells us at practice that smiling and laughing at mistakes lead to better outcomes than having a bad attitude. I took her advice to heart. Since then, I've tried to maintain a positive attitude by smiling and laughing when things go wrong. Laughter has far - reaching benefits. I believe it helps express our mood and is beneficial for the body. It can significantly improve one's mood when feeling down. I strive to be in a good mood always as I dislike being in a bad mood. Laughter makes me feel better. I think laughter is a great bodily function as it enhances my mood and those around me. It's a magical feeling that warms the heart. Everyone should laugh at least once a day to make their day better.
57	20785	8	2	"They say laughter is the ""best medicine,"" but I don't agree. However, my nephew might have a different view. For two weeks, he pretended to be ""sick"" every school day. I'd tell his grandma, ""He just doesn't like school."" But his attitude towards school changed completely. We let him think it would be another dull school day, but it was a party day for the class. Every two weeks, if the students work hard, they get a party, and they'd been working hard this time. That morning, my nephew was being stubborn, resisting everything we tried to do. When we walked through the narrow classroom door, he did something unexpected for a five - year - old. He stood still and silent like a marble statue. The room was perfectly decorated! There were streamers, balloons, food, party hats, and bags. It was the first party of the year, and they'd really gone all out. The smell of the food made my stomach growl. There were all kinds of desserts like cakes, cookies, and pies, cooked just thirty feet away. As soon as you walked in, your mouth would fill with saliva. The children were as active as ninjas. One moment they were in front of you, and the next, they'd disappeared. It took me at least an hour to find my nephew in that small room. Eventually, I realized it was easier to sit and wait for him to find me. As I sat on the cold, hard, and uncomfortable floor, he suddenly appeared in front of me. He had an ear - to - ear grin that scared me because he only had such a big grin when he had a plan. And he did have a plan. In seconds, my face was wet. He'd been hiding a squirt gun behind his back and had planned his escape route. With the chairs and short tables in the way, it was difficult for me to catch up in the room. But once we got into the hallway, I could run easily. When I caught him, his grin disappeared, but we both kept laughing. Now, my nephew loves school. It's almost the end of his first year, and they still have great parties. Thanks to us, there are no more squirt - gun attacks. I think if we'd waited longer, it would've been harder to make him like school. He's a smart, athletic, and good - natured child. He'll do well in school, and with his strength, I feel sorry for any child who picks a fight with him."
58	20787	8	2	I know you often hear the same things, and I also know many people don't answer the prompt properly. I'm sorry because I couldn't answer it either. I can't remember the last time I had a really good laugh in the past couple of years, so I'll tell you why laughter is special to me instead. What makes laughter special? For me, it's beneficial in numerous ways. I'll discuss how it's good for my health, how everyone's laughs are unique and can make us laugh at them, and why it's so special to me. After I laugh, I always feel a strange sensation in my head. I think it's because endorphins are being produced in my brain. If I laugh too hard, my stomach hurts because laughing burns calories and works my abs. I also believe it benefits all three aspects of the health triangle. Socially, I laugh with others. Emotionally, it makes me happy. Physically, working out with a friend is always fun. I think everyone's laugh is unique. Sometimes, it's amusing to hear people chuckle, snort, or sound like a mouse. Our laughs are part of what makes us who we are. Laughter is special to me because of the people who make me laugh. My friends are like family I've chosen. My family makes me laugh and happy every day. It's special because these people are special to me. Laughing with my father is different from laughing with my mother, and laughing with my friends is different from laughing with my significant other. Laughter is central to my life and is very special. It's not like chewing gum; it's a whole different experience. There's nothing more enjoyable than a girls' night filled with laughter or a romantic night of dancing. Laughter is essential for life. So, laugh, laugh, laugh.
59	20790	8	2	Laughter has been a consistent and powerful force in my relationships. I believe it helps in getting to know new people and deepening bonds with those we care about. In my opinion, laughter can bring people closer and turn a bad situation around. When I was fifteen and a sophomore at [Organization1] school, it was my first year there. I'd attended many schools, like [Location1], [Caps1] wood, etc., and I was struggling to connect socially with my peers. My daily routine was boring: wake up, get ready, go to school, come home (maybe do homework), and go to bed. It was a cycle I seemed trapped in. Trying to be cool and fit in didn't work well. I realized that pretending to be someone you're not only gets you so far. What people, especially kids, like is when you're genuine. I learned this later; I didn't initially realize it was what people valued most. I decided I didn't like acting like someone else because I thought I was cool deep down. So, I started being myself. As it turned out, I was indeed cool, and girls found me attractive and funny. My ability to make people laugh or smile, aside from my looks, helped me make many friends I didn't have at the start. It even helped me win the heart of [Location2], the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. She had a figure like a Coca - Cola bottle, caramel skin, and a face like a goddess. Like any beautiful girl, she had many admirers. But my greatest asset, laughter, came to my rescue. Although our relationship didn't last as long as I'd hoped, the time we spent together, the things we did, and the experiences we shared were priceless. It was all because I could make her laugh. I believe that without laughter, the world wouldn't be what it is today. There's still crime and horror, but imagine how much worse it would be without laughter. Joy, the core of laughter, allows us to forgive and overlook. Without laughter, it would be difficult to face the future.
60	20791	8	2	Laughter can be the best part of life. It typically expresses happiness and joy. Laughter seems contagious; a single laugh accompanied by a smile can greatly improve someone's day. The great thing about laughter is that it's easy to come by as there are many things in the world that can make us laugh. I find myself laughing most when I'm with people I enjoy being around. Some think love, joy, or self - contentment is the key to happiness. I believe the key is surrounding yourself with loved ones because everything seems better when they're around. They're like sunshine, making everything brighter. My favorite memory full of laughter happened on a warm [Date1] day at my friend's house just outside the city. It was around [Num1] in the [Time1]. The air was warm but not overly hot; it was the perfect afternoon. My friends and I were having a great time: playing football, building a fire, and just being happy. We had everything needed for an amazing night. The most vivid moment was when we were playing catch. I threw a long pass to my friend, and as he ran to catch it, he ran straight into a fence. He got up laughing, and the laughter spread. That set the tone for the rest of the night. The rest of the [Time1] felt like it was out of a movie. Everything went smoothly, and we all felt great. It was the epitome of happiness. Laughter filled the air, and we all had big smiles on our faces. It was definitely my best memory of laughter.
61	20792	8	2	"Laughter is the essence of life. Without it, my life would lack meaning, and without that sense of happiness or compassion, life wouldn't be worth living. My sister is the sole person I trust with my secrets. She's the one who can make me happy when I'm feeling down. My sister and I share laughter over our own jokes. She's my other half, and we share everything. She makes me laugh and is always there when I need her, and I'll always be there for her. Laughter is an important part of life. My sister and I often laugh and play. One day, after getting off the school bus, all I could do was cry. As I waited for my sister's bus, the tears streamed down my face. When the bus appeared, so did a sense of joy. It wasn't the bus that brought me joy; it was my sister. Right away, she could sense my pain and noticed my tears. I could see the love and care on her face. She asked me what was wrong, and I could hear the worry in her voice. My tears stopped, and I began to pour out everything without hesitation. I told her what had happened without a pause. After that, she said something I'll never forget: ""No matter what happens, I'll always love you."" Then we laughed. It was the sweetest laugh, filling the air. I've learned to laugh at what others say about me because it's not true. Laughter truly enriches my life."
62	20793	8	2	"The night was dark and cloudy, casting a gloomy aura over my surroundings. Shadows danced across the street under the lamp - light of passing cars and pedestrians. My day had been a disaster, and it seemed that fate was against me. Everything that could go wrong did. And I feared the rest of the night would only deteriorate. Earlier that day, I'd upset my girlfriend with an ill - advised statement. As soon as I sat on my bed, she called. Our exchange of words left our relationship in shambles. The conversation ended in anger and a phone disconnection. Once I lay back in bed and my anger subsided, guilt overwhelmed me. I'd said unnecessary and horrible things. As I lay there, my heart felt like it was being squeezed by an invisible force, making it hard to breathe, and soon tears welled up in my eyes. The guilt and agony invaded my soul like a burglar in a dark house, stealing my peace. My day ended in tears and pain. But then my phone rang again. I quickly wiped my tears and checked the caller ID. It was my best friend. I answered, not knowing what he wanted. He asked if I wanted to hang out and grab a bite. His words lifted my spirits a little. When he pulled into my driveway, I was waiting. I got into the passenger seat, and he immediately knew something was wrong. He asked me if something had happened, and I simply said, ""My girlfriend."" He knew it wasn't the time to talk, so we drove to a nearby restaurant and found seats. We both ordered coffee. I started vigorously ripping open sugar packets and dumping them into my coffee, while he did it more gently. Then he cautiously asked if I wanted to talk. I looked up from the mess around my coffee cup and slowly nodded. I spilled out all the events of my day, swearing and using profanity. My best friend just listened until my voice softened and my fists unclenched. We sat in silence for a while. Then he changed the subject. He asked about my mother, and another stream of curses came out. After a short silence, he asked if I felt better now that I'd gotten it all out. I was a bit puzzled but thought about it and replied yes. We enjoyed our dinner, paid, and left. My mood had improved, though I was still a bit upset. We drove to the river and got out of the car. We stood by the bank, looking at the water. He asked if I wanted to hear a joke, and after a pause, I said yes. The joke he told was so funny that I laughed uncontrollably. His timing was perfect, and it made my mood soar. I've always turned to my friends when I'm down, and they've always been there. That day was a disaster, but the night turned out much better than I'd hoped. Laughter is truly a powerful force in my life."
63	20794	8	2	Having friends who make you feel comfortable being yourself is perhaps the best quality in a friendship. Everyone has flaws, but a true friend can look past them and see the good in you. A friend can tell a joke and make you laugh until you cry. When someone thinks their life can't get any worse, a good laugh can turn things around. Laughter is the most precious gift. Just seeing the smile on someone's face tells you that you've made them happy. I've had many moments in my life when I've laughed so hard that I've cried. There's no better feeling than knowing you have people who can cheer you up with something ridiculous. I laugh a lot during the day. When I don't, people get worried, thinking something's wrong with me. That's how important laughter is in my life; it's like a second language. There was one particular night when my friends stayed over. We were just being boys, doing crazy things like eating hot sauce by the spoonful, watching comedy shows, and eating until we were sick. It was an unforgettable time, and we laughed non - stop. While watching the comedy shows, we couldn't breathe from laughing so hard. The comedian was like a master of words; his jokes were so well - crafted. I laughed and cried over and over again for about ten minutes straight. Making these memories with my friends is something I'll never forget. I'm truly grateful for the love and support I get from my friends and family. All my experiences, good or bad, teach me valuable lessons that will help me make the right decisions in the future. The laughs I share with others tell me they've had a good time, and it makes my day great too. Being myself around them is wonderful because I know they've accepted me. Everyone laughs at some point in their lives, even if they deny it. I'm honored to have such amazing people in my life who fill it with laughter. Life should be lived to the fullest, and laughter is a big part of that.
64	20795	8	2	It's always difficult to know what to do when a friend or family member comes to you in a sad or angry state. Most of the time, you're at a loss. I've learned that making someone laugh with a simple joke can often make them feel better. One sunny afternoon, I was at home when I got a call from my friend PERSON1. When I answered, all I could hear was loud crying. I repeatedly asked her what was wrong, but she wouldn't say a word. I was getting really worried and asked her to calm down and take deep breaths. A couple of minutes later, she started explaining. She said she was irresponsible and hadn't paid attention to what was going on around her. I asked her why she was saying that about herself because I knew she was a responsible person. Finally, she screamed that while she was home watching the CAPS1 basketball team play, her dog CAPS2 got run over and died. I thought it was a bit ridiculous that she was crying so much over her dog, but I didn't want to be rude. I was confused about what to say, mainly because I was afraid of hurting her feelings. Finally, I told her not to worry and that my friend had some dogs for sale. I also said that if it would make her feel better, I'd buy her a new puppy. After that, there was an awkward silence. I was so nervous, thinking she was mad. Suddenly, she started laughing really loudly and couldn't talk. I was so relieved that I'd made her laugh instead of making her more upset. She laughed hysterically for a while. Then she stopped and started talking to me again. She thanked me for making her laugh and turning the situation around instead of saying depressing things. I was happy I'd made her feel better. I told her that anytime she needed to laugh, she could call me. I'd be happy to bring a smile to her face anywhere, anytime. She laughed with me and thanked me again. From that day on, I've always liked making people laugh because I know it makes them feel better, and I also love it when others make me laugh. It's a truly wonderful feeling.
65	20796	8	2	"Laughter is a crucial element in life. Without it, there would be no happiness or joy in the world. Friends are a great source of laughter; they're the people with whom you can be yourself. Some people use laughter to relieve pain. For example, my dad often laughs when he gets hurt. My dad was in the navy a few years ago. During training, he got hit in the stomach. It wasn't serious, but it did hurt, so he sat down and started laughing. I think this trait is hereditary because I sometimes do the same. I learned about the healing power of laughter not too long ago. It was last DATE3, early DATE5, and CAPS5 of DATE5 was approaching. Traditionally, my parents and I would drive to ORGANIZATION1 and use the money we'd saved all year to buy a big pack of fireworks. When CAPS5 of DATE5 arrived, I was overjoyed. I woke up and immediately ran to my mom and asked if I could take out the fireworks. She shook her head, saying it was only eleven in the morning and sunset was at seven or eight. She smiled and whispered, ""Patient girl."" Once the sun set and the stars appeared, we knew it was time. My dad handed me the first firework and a lighter and asked if I wanted to do the honors. A big smile spread across my face. I love fireworks, watching the bright colors explode into the sky, filling it with a sea of colorful sparks. After CAPS5 of DATE5 ended, my cousin CAPS12 came over. My mom was a little sick, but it wasn't contagious. My dad thought we were old enough to take care of ourselves and my mom. As DATE3 was ending, I really wanted to see the movie CAPS13 with my mom and CAPS12. My mom had a lot of health issues and was on several medications. It seemed like she got a new pill every week, and the side - effects were causing more problems. It was mid - DATE5, DATE4, and there was still no sign of my mom getting better. CAPS12 and I tried to find things to do, like walking the dogs to the park, swimming, watching CAPS15, and cleaning the cars. On DATE1, my mom showed signs of improvement. She was walking more naturally. I called my dad and asked if it was a good idea to go to the movies. He said to wait one more day. I was worried because CAPS12 was going home the next day. The next day, my mom woke me up and asked if we could go to the movies. I was hesitant because she was still sick, but she said she was feeling better. She said we had to hurry because the next showing was in twenty minutes. I woke CAPS12 up, and we left. The movie was good. Afterward, CAPS12 went home, and the house was quiet. On DATE2, a day usually for relaxing, I was on my computer, my dad was playing video games, and my mom was in the kitchen making dinner. My dad went to help her, but she almost fell with some pans in her hands. My dad suggested she take a nap. Later that evening, my dad found my mother passed away in her sleep. I felt like my heart had exploded. A few days passed, and I found comfort in texting CAPS12. She mentioned how torn my dad was about my mom. Even though she was hurting, she and her friend tried to make everyone laugh because they knew laughter could ease the pain. That's why laughter is an important part of our lives. It can bring light in the darkest of times."
66	20797	8	2	"Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" To me, this means that since everyone laughs, it is the quickest and easiest way to connect with others. I hold this belief because there was a time when my older brother and I didn't get along well. We rarely spent time together, and when we did, we either fought or ignored each other. Since he is five years older, it wasn't a major issue. However, as I grew older, we started seeing each other more often. One day, we decided to sit down and talk. We weren't sure what to say, so we sat in silence for the first ten minutes on the back porch in the middle of the @TIME1. Suddenly, he fell backwards into a bush, and we both laughed harder than we ever had. Now, when my family gets together, there is little arguing or fighting. We sit, tell stories, and laugh. For my family and friends, laughter is one of the most important elements of a relationship. With laughter comes happiness, and with happiness comes love. Love is the most crucial component of life. So, I firmly believe that ""Laughter is the shortest distance between all people."
67	20800	8	2	"This true - to - life story might seem a bit cheesy, but it's real, and in my view, it's a beautiful love story. I'll use substitute names. On @DATE1, after a long school day, @PERSON1 logged on to @CAPS1 - book to chat with new online friends. She'd forgotten that she'd sent a friend request to @PERSON2. When @PERSON2 accepted the request, @PERSON1 remembered it. Minute by minute, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 got to know each other better, even though they'd had no idea who the other was before. After a long chat, @PERSON2 gave @PERSON1 his number so she could call or text him when off @CAPS1 - book. Both @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 started to like each other. @PERSON1 learned that @PERSON2 is a high - school sophomore, @NUM1 years old, and they have mutual friends. @PERSON1 really enjoyed talking to @PERSON2, and @PERSON2 felt the same way. @PERSON1 noticed that @PERSON2 loved to laugh heartily, and she liked that because it always brightened her day. @PERSON2 knew @PERSON1 had recently broken up with her boyfriend, but he didn't mind. He hoped he could make @PERSON1 happy. He asked @PERSON1 to be his girlfriend, and without hesitation, she said, ""I would very much like to be your girlfriend."" @PERSON2 was surprised and asked if she really meant it. @PERSON1 replied that there was no reason not to. @PERSON2 said he'd thought she wouldn't want to date so soon after a breakup. For a while, their relationship was going well. But then @PERSON1 started receiving texts from her ex - boyfriend, which affected her relationship with @PERSON2. The problem was that @PERSON1 still loved @PERSON3. Despite this, @PERSON2 fought to win @LOCATION1's affection. @PERSON1 is the kind of girl who doesn't hide things from her boyfriend. One night on the phone, @PERSON2 asked @PERSON1 if she'd try to forget her ex. @PERSON1 was scared to answer but was honest, saying she'd try but couldn't promise. Since they communicate well when laughing, @PERSON1 changed the subject and asked @PERSON2 to do her a favor, which was to laugh for her. @PERSON2 laughed heartily. Laughter can greatly improve a relationship. It may not make it perfect, but it's far better than arguing over trivial things. I'm convinced that laughter plays an excellent role in any relationship, as it's a language we can all understand to communicate. I hope you liked this true story about how laughter is important in relationships."
68	20802	8	2	"My journey with laughter began when I first met my boyfriend. Before that, I was constantly depressed, and my friends were fed up with my state. But when my friends introduced us, I fell in love for the first time. I was finally happy, no longer alone in a corner crying. It had been almost a year since I last smiled, and that happened the day I met him. My friends knew then that I'd found someone who would love and care for me as I am. As our relationship developed, laughter became a regular part of it. I was always laughing when I was with him, instead of being upset. It took the efforts of our friends to get us to hang out more. After that, we got to know each other better than when we first met. It wasn't until our freshman year that we started dating. Then, I found out that someone else thought I was dating him. I didn't believe it until that guy came up and started yelling at me. My boyfriend came to comfort me in front of my friends and asked, ""@CAPS1 are @CAPS3 cheating on me and it's over?"" with a guy @CAPS3 just met. He said it was over, but I told him we'd never been dating in the first place. My friends saw me in tears and tried to find me someone new. By the time they did, I was with another guy, and I'm extremely happy with him. He's always there for me, no matter what. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me. When I'm upset or mad, he makes me laugh and says, ""Don't worry, everything will be okay. Just believe in me."" Laughter has been a part of our relationship for almost a year. We don't plan to change that unless one of us messes up again. We've made so many mistakes, but I don't know what I'd do if laughter left our relationship. It's an integral part of my life and our relationship. I hope it never changes because it's tied to him. He's the only one who can make me laugh when I'm crying, not even my friends or family could do that. Now that laughter is almost always present, I can't wait for sorrow to fade away. My relationship with him is so strong, and I'm not my bubbly self when he's not around. Some of my friends say I'm losing my bubbly self and shouldn't let it go. They also told my dad that I don't hang out with them much, and the reason is that they can be bossy and try to control me. They don't understand that this relationship won't work if they keep interfering. My relationship with laughter is between my boyfriend and me, and nothing, not even our parents, can change that. I just wish our relationship could have a happy ending without any outside interference. I hope nothing will tear us apart, and if it does, I don't know what the future holds."
69	20803	8	2	"I once heard a man say, ""Laughing is the key to happiness, and if you do not laugh, you aren't healthy."" Why do people love to laugh? Well, laughing creates wonderful memories, banishes sadness, gives you energy, and can even provide a good abdominal workout depending on how hard and long you laugh. There's nothing quite like a really funny movie that makes you laugh so hard that you cry, your jaw aches, and your stomach is sore the next day. Many of my favorite movies are comedies. I'm sure that laughing or making others laugh could give you an edge in getting a job. Suppose you're going for an interview for a job that involves daily interaction with people. You're not going to go in there dull and monotone. Instead, you'll make the interviewer laugh and act as if you've known them for ages. However, laughter can also be misused. It can be used in a hurtful way, like making fun of people. For example, calling kids in gym class names just because they can't throw a baseball as far as you. Laughter can either make people feel on top of the world or as bad as a basketball player missing the game - winning shot at the buzzer. We need to be cautious when using laughter, treating it like a loaded gun because using it wrongly can hurt someone. A few hours after my @CAPS4 passed away, my family and I started sharing good memories we'd had with her. I noticed tears streaming down my @CAPS5 @PERSON1's cheeks. Then, we began to talk about the times she'd get really mad and swear at my dad when he was a boy, and then get embarrassed for using the Lord's name in vain. Thinking about those moments, we started to laugh, not just a small giggle but full - blown, loud laughter. That laughter dispelled the sadness that had filled the room all night. I'll always remember how that laughter that night became such a powerful and emotional memory for me later in life."
70	20804	8	2	"Laughter is incredibly important in my life. Without it, my life wouldn't be as amazing as it is now. My friends, family, and boyfriend are the ones who bring so much laughter into my days. I have numerous stories where laughter played a part, but I'll tell you about how my boyfriend used laughter to help me forget about my stomach ache. It all took place on a @DATE1 @TIME1 as I was on my way home from my boyfriend's house. We were on the max, and my stomach started to hurt. I told my boyfriend, and he thought it was because I hadn't eaten. I was worried since it was going to be a long trip. On the way to my house, my boyfriend tried to distract me from my stomach pain. He asked me about my school day, and I said it was okay. As we talked, he suddenly took off his hat and said, ""From flat to volume!"" I burst out laughing. I laughed so hard that my stomach, which had ached from not eating, now ached from laughing. His hair was all messed up and looked so funny. I asked him why his hair was like that, and he said that when he was showering, he'd grabbed a shampoo bottle that promised to add volume, and he didn't expect his hair to get so voluminous. The whole way home, I couldn't stop laughing about his hair, and I completely forgot about my stomach ache. Even to this day, I still laugh when I think about how his hair looked that day. We have an inside joke now. Whenever I remember that day, I say ""From flat to volume,"" and we both start laughing. I've realized that laughter is the best medicine for me when I have a stomach ache. Laughter will always be an inseparable part of my life, no matter what happens."
71	20805	8	2	"Have you ever pondered how you and your closest friends became friends? Perhaps not, or maybe you have but can't recall. Well, today I'm going to share the story of how my friend @PERSON3 and I became friends. I'll also tell you how we've remained friends for so long and all the little things that have kept our friendship strong. Initially, we weren't the kind of friends who were constantly laughing. Instead, one of us was a crier and the other a helper.  @PERSON3 and I first met in the eighth grade. I was called out of my first - period class and greeted by my math teacher, @PERSON1. @PERSON1 informed me that we had a new student who had moved here from @LOCATION1 and wasn't very happy about it. She asked if I'd mind showing the new student around the school with another classmate, @PERSON4. I agreed and entered the room where @PERSON3 was. The first thing I noticed about her were her tear - streaked eyes. Then I realized she was a very pretty girl who, as @PERSON1 had said, was unhappy. I'll admit I was a bit afraid to show her around since she clearly wasn't thrilled to be here.  Once we started, she calmed down significantly, but she wouldn't even crack a smile at our feeble attempts at joking. I decided to go all out. I walked in a funny way, talked in a comical voice, and even said random funny things during long pauses. Eventually, she smiled, and I kept going. By the end, I got her and @PERSON4 laughing so hard that we all nearly wet ourselves. This wasn't the last funny thing we did. You know those funny moments that you always remember when you see the person you shared them with? Well, @PERSON3 and I have many such moments. Many of them involve other people, which makes them even more fun.  For example, in our drawing and painting class, @PERSON3, @LOCATION2, @CAPS1, and I were in @PERSON2's office getting a picture to draw. I'd been hyper all day, and so had @CAPS3. I randomly looked around the room and saw a really cute poster I'd never noticed before. Without realizing it, I said aloud, ""@CAPS2, that's really cute."" @CAPS3 started laughing and held onto the desk to keep from falling. I was confused because I didn't realize I'd said it out loud, but I was also laughing because watching them laugh was so entertaining. They finally calmed down enough to tell me what I'd said, and I blushed but continued laughing.  Now, every time they see me and remember that moment, they burst out laughing and imitate what I said. I believe these big, funny memories have kept our friendship together. They help us recall the good times during tough moments and strengthen our bond within our group of friends.  The little things matter too. Every small, funny thing we do as friends is beneficial. If we only had big funny moments or boring ones, our friendship probably wouldn't last. Like when we accidentally burp or fart while walking, or when I laugh and hide my face with my hands and my arms jiggle, or when we say something weird or walk funny because we need to use the bathroom. It's not just being friends that keeps us close; it's how we are with each other. I feel like I become a better person when I'm with her, and I think I help her become a better version of herself too. The little things are just as funny as the big ones.  As I've said, laughter is a crucial part of our friendship. It started with tears and grew into laughter. Laughter brought us together in a strange way, and our friendship has remained strong. It's not because we have a lot in common (frankly, we don't), but because of the big, hilarious moments we've shared, both with each other and with others, and the little, everyday funny things we do. I truly believe that laughter is the best thing to keep any relationship healthy and happy."
72	20806	8	2	"In my experience, laughter is one of the things that can make strangers feel comfortable with each other. Meeting my boyfriend's parents was extremely nerve - wracking and uncomfortable. I'm usually good at getting along with people, but starting a conversation with those who were judging my every move was a challenge.  My boyfriend, @PERSON3, and I have been dating for almost a year. We both like spending time with our families, so it was inevitable that I'd meet his parents. We knew each other from our school days, attending the last years of elementary school, some of middle school, and all but one year of high school together. I left for a couple of years and came back a different person. After @NUM1 months of dating, the time came to meet his folks.  One day in @DATE1, @PERSON3 had a football game, which I attended with some girlfriends whose boyfriends were also on the team. After a tough loss, @PERSON3 came out of the locker room, hugged me, and said it was time to meet his parents. I took a deep breath and felt extremely nervous. I usually enjoy meeting new people, but I really wanted his parents to like me, which added a lot of pressure.  I slowly followed him and greeted them with a friendly ""@CAPS3"". His mother reached out and introduced herself as ""@CAPS2"". I shook her hand and replied, ""@CAPS3, so nice to meet you."" I looked at @ORGANIZATION1 for reassurance. Then his father, with a warm and welcoming smile, introduced himself as ""@PERSON2"". His eyes seemed so familiar and kind. I shook his hand and started to feel a bit more comfortable. I asked him what he thought of the game, and he was surprised that I initiated the conversation. We then had a great discussion about football.  After talking about football for about @NUM2 or @NUM3 minutes, @PERSON3 mentioned something that reminded me of a joke. I'm known for having lame jokes, and I was hesitant to tell it to his parents. Even @PERSON3 thought it was lame, but I loved it. I decided to take the chance anyway. I said, ""@CAPS4 that reminds me of a joke."" @PERSON3 looked at me with a ""please don't"" expression. I ignored him and started, ""So there were two muffins in the oven. One said, 'Wow, it's hot in here.' The other screamed, 'Holy crap! A talking muffin.'"" I started laughing, and my laugh is quite unique. His mother said it was adorable and that she'd tell it to @CAPS6. His father, @PERSON2, sweetly said he liked my laugh. @PERSON3 also chimed in, saying my laugh was something special. We all smiled at each other and then went to dinner, cracking jokes and laughing at my laugh.  Thanks to laughter, I felt welcome and at ease. To this day, we still laugh about me telling that joke, and I'm glad I took the chance. Laughter really can break the ice and make new relationships more comfortable."
73	20807	8	2	"On @DATE1, I had a mission - trip meeting at @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, at @NUM1 o'clock in the @TIME1. My friend @PERSON2 decided to go with me. @CAPS11's grandpa picked us up from the house and drove us to @LOCATION2. When we arrived at the church, I attended the meeting until @NUM2 o'clock and then went to bible study. By then, I was tired and eager to go home.  To my surprise, @CAPS11's grandpa was nowhere to be found. He had apparently gone home, but @CAPS11's mom, grandma, and sister @CAPS3 had just arrived to pick us up. I was informed that there was a parent meeting for the students going on the mission trip. After the meeting, we went to @PERSON1's craft store.  When we got there, @PERSON2 and I went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, while @CAPS11's mom, grandma, and @CAPS3 stayed in @LOCATION3. I bought a pair of comfortable slippers for myself and @CAPS11's mom. Then we went back to show them off to @CAPS11's mom and grandma. This turned out to be a bad idea because @CAPS11's grandma decided she needed a pair for herself. She walked over to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and took an incredibly long time looking. I told her that if she stopped browsing, we'd go to @CAPS6, get a sandwich, and come back. So we did.  When we reached @CAPS6, @PERSON2 was in a bad mood because he wanted to go home. We ordered our sandwiches and returned to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It took her an hour and a half to finally find a pair of slippers. Everyone got in the car, thinking we were going home, when suddenly grandma shouted, ""We're going to @LOCATION5's. I want a bowl of chili."" Our reaction was a collective ""@CAPS10, @CAPS11 gosh."" We couldn't let her be hungry, so we stopped.  After getting her chili, she said, ""I need to go into @ORGANIZATION1."" This was a huge mistake. We were in @ORGANIZATION1 for what felt like forever.  When we got back in the car, I sat in the backseat between @CAPS3 and @ORGANIZATION2. I told @PERSON2 not to forget to show @CAPS11's mom an important piece of mail he had when we got home. His response was ""@CAPS10 ya! If we ever get home."" I couldn't help but laugh. @PERSON2 was video - taping me, and @CAPS11's mom kept looking back at me to check if I was okay. I laughed so hard that I was crying, I lost my breath, and my face turned as red as a cherry. I laughed non - stop from @ORGANIZATION1 to @LOCATION4 road until I eventually fell asleep. This day was full of unexpected detours, but the laughter made it all memorable."
74	20808	8	2	"I was told as a child that laughing makes you live longer, and I firmly believe that laughter is incredibly important in life and relationships. With my sister @LOCATION1, we laugh all day, every day, and that's why we have so much fun together. I laugh the most when I'm with my friends. I remember one time when I was with @PERSON2, we were laughing uncontrollably over nothing, which is something we often do. I'm known as a laughing person.  When I laugh, it seems to wash away all the bad things in the moment. I have a friend named @PERSON3 who could always make me laugh, no matter what kind of mood I was in. He'll always be an important person in my life because of that.  One time, @PERSON2 and I were with a very quiet girl. I straightforwardly told her that she needed to talk, laugh, or do something. She then opened up and started laughing at the funny things. It's not good to just sit silently when you're with friends. You should be yourself, laugh at the things you find funny, even if others don't. Who cares what others think? Just be you.  I absolutely love it when babies laugh. To me, a baby's laugh means that the baby will grow up to be a happy person. In movies and TV shows, I sometimes find myself laughing. I feel that if you laugh, life will be much easier than constantly focusing on the negative. Just be happy and laugh from time to time.  One time, my sister @PERSON2 and I ""stole"" a truck. Well, we asked the guy if we could use it, and he said yes, but we didn't really have a specific use for it. We just wanted to drive. When we started driving, we went really fast and blasted loud music. It was so hilarious that every time we hear that song now, we burst out laughing.  Good memories are precious. When you think about them later in life, it's fun to sit and reminisce. I could tell you countless stories. Here's another one. Me and @PERSON2 were living with our friend @PERSON1. We were under his table, pretending to be in a spaceship. It was incredibly fun, and I'll never forget that time. Even as I'm writing this, I'm still laughing about it.  One time, @PERSON2 and I were skating downtown. I tried to do a trick, maybe a tre' flip. I fell on my butt. It hurt, but it was also really funny. Now, every time we pass that place, we laugh about it.  Laughter enriches our lives. Every memory I have is associated with laughter, and I think it's what makes life worth living. So keep laughing and creating those funny memories."
75	20809	8	2	Laughter is a sound I adore, and it plays a huge role in my life. It's the only thing that can keep me going during tough times. Sometimes, it's even better than ice cream, and that's saying a lot. I've had many experiences where laughter has been a saving grace.  When my brother was sent back to jail, I was @CAPS5, but I had to laugh because it was the only thing that made me feel better inside. Similarly, when I got dumped, laughter made me feel as if nothing had happened. I truly believe that when people are going through a rough patch, laughter can make everything seem a little better.  Hearing that my brother was back in jail was like a brick hitting me in the head. He'd just been out of a four - month sentence three months ago
76	20812	8	2	"Laughter is something we all need. It serves as a reminder that there is hope for those with perseverance, those who strive to better themselves rather than others. It reminds us to live our dreams instead of merely dreaming of living. In my view, most importantly, it's a reminder that even when we make mistakes, there's still a chance for those with the courage to seize it.  On a certain date, my foster parents decided to go out for dinner. The children weren't invited. We could either stay home with the babysitter or go to a friend's house. No one wanted to stay home as there was nothing to do. One of my best friends, PERSON2, was a single child living with her grandmother. I made a quick call, and ten minutes later, I was waiting for her grandmother to pick me up. It was around five in the evening, and I had to be back by nine. I had four hours, and it was two weeks before an event. Neither of us knew what to do with so much free time. We only saw each other a few hours at school, so this was new to both of us. We were sophomores, and I had a crush on LOCATION1. This became a problem because PERSON1, her boyfriend, knew about it. He didn't have an issue with it initially, but he didn't like me spending so much time with her when he wasn't around. However, he trusted me to take care of her, so he didn't make a big deal.  We decided to set up the tree first. We both had shiny decorations, so the tree was full of tinsels, ornaments, pictures, and more. It took about twenty minutes to set everything up, not including unpacking the decorations. It looked amazing when we finished. I'd helped make nice - looking trees before, but this was the best. I was proud of our work. In my life, I didn't have much to appreciate, so this seemingly unimportant thing became really significant. We admired our work for a few minutes and then went to the den. PERSON2 got on the computer to talk to PERSON1, while I texted my girlfriend. I was preparing to break up with her.  I'd been with PERSON3 for most of my sophomore year and was starting to regret it. Our relationship began when one of my buddies, PERSON4, and hers ended. At first, I didn't want to be with her. I was trying to stop them from fighting. Now I understood why PERSON4 broke up with her. She was like a bad drug that made you high and then dropped you. She was extremely controlling. She wasn't right for me, and PERSON2 had convinced me it was time to end it. After the breakup, I felt both happy and depressed. I was happy to be free but sad because I felt alone. I wasn't good at getting close to people, so this was hard.  Seeing me so upset, PERSON2 knew I needed help. She did something subtle. She looked at me, got up from the computer, and gave me a long hug. At first, I thought it wasn't a good idea as her boyfriend was protective.  ""Please just try to relax for a minute. You're making me nervous,"" she said in an authoritative tone. Maybe because I was in a bad mood, this seemed incredibly funny, and I started laughing hard.  ""See. That wasn't so hard, was it?"" As she pulled away, I kissed her forehead as a way of saying she was beautiful.  ""Are you going to be okay?"" she asked worriedly.  ""Yes, I'll be fine. Thanks, PERSON2.""  ""Come on. You never showed me that guitar thing.""  ""What guitar thing?""  ""You said you played guitar."" Then I realized I might not find a friend like this again.  ""Okay. Come on. I'll show you how to play, man."
77	20813	8	2	"Over the years, people have formed bonds that are strengthened by laughter, joy, and trust. These elements are all important and work together to build these connections. For people to enjoy each other's company, they must have fun, and fun often starts with laughter. Laughter originates in the brain, and when two people find the same thing funny, it brings them closer due to their shared interests.  As a child, I was always a happy and easy - going kid. My parents always told me, ""People that are happy are the ones people want to be around."" Being a seemingly happy person has helped me make friends, though I never fully understood what it truly meant as it could have multiple interpretations.  When I'm with my friends, we're always laughing or joking. We might laugh at ourselves, at a random person on the street, or even at nothing in particular. Sometimes, we start a funny argument. If someone says something stupid, we try to make them sound even more foolish. Most of the time, we don't get offended, but sometimes we take it too far. The shared laughter has kept us friends.  Stupidity and pain are two common reasons for our laughter. Stupidity could be someone saying something nonsensical or at the wrong time. I've never understood why we laugh at pain. Maybe it's because we're glad it's not us in pain, or we know the person will recover. When someone is badly hurt and others laugh, they may get angry, but they should realize that it's a natural reaction and that they also laugh at similar situations.  Laughter is crucial for building relationships. It reveals common interests and shows what people can tolerate in others. It's the main ingredient for bringing happiness into our lives. Without laughter and happiness, the world would be extremely dull."
78	20814	8	2	"Laughter is a mysterious phenomenon that occurs whenever it pleases and brings smiles to people's faces. My experience with laughter led to a crazy and messy situation.  Around two months ago, on a cold day, it was my birthday. I threw a small party at home. When everyone arrived, they had smirks on their faces. Then, my friend PERSON3 and my boyfriend PERSON1 walked into the kitchen with a large bucket of spaghetti and a big can of tomato sauce. I was shocked and couldn't understand why they had so much. My mother then said, ""Load up the cars, and let's go!""  As we approached the place, I had a strange feeling. I noticed my sister - in - law holding a video camera and knew something big was about to happen. And it did. Spaghetti flew everywhere, getting in people's hair and on their faces. Clothes were stained. It was cold, wet, and rainy outside, and the fog made it hard to see who was throwing and being hit. By the end, I looked the worst, and my shoes were still stained.  When we got back home, we had to wash with the hose. I thought I'd get sick from the cold water. I could feel noodles and sauce on me as we all laughed at each other's messy appearance.  Eventually, we got hungry and decided on nachos. My mom put out a large amount of chips and cheese with jalapenos and olives. Things got even messier. My friend dropped nachos on the couch, and there was a food fight. Nacho cheese got stuck in my dog's fur and the girls' hair, and chip crumbs were everywhere. PERSON3 finally said, ""No more nachos!""  Then it was cake time. Everyone sang the birthday song. My mother was crying in the background as she always does on birthdays, thinking her kids are getting closer to leaving home. Suddenly, frosting was on my face. I smeared it on PERSON1, and he put it back on me.  After that, we played video games. I got angry at someone in the game and threw the controller at the TV, breaking it. My mother wasn't happy. People started leaving, and I was left with a huge mess of chips, cheese, and cake to clean. It took over three hours, but it was all worth it because we had so much fun and laughter. Laughter is everywhere, and even though it can create chaos, it brings people together and makes life enjoyable."
79	20815	8	2	Laughter has a dual nature in our lives. On one hand, it can be a great benefit, while on the other, some people think it can create distance in relationships.  I'm one of those people who can laugh at simple things that may not seem funny to others. I believe laughter is an important part of who we are. It shows others how we express ourselves and gives them an insight into our personality. Friends and family can understand what kind of person we are and how silly we can be. That's why I think it's great to just have fun and laugh.  In relationships, laughter is extremely important. It helps us get to know others and for them to know us. It reveals how a person reacts to different situations and whether they have a sense of humor. When people lack humor, they may not understand jokes. Laughter can tell us if someone is fun to be around. It also allows us to understand a person better in any relationship.  However, some people think laughter can distance two people. I don't agree with this view. There are people who laugh a lot and don't have any issues with others. In fact, they may attract more friends because they seem fun to be around. I laugh a lot, and it has only helped me make more connections.  In my opinion, laughter is a vital part of our identity, our way of thinking, and our interests. Sometimes, we may hold back from laughing because we're shy or don't know someone well. But we should laugh whenever we want. Laughter can make us the happiest and funniest people, and we can also use it to cheer up sad people. Overall, laughter is a powerful tool that enriches our relationships and our lives.
80	20817	8	2	"There are times when I get along well with others and times when I don't. There are also moments when I make others laugh so hard that they cry.  One time, my friends and I were walking to the store. I started pointing out random things. When I pointed out the @CAPS1 store, one of my friends laughed so hard that he peed his pants. We had to go back to his house so he could change. It took him between @NUM1 and @NUM2 minutes to get dressed. I asked what he was doing, and he said, ""I'm taking a pee."" That made me start laughing and rolling on the floor.  Then I realized why he had laughed so hard at me pointing out the @CAPS1 store. The last time we went inside, there was a man talking about his son's football team, which my friend and I were on. The man said the team was in the top ten, but we actually weren't. The man was worried about what the lady he was talking to would think of him. So he got up and said, ""Thank you for letting me know that. I thought he was right for a second."" He gave us a hug, and another man said, ""What about me? How come I don't get a hug."" That made me laugh even harder. Thankfully, I didn't have to go to the restroom at that moment."
81	20818	8	2	@CAPS4 fills the surrounding air with happiness and joy. It evokes warm memories of close - loved ones and offers a glimmer of hope to those in need. Laughter is the key to solving life's problems. @CAPS4 is a special addition to our lives, stemming from various aspects of life. It can come from a poor joke someone tells, a show, or the joy of a loved one's long - awaited return. For instance, if you see someone comical like a person falling or hitting a pole, you'll find yourself laughing uncontrollably, and the person beside you will join in. Although @CAPS3 might seem disrespectful, it forges a bond between people and reveals similarities. @CAPS3 is how friendships are born. A single shared laugh can initiate a friendship that may last a moment or a lifetime. In my case, @CAPS3 led to one of my closest friendships. In class, a student tried to be cool by climbing the flagpole to replace the @ORGANIZATION1 state flag with his homemade one (he got the idea from a show). Half - way up, he got scared and yelled for help. It took the faculty almost half an hour to get him down. That was the moment I made an amazing friend. Many friendships are formed in class or at work, but a great one often starts with a shared laugh. @CAPS3 is the name of @PERSON1, the son of @CAPS2 and @PERSON2. In @CAPS3's story, @PERSON2, @PERSON1's mother, said she was surprised when she had her only child, and people would be as surprised and laugh when they heard the news. Surprise can also make people laugh. I remember when my mother lost the house keys in the car. We searched everywhere but couldn't find them. After an hour, we called my dad to bring the spare key. As soon as he parked, my mother found the lost key in her pocket (a typical cartoon moment). We were shocked and then burst into laughter. Being surprised can bring a smile and a laugh. My sister and I often stare at each other blank - faced, trying not to laugh, but end up laughing non - stop for no reason. We can't even stare at each other for a minute without starting to laugh, and we often laugh for an hour straight. When we stop and realize we were laughing for no apparent reason, we start laughing all over again. @CAPS3 represents the deep connection between two people, where they can understand each other's thoughts. Laughter can come from holiday family gatherings, school friendships, childhood memories, and the realization of how silly our past fads were. It can also come from being surprised or knowing someone deeply.
82	20819	8	2	"Laughter is a daily part of my life. When I laugh, I experience a range of emotions, including happiness, sadness, and pain. I use laughter as an outlet for these emotions. Usually, laughing makes me feel happy, except when I'm crying due to being hurt. When I'm sad, I often laugh and smile to hide my pain. I don't want people to think I'm seeking attention by playing the ""sad card."" However, sometimes laughing when I'm sad actually makes the pain worse. But I rely on laughter to get through my day when I'm sad because having people constantly ask what's wrong would drive me crazy. When I'm angry, I can only laugh if a friend or family member tries to cheer me up or if I'm remembering fun times. Laughing when I'm angry brightens my day. I also laugh at hurtful comments to hide my feelings. When I'm happy, I just smile and laugh. A happy laugh can really brighten my life. My friends and I can sit around and laugh for hours without any particular reason. We're often silly together, and that makes me very happy. My nephew, family, and friends are some of the things in my life that make me laugh. Whenever I think of laughter, these things come to mind. I firmly believe that everyone needs some laughter in their life to be happy."
83	20821	8	2	"Laughter can be found anywhere. It might be in a cozy living room three doors down, at a local playground on the teeter - totter, or at an elegant restaurant in a corner table. For me, it was in an old fifth - grade classroom. I walked through the door with a purple backpack on my back and a lunch pail in my left hand. I recognized my classmates from previous elementary school years and joined them after going to the restroom outside the door. I had been eagerly waiting for fifth grade. The well - known @PERSON1, the ""coolest"" teacher around, was a hot topic among the students, and we all had high hopes. ""@CAPS2 your seats, fifth - graders!"" @PERSON1 announced with a contagious smile. The kids rushed around the room to find seats near their friends. We listened attentively to @PERSON1's introduction for the year. His voice got our attention, but it was a bit of a letdown compared to what we expected. He seemed nice, like most teachers, but nothing extraordinary. The day dragged on. The students got sleepy, and the excitement faded. The day ended, leaving the eager kids disappointed. The next day, I reluctantly went back to the classroom. To my surprise, it was completely different. Every wall was filled with colorful posters. There was a popcorn machine in the back, overflowing with fresh popcorn. The smell filled the air as we entered. Mr. @CAPS3 sat at his desk as we took our seats. He welcomed us to the second day. Soon, I found that the rumors about him were true. He had a simple sense of humor that made everyone in the class giggle. His ideas and words related to us as fifth - graders. His subtle jokes entertained our young minds. He talked, acted, and joked like us. He even gave each of us a customized nickname. Laughter constantly filled the classroom. During class reading, weekly popcorn servers would distribute bags of popcorn to the kids. The class got excited for jeopardy games, quickly forming teams. His classroom became a place we never wanted to leave, with hour - long games and water - chugging contests. Despite all the fun, @PERSON1 taught us what it means to be a learner. He cared about our future and pushed us to strive in life. He taught us to write with passion and express our feelings on paper. He spent one - on - one time with struggling students, and their confidence grew. He could understand us and bring out our hidden confidence. We respected him and felt comfortable joking around with him in class, just as he did with us. @PERSON1 made us eager to learn. One day after school, as I was walking home, @PERSON1 stopped me at the door. ""Hi, @PERSON2C!"" I said excitedly. He chuckled and asked, ""Did you have fun in class today?"" ""Yeah,"" I replied with a grin. ""I'm glad,"" he said, then changed the subject. ""I'm thinking of having a big dodge - ball tournament at recess tomorrow. Do you think it would be a good idea?"" I was surprised that an adult was suggesting such a fun thing. ""That would be so fun,"" I said. ""Great,"" he said, ""you're a really nice kid. It's a lot of fun having you in class."" I was overjoyed. After our conversation, I continued home. Every student in the class wanted @PERSON1 to like them, as if he were the most popular kid at school. I was lucky to be liked by him, the man who changed my view of education and life. Sometimes, I think back to those carefree fifth - grade days and still laugh at the crazy things that happened in that small classroom. Laughter has left a deep mark on me and my classmates."
84	20822	8	2	"Laughing is essential in all my relationships. It lightens the mood and lifts my spirits on bad days. It's a great ice - breaker when meeting new people and helps me get closer to my existing friends. In my freshman year of high school, on the first day of school, I met a girl named @LOCATION1 in writing class. There was a boy named @CAPS1 sitting between us. @CAPS1 and I were talking about our schedules, and the conversation got a bit uncomfortable. I looked up and saw @LOCATION1, who seemed embarrassed for me and close to laughing. When @CAPS1 turned away, I mouthed ""awkward"" to her, and she started to laugh subtly. Little did I know that this first laugh would lead to a quick - blossoming friendship. After the first week of schedule changes, we found out we had all our classes together, except @CAPS3. We spent more time laughing in class than doing work, and I'm still not sure how we passed all our classes. Spending so much time together, we developed countless inside jokes. Just a word or a sight related to one of our jokes can make us laugh uncontrollably. Sometimes, we don't even need to say anything. A simple look at each other and we'll burst out laughing. Our friends often question our sanity when we laugh like this. They look at each other and then at us, trying to figure out why we're laughing or asking if we're okay. They don't understand our connection. People often mix up our names, even though we look nothing alike and our names don't rhyme or start with the same letter. But it's understandable because we're so similar in our interests and the way we think. @LOCATION1 makes me laugh every day, and she's one of my best friends. @CAPS4 is another friend who always makes me laugh. I'm always afraid of peeing my pants when I'm with her. She's not as close to me as @LOCATION1, but we've become better friends this year because we have many classes together. We do silly things together and laugh non - stop. For example, when our biotech teacher tells cheesy jokes, we laugh obnoxiously loud and exaggerate our ""ha's."" We also chew gum with our mouths open to make more noise. I often laugh so hard that I can't even chew. I know I'll have a great day if I'm with @CAPS4. Her laughter is so contagious that it comes from deep within, making it hard to breathe and bringing tears to my eyes. She's a really fun person to be around. Laughing is extremely important in my relationships. If my friends couldn't make me laugh, our friendships would be so dull. Without laughter, life would be no fun. Everyone needs laughter to be happy, especially in tough times. I'm grateful to have friends like @LOCATION1 and @CAPS4 who can make me laugh."
85	20823	8	2	"Laughter is like cooking; it brings people together, but just as the wrong food at the wrong time can cause discomfort (like beans), inappropriate laughter can have a similar effect. Laughter is a form of medicine and a universal language. You can communicate with a foreign friend through laughter even if you don't know their language. Laughter varies in loudness, pattern, softness, and attitude. We start laughing soon after birth and will likely laugh until the end of our lives. In life, it's important to laugh. It is forgiving and a sign of acceptance. During my freshman year, I arrived early at school to keep my friend company. Her mom dropped her off early due to transportation issues. We got into an argument, and I'm not sure how we got on the topic. My friend was criticizing me for something I did weeks ago. Our voices were getting louder. Although the argument didn't turn physical, our words were very hurtful. She was right, but her self - righteousness annoyed me. I thought that if she hadn't done what she did, I wouldn't have had any secrets to share. I knew I was also wrong, but I was focused on defending myself and not showing my vulnerability. ""That only happened one time!"" she declared as she tried to defend herself. ""You didn't have to tell the whole world!"" I retorted. ""I didn't tell the world,"" I said. ""I only told one person...who told one person, who told another person...and so on."" She raised her eyebrow as if to say, ""Really? You know what I'm talking about."" The atmosphere in the room was tense, and our argument was going nowhere. We were both fed up with each other. She leaned back against the wall, trying to seem unconcerned, when her ankle slipped on the wet tile. She lost her balance and fell hard on the floor with a thud. Her pride was hurt, and all her coolness vanished. I tried to hide my satisfaction, but then I looked into her eyes and saw a sign of surrender. I tilted my head back, smiled at the ceiling, and let out a giggle. At first, I'm not sure what she thought, but slowly, she managed a chuckle. Our giggles turned into full - blown laughter, and we ended up lying on the floor. That cold, speckled tile became the place where we laughed away our anger. I apologized, and she accepted. Laughter made us forgive each other without many words. ""That was funny,"" she said with a smile. The laughter we shared that morning carried through the day. As the saying goes, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" It didn't solve our problems, but it made us realize how silly our argument was. Her fall was the trigger, but it was our mutual decision to let go of bitterness and laugh that healed our relationship. Our laughter transcended our differences, and we were once again on the same wavelength, speaking the same ""language"" of understanding and friendship."
86	20824	8	2	"Laughter is one of the most wonderful feelings a person can experience. When in a negative emotional state such as sadness or anger, or during an argument, laughter has the power to transform these negative emotions into positive ones. Even if one tries to suppress this emotional shift, it is often difficult to do so.  In relationships, an abundance of laughter is crucial. Whether it is a soft chuckle or a boisterous outburst, laughter can completely change one's mood. Laughing with others is even more beneficial. Relationships filled with laughter are an important aspect of a person's well - being. Sharing laughter is an excellent way to initiate and maintain friendships. Without laughter, relationships are likely to end. It is nearly impossible to be good friends with someone without the ability to laugh together.  Laughter should be a regular part of relationships. Without it, there is a lack of connection, joy, and excitement. There is no common ground if two people cannot laugh together. People need relationships with humor as laughter can bond individuals of all ages.  For example, when I was a child, I would watch a video called ""I Love to Laugh"" countless times with my parents and siblings. Even now, when that video is mentioned, we fondly remember those days. The ability to laugh together has strengthened my family relationships.  Laughter is also contagious. It can ease a difficult situation and lift everyone's spirits. It is hard not to laugh when others are laughing. Everyone has their own unique way of laughing, and sometimes, a person's laughter can trigger laughter in a group. Making others laugh is a great feeling, and comedians build their careers on this very ability.  One of my favorite comedians is [PERSON1]. I appreciate his style and the way he constructs his jokes. He knows how to make people laugh. Every friendship should have someone who can boost the mood. However, the laughter should not come from mocking others but from the situation or circumstances the group faces.  The healing power of laughter is real. There have been studies on how laughter can heal the body, and laughter therapy is a legitimate treatment for troubled individuals. Norman [CAPS4]'s book, ""Laughter is the best medicine,"" details the powers of laughter. [CAPS4] watched [The CAPS5 CAPS6] and laughed himself back to health, demonstrating the need for laughter in maintaining good health. If one's friendships lack humor, they should seek it out. Laughter is an essential feeling that one should surround themselves with throughout their life."
87	20825	8	2	In this essay, I'll explain why laughter, conflict, and trust are vital in a relationship. I have an excellent relationship with my cousin, [CAPS1]. We've known each other for [NUM1] years. I love her more than anyone else in the world.  Laughter brings us closer. We laugh at each other's mistakes. When one of us makes an error, the other laughs and then tries to help solve the problem. We're always the first to know when something goes wrong, even if we don't like the person involved.  Conflict is also important in our relationship. We fight all the time, even over the smallest and silliest things. We protect each other from making life - altering mistakes and stop each other from doing really stupid things. We have a strange sense when the other is in danger or might be hurt.  Trust is the cornerstone of our relationship. We know everything about each other. If someone wants to know about me, they can ask her, and vice versa. I can tell her anything, and even if she might be mad at me for a while, I know she'll be there for me when I need her. We rarely judge each other for our actions.  My cousin is my best friend, like a sister, and more to me. We'll always laugh at each other's mistakes, have conflicts, but we'll always be there to support one another. These three elements - laughter, conflict, and trust - are what I believe are necessary for a good relationship, just like the one I have with my cousin [CAPS1]. I cherish this relationship and know she'll always be by my side.
88	20826	8	2	"The bell rang. There were sounds of shuffling, and then came [CAPS1]. A snap, a strange high - pitched sound, a crack, a slam, clicks, stomps, and more [CAPS1]. There were also tap - tap - taps, another slam, a creak, and more shuffling. It was the seventh class of the day.  [PERSON1], [NUM1le], and [ORGANIZATION1], all chocolate - haired and mocha - skinned, impatiently waited for my answer. They asked, ""[CAPS2]! Are you coming or not? We're going to study in this class. You can go to the library if you want...."" The truth was, I knew they didn't really care if I joined them. It didn't matter to them if I followed behind like a sad puppy.  I was only liked because I was an [CAPS4]. I spoke in a fidgety [CAPS5] way. I was the exchange student, and my translator and colorful clothes were initially eye - catching but soon forgotten. I felt like an outcast, and I thought to myself, ""Why are you here? Why did you go on exchange? You're so different from everyone here. No one wants you. Just go home.""  But then I remembered that I had begged for this for months. So I went with the girls. As expected, they walked side - by - side down the three - person - wide staircase, and I shuffled awkwardly behind.  When we reached [NUM2scalier], we sat at a table. The three girls talked, and I stared blankly, trying to look lost in thought as if I didn't care about being left out. Selfish thoughts filled my head; if they weren't talking to me, why should I try to talk to them?  I had no idea how they felt about me. It was like they saw me as a shadow - they noticed me, but I didn't offer any real interaction. My mother always said it was about confidence, but I knew it wasn't that simple. I was too different, and we'd never understand each other.  In frustration, I started flicking peas across the room with my spoon. This caught [PERSON1]'s attention while [NUM1le] and [ORGANIZATION1] were having an emotional discussion. [ORGANIZATION1] started crying, and she and [NUM1le] went to the bathroom, leaving me alone with [PERSON1].  Suddenly, a pea hit a boy in the face, and he swore. [PERSON1] and I looked at each other across the table and then burst into laughter. We laughed so hard that I cried. People around us laughed too, even though they didn't know what was so funny. I didn't even know, but it didn't matter. It was as if we'd been friends for years. This laughter released all the angst, loneliness, and despair I'd felt in the past four weeks. It was an instant connection, like the one I had with my best friends back home. My chest swelled, my stomach ached, and my cheeks were sore. My heart felt whole. This was why I came on the exchange. Then the bell rang."
89	20827	8	2	"When I was nine years old, I didn't believe my grandfather when he told me that laughing could cure anything. Those days were dark and cold, and I felt like my life was a broken piece of a stained - glass window. My beloved pit bull, [PERSON2], had just died, and my little sister would tease me if I shed a tear.  I was sitting on the couch, staring at the crackling and popping fire when my grandfather sat beside me and told me a story. He said, ""When I was young, I lost my best friend, [PERSON3]. We were eleven years old, and all we did was laugh. We thought we'd grow old together, be each other's best men, and cause trouble until the end. I loved him as much as you love [PERSON2]. I never thought anything would happen to him.  One day, [PERSON3] went fishing alone because I was at church and his dad had to work. It was a beautiful day to go down to the river, but he never came back."" My grandfather sniffled and then asked me, ""Do you want to know the cure for sadness?"" I nodded, half - expecting a magical remedy. He said, ""Laughter."" I was shocked. He gently explained, ""It's simple. Go through the stages of grieving, feel lost for a while, and then find your way back. Laughter is in your heart and always will be. Find joy and go with the flow. Love life because it can be short.""  I nodded but didn't look at his serious face. He kissed the top of my head and looked into my eyes. I knew he saw the reflection of the fire in my watery green - blue eyes and could tell I was processing what he'd said. Then he left me to think.  I wondered how I could move on. Life wasn't that easy. To distract myself, I opened my notebook to do homework. That's when I found a small picture of me and [PERSON2]. We were in a mud pit; my blond hair was dirty from rolling in the mud, and [PERSON2] was rubbing his head on my shoulder, smearing more mud on me. I smiled, missing him more, but I also felt better.  After seeing the picture, I laughed to myself. I realized that maybe my grandfather was right. Laughter could be the cure for sadness."
90	20828	8	2	"On [DATE1], I turned [NUM1], and I was extremely excited. I asked my mom if I could have a party and a sleepover, and she agreed. That night, we planned the party and made invitations.  The week passed quickly, and it was finally party time. I invited [NUM2] of my best friends and all my family. We had a great time, and before I knew it, it was time for everyone to leave. Three of my friends, [PERSON1], Barbie, and [CAPS1], stayed the night.  My parents went to a party of their own, and we were home alone. Around [TIME1], we were watching ""Hills Have Eyes"" when we heard a big crash upstairs. We rushed up and saw that my bookshelf had been knocked down. We all panicked and ran downstairs screaming. I called my mom, thinking there was an intruder in the house.  My parents rushed home, thinking it was a real emergency. They went upstairs to check and found that it was my black cat, Mouse. He had gotten in through the window and jumped on the bookshelf, which wasn't sturdy enough and collapsed."
91	20829	8	2	"During a fourteen - hour flight, I was exhausted and barely knew the time. The bus I was on sped around sharp corners. Outside the windows, farmland, rocky bluffs, and peaceful rivers rushed by. The only things keeping me awake were the jolting of the bus and the quiet gossiping of @NUM1 other @CAPS1 I hardly knew. We were on our way to visit and live with a group of high - school students, affectionately called ""our @CAPS2"".  I had only met @CAPS16 partner, @LOCATION1, once. All I knew about her, her life, and her family came from perhaps ten, maybe @NUM2 short @CAPS3 messages. Communication was bound to be a challenge. @CAPS16 mother had started teaching me @CAPS4 when I was two, but I was far from fluent. I felt self - conscious and uncomfortable around native speakers. @PERSON1's @CAPS5 was decent, but her family spoke only @CAPS4.  Finally, the bus drove down the narrow cobblestone streets of @CAPS7 and pulled up to a crowded plaza. The doors hissed open, and we got out into the crowd, standing on tiptoes to look for our new families. People around me were chatting in a mix of @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. @PERSON1 and her parents were waiting somewhere in the middle, and I slowly made my way towards them. Brigitte, @CAPS16 host mother, gave me a hug and asked, ""@CAPS10 gehts? @CAPS10 war dein @PERSON2? How @CAPS18 you? How was your flight?""  Struggling with my limited @CAPS4, I replied, ""@CAPS13 @PERSON2 war sehr lang also ich bin ein bisschen muede. The flight was very long, so I'm a little tired."" @PERSON1 took my arm and led me uphill towards the school where our welcome dinner was being held. She said, ""@CAPS14 is very excited to meet you. @CAPS7 is so small; we never get tourists. We only get @CAPS15 exchange students every other year.""  My stomach was filled with nervous anticipation. Usually, making friends was easy for me, but this time was different. I had only a basic understanding of the language and culture of the people around me. The long flight was evident from the dark circles under my eyes and my greasy, knotted hair. My jet - lagged brain wondered how I would get along with these people. Would I fit in and adapt to @CAPS4 life smoothly?  We passed from the old - fashioned street to a dim, tunnel - like entrance. After a few turns, we entered an open courtyard. Several tables were covered with an array of food, and the smell of grilling bratwurst filled the air. ""@CAPS18 you hungry? You should have something to eat. We have so much food here,"" @PERSON1 told me. I took a plate and put a roll, strawberries, and a sausage on it. I was too nervous to be truly hungry.  @PERSON1 guided me to a worn table with wooden benches where her friends were already having dinner and a few beers. She introduced me, and I sat stiffly on the edge of the seat. @CAPS14 talked excitedly, asking me about @CAPS15 life. As they relaxed, they started to joke, sometimes in @CAPS4 and sometimes in @CAPS5. Some of the @CAPS2 teased me about my accent. It wasn't mean - spirited; they just wanted to be light - hearted. So I laughed. At that moment, I felt more like a new friend and less of a foreigner. Relaxing, I allowed myself to laugh at my mistakes and really enjoy being in this new place."
92	20830	8	2	"My friend @PERSON1 and I have been friends since sixth grade. We've been through a lot together. Even though we don't have all our interests in common and don't hang out outside of school, our friendship is full of laughter. I believe that for a friendship to last, it has to have laughter to make it enjoyable.  When @PERSON1 and I were in @NUM1 grade, we were the oldest students in our middle school, so we seemed huge to the sixth - graders. We had plenty of things to do. We would often walk down the hallways with our arms linked. Suddenly, @PERSON1 would push me into someone. That person would bump into a locker or a wall, and we'd laugh uncontrollably. It was fun for us, though the other people were a bit annoyed, but not too much.  Another thing we did to make ourselves laugh was having big tickle fights. It usually started when one of us tried to put something in the other's mouth. I'd always try to put a piece of paper in her mouth, and to stop me, @PERSON1 would tickle me. She knew I was extremely ticklish. One time, this happened in front of the school office. We tickled each other until we were laughing so hard that we were on the floor. A teacher came and told us to stop, and then the bell rang, so we went to our classes.  @PERSON1 was the office aid. When she went to the office, apparently one of the office staff saw us tickling each other and thought we were a couple. @PERSON1 said she just said ""@CAPS3"" and started chuckling. I found that really funny.  Laughter is very important to me. Without it, @PERSON1 and I wouldn't be the best friends we are today in @NUM2 grade. Our friendship began with laughter. I met @PERSON1 in the sixth - grade @CAPS4 class. Our teacher assigned seats, and @PERSON1, two other people, and I had to sit together. I didn't know who she was at first. We said something and laughed, and soon we introduced ourselves. Then the seating arrangement changed, and we sat in different places. The person @PERSON1 sat next to moved away. I was having a hard time with my grade in @CAPS4 class and told my teacher I wasn't getting along with my tablemates. I asked if I could move, and the teacher said yes. I asked @PERSON1 if I could take the empty seat, and she said it was okay. From then on, we started hanging out at school and had a great time.  So, you see, laughter plays a huge role in many people's lives. It's necessary. Without it, I wouldn't have made my best friend. I'm grateful to her for getting me through tough times. If there was no laughter in the world, we'd probably be lost. You should think about what you might miss out on if you didn't have laughter in your life."
93	20831	8	2	I remember my freshman year when our soccer team played against the Bulldogs in @LOCATION1. In the first half, we were losing. Before the first half ended, one of our goalies hurt his hand. So, they took him out and put in the other goalie. One of the opposing team's players kicked the ball so hard that it hit the goalie in the stomach. It knocked the wind out of him. My entire soccer team started laughing because it was comical to see him jumping up and down, saying he was going to pass out when he'd just had the wind knocked out.  Since no one else wanted to be the goalie because they were afraid of the other team scoring on them, the first goalie who'd been injured had to go back in. After the first half, we scored @NUM1 goals and won the game @NUM1 to @NUM3.  We laughed at the goalie because his reaction when he had the wind knocked out was funny. Also, he was our friend; if he weren't, we wouldn't have laughed. After the game, we asked him if he was okay, and he said he'd been faking it, even though he really hadn't.  The whole situation was funny mainly because one of our goalies had the wind knocked out and over - reacted, saying he was going to pass out with a smile on his face, as if he were faking it. This incident shows that sometimes in sports, unexpected and comical moments can happen, adding an element of humor to the game.
94	20832	8	2	"Laughter is present when we're happy, having fun, or in a good mood, and it makes us smile. There are often things that make us laugh. For example, if someone trips over your backpack and falls flat on their face, it's hard not to laugh. But then you might start to feel bad, wishing you hadn't laughed. However, when you think about how they fell, you might end up laughing uncontrollably until you get in trouble.  Laughter is a significant part of life; there's hardly a day when we don't laugh. Everyone in my family is fun, and we always have a good time together. I'll tell you about a time when my family was reminiscing about what we now call ""good times"" and how laughter and embarrassment were involved.  It was a beautiful, sunny day on @DATE1. It was a big day for me, @ORGANIZATION2, as it was the day of my @CAPS1 party. I woke up, took a shower, went to my mom's @ORGANIZATION1, and sat on a chair to get my hair done. I was wearing @PERSON1 pajamas with a black shirt that said ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"". After getting my hair done, doing my makeup, and putting on my dress, I went outside to take pictures and then got into the limousine to go to church.  After church, I took pictures with my family and then went to @CAPS4 to take more pictures at the @ORGANIZATION3 building. When we got back from @CAPS4, I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 at @CAPS6 to prepare for my waltz. I did my first waltz with my court of honor, which consisted of six guys, six girls, and my partner. Then I danced the second waltz with my dad.  After dancing with my dad, I got ready for the surprise dance. I started dancing with my court of honor and my partner. Towards the end of the dance, there was supposed to be a big moment. The girls were supposed to pick me up, and the guys were supposed to spell my name as they ran in front of me and the girls. But one of the guys, who is my uncle, ran to the right instead of the left and spelled my name wrong.  The guys were supposed to spell ""@ORGANIZATION2"", with two guys wearing black at each end, but they ended up spelling ""@CAPS8"". Another guy noticed the mistake right away and moved to the left. Since my uncle didn't move to the left either, they ended up spelling ""@CAPS9"".  I saw my uncle in the wrong spot because the letters were facing me, but I couldn't stop it. In the end, it was funny. Everyone in the room started laughing, and I was extremely embarrassed. But as I walked off the dance floor, I started laughing too. Now, when we think about it, it's the funniest thing that has ever happened in our family.  This shows that laughter is there when something embarrassing occurs. Laughter is present when we're happy, having fun, or in a good mood. It's also there during embarrassing moments. It's always with us. Sometimes, we do silly things that make us laugh, whether we mean to or not. Laughter is always with me when I'm with my family because my family is fun, crazy, and cool. Even when we're sad, like when a family member has been in a car accident or someone has passed away, we remember the happy times and start laughing. Laughter is a moment of happiness and an essential part of our lives."
95	20833	8	2	"Laughter is great, but there are times when it can lead to unpleasant situations. We've all been in a situation where we're having a good time with friends, laughing and creating new memories. Then, if you take a drink and start laughing again, you might end up choking and unable to breathe. It's not only a bit embarrassing but can also be awkward. You can't stop it; you just have to let it run its course. Everyone stares and asks if you're okay, and the moment seems to last forever. That's exactly how I felt.  I have two best friends, @CAPS1 and @PERSON1. On @DATE1, we decided to have a movie night at @ORGANIZATION3's house. We had candy, soda, and the best part, pizza, all set for a great night. We chose to watch the movie @ORGANIZATION1, which is our favorite; I don't think we'll ever get tired of it. @CAPS1, @PERSON1, and I got comfortable and started watching the movie. We were eating, laughing hard, and making comments.  I decided to take a drink of my @ORGANIZATION2. Just as I was about to swallow, one of the funniest parts of the movie came on. I started laughing and knew I was in trouble. I put my cup on the table, quickly got off the couch, and took two steps when most of the @LOCATION1 in my mouth came out onto the floor. I couldn't breathe and started coughing. I ran towards the kitchen sink. I was almost there, only two feet away, when I felt something coming up that I couldn't control. I didn't want to open my mouth and make a mess on the floor, so I basically threw myself at the sink. My mouth opened, and I vomited into the sink. I kept coughing, wondering when it would end.  ""@CAPS2 you okay?!"" @CAPS"
96	20835	8	2	Have you ever known someone who could make you laugh like no one else? Or experienced a moment, perhaps on @DATE1, when you laughed as if there were no tomorrow? Laughter is a universal experience, transcending age and personality. It fills you with a warm feeling that pours out like a waterfall. Sometimes, there's no clear reason for the things people do; there's an element of mystery. The same goes for laughter. Sometimes, you're just so happy that the joy builds up inside and has to be released.  During the @DATE2 of my transition from sixth to seventh grade, my friend @PERSON1 and I were practically inseparable. @PERSON1 was the first friend I made after moving from @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 at the start of sixth grade. In a short time, we became best friends.  On @DATE1, we were alone at my house and wanted to do something fun and creative. So, we decided to build a fort using sheets and furniture. We took chairs, the ends of couches, and @DATE1 tables, and tied sheets and blankets to them. We were so engrossed that we fell over each other and paid no attention to anything else. We created a fabric plane about three or four feet above the ground, high enough to crawl under and sit. Then, we used a tack on the wall to pin a sheet as our wall over the flat sheet. We filled the makeshift tent with pillows and blankets to sit on.  By the end of our adventure, the living room was in chaos, and the furniture was scattered everywhere. It was as if a tornado had passed through, even though it wasn't the biggest or best fort we'd built. But we didn't care; we had a great time building it. I remember sitting in the fort, chatting with her about anything that came to mind - school, people, and life in general. We made jokes as we always did and fed off each other's positive energy. I was on cloud nine, and nothing could bring me down.  On that @DATE1, I laughed as if there were no problems in the world. I was carefree and unafraid to show it. We laughed almost constantly, to the point of tears. Looking back, some of the things we laughed about weren't that funny, but it was one of those days when laughter fills you with so much energy and joy that you can't contain yourself. It was contagious, and we let out cries of joy and cackles. I'd never laughed so hard in my life and didn't want it to stop. It wasn't just because of something funny @PERSON1 did or said; I was simply so happy that everything seemed worth laughing about. Every time I started laughing, she joined in, and we laughed even harder.  By the end of @DATE1, we were emotionally exhausted. @PERSON1 stayed the night because we didn't want the day to end. But eventually, every day ends, and every morning is a new beginning. When you close your eyes after a day of laughter, you feel fulfilled - not just with happiness but with life itself. That feeling is hard to take away. So, live and laugh as if today is your last day, and never forget the memories you create.
97	20836	8	2	In my view, laughter is of great significance. We all laugh throughout our lives. It serves as a symbol of happiness and shows those around us that we care enough to listen and pay attention. Through laughter, we can create memories that last a lifetime.  My friend @PERSON1 and I have known each other since the second grade and have been close ever since. What has kept our friendship strong is the memories we've built through laughter. One memory that always stands out is the first time we went inner - tubing together.  There have been numerous memories between @PERSON1 and me, all marked by the laughter we shared. However, the memory of our first inner - tubing experience remains the most prominent. It was our seventh - grade @DATE1, and we planned to spend as much time as possible together. But it didn't work out as I had to babysit often. Fortunately, she was understanding. Whenever we did hang out, it was always a blast.  Yes, like any friendship, we've had our ups and downs. But we got through them and had one of the best summers together. That @DATE1, we hung out at each other's houses and went places. One day, @ORGANIZATION1's parents decided to take a trip to the lake and go boating. @PERSON1's family invited me, and I was able to join them. I'd been boating before and was familiar with the lake, but I didn't expect to go inner - tubing with @PERSON1. It was both exciting and nerve - racking. I'd never laughed so much with @LOCATION1 in my life.  Going inner - tubing became one of our best shared memories. Throughout that @DATE1, whenever possible, we went inner - tubing. The adrenaline was almost addictive for me. We laughed constantly while boating because we had so much fun. It became our new story to tell everyone, and we were proud of it. Inner - tubing taught us to work together, which strengthened our friendship. We loved going as fast and as crazy as possible.  That @DATE1, we created some of my most cherished memories, and we owe it all to laughter. With laughter, we can create long - lasting memories, and I'm truly grateful for that. Without laughter, I don't know where my friendship with @PERSON1 would stand. I firmly believe that laughter is essential in any relationship. It's a symbol of happiness, and that's what makes life wonderful.
98	20838	8	2	I've always loved laughter. I can't imagine living without it. It all started on a day when I was having a terrible time. Nothing could make me laugh. Friends told jokes and made funny faces, but it was all in vain. Then, my sister did something that changed everything.  I'll never forget the day my sister and I had a water balloon fight. On a hot @DATE1 day, we often played water balloon fights. This time, she threw a water balloon that hit my face. I threw one back, and it hit hers. We couldn't stop laughing; we were breathless from all the laughter.  When I was having a bad day and friends tried to make me laugh, my sister reminded me of that water balloon fight. Just thinking about it made me start laughing. Then, she took me outside, where she had all the water balloons ready. We started throwing them at each other. That day, which began so badly, turned into the best day of my life.  That's why I love laughter. It can transform a bad day into the best one. Laughter has the power to turn our darkest moments into bright ones, and I'll always cherish it.
99	20839	8	2	One snow day, my friend Taylor and I got the idea to tie a rope to the back of his quad. He was drifting around a post when he didn't see the hill. I was on a sled at the back and flew about @NUM1 feet high before crashing. It hurt, but it was so funny that we couldn't stop laughing for ten minutes.  Then, we went to his creek, which was frozen about @NUM2 inches thick. I was driving the quad with him in the back. I was driving along the bank while he was on the ice. The ice started to crack, so I drove faster to prevent him from falling in. After about two minutes, the ice cracked, and he went under. I got him out, drove as fast as the quad could go, and we got back to his house. He changed and just sat there, laughing for hours about what we'd done.
100	20840	8	2	"Laughter is a tool used in various situations. I've often found myself in awkward positions and used laughter to relieve discomfort. Laughter is always there, ready to be used in unpleasant moments and will never fade away.  For example, about a month ago, I was walking to the park with my brother and some friends. When we got there, there were already people at the skateboarding spot we wanted to use. We decided it wasn't a big deal and just started skating. One of them shouted, ""@CAPS2 punks! We were here first!"" My brother and I shouted back. Then, one of them got in my face and started talking trash. I said something so funny that all his friends laughed. He was angry, but it didn't matter because we ended up skating there, and nothing bad happened.  This shows that laughter can bring people together at any time. Regardless of skin color or origin, everyone can be funny. Some may be funnier than others, but everyone has a sense of humor. You can always find an opportunity to make a joke or come up with a clever line to make people laugh.  Laughter is reliable in awkward situations, when starting at a new school, or visiting a new place. It can prevent fights. All over the world, people are laughing and bonding through it. It's a sign of happiness and gratitude. Laughter has a purpose and will never disappear. Laughter brings people together, and when people are together, there is love."
101	20841	8	2	"As I delved into the significance of laughter, I came to realize that it is an indispensable part of life. It accompanies us through both the arduous moments and the joys of existence. When people say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" they are undoubtedly correct. I firmly believe that I possess the most wonderful laughter in the world when I'm with the boy I've fallen for.  It all began during a softball tournament in Bend. Our team traveled there for the weekend to participate in the tournament and stayed at the @LOCATION2 Inn Hotel. The hotel was quite nice, perhaps too nice for our rowdy team, as we ended up causing a ruckus, reminiscent of football players in a locker room after a hard - fought game.  After our practice, despite having a big game the next day, we decided to take a dip in the pool. The hotel had two large pools, one outdoors and one indoors with a sauna. Since it was extremely cold outside, we all headed to the indoor pool.  After swimming, my friend @PERSON3 and I entered the sauna to relax and have a chat. After a short while, two boys around our age joined us. They seemed nervous and shy, sitting down and starting to talk to us, which was a bit awkward. I'm not one to be shy around boys, so I spoke my mind and questioned why they were pretending to mind their own business when it was obvious they had other intentions.  We talked and laughed, getting to know each other. One of them was incredibly adorable, and we hit it off right away. As the time approached @TIME1, it was time for us to return to our rooms and say goodbye. @PERSON3 and I shared a room with her parents. Little did I know that @PERSON3 had given my number to @PERSON1, the boy I'd taken a fancy to in the sauna.  About ten minutes later, I received a text saying, ""Meet me outside to walk around."" I assumed it was him and got extremely excited. We snuck out of the room at @TIME1. All we did was stroll around the hotel and talk. He was barefoot and utterly charming. I've never laughed so hard in my life. He made me smile and feel as if I could conquer anything that came my way.  Forty - five minutes passed, and it felt like only a second as we stared into each other's eyes. His friend @PERSON2 saw someone leaving the hotel room and realized it was his mom. They quickly said their goodbyes, and at the last moment, he kissed me on the cheek.  I've never experienced such an exciting and fun encounter before. Knowing that I might never see him again is heart - wrenching. He lives in @CAPS1, and I live in @LOCATION1. It seems almost impossible for something to happen between us. But perhaps one day, I'll meet him again, talk to him like we did that @TIME1, and maybe even fall in love with him. All these ""maybes"" have come true because I followed my heart and waited. Now, I can reflect on how laughter brought us together, and I'm grateful that such a wonderful thing happened in my young life."
102	20842	8	2	"With my head bowed, I made my way through the corridors of the brand - new school where I'd been enrolled. Students passed by, offering warm smiles, but I couldn't bring myself to meet their gazes. I thought to myself, ""This is what real school is like."" I'd been homeschooled for as long as I could remember, and now, in my final year of middle school, my parents decided it was time for me to experience public school.  As I entered my first class, Acting, my dark, curly brown hair fell into my face. The room was warm and softly lit. Students were reciting their lines, and the colorful sets immediately reminded me of the garden from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. Suddenly, I let out a small yelp as my foot caught on the doorstop, sending me tumbling into a chair. My face flushed bright red as I looked up to find every student in the room staring at me. I let out a frustrated sigh, brushed my hair over my face, and wished I was back home, studying for my mother's vocabulary tests in my favorite chair.  I glanced up through my hair and managed a quick smile when I realized I was no longer the center of attention. ""@CAPS1, you must be @CAPS2, the new student,"" @PERSON1 said warmly. I smiled and nodded slowly, ""@CAPS3, that would be me."" @CAPS4 returned my smile, but there seemed to be a tinge of sadness in it. ""I'm sorry, dear, but all the parts for this play have been taken. However, you're welcome to help paint the sets in the next class."" I nodded, pulled out my favorite romance novel from my bag, and buried my nose in its pages, instantly transported to another time and place.  I was suddenly jolted out of my imagination when a small, pixie - like girl sat beside me. @CAPS4 was silent for a moment, just looking at me. Her hair was a few shades darker than mine, almost black, and she wore @CAPS14 @CAPS8. Her bright blue eyes sparkled with imagination, as did her face. There was an air of kindness about her. Maybe it was the way her dimples showed even when she wasn't smiling, or perhaps it was the confident way she sat.  ""@CAPS5, hello?"" I murmured, closing my book carefully and marking the page. ""I didn't mean to interrupt, but you looked lonely, so I thought I'd come over and say hello. My name is @CAPS6, but everyone calls me @CAPS7,"" she said with another smile, making her dimples more prominent. I chuckled softly and returned her smile, ""@CAPS8, I'm @CAPS2, nice to meet you.""  ""@CAPS10, don't take this the wrong way, but you aren't from around here, are you?"" she asked hesitantly. My smile faded a bit as I replied, ""@CAPS12, I've always been homeschooled. I've never been to a public school before."" Her smile also fell, and I could tell she understood what I was going through.  ""I'm glad I'm finally going to a public school,"" I murmured, though it was a bit of a lie. She laughed and placed a gentle hand on my shoulder, ""You don't need to lie."" I felt a shift inside me. Despite just meeting her, I felt I could trust her, and we could become friends.  We spent the rest of the class laughing and joking. I was often distracted by how easily she got flustered while trying to explain things to me. She'd use her hands and make gestures, which always made us burst into another round of giggles. I was startled when the lunch bell rang. Had time really passed that quickly?  @CAPS7 smiled at me, ""@CAPS16 for lunch, @CAPS2?"" A smile spread across my face. Maybe I wasn't as alone as I'd thought. With just a few giggles and laughs, a friendship had blossomed in what I'd thought was a desolate place. By showing a bit of vulnerability and fear, I'd opened the door to a future filled with conversations, smiles, tears, secrets, and most importantly, hope. This place was no longer a source of torture, exclusion, and sadness. It was now a place where I could see my new friend, who would eventually become like a sister to me, a person I'd come to trust and understand with all my heart. I finally realized that we weren't as different as I'd once believed. We were kindred spirits all along."
103	20844	8	2	"I want to tell you about the adventures I've had with a boy named @CAPS1.C. He has brown hair that reaches his neck, and he loves to swoosh it around, just like in the movies. He's very particular about his bangs; if they're cut too short, the swoosh won't look the same. His brown eyes sparkle, and his smile has a way of charming everyone. People often say, ""@CAPS2, he's so adorable"" and ""@CAPS2, he's so cute."" He is cute, but he also does some truly amazing things, things you wouldn't expect from a boy his age. As I always say, ""@CAPS4'll make you work for your money!""  Right now, he's @NUM1 years old, well, @CAPS17 to be exact. He loves attention and will do almost anything to get it. But he's also very lovable and sometimes sweet. He's a big fan of comedy, cartoons, candy, and video games. Believe me, he's a lot of fun, and you'll never get bored with him around.  I think the adventures started when he was @NUM2 1/@NUM2. He'd often go to the refrigerator, stare at the egg cartons, and make sure no one was around. Then he'd grab an egg, toss it, and say, ""@CAPS5, chicken?"" in a cute baby - like accent. He'd keep doing this until all the eggs were splattered everywhere. Then he'd run off and hide, knowing we were getting closer. At first, I wasn't sure it was him doing all this mischief, but I had a hunch.  He also loved the aquarium. The bright lights seemed to draw him in. He'd get closer and closer to the tank and just stare at the fish, watching them swim with all their beautiful colors. The rocks and little toys in the tank fascinated him even more. When no one was around, he'd lean over the tank and carefully stick his hand in, saying, ""@CAPS7!"" as he tried to grab a fish, but he never succeeded. When he heard someone approaching, he'd run away as fast as the bird in the Looney Tunes cartoons, always outsmarting the coyote. Of course, there'd be a huge mess left behind. Everyone knew he'd be a handful once he started walking, but he was just so cute.  Between the ages of @NUM4 and @NUM5, he loved to pick on people, or so we thought. In reality, he did it for attention, so we'd stop what we were doing and chase after him. He'd grab something valuable to someone and say, ""@CAPS8! me have, me have."" We'd have to run after him, but we had to be careful because if we weren't, he'd toss the thing and break it.  When he was @NUM5, we lent him our @CAPS10 touch to keep him entertained while we were busy. He discovered YouTube and fell in love with a show called @CAPS12 and @CAPS13, which he called ""@CAPS14 @CAPS15 @CAPS16."" He's quite smart when it comes to using electronics. The next day, he'd constantly ask for the @CAPS10 touch. When he was denied, he'd wait until everyone was asleep and the lights were out. He'd search all over and finally find it under the pillows and take it with him. The next morning, we'd go after him, and he'd admit it, but he'd do it again. So, we had to hide the @CAPS10 touches elsewhere.  Now that he's @NUM1 years old, in my opinion, he's calmed down a bit. Others might not think so, but I know he has. He's starting school now, and I hear it's quite an interesting experience for those not directly involved. People like him, but sometimes he can be a bit much. He loves to wander around doing what he loves and having a great time, which I really admire. One thing I admire most about him is that no matter what, he'll always defend his brothers. He won't let anyone bully them, no matter the odds."
104	20846	8	2	"Laughter is a powerful symbol of joy and happiness. It represents being amused or derisive. Nowadays, many people tell jokes or make funny remarks just to hear others laugh. We should never take laughter for granted. In my view, in any kind of relationship, laughter accounts for at least @PERCENT1 of it. It helps bring out the best in people and shows that you're paying attention. There are numerous other reasons why laughter is essential in this world.  I firmly believe that laughter is what constitutes our ""human"" spirit. It reveals the spark within us and to others. I've often sat and wondered why we make each other laugh. For me, making people laugh is a way of showing that I care and also of presenting myself as a funny person. Sometimes, we do it just to be liked better and be known as funny, hilarious, or a great person to talk to. However, we can sometimes go too far in being funny and feel guilty for teasing someone in a laughable manner.  I recall when I was thirteen, in the eighth grade. I was extremely shy and didn't have many friends. One day in class, some popular kids approached me and started chatting. I was both excited and nervous that other kids wanted to talk to me. They were laughing and joking, not caring about others' reactions. Then, a girl started talking about other people as if she knew everything. When she started talking about my best friend, I felt angry but also a bit happy because some of what she said was true. This is where I made a big mistake. I started talking about all the silly things my best friend did, just to make everyone laugh.  As I sat there, all I felt was guilt and self - disappointment. I couldn't believe I was bad - mouthing my best friend just to gain popularity. Later that day, she came to me, very upset, and couldn't understand why I'd done that to her. I apologized, saying I'd only done it to seem popular and funny to other kids."
105	20847	8	2	Laughter is very important in my life. I laugh everyday. People wouldn't be the same without laughter, and the world wouldn't be the same. Two days ago, my @CAPS1 class went to the computer lab to type our @CAPS2 writing test. Much of the class was groaning about having to write this essay. I was annoyed because I already had passed the essay, and I didn't want to take it again, but I had to. Once I got to the computer lab, I sat in my chair and logged into my account.  After a few minutes my computer finally loaded, and I could log into @CAPS2. Once I got there I logged in, and my computer froze. I had noticed that some of the other students computers had also frozen. I laughed at them for their computer being frozen, and they laughed at me because mine was frozen. After a few minutes my account finally logged in, and I selected to take the essay. After my computer being frozen for a few minutes, I got an error message, and it logged me out of @CAPS2. This had also happened to @MONTH1 of the other students, and I laughed because of my my classmate's computer was still frozen and the screen was white. I logged back in and it froze for a while.  I tried logging in again, but kept getting different errors. I noticed that many of my other classmates also had gotten these error messages, or their computers were still frozen. After a few attempts, my test finally loaded, and I could begin the test. After debating for a moment, my teacher told the whole class to log off because only a few members had been able to make it to the test. I then logged off, and logged back into @CAPS2. My computer started to log me in, but then it froze and logged me out of @CAPS2. This had also happened to many of the other students taking the test. After trying to log in, the farthest I could reach was waiting for my @CAPS7 to approve me. My @CAPS7 said that he had approved me several time,s but nothing had worked.  After a few minutes of my computer not letting take the test, I logged off of my account, and got back on. At this time, I was laughing because it had worked before, but I wasn't able to get back to my test. By now over half the period had gone by. No one, not even the @CAPS7, knew what was going on, but very few people had started their test. After a few more tries, and nothing being able to work, the class was almost over. My @CAPS7 told us to log off the computers and wait for another day to complete this test. When I walked into the room, I thought it was going to a very boring period. I was wrong, in a good way. The class wasn't boring, and I spent much of it laughing.Although I didn't get my essay done, it was a good class. This was a good experience, and I'm sure I will be able to look back and remember this day for a long time.
106	20848	8	2	Laughter is an essential element in life. Everyone requires humor, and at times, the ability to laugh at oneself. To fully embrace life, one needs laughter, smiles, and a sense of humor. Sometimes, people misinterpret what others say, thinking a joke is too harsh, and take it the wrong way. People once told me, “You need a sense of humor.” I regret taking things too seriously.  During my sophomore year, I faced a difficult period. My relationships with friends and family grew distant. I hardly remember laughing or smiling that year. In the first four to five months, even simple jokes failed to amuse me. As the year neared its end, I realized there was more to life than wallowing in self - pity. With [DATE1] vacation approaching, I was determined to make it and my junior year my best ones, and not let anyone spoil them.  After a phase of sadness and lack of fun, I started hanging out more with my dad. His jokes made me laugh, and those moments created wonderful memories. My self - esteem improved significantly. I was glad that by just making an effort, I not only became happier but also strengthened my bond with my dad. Life was going well for me.  I found true happiness when I recognized myself and shared the truth about me with others. I had been diagnosed with gender identity disorder. Without undergoing therapy, I knew it was the real me, which might explain my sophomore - year sadness. Once I discovered myself, I understood that life was more than just building a good reputation. I could smile more and appreciate everyone who wanted to be my friend or get to know me. It felt great when people showed interest in me, asking about my preferred name and what being transgender meant. I felt wanted, interesting, secure, and most importantly, happy.  I knew coming out would lead to harassment. I received calls from restricted numbers and hate mail, but I laughed at them all. It was worth it because I knew what I was about, while they knew nothing about transgender issues. Spending time with my dad and friends paid off. After surviving a hot [DATE1], I was excited for school and the sports ahead. I was determined to have a great junior year.  Around my birthday, about a month into the school year, I realized I needed someone to make me laugh and smile constantly. A girl named [PERSON2] on [CAPS2] - book caught my attention. She was cute, and her personality suited her perfectly. She knew how to make me smile so hard that my cheeks would burn. On my birthday at [TIME1], we talked on the phone, and it was the best night in a long time. That weekend, we hung out at [CAPS3] [CAPS4] in [LOCATION1]. Her friend [PERSON1] was singing to [CAPS5] songs, and [PERSON2] mocked her voice, making me laugh so hard my stomach ached. Clearly, having people around to make you laugh is an amazing feeling. You should also be able to laugh at yourself. It's wonderful when you can be your true self and make new friends who accept you.
107	20849	8	2	In a relationship, trust, confiding, communication, sharing tears, and most importantly, sharing laughter are crucial. Many people believe that laughter is an essential part of relationships, and I wholeheartedly agree. The relationship with my best friend and boyfriend, [PERSON2], is filled with laughter. He can always make me laugh, even on my worst days. I am constantly grateful to [CAPS1] for bringing him into my life.  When I got to know [PERSON2] better, I noticed his ability to make me laugh. Whether he made weird faces or tickled me until I couldn't breathe, he always knew how to make me laugh. Even when I was crying, he could make me giggle. For instance, [TIME1] when I had a terrible day at school, he cheered me up within minutes.  In church or with friends, a simple look or a face would set us off laughing. His blue eyes and dorky smile were irresistible. Our shared laughter has been a great part of our relationship from the start.  When we play [CAPS2], we laugh at my poor skills or my rare good kills. “That just works out, don't it!” is one of our inside jokes. We have fun competing to say it the most, and if we say it at the same time, we playfully argue over who wins.  [PERSON2] loves making funny faces in front of the camera, which always makes me laugh. We end up taking many silly pictures and laughing at the weird faces we make. Laughter is contagious between us.  To be truly comfortable with each other, we can laugh at ourselves. Once, when [PERSON2], his little sisters [PERSON3] and [PERSON1], and I were trying to kick high, I kneed myself in the forehead. [PERSON2] noticed and was silent until I started laughing, then he checked on me. Another time, when I pushed him to the ground at his house, his family laughed, and he just laughed it off.  Even when we disagree on things, we can look back and laugh. [PERSON2] and I don't always agree, but we can work things out. We've both made mistakes in the past, and we can laugh about them.  The saying “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people” is true for us. I'm grateful to have [PERSON2] in my life. His ability to laugh and make me laugh is what made me fall for him. Whether it's through text messages, doing weird things, or watching a movie, we're always laughing together. As we say, “We're freaking soul mates!”
108	20850	8	2	Every day spent with my girlfriend is filled with fun and laughter. Even when I'm in a bad mood, she can brighten my day with just a few words. Together, we can turn any situation into a happy one. Laughter is a powerful force. By making someone laugh, you can change their mood, their day, or even their life.  People say that laughter is contagious, and I believe it. Comedians are a perfect example. They can take any situation and make a whole room burst into laughter. One of my favorite jokes is when a comedian said, “[CAPS2] [CAPS3] shivering in the cold, we will bring him silver and gold,” like in a song. Then he added, “[CAPS4] don't they [CAPS1] bring him some blankets, I mean come on, the poor kid is going to die of hypothermia but at least he will be rich when he does.”  I wrote this paper to demonstrate the power of laughter in the world. I believe that everyone should laugh at least once a day to make the world a brighter place. A smile can light up a room, but laughter can transform the world into a happier place. No one should go through life without laughter. A life without laughter is a life not fully lived.
109	20851	8	2	Two years ago, I had a memorable experience involving laughter when I met my friend [CAPS1] at the [ORGANIZATION1]. I was walking out of [ORGANIZATION5]'s [CAPS4], and [CAPS1] was walking in. We bumped into each other. Initially, we were both angry, shouting, “[CAPS3] watch where you're going!” After calming down, we went our separate ways.  I went to the food court, and within ten minutes, [CAPS1] was there too. We both queued in the [ORGANIZATION3] line. We stood beside each other for a while until I apologized for bumping into her earlier. She replied, “[CAPS5] it's [CAPS6], I should have been watching where I was going instead of looking at the floor as I walked.” We laughed a bit until it was our turn to get food.  After paying, I invited her to sit with me since we were both alone as our parents were still shopping. We started chatting about our origins and schools. [CAPS1] attends a private [ORGANIZATION2] [NUM1] in [LOCATION1], [ORGANIZATION6], and I told her I went to [ORGANIZATION2]. We were both freshmen in [ORGANIZATION4] [ORGANIZATION2] and loved band.  We then realized we had met before at a band competition. At least a year ago, we had bumped into each other in a similar way. She was coming out of a room where her band was warming up, and I was on my way to my band's warm - up room two doors down. Just like in the [ORGANIZATION1], we were both looking at the floor and got angry at each other. We laughed about our repeated encounters.  We knew we had changed a lot and would become good friends. Laughter is a significant aspect of friendship. What's the point of having a friend if you can't share laughter and create awesome memories? To this day, I still hang out with [CAPS1], and we're still amazed that we met twice in the same way.
110	20852	8	2	Laughter is a vital part of life, but it can have both positive and negative impacts. Some [MONTH1] say that laughter is essential for a fulfilling life. However, there are times when laughter can cause more harm than good. I've come to this conclusion based on my own experiences.  Laughter can express emotions or a lack thereof. It can make someone happy or depressed. There is a clear difference between someone laughing at you and someone laughing with you. When friends laugh with me, it boosts my self - esteem and strengthens our bond.  One day, during a scorching [DATE1], my friends and I decided to go to the mall because we lived in apartments without air - conditioning. When we entered the mall, the cool breeze was a relief. Since we were introverted, shopping in a crowded mall wasn't appealing, so we sat on a bench and “people - watched.”  There was a girl who exuded an air of wealth. She walked in a way that exaggerated her hips and bounced her bleach - blond hair, looking down on us as if we were beneath her. Angry at her attitude, I mocked her walk after she passed by. My friends found it hilarious and burst into laughter.  The girl stopped and approached us, asking, “[CAPS1] you guys like have a problem or something?” I was speechless, but my best friend came to the rescue, saying, “[CAPS3], we think your dress is very pretty.” The girl believed us and walked away less snobbishly.  Through this experience, my friends and I learned two important lessons. First, people can easily overhear negative comments. Second, while laughter can bring friends closer, it can also have consequences. I'm not sure if the girl heard or saw us mocking her, but I felt bad about it later. Although it seemed amusing at the time, looking back, I regret my actions. Laughter is important, but it should be used appropriately.
111	20853	8	2	"My boyfriend and I spend a great deal of time together. Two days ago, he and I had an argument. His mom had just finished cooking, and he wanted me to taste the food to see if I liked it. Before I ate, I asked him if he'd eat some with me. He said, ""Maybe just a little bit"" and got up to get a fork. I thought he'd eat with me, but he just sat beside me and talked to PERSON2 about the fight we'd just had. I didn't mind that he wasn't eating with me. I continued eating and separated the food by colors to create a face on my plate. It looked really good. He looked over and smirked, asking, ""What's that supposed to be?"" I replied, ""It's a face! See, the carrots are the nose, the shrimp are the eyes, and the greens and noodles form the mouth and hair."" I smiled and asked, ""Wanna take a picture of my face on the plate?"" He said, ""Nope."" I responded with something. Then I mixed up the food and kept eating. When I finished, I got up, put the plate in the sink, returned to the table, and sat down. PERSON3 got up, went outside to get more wood for the fireplace, and started lighting it. I went up and asked if he was mad, and he said yes. I felt sad and apologized. We talked it over, and it turned out he was mad because I didn't let him take a picture of my food. After five minutes, we were happy again. PERSON1 suggested going to CAPS5, and we all agreed. When we got there, we ordered food and waited. At the same time, we all said, ""Let's go to the wrestling mat!"" PERSON1 and PERSON2 stayed to wait for the order, while PERSON3 and I went to play with the little - kid toys. As we tried to get to the wrestling mat, we noticed the little kids staring at us as if they'd never seen older kids play. We continued our rough - and - tumble game of kicking, punching, slapping, and scratching each other. I decided I needed a break, so I sat up and took deep breaths. Then I heard a strange noise. I looked over and asked if he'd farted. He gave me a cheesy smile and, after five seconds, said yes. He kept farting, and the room got really quiet. We looked around and saw that all the little kids had heard him too! There were two little girls at the entrance, a little boy a few feet from PERSON3, and two other kids by the slide. I guess they were shocked. I laughed until I cried and ran out of the playroom to tell PERSON1 and PERSON2 what had happened. They also thought it was hilarious."
112	20856	8	2	"Laughter is a potent tool when utilized effectively. It can inspire in moments of doubt, elevate spirits, and foster great dedication to a person, thing, or cause. So, what has laughter accomplished for you and me? Well, it has done a great deal for me. A prime example is my experience in the ORGANIZATION2. At middle ORGANIZATION3, I had everything going in my favor. I had good grades, excellent teachers, and most importantly, a group of friends with whom I shared numerous laughs. When we graduated and moved on to ORGANIZATION3, my friends either moved away or joined other groups. It was terrible not having anyone to laugh with, making things quite difficult. Then came the LOCATION1 CAPS3 program, or ORGANIZATION1. Since I wasn't really involved in the program, I had no friends, except for Vanecek. An opportunity to join the ORGANIZATION4 arose, and I seized it. Every afternoon for an hour, we had practice, which in turn forged a strong bond among the ORGANIZATION4 members. Before shooting, we would laugh and relax, creating a fun environment for shooting. The ORGANIZATION4 quickly earned the nickname, CAPS4 CAPS1, due to all the laughter heard outside the range. The ORGANIZATION2, of which my battalion was a part, hosts five competitions a year. With fourteen schools from across LOCATION3 and LOCATION2 participating, I got quite nervous. Before our first competition, we had spent enough time together to consider each other family. My family, noticing my nervousness, took me aside the night before the shoot - out. We played cards, talked, and cracked jokes. It was one of the most special times of my life. We shot early the next morning, and I was relaxed, not nervous. Out of twenty - four - man teams, we took third place. Not bad for a new ""family."" Since then, the ORGANIZATION4 has won first place four times in a row. I attribute those victories to the simple human emotion of laughter. Laughter, in a way, has inspired me to commit to a ""family"" and has taken me to new heights. My question for you is, what CAPS4 CAPS1 are you a part of?"
113	20857	8	2	"It was the DATE1 after CAPS15's NUM1 grade year of school. I invited CAPS15's friends, PERSON2, PERSON3, and CAPS15's neighbor, PERSON1, to stay the night at CAPS15's house. When we got bored, we usually went around CAPS15's neighborhood to ""CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3"" some houses for fun. ""CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3"" means quietly sneaking up to someone's front door, ringing the doorbell a couple of times, and then running away. That day, all four of us were hanging out. It was a wonderful DATE1 day, with a beautiful sun, warm temperature, and a gentle breeze to cool our faces. As night fell, we were all in CAPS15's room playing CAPS7 NUM2. ""I'm bored bro,"" PERSON2 said to the rest of us. ""Then, think of something to do,"" CAPS9 replied. ""I can't think of anything,"" PERSON1 said with a bored look. We sat there for a while, trying to come up with something to entertain ourselves. ""I got it!"" I said with a confident smirk. ""Let's go CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3!"" ""I'm down for that,"" PERSON2 said. ""Me too,"" CAPS9 and PERSON1 replied right after PERSON2. As we were walking out of CAPS15's front door, CAPS15's mom shouted, ""Where are you boys going?"" Her question caught me off - guard. I hesitated and replied, ""Uh, we are going on a walk."" ""Be safe,"" CAPS15's mom said as I walked out. We ""CAPS1 CAPS2"" a couple of houses, but it started getting boring. Then, an idea hit me. I said, ""Here's what we'll do. I'll 'CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS28' the first house, PERSON2 will get the next one, PERSON1 will go to the house at the corner, and PERSON3 will run around the corner to get the last house."" ""Do you think that will work?"" PERSON1 asked. ""Yes, it will work!"" I said. ""Are you ready?"" ""I guess so,"" PERSON1 replied after PERSON2 and PERSON3 said yes. We lined up. I rang the first doorbell and started running. I saw PERSON2 slam his fist on the second door. I didn't see PERSON1 ring the doorbell because he was already running ahead. ""Get the last house!"" I shouted at PERSON3. The house PERSON3 was running to didn't have its porch light on. PERSON3 ran fast and tripped over the step in front of the door, hitting his face on the screen door. I could hear the loud smack from the middle of the dark street. He got up quickly and looked at us in confusion, asking, ""Should I ring the doorbell?"" ""Run! I'm sure they heard you smack their screen door with your face!"" When we got back to CAPS15's house, everyone was laughing. That was NUM3 years ago, and I still remember it vividly. So, next time your friends suggest ""CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS28"" a house, think about whether the porch lights are on."
114	20859	8	2	"I woke up on DATE1 at TIME1, thinking it would be an ordinary day. I asked my mom, ""Ma, do you know where my purse is? I need to put my license in my wallet."" I searched around and found it in my room under the dirty clothes. I sighed in relief. I had plans to go to a basketball game after school. It was the biggest game of the season, and we were playing our rivals, the CAPS2 CAPS3. The day seemed to drag on, and I couldn't wait for it to end. Finally, the school bell rang. I drove home feeling a bit disappointed because I wasn't sure if my friends would go to the game with me. If they didn't, I probably wouldn't either. But I was determined. I texted them at five o'clock and convinced them it would be fun. I picked up my friend PERSON1 first, then PERSON2. My ordinary day was about to turn eventful. The ORGANIZATION1, where the game was held, was about twenty minutes away. I had to stop for gas before leaving. We went to the cheapest gas station in town and filled up my car. When it was time to go, my old car refused to start. It often does this; it just sits there until it decides to start. There were some guys in the other lane that we knew, and they were staring at us. We started laughing; it was really embarrassing. The attendant asked if we needed anything else, and I said no, my car just wouldn't start. I tried turning it on again, but it kept stalling. Of all days, it chose today not to start. Then some men came out and said they had to move my car. I was so embarrassed that I started laughing again. I always laugh when I'm nervous. I asked them to let me try one more time. I prayed it would start, and thankfully, it did. I was relieved and embarrassed at the same time and left as quickly as possible. Twenty minutes later, we were in front of the ORGANIZATION1, but there were no parking spots. We drove around for about five minutes until we found one within walking distance. We gathered our things and walked to the game. It hadn't started yet but was about to. I had a feeling it would be a close game. The game began, and as I'd expected, it was back - and - forth. We scored a point, they scored a point. It was really exciting, but there were two parents behind us who were overly involved. They shouted at the players and the referee, which was annoying. In the end, the CAPS2 CAPS3 won by CAPS6 points. It was a bit disappointing, but the ORGANIZATION1 had a good team. After the game, we planned to eat at ORGANIZATION2. We left quickly to avoid traffic. I was driving on a road I thought I knew, but I realized I didn't recognize it at all. PERSON2 told me to keep going as she knew where we were. Fortunately, the road took us straight to downtown by CAPS7. I got on a main road and headed to ORGANIZATION2. The road had a lot of stoplights, and I was stopping every NUM1 minutes. Then a pedestrian crossed the street in front of me, even though he wasn't on a crosswalk. I waited for him. I was driving along, listening to music, when suddenly, I saw rainbow lights behind me. This day just kept getting worse. I pulled over and waited for the CAPS8 to come to my window. He asked for my license and registration. I got my purse and looked in my wallet. I panicked because I couldn't find my license. I'd just put it in my purse a few days ago. I started laughing nervously. I searched everywhere. Finally, he asked if I had my school ID. When I pulled it out, there was my license underneath. He went back to his car, leaving me laughing. He returned and told me my insurance was expired. He gave me a ticket for speeding and expired insurance. I think he gave it to me because I was laughing, and he thought I was taking it as a joke. But I can't control my nerves."
115	20860	8	2	In my opinion, laughter is the key to any happy and successful relationship. It can break the ice in an awkward situation and bring people closer. People often say that laughter is the shortest distance between two people and the best medicine, and I wholeheartedly agree. Throughout my NUM1 years of life, laughter has significantly transformed many social situations. One particular instance that stands out is when I went camping with some friends three years ago in the middle of DATE1. We were sleeping outside under the stars. We had been having a serious conversation about family and friend problems, sharing our hardships. I didn't have much to complain about; I had an average but loving family and good friends. However, that evening, I learned some disturbing things about my friend's home life. She started talking about how her parents didn't care and were both alcoholics. I could tell from her tone how painful it was for her to admit this. The mood shifted from light - hearted to serious and emotional. She continued to say how alone she sometimes felt and how she always wished she could be with us because we had a great time together. After she shared all this, we lay in silence for a while. Neither of us was asleep, and I didn't know what to say. I wondered how anything I could say would make the situation better. While we were in this silence, our other friend ran back to the car to get sodas and use the bathroom. We heard her calling our names and searching for us in the dark. Suddenly, she found
116	20861	8	2	"Laughter has consistently held a crucial position in my life. Sharing laughter with someone forms a special bond. Through laughter, I became friends with a person who is now my best friend. I met this future best - friend through one of my friends. A group of us were hanging out, and my friend, @PERSON1, said, ""You know @PERSON2, you should talk to a good friend of mine."" I didn't oppose the idea as it seemed easy to get along with her based on what @PERSON1 told me. About ten minutes later, I noticed a text from an unknown number on my phone. I asked who it was and waited. Two minutes later, I got a message saying, ""My name is @ORGANIZATION2. I'm the girl the curly - headed kid sitting next to you told you about."" I burst into laughter. I never thought a girl I'd never spoken to would be so brave or sarcastic to say that as a first message. For the next few hours, we exchanged sarcastic remarks and jokes non - stop. @ORGANIZATION2 has the talent to make anyone laugh, regardless of the situation, mood, or activity. We've spent hours walking, often having to stop to catch our breath due to hard laughter. Laughter has helped us through tough times. A few years ago, @ORGANIZATION2's mom passed away, sending her into depression. She rarely felt happy until we talked and started laughing. Recently, I received a @CAPS4.B.I. or @ORGANIZATION1, and I felt numb. Fortunately, @ORGANIZATION2 made me laugh and feel normal again. The ability to laugh with @ORGANIZATION2 has strengthened our friendship. Laughter doesn't just affect a moment or a single person. It creates bonds that are otherwise impossible. I've experienced the power of laughter in our relationship, and it feels wonderful."
117	20862	8	2	"In today's society, laughter is highly cherished. From comical shows to funny friends, people enjoy the joy of laughter. Moreover, laughing is a great workout. When texting, people use ""@CAPS3"" or ""haha"" to show amusement, but it's nothing compared to laughing with friends in person. I was at a camp on the coast with friends. We were about to go to the three crosses. Some girls were asleep, and we had to leave quietly. One girl tripped as we were leaving, almost falling on a sleeping girl. We held back our laughter until the door closed, then doubled over. Jasmine's face when she tripped was unforgettable. We stepped into the crisp air and skipped along. As the hill got steeper, we walked. Jasmine, tired from skipping, almost fell again, making everyone laugh. The walk up the hill took longer than expected. Finally, we saw the three crosses. At the crosses, we waited for the sunrise. We stared at the ocean, but then @CAPS5 pointed out that the sun rises in the east, over the mountains. We laughed because we were so tired we'd forgotten. The sunrise was astonishing, with pinks, purples, yellows, and oranges. After the sunrise, we faced the walk back down. I found a shorter - looking path and convinced the girls to take it. The path was easy at first but got narrow and brushy. One girl lost her shoe in a blackberry bush. @PERSON1 tried to grab it and fell into the bush. It took many tries to pull her out. Everyone laughed throughout. On the way back, we saw animal tracks and realized the path was likely made by animals. Some girls joked about being scared. When we got back to the cabin, we were still laughing. Laughter helped us through the day's challenges. It's clear that laughter is important as it brings happiness and helps us overcome difficulties."
118	20863	8	2	"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" a quote from my best friend @PERSON1. Our friendship is filled with countless moments of laughter. People often say, ""I'm going to die laughing,"" and I truly believe I might because of @PERSON1. She has a knack for making me laugh. It's impossible to count the number of times we've laughed together. Our friendship started on @DATE1, and now we're in our sophomore year of high school. We've been friends for one year, eleven months, and six days, and we're the best of friends. Last year, when learning football cheers, after each cheer, @PERSON1 and I would say, ""@CAPS3 - in @CAPS4."" It became our slogan, used before and after football and basketball games. We had a great time laughing for hours. In @DATE2, on the way to state for cheer, in the car to @LOCATION1, every time we took a corner, we'd say the corner type and do a motion. We also had a ""monkey"" motion. We laughed so hard we cried and needed to pee. It was an amazing car ride. @PERSON1 and I do everything together. We cheer together, have sleepovers. She's my cheer sister and best friend. I'd do anything for her. When @PERSON1 comes to my house, I always make sandwiches and orange juice. One night, we stayed up past midnight, got hungry, and I made them. She loved it, so now it's a tradition. We often laugh about this. Our friendship is based on laughter. @PERSON1 and I will always be best friends. Laughter has made our bond stronger, and I'm grateful for our friendship filled with so many happy memories."
119	20865	8	2	On a day in @DATE1, I was on my way to school with my friend @PERSON1. We lived on the same street, and he lived a few houses away. I wore sneakers with no traction on a snowy day. I slipped a few times on the way to school, and we laughed. At school, the floors were wet from dried snow, and I almost fell there too. I thought about going home to change shoes but had to wait until lunch to avoid getting in trouble. After first period, I found a puddle and slid across it for fun. My friends' shoes had too much traction. The bell rang for second period, and I headed to class. The teacher announced a field trip to the ponds. I wanted to skip but couldn't as the teacher was behind me. On the bus, the teacher called our names every @NUM1 minutes, which was annoying. The bus driver played country music, and I wasn't in the mood. I realized I'd left my iPod at home. At the ponds, the teacher warned us not to get too close. I thought he was joking, but the bus driver said we'd have to dry off if we got wet. We met a tour guide and listened to the pond's history. While walking, I slid and grabbed my friend, and we both fell. Everyone, including us, laughed. On the way back, we talked about what we learned and if we'd return or volunteer. We got back just in time for the last class, @CAPS1. In the gym, we were going to play dodge - ball on the wrestling mats. I was lucky as we had to take off our shoes. After school, @PERSON1 and I walked home. The snow had turned to ice, and I slid all the way. I laughed when I looked at @LOCATION1. It was a fun day, though I fell on the icy deck when I got home.
120	20866	8	2	"I had a day where I just lounged around, played @PERSON2, texted, and laughed at myself. No one bothered me all day, and I didn't have to do chores. At dinner time, someone called me upstairs to eat, but it wasn't pizza. I'd rather eat it than get a lecture about gratitude. My brother came home, ate with us, and then planned to leave. I asked to go with him as I was tired of playing @PERSON2. He refused, but I got my dad to change his mind. He was going to hang out with my childhood friends. These friends are great. We just crack jokes and laugh. It's @DATE1 time, around The @CAPS1 of @DATE2. Fireworks are for sale, and the guys are making ""bombs"" out of them. As a girl, I'm not allowed to participate. My brother likes a girl and wants to impress her by showing the ""masterpieces"" at her house. It made me laugh, and I felt a bit bad for him as they're still just friends. The ""bombs"" were complete duds. We tried multiple times to make them work, but they didn't. My friend @CAPS2 put a bunch of @CAPS3 @CAPS4's into my stuffed animal. It made sparkly colors and loud noises, and we recorded it for a good laugh. After my brother said goodbye to the girl, we headed home. We had many fireworks left. We decided to go to @PERSON3's house. @CAPS2 got out, lit a firework on the porch, jumped in the truck, and we drove off. We did it three times, making the neighbors confused and us laugh more. Then we went to @PERSON1's house. She thought it was rude, and her mom got mad and chased us. She got our license plate number and called the police. The police didn't think it was a big deal. My mom understood we were just having fun and laughed about it. That @CAPS1 of @DATE2 was a great night filled with laughter, a memory I'll cherish."
121	20869	8	2	"One day, I went out for breakfast at @ORGANIZATION2 with my cousin, her husband, my mom, and my dad. They had all grown up together, and reminiscing about the old days made them eager to hang out more often. They always had a great deal of fun together. I spent a lot of time with my cousins as I was growing up, and we often hung out. We started sharing stories about all the crazy times we'd had, and it was lovely to hear about the past. We were laughing uncontrollably. Suddenly, my cousin @PERSON1 let out a fart. We all burst into laughter. @PERSON1 kept farting while laughing uncontrollably. Many people in the restaurant were looking at us. There we were, a group of people laughing, and one of us couldn't stop farting. The laughter and the farting got louder. My mother couldn't stand it anymore. She grabbed a salt shaker and started pounding it on the table to drown out the sound of @PERSON1's farts. @PERSON1 turned bright red. We were laughing so hard that we started crying and were almost on the verge of wetting ourselves. @PERSON1 couldn't hold it any longer. She finally stopped farting, but now she had to pee so badly that she could barely walk. When she got up to go to the bathroom, she had to walk with her legs crossed and very slowly. All the way there, she was still laughing, and so were we. We found it amusing to watch her stop frequently to avoid wetting herself. Once, she stopped right next to two guys' chairs. She stood there, laughing with her legs crossed over the two guys, trying her best not to pee. The guys didn't do much; they just sat there waiting for her to leave. We could tell they were very uncomfortable. I told my mom, ""I'd be uncomfortable too if some random girl was bent over me, laughing and trying not to pee. I'm surprised they didn't move. I would have."" Finally, @PERSON1 reached the bathroom. The two guys had left, and when she came out, she was glad to see them gone. When we saw her, we couldn't help but laugh. She laughed with us, so we didn't feel bad about it. People were still looking at us, and @PERSON1 was still blushing. She wanted to leave, so we did and talked about it all the way home. They were coming over to our house to play board games. When we got home, my brother joined us in a game of gestures, which is similar to charades. We formed teams. I was on @ORGANIZATION1 and my brother's team. My brother went first. He started melting to the ground. I shouted out, ""Wicked Witch of the West!"" He frowned at me and said, ""@CAPS1, watch before you shout things out."" So, I sat there and watched. He did the melting thing again, but when he reached the floor, he started rolling and jerking around. I was very confused. My cousin shouted out, ""Poop!"" My brother yelled, ""@CAPS3, why would anyone want to be poop?"" We all started laughing, and he told us what he was. He was a waterfall. It was my turn. I got ""horse."" I didn't want to be a horse, and I didn't know how to act like one without making a sound. I went up there and started hopping around like a fool. I felt so stupid. My teammates made me feel worse because they couldn't guess what I was. The buzzer rang, and we lost the game by two points. My brother hates to lose. He got really angry and ran up the stairs. On his way up, he tripped and fell down the stairs. We all started laughing, which made him even madder. He went up the stairs again without falling and stayed in his room for the rest of the day. The rest of us stayed downstairs and played more games. It was a really fun day. I got to hang out with my family and have a great laugh. Spending time with family is something everyone should enjoy. It just makes you feel good."
122	20870	8	2	"Laughter is crucial, and we're all aware of that. It makes life more manageable, happier, and can even contribute to a longer life. It's also highly significant in relationships. When people talk about their preferences in a significant other, they often mention wanting someone who can make them laugh, and this is the reason. This story, however, isn't about dating. It's about how laughter can transform your feelings from hating someone to becoming their best friend. I'd known @PERSON1 for a few months at that point. I'd met him on the bus. He was pale, skinny, and loud, and he always had something funny yet offensive to say. He was somewhat of a recluse. Before I met @PERSON1, I could dish out jokes but couldn't take them well. I remember one day, the day my feelings towards him changed from hatred to friendship. We were arguing about something so trivial that I can't recall what it was. But I do remember what he said. He said I was a ""hypocritical, arrogant asshole who would go around making fun of others but would get angry if someone did the same to me."" This made me laugh. Not because everything he said was true, but because it made me realize that @PERSON1 was actually a decent guy, and his only real flaw was that he didn't know when to stop talking. Throughout the time I've known @PERSON1, he's never stopped smiling. He can laugh off anything, from stepping in dog poop to his father's drug addiction. He can use laughter to ease the pain of any hardship. @PERSON1 is a constant reminder for me to never stop laughing."
123	20871	8	2	Laughter is beneficial for everyone. It helps the body become more alert. In fact, believe it or not, laughter is a form of exercise for the body. When people are highly stressed, laughter can cleanse the body. It's like a remedy for the body. Moreover, laughter is not only good for oneself but also has a positive impact on others. When others see someone laughing, it can inspire them to do the same. In conclusion, laughter is a powerful and positive force that can bring about physical and emotional well - being for both individuals and those around them.
124	20872	8	2	"Laughter is a powerful force. We've all been in situations where we didn't want to help a nagging parent. I was that kid. My dad had been in a severe motorcycle accident. I'd been taking care of him during his hospital stay, waiting on him hand and foot. He'd undergone several surgeries and was on a lot of medications. I noticed that he wasn't his usual self on these pills. His changed behavior was taking a toll on the family. During this stressful time, we were also worried about my step - mother. She was pregnant with her second child. There was also the stress of my father's business being the main source of income, and him being unable to work. My father felt helpless as his leg was too weak for him to do anything. He would micromanage everything and tell me I was doing things wrong, which was causing a lot of tension at home. One day, Isabelle (my little sister) and I were left alone with my dad for the first time. I was going to the kitchen to get scissors for an art project in my room. My father asked me to make him some oatmeal. With my hands full, I said, ""@CAPS5, but I will when I'm done."" My father took this as disrespect and hobbled over to me on his crutches, yelling. Instead of arguing, I went to my room. The anger in his voice was unbearable. I turned around, told him to stop yelling, and went back to my room. That's when he hooked the end of a kids' chair and flung it down the hallway. It bounced off the walls, breaking an outlet shell, making a hole in the wall, and hitting my knee. I was too scared to say anything. I slammed the door, and luckily, I had the phone. I called my grandmother and left a voicemail asking her to pick me up and take me to her house. She arrived about an hour later, not knowing about the voicemail. I explained what had happened, and she comforted my sister and me, saying it would be okay. My grandmother sat us all in the living room to resolve the situation. By then, my dad had calmed down and apologized to us. He used popcorn and candy to try to make us forgive him, and then he started making jokes. Every time there's a fight, my dad always cracks a few jokes to lighten the mood. This time, after telling the jokes, he apologized again and explained why he was sorry. I appreciated that, and it made the rest of the day pleasant. As the saying goes, ""@CAPS7 made laughter to be a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 medicine, @NUM1 minutes of laughter is equal to two hours of @CAPS2 @CAPS3."" A service on @DATE1 talked about this. Laughter can truly heal a broken heart. The stress my sister and I went through that day was all gone after the laughter my father brought. He also said, ""Laughter can save us."" After this day, I believe that with a bit of humor, my father and I's relationship can overcome any difficulty. I won't let one mistake ruin our long - term bond. Laughter will always hold a special place in our hearts."
125	20874	8	2	"Laughter plays a vital role in relationships. It supports enjoyment and can be a pursuit of happiness. Whenever I laugh, it's either because I'm really enjoying myself or having a great time. Many people don't have a good sense of humor and don't laugh at funny things. When I watch a funny movie I like, I sit down and wait for the really funny parts. But don't get me wrong, don't laugh too hard because you might accidentally wet your pants. Or, if you laugh hard enough, you might pull a ""whotammy,"" and trust me, that doesn't look good and will make you embarrassed in front of everyone. My favorite comedian is Adam Sandler. He's very funny and has a great sense of humor. He knows how to keep people laughing and interested in his comedy shows and movies. When he made the movie ""Big Daddy,"" it was pretty good, not extremely funny but still decent. My second - favorite comedian is @PERSON1. He's a bit funnier than Adam Sandler, though not quite as good overall. He stars in a TV show called ""Wild 'n Out."" That show makes me almost cough out my lungs, especially when they start with ""your mama"" jokes. It keeps you laughing and gets your blood pumping. We all generally understand what laughter is, but most people don't seem to laugh at things that are funny. I can't quite understand this, but my guess is that they don't have a good sense of humor. On the other hand, some people laugh at things that don't even make sense, and I don't understand that either. But I guess it's better to laugh than not to laugh at all. Some really good comedy movies that will keep you engaged and laughing for more than half of the movie are ""Grandma's Boy,"" ""Happy Gilmore,"" ""Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Sipping My Juice,"" and ""Zombieland."" ""Zombieland"" is an excellent movie. It's not just about making a movie to make the audience laugh; it's about how the movie is made, how the actors act, and how good the background story is. That's what I pay attention to when I try to figure out what makes a movie funny. If I don't understand a funny movie, I watch it again and again until I get what's so hilarious about it. In conclusion, this covers the basics of laughter. It's important to understand it, enjoy it, and use it wisely. Remember, don't laugh too hard to avoid embarrassing situations. Thank you for reading."
126	20876	8	2	Laughter serves as a cure for ailments and a balm for pain. It has the power to mend friendships, transforming strangers into the closest of friends. If one were to ask anyone on the street about the importance of laughter in life, they would likely affirm its great significance. Laughter is akin to love; everyone needs a touch of it to grow and mature. It can be wielded in various aspects of life, such as landing a job, winning the affection of a girl, or simply enjoying oneself and making new friends. It is one of the fundamental elements that shape a person and their actions.  On @DATE1, my cousin @PERSON1 introduced me to a girl named @DATE3. When she started talking to me, I was shy as I wasn't accustomed to conversing with girls. I cracked a joke, and we both burst into laughter. This was the first step in forging a new friendship. As days passed, we exchanged text messages daily, joking about our days and teasing each other. Eventually, we began talking on the phone. Nowadays, teens often rely on text messages, which can make it difficult to discern emotions. @DATE3 and I would talk until late @TIME1, sometimes falling asleep with the phone on. Making each other laugh was our primary connection since she attended a different school. I aimed to make her happy, and one way to achieve this was by making her laugh or being a charming young gentleman, as I was raised with such values.  As the @DATE2 formal approached, I needed a date. @DATE3 was the obvious choice as I was growing closer to her and developing feelings. When the opportunity arose, I asked her to be my date for the @DATE2 formal, which would be one of the most memorable nights of my freshman year. On the night of the formal, we danced the @TIME1 away. Of course, I cracked a few jokes that made everyone laugh and have a great time. Near the end of the dance, I asked her to be my girlfriend, and she accepted. She complimented me on being funny, nice, and cute. Our shared sense of humor and fun made the @TIME1 truly special.  At the next @DATE2 formal, a similar scenario unfolded with a different girl. Laughter remained a crucial factor, making the @TIME1 incredibly enjoyable. That @TIME1 was one of the best nights of my life, filled with laughter and pure joy. Laughter is an indispensable part of my life. Without it, I wouldn't have won the girl or experienced such wonderful moments. It enhances every situation, and I incorporate it into my daily life. Everyone benefits from a good laugh, especially when in a bad mood. Without laughter, my life would be dull and lack the color that defines me. It is one of the keys to happiness that everyone should embrace. A child who grows up without laughter or other essential elements may turn out to be a mean and unkind person, lacking an understanding of good values and humor. Everyone needs personality and color in life; otherwise, everything becomes gray. Life is like a coloring book, and without something to bring it to life, it is meaningless.
127	20877	8	2	"I've had numerous wonderful times with my grandpa. He's a hilarious and affectionate man. A few years ago, he took my cousin and me on a two - day camping trip along the @ORGANIZATION1. The first campground we reached had no available sites, so we moved on to the next one. @CAPS1 campground had plenty of open spots, so we chose the best one we could find and stayed there for the first @TIME1.  Later that evening, we discovered why the campground was empty. There had been a raccoon problem a few days prior, and people were afraid of being attacked or having their food stolen. Fortunately, we never saw the raccoons and didn't lose any of our food. The next @TIME2, as we were leaving, we saw a sign that read ""caution raccoon problem."" @CAPS1's comments made us laugh all the way to @LOCATION1, a small town on the @ORGANIZATION1.  Once in @LOCATION1, we stopped for gas and more food to last through the @TIME1. At the gas station, we encountered a rather comical situation. A young blond woman came to assist us, but she wasn't the most intelligent person we'd met. She charged us three times the amount of gasoline we purchased and couldn't tell us where the nearest grocery store was. As my grandpa rolled up his window, he loudly muttered ""dumb blonde"" while the woman was standing right there. She didn't say a word, and we drove off, laughing so hard we could barely breathe. My grandpa was oblivious to the situation and asked us why we were laughing so hard. When we explained, he was unaware of what he had said at the time.  The next @TIME1, we stayed at a different campground without any raccoon issues. The @TIME1 was still filled with laughter. After dinner, we were roasting marshmallows over the fire. For some reason, my grandpa couldn't keep the marshmallows on his stick. He wasted about six marshmallows before getting one he could eat. Every time he dropped a marshmallow into the fire, it got funnier. We laughed until our stomachs hurt, and my grandpa just looked at us as if we were crazy.  That @TIME1 in the tent, we were so tired that everything seemed funny. We laughed at each other until two in the @TIME2 and then fell asleep. My cousin and I have been camping with my grandpa for about four years now. Each year is an adventure filled with laughter, and our bond grows stronger. My grandpa is an amazing man, and I look up to him in many ways. He always makes me laugh, and I try to do the same for him. We believe that laughing together is important as it keeps us smiling and brings us closer. So, keep laughing and have fun in everything you do."
128	20878	8	2	"I firmly believe that ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" When things get tense with a loved one, making them laugh can break the ice. For instance, when I get angry with my boyfriend, he knows the key to making me happy is to make me smile or laugh, and he always manages to do so.  It was @DATE1 @CAPS1, and we had just started dating. He asked me if I was hungry, and I said no. But he kept asking, about being hungry, thirsty, bored, or tired. He didn't know that I'm easily annoyed and have a short temper. An hour and a half passed, and he was still at it! I was going crazy, but I didn't want to tell him how I felt because I didn't want to hurt his feelings. However, I thought it was better for him to know my likes and dislikes early on rather than finding out later.  So, I told him everything about myself, both good and bad. At first, he just listened, but then he exploded, saying I should have been more straightforward from the start. This really upset me because I was trying to be honest to avoid bigger problems. I stayed quiet for a long time, and he kept asking what was wrong. I told him it upset me that he flipped out for no good reason when all I was doing was trying to save us from a larger argument. He said I was wrong because it took me two months to show my true self. I kind of understood his point, but I also disagreed because, in my opinion, it doesn't take that long to get to know someone, especially your girlfriend.  In the end, we agreed to be ourselves around each other. Then, he suddenly said ""ouch charlie you bit me"" in a @CAPS2 accent. I couldn't stop laughing for days and completely forgot about our intense discussion.  Laughter is not only useful with loved ones but also with strangers. If someone is shy, making them laugh can help build a great friendship. A simple smile, ""hello,"" or ""hey"" can brighten someone's day. I believe that people who smile often live longer.  In conclusion, laughter is a powerful tool for breaking the ice when things get tough. It can turn a difficult situation around and make any day better. Without laughter, relationships might not survive the rough patches. As I said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."
129	20879	8	2	A year ago, around @DATE2, I was at my best friend @PERSON1's house for a sleepover after her @CAPS3 party. We were exhausted from swimming in her @CAPS4's pool, walking her dog, and partying. But we couldn't sleep right away because we'd eaten a family - sized bag of @CAPS5 and drunk a six - pack of @ORGANIZATION1 not long before.  At around three in the @TIME1, in our childish curiosity, we decided to paint the tips of our tongues blue with nail polish, hoping they would glow in the dark under the black light on her windowsill. I was the first to touch my tongue to the brush, and it really hurt! The acid and alcohol in the polish stung my taste buds.  The next day was @DATE1. After spending the afternoon at @LOCATION1's house, we came to my house for another sleepover, which is our usual routine when we're together. That night, around two in the @TIME1, we got hungry again. We went downstairs to get a snack and then went back to my room. @PERSON1 played on my computer while I used her phone to text my former crush.  @PERSON1 brought jars of ice water. I still don't understand why she uses jars instead of cups. She interrupted my spinning around the kitchen floor in my new socks, and we had a random ice - chugging contest. After ten seconds of silence, I looked at @LOCATION1, who was barely halfway through her water. There was a speck of blue nail polish on her chin. I tried to gasp to start laughing, but an ice cube went into my windpipe instead. We were choking, laughing, and falling on the floor. @PERSON1 dropped her jar, and it shattered, sending glass and water across the kitchen. But we were having so much fun that it didn't matter. We fell asleep on the kitchen floor within ten minutes. We were more tired than we thought, but we did clean up the glass.  Some people say laughter is the best medicine. Dentists use laughing gas during dental operations, which makes patients feel less pain. Today, @PERSON1 and I are still best friends. We do have fights, but they usually end quickly. The longest fight we had lasted a month and a half, and it was due to a misunderstood rumor. We resolved it by laughing at how silly the whole thing was.  Over the five or six years of our friendship, we've realized that laughter is healthy, both physically and emotionally, as it relieves stress. So, every time we see each other, we laugh as much as possible. Whether it's an inside joke, a funny - looking person on the street, or just a random thought, it always triggers laughter. Sometimes it even hurts, but we can't stop because it's so much fun.
130	20881	8	2	"One late rainy night, my friends and I decided it would be fun to play @NUM1 - go - seek in the woods. One of my friend's sisters drove us there. The game plan was that since there were four of us, two would go hide, and two would stay in the car and count until the others were ready to be found.  The two who went to hide were @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, and the two who stayed in the car to count were me, my friend @PERSON3, and I. Before @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 went to hide, we came up with a signal to indicate if we were okay. The danger signal was @CAPS1 @CAPS1.  After our discussion and getting everything sorted, @PERSON1 got out of the car and went to hide while @PERSON3 and I stayed in the car to count. After counting to about @NUM2, we heard screaming and shouting. I thought they were just trying to scare us. Curious, I cracked the car door open to hear better. Sure enough, @PERSON1 came running, followed by @PERSON2. @PERSON2 looked like she was about to cry and was having trouble running on the muddy road. She kept slipping but finally made it back to the car, and they both crammed in with us.  We were all wondering what they were running from. I, being the brave one at the moment, decided to go and check. @PERSON2 didn't want to seem like wimps, so they followed me. As I was walking down the road, @LOCATION1 jumped out and said she saw something dart across the road. I walked over to where she pointed, thinking she was just imagining things. But then @PERSON2 grabbed me from behind and screamed. I turned around, annoyed. She looked really frightened and pointed at a tree, asking why it had a big tan spot in the middle.  It was dark, and I couldn't see well, so I went back to the car to get a flashlight. As soon as I got back to the tree, @ORGANIZATION1 let out a blood - curdling scream, saying whatever it was on the tree was moving. @PERSON2 grabbed the flashlight from me and pointed it at the tree. There was indeed a big tan spot on the white tree.  As we waited for it to move again, it finally did. I shone the flashlight on it and started laughing. When @PERSON2 realized I was laughing, they wanted to hit me because they didn't know what was in the tree. I asked @PERSON1 if she wanted to see her ""monster."" She freaked out again. I told her to look for herself, and she saw a large brown paper bag that the wind had blown up.  As soon as I told them what it was,"
131	20882	8	2	"Laughter, in my view, is the driving force that keeps the world vibrant and filled with happiness. It's an essential element that lightens the atmosphere and spreads joy. You'll rarely find me without a broad smile on my face. There are numerous stories to share, but the one from @TIME1 stands out as the most enjoyable to recount. Just thinking about it still makes me chuckle.  I was on a trip to @LOCATION1 with my former boyfriend, @PERSON1, for the Fourth of @DATE1. They host a large Fourth of @DATE1 event, and I was fortunate to accompany him and his mom. We stayed at the home of his mom's good friends, @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. Their house was incredibly beautiful, featuring lovely wooden floors, a spacious open - plan living area that combined the kitchen and dining room, high - vaulted ceilings, and a magnificent window framing the crisp @CAPS3 @CAPS4. However, my favorite part was the railroad tracks. A short quarter - mile walk through a wooded trail led to two sets of tracks that stretched as far as the eye could see in both directions.  It was the second @TIME1 of our stay in @LOCATION1, around @NUM1 o'clock. @PERSON1 and I went for a walk in the refreshing @TIME1. Visibility was poor, and we held onto each other tightly to maintain balance. Smiling and giggling, we finally emerged from the well - hidden trail onto the tracks. Hand in hand, we strolled along, simply enjoying each other's company.  In @CAPS4, the stars were the most spectacular I've ever seen. For some reason, the sky seemed to expand, looking twice as large as it really was. The @TIME1 was perfect for stargazing, with not a single cloud in sight. So, we decided to lie down between the tracks and gaze at the stars. We cuddled for about @NUM2 minutes. Then @PERSON1 looked up. I gave him a puzzled look and followed his gaze. In the distance, a light was slowly approaching. Sure enough, it was a train at @NUM1 o'clock on @TIME1. We looked at each other and burst into laughter at the unexpected appearance of the train. As the train got closer, we jumped off the tracks to let it pass so we could resume our spot.  The train was moving much slower than I'd anticipated, no more than @NUM4 to @NUM5 miles per hour. @PERSON1 had an idea and blurted out, ""We should jump it!"" Immediately after saying it, he regretted his words. I thought it was a great idea, though. He tried hard to persuade me not to do it, but I walked towards the track, telling him to be adventurous and have some fun. I'd never jumped a train before, but this one seemed ideal. There were long, flat - bed cars with convenient ladders on each. I grabbed a ladder and jumped on just before @PERSON1 could stop me. He eventually gave in and jumped on the next car. We were both smiling and having a great time when we jumped off and hugged.  Then the train stopped. We froze. A light started coming our way. Panicking, fearing we'd get in trouble, I sprinted towards the trailhead, with @PERSON1 close behind. Unable to find the trail and with the light getting closer, we dove into a thick bush. We stayed perfectly still until the light passed and the train picked up speed again. When I saw @PERSON1's big smile, we couldn't help but roll over laughing. The odds of such an event happening during a simple walk were astonishing. @PERSON1 leaned over and gave me a perfect kiss. That was one of the best nights of my life. This incident is a prime example of how smiling and laughter played a significant role in @PERSON1's and my relationship. Love, friends, and laughter make life worth living."
132	20883	8	2	"Laughter is one of the most wonderful feelings in the world, and sharing it with family is truly priceless. Family moments like these are memories that no one can take away, and they bring a smile to our faces when we look back on them. Without laughter, the world would be a dull and depressing place. It serves as a strong bond between family and friends.  During the @DATE1 break, my family and I decided to drive to @LOCATION1. None of us knew the way, but my mom assured us she'd figure it out. After school, she packed us up, and we set off. After a two - hour drive, we reached the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. There was a large crowd waiting to cross. On the boat, I went upstairs to see our location, and there it was, @LOCATION2.  After getting off the boat and navigating through the busy highways of @LOCATION2, we started crossing the @LOCATION2/@CAPS4 border. I noticed my mother had a worried look on her face. My sister asked if she knew what she was doing, and she replied, ""kinda"". After hours of driving, my mom thought it best to buy a map. On the map, we spotted a nearby town. When we arrived, my mom said we'd stay there for the night.  The next morning, my mom realized that the town we were in was the one we were supposed to reach. After driving around looking for our hotel, we finally got to our room and rested. My sister made a comment about how funny it was to watch my mom drive around pretending to know where she was going. This made us all laugh, and we started joking about her ""great"" navigation skills.  For the rest of the trip, we drove around, laughing and teasing my mom not to get lost and to ask for directions if needed. Turning the mishap of getting lost into a laughing matter made this trip an unforgettable experience.  Laughter is indeed the greatest feeling in the world, especially when shared with family. It can turn a negative situation into a wonderful vacation. Everyone should laugh in life because we only live once, and we should make it worthwhile."
133	20884	8	2	Laughter has a unique way of bringing people together, creating a special bond that is difficult to describe. When two people share a laugh, it can lay the foundation for a strong relationship. It's a connection that everyone on this @LOCATION2 should experience.  Last @DATE2, I joined a select lacrosse team and didn't know any of the girls. After three practices, I still hadn't made many friends because I was too shy. At the fourth practice, while stretching in a circle, I made a comment to one of the girls, and she laughed. We started talking and became friends by the end of that practice. Making her laugh helped me make a friend on the team, and I was even more excited for the upcoming tournament.  The final practice was cut short so we could make tie - dye t - shirts for the tournament. I sat with @PERSON2, the friend I'd made at the previous practice, and her friend @PERSON1 joined us on the concrete. We talked and laughed as we prepared to dye our shirts. We had a great time, making a mess of the colors on a warm night. After finishing our shirts and putting them in plastic bags, we said goodbye in the parking lot. I now had two friends on the team and was eager for the tournament on @DATE1.  On a @DATE1 @TIME1, I woke up at @NUM1 am to meet the team at a park in @LOCATION1, OR. We loaded our things into three large white vans and set off. I got into the van wearing my tie - dye shirt and saw some tired - looking girls also in their tie - dyed shirts. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were in the back with another girl between them, so I sat in the row in front. More girls squeezed into the van, and we started our journey.  During the @NUM2 @NUM3 - hour car ride, we slept, laughed, and told stories. Despite coming from different cities, schools, and backgrounds, we bonded through laughter and storytelling.  At the tournament, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and I stuck together. We walked around the fields, ate meals, and laughed almost the whole time. The only time we were apart was when roommates were assigned. We all worked as a team towards the goal of winning games and reaching the championship.  Most of the girls on the team bonded in some way, and even now, many of us still keep in touch. Laughter brought @PERSON2 and me together, and it united the whole team. Connecting with others through laughter is a unique and powerful experience that can create friendships that last a lifetime. It makes the world a better, brighter, and more united place.
134	20885	8	2	"Humor is an integral part of my personality, and I love making people laugh. However, this story is about an event that made my entire family laugh uncontrollably.  It all began on a @DATE1 when my cousin received a trampoline for his birthday. It was a great day for him and for us kids too, as we could play on it whenever we wanted. After that, we were often at my cousin's house. We had competitions to see who could jump the highest or perform the coolest trick. Sometimes, when someone got hurt, my aunt and uncle would restrict our access to the trampoline, but they'd always give in and let us play again.  A few months later, we witnessed the funniest accident of our lives. It was my aunt's birthday party. Usually, she held it at a fancy restaurant, but this year, to save money, she decided to have it at home. My mom, my brothers, and I attended the party. First, we did the typical birthday things like greeting family members, eating, and singing ""Happy Birthday."" In my opinion, it was all rather boring. There was a trampoline in the backyard, just waiting to be used, but the adults wouldn't let us near it until we'd finished eating.  Finally, after everyone had eaten, we were allowed to play on the trampoline. It started like any other normal day, but little did we know that in a few hours, our stomachs would ache from laughing at what was about to happen."
135	20887	8	2	"It was an ordinary day. My friend @PERSON2 called me and asked if I wanted to hang out. I said yes, took a shower, and got ready. Once I was done, I called him back and asked where he wanted to go. He said he wanted me to go to Kyle's house and play basketball.  When I arrived, everyone was there, so we decided to have a big basketball game. I was on the better team and was confident we'd win. However, I missed every single shot I took, which was really embarrassing. But as expected, our team won.  After the game, we were all tired and went inside to play video games. We played @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM1. I took turns, but I didn't play well because I'm not into video games. Everyone, including myself, laughed at my poor performance.  Right after we finished playing, I got an invitation from a group of girls who were going to the movies that night and wanted to know if we'd join them. We all decided to go and were excited to see ""Paranormal Activity @NUM1."" Before the movie, we went to @PERSON1's house and hung out with the girls. Most of the girls were upstairs getting ready while we sat in the living room listening to music. I was bored, so I went upstairs. Big mistake! As soon as I got there, the girls wanted to straighten my hair or put makeup on me. I went back downstairs and warned everyone not to go up. When I told them why, they laughed, and some of them went up anyway and came back with makeup on. I laughed so hard that I fell off the couch.  Once I stopped laughing, it was time to go. @PERSON1's mom drove us to the theater. There weren't enough seats in the car, so the girls and I squeezed into the front, and the guys sat in the back. I was okay with that.  At the movie theater, there was a long line, but it was worth it. Surprisingly, the movie was actually quite scary; it made me jump about five times.  On the way home, it was around @NUM3. @PERSON3 and I walked home from @PERSON1's house. @PERSON3 was really freaked out, and it made me laugh. I was a bit scared too, which made him laugh. I think it was a really fun day because I laughed throughout most of it."
136	20888	8	2	I firmly believe that hilarity and giddiness represent the most favorable emotional states. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that individuals who share a sense of humor would establish positive relationships. Their shared mindset connects them, and they find joy in each other's company. My personal experience serves as an illustration of the power of laughter to forge connections between people and strengthen the bonds it creates.  Picture this scenario: It was [DATE2] on the north side of [CAPS2], beneath the well - known snow dome. There stood a frail eleven - year - old boy who felt he couldn't proceed any further. Beside him, patiently, was his father, an experienced climber who had scaled mountains in [LOCATION1] and [LOCATION2].  The boy was exhausted. He could barely put one foot in front of the other. His muscles protested loudly, and the blisters on his heels throbbed in unison. The sun on [DATE1] beat down on him, and the snow gave way, causing him to fall. It seemed as if the mountain was determined to make him fail and was goading him to give up and cry in defeat. Fatigue overwhelmed the boy, making each of his limbs feel as if fifty pounds had been added. His mind grew dull, and he could only think of simple tasks like putting one foot in front of the other. He constantly found excuses to stop.  The boy's father tried every possible method to motivate his son to keep going, but to no avail. Then, he changed tactics and began telling the boy stories, perhaps hoping to distract him from the excruciating pain. To everyone's relief, this approach proved effective. What was truly remarkable was that it wasn't the content of the stories but the humorous and sarcastic tone that made the real difference.  A feeling akin to a combination of laughing gas and an energy drink washed over me. In the presence of my father's humor, I found the strength to continue. It was as if I had been completely recharged and refreshed. My arms and legs, which had previously felt like solid lead pipes, lightened significantly. The stabbing pain in my muscles and joints faded away, and the dull throbbing of the blisters on my heels ceased. All of this was due to someone's thoughts and ideas tickling my funny bone.  I believe laughter to be nature's anesthetic, the emotional element that keeps the world sane. It was at that moment that I realized what I respected most about my father. He had many admirable traits, such as an indomitable work ethic, being a great teacher, and possessing an extraordinary amount of energy. However, what I respected most was our shared sense of humor. We laughed at the same things and found amusement in each other's comments. This shared humor forged a strong bond between us, a bond of euphoria and glee that endures to this day. Whenever I am sad, he always manages to make me smile, and I have the same ability. In my opinion, a relationship built on laughter is the strongest of all. Laughter is a force that paves the way for friendship, respect, and love. Without laughter, there can be no hope for a better future. It is a divine gift that courses through the bloodstream of society, freeing minds from the stress and worries of tomorrow. Laughter can unite a community and foster a sense of friendship. Have you ever laughed at something and then noticed that someone across the room was laughing at the same time? Your eyes meet, and a slow smile spreads across both your faces as you realize that you are not alone in your thoughts and sense of humor. This connective force is the result of the power of laughter.
137	20889	8	2	"Laughing, smirking, giggling, and chuckling all revolve around one central theme: laughter. Laughter is ubiquitous; you can hear it in libraries, parks, at home, or even behind your back. It can be either a wonderful or a terrible thing, whether in [ORGANIZATION1], with family, or among friends. Everyone has a history with laughter that has welcomed them, offered assistance, lifted their spirits, or even helped them make a lifelong friend.  It was the start of a new [ORGANIZATION1]. I had just moved from [LOCATION2]. As a seventh - grader about to start at [ORGANIZATION1] in [LOCATION1], I wasn't very fond of socializing, so I mostly kept to myself. I ate lunch in the guidance center and tried to find my way around the school without talking to anyone. My schedule was great; it included choir, art, and drama, all subjects I enjoyed. Art and drama were a lot of fun, but when it came to choir and singing, my social interaction decreased. I loved to sing but never did so in front of others.  One day, while walking to choir, I tripped and fell, and my papers scattered everywhere. My schoolwork was strewn across the hallway, with math at one end and science at the other. Out of all the kids in the hallway, only one laughed. She walked by and said I did a great job, but something made her come back. She helped me pick up my math homework and my schedule and noticed that we both had choir that period. Her name was [PERSON1]. We introduced ourselves and walked together.  We sat next to each other in choir and sang in harmony. We talked during breaks, at lunch, and on the bus ride home. We became great friends, and even the principal thought so; he arranged for us to have classes together. We remained friends, and we still are to this day. Unfortunately, she moved near the end of eighth grade. However, she was my only close friend for a while, and I still call her from time to time. Sometimes we can talk for hours, laughing and catching up on each other's lives and discussing when we'll see each other again.  Our friendship all started with a simple slip, the scattering of papers, and a single laugh from an amazing person. Laughter has had a profound impact on my life at [ORGANIZATION1]. Whenever I see someone alone and in need of a friend, I approach them and even laugh with them. A single laugh can spark a great friendship, even if you don't initially think so. As the saying goes, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" and I believe it because it happened to me."
138	20892	8	2	"Laughter has the power to transform a person's thoughts and mood. It can turn a bad start to a day around or strengthen the bond between two individuals. I love to laugh as it reflects my emotions and keeps me happy. I laugh not only when I'm sad but also when I'm in a great mood.  Growing up in a world filled with tragedies and war, I believe one should always stay positive and keep smiling. When life presents challenges, we should make the best of the situation and find humor in it. I think laughter is one of the most effective remedies and can alleviate most problems when we're feeling down.  My older sister has blessed the world with the most wonderful little nieces. When they were babies, I used to make funny faces, dance to [PERSON1]'s music, and watch movies with them. However, it was my desire to laugh that brought us closer and made them happy.  One day, I was feeling extremely low, but I didn't want it to affect me. So, I continued with my day and started watching music videos. When ""[CAPS1] [CAPS2] [CAPS3]"" by [ORGANIZATION1] came on, my nieces went wild. They jumped on the bed, twirled around, and acted as if they were [ORGANIZATION1] themselves. They really stole the show. I was amazed by their enthusiasm and burst out laughing with joy. I was so caught up in their happiness that I got up and danced with them. We jumped, twirled, and whipped our [CAPS3] until the song ended, leaving us dizzy and out of breath.  After the music video, they kept dancing. I wondered if they would ever get tired, but I was certain that their laughter was a source of endless amazement for them. A smile can convey so much, and laughter is truly priceless. My nieces really lifted my spirits that day. It was a bittersweet experience, starting off bad but ending on a high note.  I think my nieces sensed my sadness and would ask, ""[CAPS5], what's wrong?"" ([CAPS5] being my nickname because I'm short). They always found a way to make me smile and have a good time. Our relationship has grown stronger, and I know that whenever I'm with them, I'll laugh. As the saying goes, ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" and I believe it because my experiences with my nieces have proven it."
139	20893	8	2	"Laughter plays a significant role in revealing one's true self. Some people may seem ""stuck - up,"" but in the end, everyone can laugh together regardless of their personalities. When something funny happens, it's almost impossible not to laugh. Even when people are nervous, they often use laughter as a coping mechanism. Different individuals have unique ways of incorporating laughter into their lives.  Take the so - called love poem, ""Roses are blue, roses are red, you're always in my head, I want you in my bed."" When in a relationship, one might think they're in love. However, if a partner is never open, the relationship may not be very fulfilling. A healthy relationship should involve the ability to argue one moment and then laugh off the disagreement the next, realizing that the argument was silly. Love and laughter are both essential components of a relationship.  Friendship is also a great arena for laughter. For example, my friend [PERSON1] and I were invited to a birthday party. There were lots of fun games and plenty of food. As the night wore on and it got late, around [NUM1] in the [TIME1], we were tired. We love to sleep, but we were having such a great time at our friend's house that we didn't want the night to end.  We spent about four hours earlier sitting and lying on the ground and the bed, watching ""[CAPS2] A"". Then, out of the blue, I started laughing at [LOCATION1], and to this day, I don't know why. Suddenly, she started laughing even harder at me, and this made me laugh even more. I was on the verge of being unable to breathe. I had to go to the bathroom, but I could still hear her laughter, which kept making me laugh.  Since that night, [PERSON1] and I have become much closer friends. Laughter is an important part of life. Sometimes it can make you feel like you're dying from laughing so hard, but that feeling is definitely worth it."
140	20894	8	2	"As we all know, water is essential for survival, and similarly, laughter plays a crucial role in our lives. I once heard my night - school teacher say, ""[CAPS1] is [PERCENT1] attitude,"" and after some thought, I realized the truth in this statement. Just as no one can go through a whole day without a beverage, even the most upset person will eventually smile, perhaps at the silliest thing.  I've been dating my boyfriend from [LOCATION1] for about seven months. We don't get to see each other as often as I'd like, but we try to spend weekends together. Sometimes it's every other weekend. Since we have many things in common, such as our relatives, our pre - dating acquaintance, the places we go for entertainment, our food preferences, and our likes and dislikes, we rarely disagree on how to spend our time together. Even though it's only been seven months, it feels like we've known each other for much longer.  Once, I was at [LOCATION1]'s house to celebrate [PERSON2]'s birthday. [PERSON2] is [ORGANIZATION1]'s youngest sister. We celebrated with pinatas, cake, and all the toys she wanted. Everyone was having a good time, but the kids were starting to run out of energy after playing on the trampoline for a few hours. Before the kids could mention anything about the pinatas, we had already prepared everything. When they heard the candy being poured into the pinatas, they rushed to be the first to hit it.  [PERSON2] got to hit the pinata first since it was her birthday, and then the little kids followed. As they went up to hit the pinata, we sang songs and made jokes, even pretending to imagine who the pinata represented. As time passed, it was the older kids' turn. Most of us were a bit shy, but a [NUM1] - year - old bravely went up to hit the pinata. After she hit it hard, the others said her turn was over as they were eager to get the candy.  She was supposed to call on someone next. I thought she would call on me since she kept looking in my direction. I was blushing, but thankfully, she called on my boyfriend. He got up, grabbed the stick, and the others told him not to hit it too hard so the little ones would still like him. He is well - loved by everyone. He encouraged me to go with him, and without his invitation, I don't think I would have done it. There, he taught me how to swing the stick to hit the pinata. In the process, I swung too hard and hit him. One of his aunts joked that this was how I'd deal with him when I was annoyed.  After that, [PERSON1]'s mom started getting the cake out, and I went to help her. As we gathered to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to [LOCATION2], we were still laughing about what had happened. People were even joking about how this might be a preview of our married life. I didn't know what to say, so I just smiled. As everyone was leaving, my dad was already outside the door, and I thanked him with a silly smile."
141	20895	8	2	"Once, I was walking through @ORGANIZATION2 in a banana costume with one of my closest friends. We were on the hunt for the best costumes for a @CAPS2 party. Amid all the fun of taking numerous pictures and videos, we lost track of time. I can't recall which one of us was laughing the hardest. @CAPS3 is just one instance of the wild things my friend @PERSON1 and I have done together. One thing's for sure: whenever we're together, we're always laughing. Laughter helps both @PERSON1 and me reduce stress. We were teammates for six years, competing as gymnasts at @ORGANIZATION1. We worked out at the gym @DATE1 for four hours daily, leaving us no time to hang out with friends and just enough to do homework. At @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1 and I had to stay focused to avoid getting hurt. @CAPS3 meant that off the floor, we needed laughter to relieve stress and fear. To achieve this, we'd often hang out on weekends and in the @DATE2 sun. Our friendship grew strong because of all the laughter and good times we shared. When either of us got stressed, we'd cheer each other up by recalling the moments when we laughed uncontrollably. Even when we're apart, we often think of the memories we've shared. As mentioned earlier, laughter also helps reduce fear. It does so because if you're not having fun and laughing, you'd dwell on all the bad things that could happen. But when laughter is involved, it makes you want to do anything with your friend. The laughter @PERSON1 and I shared always attracted others to us. Whenever we were together, people always wanted to join because we were having such a great time. For example, on @DATE2, we were at @LOCATION1's house, playing outside on a warm, sunny day. We were laughing, and suddenly, one of her neighbors showed up. Then more kids and her friends came, and soon it seemed like the whole neighborhood was with us. When we had a large group, @PERSON1 and I would choose a game suitable for many, usually a hide - and - seek tagging game. Even with more people around, we were always laughing as we'd trick the players. It created a positive bond between us. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS3 is how @PERSON1 and I became such wonderful friends. Without laughter, I doubt our friendship would be as close. Our laughter brings us closer every time we see each other. Laughter truly strengthens the bond between friends and helps us get through tough times."
142	20896	8	2	"Many people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship, and I wholeheartedly agree. I arrived at @LOCATION1 around @DATE1. At that time, I couldn't speak @CAPS1 at all. I started going to school. Before going, I practiced saying my name, age, and where I came from. The next day, when I walked into school, I noticed everyone looking at me. It was quite scary. I looked back at a girl, and she walked towards me. ""Hi, my name is @PERSON1,"" the girl said. ""Hi, my name is @CAPS4. I'm from @LOCATION2. I don't really speak @CAPS1,"" I told @PERSON1. Then @PERSON1 started laughing uncontrollably. ""You have an accent,"" @PERSON1 said, ""it's really cute."" I laughed back. @PERSON1 looked so nice with her smiles, and we became friends right away. She was my very first @CAPS7 friend. I always thought making new friends was difficult, but laughter made it much easier. Laughter truly has the power to break down barriers and build new relationships."
143	20897	8	2	Laughter is the ideal way to show someone they're funny and to relax. Everyone agrees that hearing a baby laugh is wonderful. Watching comedians perform can lift people's spirits and make them laugh. There are three reasons why laughter is the best way to relax. Firstly, no one can stay angry at the person making them laugh. Secondly, when someone laughs, those around them tend to laugh too. Thirdly, no one can stay sad when something funny is happening. When you hear a baby laugh, what do you think? I believe the baby is truly loved by its family. The baby is having a great time playing with family members or on their own and finds what's happening funny. A comedian's job is to make an audience laugh. One form of comedy is stand - up comedy, where a comedian performs on stage. Another is a comedy, which can be a @CAPS1.V. show, a play, or a movie. Comedies usually don't have a complex plot; the main goal is to make people laugh. In my opinion, laughter helps anyone relax. Hearing a baby laugh is a joy, and comedians love to hear people laugh at or with them. Laughter is a powerful and positive force in our lives.
144	20898	8	2	"Only a few weeks ago, on a day when all students should have been having fun or sleeping due to the heavy snow outside, a guy was crying on his chair. He had his hands over his eyes, a french horn in his lap, and his gaze fixed on the ground. Sobs filled the band room, but fortunately, there weren't many people around to witness his distress. The guy lifted his head; the tears seemed to erode his usual self - assurance. He spoke to the person sitting to his left. ""I just don't understand @PERSON2,"" his broken voice cracked. ""I don't care that you play in cascade winds, get private lessons, or have gone to state honor band! It may sound like a silly reason, but I just want to play first because I've always wanted to, and you never let us play first."" @CAPS2 was right; @PERSON2 really never let us play first. I understood his frustration. In my freshman year, I always sat under him, and he under someone else. I'd never seen him in the first - chair position. Now, in his senior year, a prodigy had joined the band. She was determined to hold onto the first - chair spot. In an instant, his four years of hard work for the first - chair position were reduced to being second - best. The realization that all his efforts seemed mediocre in the face of her talent broke him into tears. @PERSON2 was clearly more talented than us, with numerous accolades to prove it. She'd attended cascade winds solo ensemble festival, band camp, and was going to @LOCATION1 as a music ambassador. Still, something about her having the first part didn't feel right. Maybe it was my own desire for superiority. @PERSON2 listened to his words, then leaned in and said, ""I understand that you want first,"" with a confident tone. ""But right now, we need specific players in specific spots. I've played more difficult music, and my skills are needed for the first part. I understand how you feel; I've been there."" It struck me as odd that a sophomore was saying this to a senior. How could she understand what @CAPS2 was going through? She'd been a prodigy from the start. I initially sided with @PERSON1, but then I realized that letting him play a more demanding part would harm the band. So I tried siding with @PERSON2, but all I could think about was that this was @PERSON1's last chance to shine as a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 french horn player. Their argument escalated. Every comment made the situation more tense. If the argument continued, the horn section would be divided, and cooperation would be impossible. More importantly, I'd lose two talented partners. I quickly slid my chair next to them to share my thoughts. ""When a man has no socks,"" I began my speech mysteriously, but that's as far as I got. I thought it was a great start, but their faces said otherwise. They called me crazy and laughed at me. Thankfully, I ignored their remarks as I wanted to remember what I wanted to say. Eventually, @CAPS3 stopped crying, and @PERSON2 understood that @CAPS3 was a senior with few chances to play first chair. They settled the fight with a simple agreement: @CAPS3 would get the first - chair position once the competition ended. I've been the butt of jokes, but sometimes, it's funny for everyone, including me. I can't imagine what the band would be like if their enmity had gone too far. There have been times when heated discussions raised stress levels in our section. But the laughter that came just in time helped them understand each other. It opened their eyes to the fact that they'd have to sit next to each other if they continued fighting. Laughter has definitely changed the way they feel about each other. @CAPS3 is eagerly awaiting his turn to shine, and @PERSON2 is curious to see him play."
145	20899	8	2	"@PERSON1 told me we're happy together as we lay on his bed. I just smiled, knowing this would be an amazing relationship. @CAPS5 always makes me feel great and beautiful. People often say you're too young to know what love is, but I know no one has ever made me feel as wonderful as @CAPS5 does. When we're together, it's full of fun. Our dates include walking to the park to sit and talk, eating out, and even kissing in public. Before we started dating, we were best friends, and we still are. Everyone asked if we were dating, and we always said no, but I always wanted more. @CAPS5 has always made me laugh. I don't think we'd be such a strong couple without the laughter. Just thinking about the moment I first knew I loved him makes me laugh. I was walking to my @DATE1 class when @PERSON1 suddenly grabbed my arm, pulled me into a bear hug, buried his head in my neck, and laughed, saying, ""@CAPS3, you have some toilet paper sticking out of your pants."" I blushed deeply. I quietly asked him to hide me so I could remove it. When I got to class, I initially thought he wanted to embarrass me. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized he really cared about me, wanting to help rather than embarrass. After that incident, we had a good laugh. After joking about it, @CAPS5 kissed me. I wasn't sure if it was a friendly or a loving kiss, so I just laughed. Then he kissed me again, and this time I knew it was a real love kiss. We're not like most couples, which makes us stand out. Unfortunately, this made some people dislike us. They'd say horrible things about @PERSON1 to me in the hallway, and I don't know what they told him. Even some of my close friends made rude comments about us. But @CAPS5 would laugh at all the negative remarks. When he laughed, I'd ask what was so funny, and he'd say, ""If the rumors aren't true, laugh at them so people know they don't bother you."" I never thought of that. I'm an emotional person, so the comments used to bother me. But once I started laughing at them, the negative talk stopped. I never thought I'd be in @ORGANIZATION1, let alone find a guy who understands what I'm going through. My brother went to prison @DATE1, and I don't think I could have coped without @PERSON1. We cried together at @ORGANIZATION1 almost every day. It's been about a year now. Every time I visit my brother, I remember @PERSON1's words, ""If you're happy, the people around will be happy."" So I always put on a smile. Laughter truly helps. Even when there's nothing funny, just laugh. We're here for a reason, and until we find it, keep laughing. I love @PERSON1 for helping me understand that life is too short to be unhappy and that laughter is essential in our relationship."
146	20900	8	2	Rewrite of the first item Everyone enjoys laughing, yet I doubt everyone fully comprehends the impact laughter can have on two individuals. Consider two complete strangers who've never laid eyes on each other before. Once they start laughing, they could become good friends. You'll never know how close you can get to someone if you don't sit down, talk, laugh, and get to know them. You might go through life with only a handful of friends at @CAPS4, while there are @NUM1 other classmates you've never spoken to who could also become your friends.  I'm certain that getting to know one another can make a difference in someone's life. For me, there have been numerous situations where laughter has influenced my relationships, especially with my best friend, @PERSON1. When we first met, we were total strangers, but a simple laugh broke the ice, making us feel comfortable and lessening the awkwardness. As we laughed more, we couldn't stop, and our friendship blossomed.  I attended elementary @CAPS4 with @PERSON1 for @NUM2 years without ever talking to her. But in @NUM3 grade, we started hanging out with the same people and chatting more. By @NUM4 grade, we began spending time outside of @CAPS4, sharing secrets and having sleepovers. Laughter not only broke the ice but also brought us closer.  In @NUM5 grade, we became best friends, having sleepovers at each other's houses every weekend. Before our @NUM6 grade year at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, we spent weeks together at each other's homes, talking and making plans constantly. Now, we can be ourselves around each other and always have a great time.  Laughter not only brings people closer but also provides support. When I'm sad, @PERSON1 makes me feel better, and vice versa. We always have each other's backs. When @PERSON1 had problems at home and needed a place to stay to avoid going to The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, she moved in with me. Living together has been incredibly fun. We thought we might argue and grow apart, but that hasn't happened. We're like sisters, and @PERSON1 plans to stay with me until we graduate from @CAPS3 @CAPS4.  It's amazing to think that our close friendship, living together, and complete comfort with each other all started with a simple laugh when we first talked in @NUM3 grade. This is why I firmly believe that laughter can turn strangers into the closest of friends.
147	20901	8	2	"One @DATE1 @TIME1 in @DATE2, a few friends and I were extremely bored. Nothing seemed appealing. Going to a movie, getting food, or even playing call of @CAPS2 didn't sound fun. @LOCATION1's parents told us to go outside. Before leaving his house, he went into the pantry and grabbed two large rolls of @CAPS11 wrap. ""I have an idea,"" @CAPS3 @PERSON1 said as we walked away. I had no idea where we were going; @PERSON1 just kept saying, ""Follow me.""  We walked in a group down the street until we reached @ORGANIZATION1. Cold and confused, we sat in the parking lot, waiting for all the cars to leave. Once the lot was empty, @PERSON1 explained our plan. He told us about something he'd done with his cousins before. There would be three people on the roof of @ORGANIZATION1's @ORGANIZATION1 to watch the road, and four @CAPS4.  ""What are @CAPS4?"" I asked @PERSON1, looking confused. ""@CAPS5, @CAPS4,"" @CAPS6 @CAPS4 were the ones who would put the @CAPS11 wrap across the street. The plan was to hop the fence and put the wrap across when no cars were coming, so the cars would drive through it and stop.  ""Sounds fun, but what if the @CAPS15 stops before the @CAPS11 wrap and takes it down?"" @CAPS8 @CAPS9 questioned, looking down on the operation. @PERSON1 laughed and said, ""@CAPS10 then it will be an inconvenience for the driver."" @CAPS11 wrapping the road sounded more fun than black ops, so we were all in.  Everyone got into position. Mark, @PERSON4, @PERSON2, and I were by the roadway, hidden by some bushes. @PERSON1, @CAPS9, and @PERSON3 were on the roof, giving us updates on the traffic. We got a call from @CAPS9 saying it was clear for a while. I hung up, told the guys, and we got up from the ground. We quickly got over the fence and started the first layer of @CAPS11 wrap.  I got another call. @CAPS14 said three cars were almost at our location. We dropped the @CAPS11 wrap in the bush and got back over the fence. The @CAPS15 that came was a cop. Of course. We hid in the bushes while the cop took our large roll of wrap. We were left with one more roll, which should be enough.  @CAPS9 called again and said it was clear. We went out and set up the prank. We wrapped it around @NUM1 times and made it as tight as possible. It was perfect.  ""@CAPS15 incoming! Go! Go! Go!"" Mark yelled as we tried to get over the fence. We made it in time and lay prone in the field. Someone whispered, ""Here it comes."" The @CAPS15 slammed on its brakes, and the driver got out. He looked at the @CAPS11 wrap in disgust and looked around for the kids responsible. @CAPS9 let out a big laugh from the roof that we could hear clearly. The guy walked up to the fence, looked around more, and muttered some foul words. He didn't continue but got in his @CAPS15 and backed up.  ""My god, dude, that was hilarious!"" I said with a big grin. @CAPS9 and @PERSON3 came running through the field, looking scared. ""@CAPS18!"" someone yelled, and we scattered in different directions. Mark, @PERSON2, and I jumped over the fence and hid in the play structure. The rest of the boys ran to a safe place. Eventually, we all met back at @LOCATION1's house without getting caught by the authorities.  Nights like this, filled with laughter and adventure, play a crucial role in strengthening the bond among friends like us. The shared laughter and the excitement of the prank brought us closer together."
148	20902	8	2	I wholeheartedly agree that laughter is what mostly brings people together. In my view, @NUM1 of the time when you're talking to someone, laughter is essential. It enlivens a dull conversation and makes it engaging. Of course, when discussing something serious, laughter may not be appropriate, but I'll touch on that later.  I can vividly recall the first time I met each of my friends. The catalyst for our friendships was a simple joke. I can't remember the exact joke, but I do remember that we shared a similar sense of humor. Once we realized that none of us were serious or dull individuals, we were eager to spend more time together. This is precisely why laughter creates a strong connection between people and draws them closer over time.  As time went on, my friends and I became inseparable. We often expressed our friendship through jokes, some of which were quite silly. Many of these jokes led to physical pain and even prompted us to seek revenge on each other. However, this is just our way of staying close. Whenever we come across something funny on TV, the internet, or in real life, we always share it with each other, knowing that the other person will find it amusing. This shared sense of humor makes us feel closer and shows that we have at least one common interest.  For instance, I once watched a comedy where the comedian talked about a prank he played on a stranger's house. Immediately, I knew my friends had to see it because I knew they would enjoy it. And I was right. When they saw the show, they were amazed at how funny it was and were grateful that I shared it with them. This experience brought us closer than ever.  Laughter not only strengthens friendships but also helps in socializing with the opposite gender. I met a girl, and every time we talked, I made sure to add a joke or a relevant story. Eventually, she started joking around too. She told me that she saw me as a different guy, not boring like others. This made her want to keep talking to me. I've always hoped to avoid being a dull person, and jokes have helped me achieve that. Now, we're very close, and it all started with laughter.  In conclusion, laughter makes relationships happier and more open, at least in playful relationships. There are people who take everything seriously and can't handle jokes, but I highly encourage everyone to embrace laughter. In my life, laughter has helped me make many friends, and it has made my life more interesting.
149	20904	8	2	I have many fond memories of the fun and laughter in my life. It all began in the @DATE1 when I was about @NUM1 years old. My cousins had just moved to @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION2 and were living with us. It was so much fun having them around.  My cousins and I would often ride our bikes. Sometimes, Joey would take my bike without asking, acting as if it were his. We would race down the street on our bikes, and I usually won because I had a @PERSON4 @CAPS1, a @CAPS2 bike designed for dirt and racing.  Behind some apartments on our street, we had built a dirt ramp. It was tough, even though it was just made of dirt. One rainy day, @PERSON7, @PERSON3, another neighbor, and I asked our parents if we could go outside, and they said yes. Joey's parents said it was too rainy, but he came out anyway.  We got all muddy. I fell off my bike while trying to go up the ramp in the mud, and my cousin kept falling off too. By the time we were done playing outside, we and our bikes were covered in dirt. My mom was mad at me for getting so muddy and sent me straight to the shower.  After we cleaned up, we had a great time playing Super @PERSON5 Bros on the Super @ORGANIZATION1. When it was hot outside, we would either play video games, ride bikes, or have water fights with water guns and balloons. We would also go to the park for free lunch provided by the school. Many of my friends and cousins would go to the park for lunch. After eating, @PERSON3, @PERSON1, and I would trade @CAPS5 cards or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cards. Everyone had these cards back then, and I had piles of them. It was so much fun being at the park with friends and family, eating, playing, and getting wet.  In @NUM2 grade, @PERSON2, @CAPS14, @PERSON6, and I were like the three amigos. We would stay at @ORGANIZATION2's house almost every weekend because his backyard was big, and we could play hide - and - seek. He also had a playroom with a pinball machine, a basketball hoop, and other games. On @ORGANIZATION2's birthday, we slept over and played games like Grand Theft Auto @CAPS18 @CAPS19, which was really cool.  I firmly believe that laughter is a crucial part of friendship. When you're having a great time with your friends and laughing, it shows that they're good people. My friends @PERSON6 and @PERSON2 always know how to make me laugh, which is why I enjoy spending time with them. Laughter truly enriches our relationships with friends and family, making life more enjoyable.
150	20905	8	2	"Someone once said that laughter was the best medicine. To me, it was like hearing, ""@CAPS1! Life isn't going to improve, so just enjoy it while you can!"" For a while, that's exactly what I did. However, laughing at everything quickly became tiresome. Unfortunately, I still find myself laughing at most things, even sad ones, thinking that it will make everything better. But in reality, it often causes more pain and suffering.  I remember the first time I met a guy named @PERSON1. He was truly amazing. Most people who met him thought he was a god, but this made him very uncomfortable. He was just a human being, and that's how I and he saw himself.  Our initial communication was through notes. I would give notes to my friend @CAPS3, and she would pass them on to @PERSON1. Since he was very shy, he never wrote back on paper. Instead, he typed messages in @CAPS3's phone, and I would read and reply. It was fun for a while, but I really wanted to meet him in person.  I saw one of his rare pictures, and he was indeed very handsome, but not like a god. He didn't have a wreath on his head or wear a @CAPS5 god - like skirt. He was just an ordinary kid who dressed like a skater and was a real romantic. He had jet - black dyed hair, bright green eyes, and a smile that could light up the world.  Despite the warning signs in my head, I ignored them, which only made my life more complicated. One day, a few friends and I were in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3"
151	20906	8	2	Trust is of utmost significance in friendships. Friends concur on matters, express honest opinions, and safeguard the trust within a strong bond. One can never be certain who will stand by with unwavering trust. When trusting a friend, one relies on them to maintain confidentiality.  My friends and I agreed to share everything and never lie, basing our friendship on trust. We've always had an excellent relationship, sharing feelings, combining opinions, and finding mutually - acceptable solutions. This is why friends should support each other like a team.  Once trust is broken, it's difficult to regain the same level. Communication may decrease, and one may be regarded as untrustworthy. For instance, a friend once hid the full truth from me. After I discovered it, my trust in her diminished, though we remain friends.  Trust is vital in friendships and all relationships. It helps people understand each other better and gain more attention. One can also learn to trust more people. Since trust is so crucial, individuals must work together to build and maintain it. My friends and I have learned a great deal from trusting each other in various ways, and we understand that a good relationship thrives on trust.
152	20907	8	2	"One day, when I was struggling to cope with significant changes in my life, I turned to a friend for help. Usually, on bad days, I keep to myself, but this time, I needed someone. I met my friend, and she did her best to cheer me up, but nothing worked. Then she asked, ""Want to hear a story?"" Eager to be distracted from my slump, I agreed, thinking it might help.  She began, ""The other day, my family and I went grocery shopping. We were out for about four hours. When we got home, the parents started unpacking the groceries. Meanwhile, my sister and I were in the living room training our dog to sit, lay, shake, speak, and roll over. Every time the dog did a trick, we gave her half a dog treat. When the parents finished putting away the groceries, they came into the living room, and we showed them the dog's tricks. After that, my father said, 'Put the dog treats away so she doesn't get into them.' I simply replied, 'Okay.' Then the parents said they'd go get pizza as they didn't want to cook after shopping. While they were gone, my sister and I tidied up the living room and continued training the dog.  When the parents returned, we all sat down to watch TV and eat pizza. After a while, when everyone was done eating, my sister and I heard my dad in the kitchen complaining about not finding the cookies they'd bought. I said to my sister, 'Wouldn't it be funny if Dad thought the dog treats were cookies and ate one?' My sister giggled. Just then, my dad stomped into the living room, threw himself on the couch, and looked annoyed. We started laughing, and he scolded us. Then, out of nowhere, he said he'd found the 'cookies.' He reached for the dog treats on the coffee table. My sister and I were silent, watching him. He looked at the bag, took out a treat, looked at us, and then put the whole treat in his mouth. He started chewing, then slowed down, tilted his head like a dog, and choked. He coughed and spat dog treats all over my mom's head.  My sister and I laughed uncontrollably. My dad sat on the couch with a straight face, but then he started laughing too. We all laughed, and even my mom, who'd been sitting on the floor in shock, joined in.  After my friend told me this story and we both laughed until I cried, I realized that a little laughter can brighten one's day."
153	20908	8	2	Have you ever felt the fear of falling off a cliff while in the mountains? I have had such an experience. On a particular day, after getting off the bus, I grabbed my snowboarding gear from under the bus and headed for the slopes with my friends. We strapped on our boots and took the lift up. That year, the three of us had joined the school's snowboard team.  The air at the top of the run was crisp, and the snow was a fresh layer of powder. We were excited to ride in such perfect conditions. As we went down the usual run, I suggested exploring new trails, and my friends agreed. The new trail was great, with many jumps and plenty of powder. It seemed like an ideal area for snowboarding, and we enjoyed it thoroughly.  However, as the trail got narrower, we realized it was coming to an end. Suddenly, there was a drop in front of us. I tried to stop by shifting my board sideways, but I hit a patch of ice, and it was useless. I fell off and braced for impact, fearing serious injury from the rocks below. Fortunately, my board hit the rock first, creating sparks. I slid a few more feet in the snow before coming to a stop.  Looking back, I was amazed that I'd survived. I was worried my friends might have the same fate, but they stopped just in time. We couldn't believe what had happened. I learned a valuable lesson: always scout the area before going through it. I was lucky not to be hurt, as I could have been seriously injured.
154	20909	8	2	"Laughter is a universal phenomenon, enjoyed by people of all ages, from babies to the elderly. It is an essential element in life, and the saying ""laughter is the best medicine"" holds true. Laughing shows that one has a good sense of humor and likes to have fun. In friendships, relationships, jobs, and sports, it's important to laugh occasionally; one can't always be serious. Being overly serious is not beneficial, as it can make people seem unable to enjoy life or lacking a sense of humor.  During a volleyball season, I faced challenges. As co - captains with my friend [PERSON1], we weren't well - liked by some teammates. A few quit because they didn't want to play under our leadership. We had to bring up seven players from junior varsity to varsity. The new players struggled at first but soon got the hang of varsity play.  Our first game was tough. In the first set of what would be a five - set match, we didn't focus well and lost. In the second set, unsure of what to do, I, as a captain, said we had to give our all. [PERSON1] agreed, and we won the second set. In the third set, despite being tired and frustrated, we pushed on and won. One more set to go.  In the fourth set, we made a bad start, letting the other team score easily, and we lost that set. In the final fifth set, we knew it was a do - or - die situation. We started well, but the game was a back - and - forth battle. Eventually, we won.  Later in the season, when we faced the same team again, we lost. But we made it to the state finals, facing the same team for the third time. We won the first set, but lost the second, which was a blow to our confidence. In the third set, as captains, [PERSON1] and I started laughing, and we explained to the team that we needed to laugh to win. We went on to win the third and fourth sets and became state champs.  Looking back, laughter was the key. Our team motto became ""laugh until you cry, and cry until you laugh."" In the current season, we hope to repeat as state champs."
155	20910	8	2	"Laughter plays a crucial role in relationships. It once saved my best friend's relationship with his girlfriend. They got into a huge fight that started over something trivial. As the fight escalated, they lost track of what they were arguing about.  One day, while taking a break from the fight, we went to watch a funny movie. During the movie, I went to the restroom. When I returned, my friend and his girlfriend were laughing hysterically. I asked what was so funny, but they wouldn't tell me.  After the movie, we went to a restaurant for dinner. While being seated, my friend whispered something to his girlfriend, and she burst out laughing. Again, when I asked what was funny, they said it was nothing. The dinner was excellent for [CAPS1] cuisine. When my friend's girlfriend went to the restroom, my friend told me, ""You won't believe it. We're not fighting anymore. When you left for the restroom, I asked her if she remembered what we were fighting over, and she said she didn't know. We realized we'd just been arguing to win. That made us laugh, and we stopped fighting.""  After that, I rarely heard them fight again, until she moved out of state. The new argument was about whether to have a long - distance relationship. Since laughter had previously saved their relationship, I firmly believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship and also serves as a great ice - breaker in conversations."
156	20911	8	2	"Laughter is a vital element for survival in this world. One should laugh at least ten times a day. It is a well - known fact that it takes more muscles to frown than to smile, and I firmly believe this to be true. It is more convenient to be happy than sad.  In @DATE2, my family lived in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1. Before my brother and I were born, my parents had @NUM1 baby girls. On @DATE1, a beautiful snowy Christmas morning, my sister @PERSON1, dressed in a bright yellow dress, was extremely excited about getting presents and cake. When she opened a big battery - powered monster truck, her clear blue eyes widened like watermelons. She walked steadily and climbed into the huge truck, but the problem was that she couldn't reach the pedals. Everyone was silent at first, then burst into laughter as she awkwardly looked like she was dancing in the truck while trying to reach the pedals.  My mom then said, ""Someone should go help @PERSON1 get going on the truck."" This was perhaps a bad idea. My @CAPS2, who is @NUM2 years old and about @NUM3 pounds and not in the best shape, said annoyed, ""I'll help @PERSON1."" My dad was giggling in the background. My @CAPS2 seriously said, ""I need a stick or something to push on the 'go' pedal."" So, they found a long stick outside in the snow.  Since @PERSON1 wanted to feel the chilling wind on her face while riding in the truck, they decided to try it outside. My mom bundled @PERSON1 up in @NUM1 jackets, gloves, and a beanie. Somehow, they got on top of a @NUM5 - foot snowy and slippery hill. My @CAPS2 pushed the ""go"" pedal, but the front tires got caught on @PERSON1's long dress and ran her over. She tumbled down the hill, screaming at the top of her lungs, and her red - flowered dress flew up. My sister loudly said, ""That's gross @CAPS2!""  Thankfully, my @CAPS2 only had minor bruises and scratches. That was the most memorable incident involving my @CAPS2. I watched it on the @CAPS11 video, and we @MONTH1 put that video on the ""@CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12."" If you see it, remember me chuckling in the background. Always remember, laughter is the key to a happy life, and one should laugh or smile more than frown or be mad."
157	20913	8	2	"Laughter brings enthusiasm and joy to any situation. Have you ever considered that laughter could be a key element in a relationship? For me, laughter played a significant role in forming a friendship with one of my best friends.  I started fifth grade at a new public school after transferring from a private one. I only knew a few cousins there, and sitting with them was quite awkward. At the end of the day, I was eager to go home. I had to walk home with a kid who lived nearby, and luckily, we both liked skateboarding. We started laughing as we talked about our unpleasant falls while skateboarding, and he invited me to hang out after school. As a shy person, I agreed.  Later, he came over with his skateboard and asked me to go down a ramp I had. I fell on my back, and we both found it hilarious. This shared laughter made me feel comfortable with him and bonded us. That fall was a crucial part of our friendship as it eliminated the awkwardness and allowed us to talk about other funny things we had seen.  Since then, every time we hang out, something funny happens, and we laugh heartily. These moments are stored in our memories as good times. Laughter always ""sweetens the mood,"" turning a good time into a great one and a boring time into an exciting one. When I laugh, others around me also laugh, and most of my friendships are based on the times we've laughed together.  In conclusion, most of my relationships are strengthened by laughter. It bonds people and makes everyone feel good. Without laughter, encounters with others, even with friends, can be awkward and unenjoyable. So, laughter is a necessity in any relationship, whether with someone new or someone you already know."
158	20914	8	2	"Many people claim that a sense of humor is crucial when looking for a significant other or a friend. However, some people fail to realize how much laughter can bring people together. I've learned that two people can become great friends simply by laughing together. My best friends, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, became my friends in this way.  Throughout my life, I attended small schools with my aunt in @LOCATION1. Since we are only two years apart, we usually stayed in the same @ORGANIZATION1, so I never felt alone. But @CAPS2 ended up going to a different @ORGANIZATION1 than me, and I had to face @ORGANIZATION1 on my own.  During my freshman year at a large @ORGANIZATION1, I was very nervous. It was my first time at such a big institution, I had just moved, and I didn't know anyone, so I was quite shy. I made my first friend easily in one of my classes. The teacher, @PERSON4, wanted us to have partners for an exercise. For some unknown reason, @PERSON2 and I chose each other.  We were assigned to do the ""mirror exercise."" @PERSON2 was the mover, and I was the mirror. When @PERSON2 started acting like a monkey, we both laughed, and even @PERSON4 joined in. At lunch, @PERSON2 introduced me to her friend @PERSON1, who she claimed to have known for several years. @PERSON1 and I just smiled at each other and didn't talk much.  In my last class of the day, which I didn't like because it was a @CAPS6 class, I found that I shared it with @PERSON1. Since we had already met and had @PERSON2 as a common friend, we sat together but still didn't have much to say.  A few days passed, and we still didn't talk much. Meanwhile, @PERSON2 and I became closer through shared laughter in class. One day, during a test in the computer lab, @PERSON1 asked me if I had heard the ""@CAPS11 @CAPS12."" When I said no, @PERSON1 sang it, and we both laughed so hard that it hurt. After that, we started talking and joking all the time.  @PERSON2 noticed the change and was glad we were getting along well. To this day, @PERSON1 and I still share laughs whenever we have the chance. Although I'm busy with babysitting, @ORGANIZATION1, and my job, and @PERSON1 is in college, the connection formed through laughter remains strong.  Laughter is an important basis for any relationship, but it's not the only factor. Trust and a sense of safety are also essential. If you can't trust someone, their humor won't make them a good friend. And if friends encourage you to do things that make you uncomfortable, they aren't good friends. I'm certain that @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 are the best friends I'll ever have, and laughter will keep our friendship strong for years to come."
159	20915	8	2	"It was @DATE1, hot and dry, and we hadn't seen any @CAPS26 for miles. We'd been walking for six hours, snacking on leftover jerky scraps. @PERSON3 was still angry about dropping the can - tine. In normal circumstances, I might have laughed, but our survival depended on that can - tine.  Under the blistering sun, there was no wind, and the dead - dry dirt was completely still. The sun was at its peak, yet it felt like weeks had passed. Summoning the courage, I sputtered, ""@CAPS1 sound good right about now, don't you think?"" @CAPS2 didn't even look at me. I couldn't tell if @CAPS2 was ignoring me or if sunburn made it painful to turn his head.  I said, ""Don't make me start singing. You know how bad I am at it. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 left me after I started singing to her."" I began to chuckle. @PERSON3 then said, ""So, I'm going to die by myself? Will that make things better?""  I tried to lighten the mood, saying, ""It wasn't so bad. Try to imagine that can - tine had whiskey in it. You hate whiskey, right?"" @PERSON3 muttered, ""Why did I ever start riding with you outlaws? I should have stayed home and become a lawyer to make a name for myself.""  I replied, ""Well, you made your choice. Now we can go on or you can go back and get lynched. Maybe go ask for @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION2's body back by the rocks as a reminder of what'll happen back there.""  Looking into the distance, I saw a small brown dot. @PERSON3 asked, ""What do you reckon that is?"" I guessed, ""Some dead animal.""  A few hours passed, and as we got closer, the brown dot grew a bit. I still couldn't tell what it was, but I had my hopes. My boots, which had started wearing out years ago, now had a hole where my big toe stuck out.  @PERSON3 said, ""We're out of jerky."" He then asked, ""What do you think that is?"" I replied, ""I don't know, but it's big, and with the hot sun, it might have some shade.""  As it was nearly dusk, @PERSON3 worried about walking in the dark. I said, ""It's not that hard to walk without looking. Think of it like trying to find the tail on a donkey while blindfolded."" @PERSON3 started fantasizing about @ORGANIZATION1's party and her pies.  Walking with my arms outstretched, I suddenly heard a thud and felt something smooth. @PERSON3 said, ""I think we found it."" I realized the thud was hitting the object. I guessed it was an abandoned jeep.  @PERSON3 asked, ""What are we going to do with it?"" I said, ""We'll see."" We climbed into the jeep, and the seats were firm but comfortable enough to sleep on.  The next morning, I woke up to the harsh sun. I started searching the jeep's compartments for @CAPS26. @PERSON3 sighed and asked, ""What are you looking for?"" I replied, ""@CAPS26, what else?"" While searching through old papers, I found a piece of gum, a cigar stub, and a half - empty bottle. I hoped it was @CAPS26, but it was whiskey.  I got out of the jeep and saw @PERSON3 sitting against the front tire. I sat down and said, ""Here's some of your favorite drink."" @PERSON3 muttered, ""Is that all you found?"" I just stared at the horizon, which was all sand.  @PERSON3 asked, ""I'm scared. Are you?"" I joked, ""The only thing that scares me is when @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 caught me snacking on her pies before supper."" @PERSON3 laughed and wiped the sweat from his brow.  We sat there for a few days, staring and joking. @PERSON3 was a great guy, but it was a shame I brought him into this. Eventually, @PERSON3 died of a heat stroke. That desert was harsh and unforgiving, and this is a memory I'll carry forever."
160	20916	8	2	"Laughter makes you feel alive. It releases the pain in your life and gives you the feeling that everything is okay. You laugh when things are funny, and sometimes even when they aren't, just to make someone feel better or relax. When someone tells you a hilarious joke, do you just sit there or do you fall on the ground laughing? I personally fall on the ground, laughing hysterically.  Laughter lightens the mood and makes the environment less tense. I've had many great times laughing at the silly and dumb things my friend and I do. My friend and I have been going on adventures since third grade. We go on walks and get lost, build forts in the middle of nowhere, ride her quad to sandy race tracks, and climb over fences to pass the time. Every adventure ends with a laugh and a great story to tell our friends and family.  As we grow up, we may lose interest in these adventures, but we never forget the good times. Let me tell you about one such time when I laughed so hard I cried.  When we were little, we thought things were more challenging and taller than they actually were, but that didn't stop us. When @PERSON1 and I were about @NUM1 years old, we loved playing outside, climbing trees, burying treasures, and spying on the neighbors.  One day, we decided to ""spy"" on the neighbors. They had kids, animals, and lots of cars, so they were outside a lot. Usually, we would stand on the ten tires next to @PERSON1's fence and stand on our toes to peek over, but this time we wanted to be more sneaky.  Since @PERSON1's dad left for work and would be gone for a while, we had time to prepare. We thought of various ways to look over the fence, from drilling a hole to sitting on the shed. Finally, we came up with the idea of climbing on the trash can to spy.  I volunteered to go first. But when I got on the trash can, it started to shake. I was"
161	20917	8	2	"A laugh can bring various forms of comfort. My story is about the comfort of love. I was a young and naive teen (and I guess I still am in some ways). A few days ago, my friend @CAPS2 made me laugh uncontrollably because @CAPS5 made a blunder when meeting my mother. @CAPS2 was nervous about meeting her. For some reason, when I started to laugh, @CAPS5 suddenly acted as if everything was okay and there was nothing to be nervous about. Later, when we went for a walk, I asked @CAPS5 about it. I simply said, ""@CAPS4, did your mood change when I began to laugh?"" @CAPS5 smiled and replied, ""@CAPS6, when you laugh, I feel calm and know that I'm going to be alright."" As a typical teen girl, I blushed, quickly changed the topic, and tried not to make eye contact. But I couldn't help myself. The feeling of his eyes on my cheek overpowered my will not to look. I turned my head slowly, and sure enough, @CAPS5 was staring straight into my eyes. His eyes were wonderful, like sunflowers against a blue sky. As @CAPS5 stared back, I felt as if he was trying to unlock all that I am and all that I know with his eyes, as if he could see straight to my soul. I quickly turned away. @CAPS5 let out a soft, almost beautiful laugh. It was as sweet to my ears as nectar is to a hummingbird. The next few days were tough. All I could think about was that walk. People probably thought I was crazy because every time I remembered the walk and his laugh, I'd let out a laugh of my own. I realized that laughter plays a significant role in everyone's life. For me, I laugh when I'm with the people I love. For some, it's watching TV shows they find amusing, or maybe their kids do something silly. The point is, laughter is everywhere. Laughter is never a bad thing. In fact, it's been proven to have many health benefits. Some people don't understand this. Laughter isn't something to be ashamed of. If someone laughs at you, just laugh with them. It's not laughter that starts wars or kills people. It's people who choose not to fill their lives with the joy of laughter. So, here's the goal: laughter is contagious. Try to spread a laugh. Do something that makes people remember it, and they'll start their own laughter. Let's embrace laughter!"
162	20918	8	2	We all recognize the benefits of laughter. It's often said that it's the shortest distance between two people. In particular, I'll share how laughter functions within a brotherhood that has many great moments because of it. I know for a fact that my brother and I have the best time when we're laughing and joking around. Laughter seems to create the best relationship possible between brothers, and we have a lot of fun. Next, let's discuss the power of laughter in a family and in a romantic relationship. In a family, when relatives gather, they talk about the past and laugh at the things they did as kids. The power of laughter brings families closer together. In a romantic relationship, if a boy can't make a girl laugh, he might as well not talk to her. Girls love to laugh and have a good time with their friends and partners. So, guys, learn how to make a girl laugh to have fun and show that you're not afraid to talk to her. Now, let's talk about friendships. People like friends who can make them laugh and have a good time. That's the kind of friends I have and cherish. In conclusion, we've seen the benefits of laughter in a brotherhood, a family, a romantic relationship, and friendships. I understand that not everyone may see it the way I do, but that's their perspective. I hope you enjoyed my thoughts on the power of laughter. Until next time!
163	20919	8	2	"Laughter is a sign of good relationships. It can also be a sign of personality, love, and caring. To me, laughter makes people unique. For example, a baby's laugh is high - pitched, and as a person gets older, their laugh becomes lower, like @ORGANIZATION1's. His laugh is an integral part of who he is. When I was a child, I remember trying to laugh like @ORGANIZATION1. I'd walk around the house, trying to make my laugh really @CAPS1. My family thought it was great and would ask me to laugh like @ORGANIZATION1 so they could have a laugh too. Now, my laugh is what I wanted it to be, ""@CAPS1"". It's hard for me to laugh quietly. People have told me things like, ""@CAPS2 laugh is what I'll remember you by"" or ""@CAPS2 laugh is really something else"". I love my laugh because it's part of me. Without laughter, we wouldn't be who we are today. Laughter is a way to show emotion. So, go ahead and try different laughs, but you can't change the one you're meant to have."
164	20920	8	2	"I'm going to tell you about some funny times in my life when my brother and I liked to play pranks on my aunt. The first prank: when I was about six and my brother was four, my aunt bought a beautiful purple suede couch. She loved it so much that my brother and I thought she loved the couch more than us. So, we took two jugs of chocolate syrup and poured them all over the brand - new, three - thousand - dollar couch. The second prank was done by me alone. One day, I was playing video games and getting frustrated. I threw the controller down, and my aunt ran over and popped me on the back of the head. She told me to be a good sport and try again. I was upset and wanted revenge. When my aunt went to the bathroom to put on her makeup for work, I went to the kitchen, got a grape soda, walked over to her purse, cracked open the soda, and poured it all over the inside of her purse. The worst prank my brother and I ever pulled was one morning when my aunt was at work and my dad was sleeping. We were sitting on the couch watching TV. My brother said he had to go to the bathroom, and since we always do things together, we went upstairs. We saw a big box of fifty - four rolls of soft, lush toilet paper. For some reason, we love toilet paper rolls. We opened the box, and my brother dropped one in the toilet. Then I put one in, he put another one in, and I flushed it. We didn't know it would backfire. The toilet started to overflow, but I kept flushing. Then I got another roll and started unwrapping it on the floor, and my brother did the same. Soon, we were knee - deep in toilet paper and water. Our aunt came home, and we didn't hear her because we were having so much fun. She came upstairs, went to the bathroom, and saw the mess. All she said was, ""CLEAN @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!"" She slammed the door, and we looked at each other and started cleaning. After hours of cleaning, the bathroom was back to normal. These are the three worst pranks my brother and I pulled on our aunt."
165	20921	8	2	"Being with family and friends on a memorable trip always brings a smile. I was about to graduate when my parents told me we were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 after the school year ended. The date was set for @DATE1, right after school. My first reaction was to ask if my best friend, @PERSON1, could come. My parents thought it over and said yes. I was thrilled that my best friend would be part of this trip with my family. I immediately called @PERSON1. I assumed she'd be excited and say ""@CAPS1!"" right away. But she postponed her answer and didn't seem very enthusiastic. I didn't consider that there might have been a miscommunication. She talked it over with her mother and called me back. I realized I hadn't told her that we'd cover her airfare, dining, and hotel expenses. After clearing things up, they decided she could join us. @PERSON1 and I were overjoyed. We made a countdown board starting about two months before our departure. We planned many things, including which landmarks, resorts, and shops we'd visit. Our family friend who lived in @LOCATION1 at the time gave us a tour of the island. Having her as a guide made the trip even more fun as she knew all the local hangout spots and had access to military beaches because she works in @ORGANIZATION1. There were many funny moments during the vacation, but some of the most memorable ones were in the hotel with @PERSON1 and my mother. My mom always makes things hilarious, so our girls' night out was a blast. First, we went shopping at the mall attached to our hotel. There were lots of small clothing stores, food shops, and jewelry outlets. One of our favorite stores was a @CAPS6 - shirt shop with chocolate - infused fabrics. We spent so much time looking at the designs that we probably smelled like cocoa for the rest of the night. After shopping in the town center, we went back to our room, laughing and chatting. The three of us, smiling with sore feet and new bags, got on the elegant, golden elevator. My mother pushed the button for our floor while @PERSON1 told a story about our previous night's plans. We carried our new things down the long hallway to what we thought was our room. Then we realized we didn't have a key card. We thought my dad should be back from renting surfboards and would answer if we knocked. We knocked for about five minutes, thinking he was playing a joke. After a while, I heard a low buzzing voice from inside the room. I turned to my mother and @PERSON1 and could barely keep from laughing. I then realized we hadn't left a TV on. We quickly stopped and moved away from the door, laughing uncontrollably. My mother had hit the wrong floor button on the elevator! We were so caught up in having a good time that we didn't realize we were bothering someone and embarrassing ourselves. This trip wasn't just a single moment; it's a lifetime of joy because I can look back on these memories and smile. These are the moments I cherish the most."
166	20922	8	2	"Emotions are an integral part of life. Certain emotions evoke tears and laughter, both of which are powerful and essential aspects of existence. Not long ago, I managed to turn a girl's tears into laughter, brightening her day.  It all began with the current teenage craze, ""@CAPS1"". For those unfamiliar, it's a website where teenagers spend a significant amount of time and communicate with one another. I logged in and noticed that the girl I liked was also online, so I initiated a conversation. We engaged in typical teenage banter like ""@CAPS2, whats up?"" Then, she asked if I could hang out with her. I believe most guys in my position would have agreed, and I was no exception.  I met her at the library. As always, she was stunning, even though she may not have been trying. As I approached her, I noticed she seemed upset. When I inquired about what was bothering her, she didn't want to share. Not wanting to make matters worse, I didn't press the issue. All I could think about was how to make her happy, so I started talking about the most absurd things, unsure if it would have any effect. Fortunately, it worked, and she began to smile. Eventually, I had her laughing and having a great time.  Since that day, we've been dating and are extremely happy. Every day when I see her, I say something random to make her smile. This experience has taught me the power of laughter and how it can transform a situation and bring people closer together."
167	20923	8	2	"Laughter is a vital element in a person's life, especially when one is in a joyful or happy state. It serves as an indication to others that you appreciate something they've done, putting you in a good enough mood to share a laugh. However, people's reactions to laughter vary due to their emotions. Some laugh at hilarious jokes, while others find humor in people's accidents, and there are those who don't find such things amusing at all.  Emotions play a significant role in a person's life. They include joy, sorrow, jealousy, fear, and anger. Happiness often prompts people to laugh. Sometimes, excessive laughter can even lead to tears. People tend to be drawn to others who are in a happy or joyful mood because they can then share in those positive feelings. This, in turn, encourages more people to adopt a positive attitude.  Jokes are another common source of laughter. Some jokes are incredibly funny, others can be distasteful, and some are so hilarious that they are unforgettable. However, jokes can be complex. For example, a simple joke like ""@CAPS2, @CAPS2!"" ""@CAPS4's there?"" ""@CAPS5."" ""@CAPS5 @CAPS4?"" ""@CAPS5 @CAPS4?, don't cry about it, it was just a joke"" might amuse a young child, but an older person may require a more sophisticated joke to elicit a laugh.  People generally enjoy laughter, whether it's from others' jokes or hilarious pranks. However, not all pranks are funny. For instance, pranking someone allergic to garlic with something that spits out garlic is not a good idea. Nevertheless, most of the time, funny things can help lift people's spirits when they're feeling down.  Accidents can also be a source of amusement for some, although they can be tragic at times. People may have different views on whether an accident is funny or not. For example, one person might find it hilarious when someone slips while trying to jump off a diving board and hits their back, while another person might not see the humor in it.  In conclusion, laughter is an important part of life. It can bring people together, improve mood, and make life more enjoyable. Whether it's through jokes, pranks, or unexpected accidents, finding reasons to laugh can have a positive impact on our well - being."
168	20924	8	2	Laughter has the power to alleviate discomfort in a situation, forge connections between people, and signal that one is having a good time. In my personal experiences, laughter often emerges at the most opportune moments.  On a regular day at @ORGANIZATION1, during lunchtime, I was sitting with my friends, chatting about our lives. I noticed a girl sitting alone. Since I didn't recognize her, I assumed she was a new student. I asked my friends if they knew anything about her, but no one did. Looking back at her, she appeared incredibly lonely and in need of a friend.  Driven by curiosity to meet someone new, I walked over to her and started a conversation. After a short while, we relaxed and began discussing our interests. She said something funny, and I burst into laughter. My laughter, which sounds almost hysterical and is often considered ridiculous by others, made her laugh as well.  In that moment, as we sat there laughing together, I realized that laughter was bringing us closer, despite the fact that we had only met minutes ago. Laughter truly makes life more enjoyable and fulfilling. The ability to share laughter with someone new or someone we've known our whole lives is truly magical.  Laughter is a universal language that everyone should embrace. It is not only a source of joy but also beneficial for our health and well - being. We should all make an effort to laugh more and spread this positive energy to those around us.
169	20925	8	2	During the @CAPS1 vacation, there was a thick layer of snow on the ground. My cousin @CAPS2, my brother @CAPS3, and I decided to get together and go to our grandparents' place. My brother lives in @LOCATION2, while my cousin and I live in @LOCATION1. So, it wasn't difficult to gather us all.  Our plan was to go to our grandparents' and go snowmobiling together, and stay there for a few nights. However, by the time we all got together and were about to head out, it was too late to go snowmobiling. We were a bit disappointed, but it was okay. We decided to watch movies on direct @LOCATION3 and wait for the morning.  When morning came, it was extremely cold, so we couldn't go out right away. We made a big breakfast, got ready, and then sat around until it got warmer. Finally, in the afternoon, we dressed in warm clothes and went outside.  My grandpa had one of the snowmobiles ready for us, and he attached the hood of a truck behind it so he could pull us. My grandpa drove the snowmobile, and we kids sat in the back. My grandma joined us once but got off because my grandpa was driving too wildly, and we were bumping into each other.  Once it was just us kids on the hood, my grandpa started going really fast. I ended up covered in snow and looked like a snowman. It was so funny! My grandma went inside to get the camera to take pictures, but it took her a while because she's not very good at taking pictures quickly.  After she finished taking pictures, we continued snowmobiling for the rest of the day. By the end of the day, I really looked like a snowman. It was a great day, full of fun and laughter. However, I got really cold afterward. We went inside, and I sat in front of the heater to warm up while my grandma made hot chocolate for all of us. This vacation was filled with wonderful memories that I'll always cherish.
170	20926	8	2	"We were on our way to our first ski race. In our team van, my friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 sat on either side of me, squeezed in tightly. The van was filled to the brim with our packed bags and ski gear, along with six other kids taking up all the remaining space. Despite the uncomfortable seating, our spirits were high. Just five minutes into the road trip, the van was filled with laughter as @PERSON1, who has a real talent for comedy, started cracking jokes. I could already tell that this was going to be a ski trip I'd never forget.  When we arrived at the hotel parking lot, it was already late. The sky had turned black with the @TIME1, and we were all exhausted from the long drive. With weary eyes, we quickly unloaded our bags, eager to get into our beds. We knew we needed to be well - rested for our first ski race of the season. Everyone was soon in bed, aware that 5 a.m. would come quickly.  The sun began to rise over the mountains, but I had already been awake for nearly an hour. I sat in the van as we made our way up the mountain, taking each corner at speed. It was race day, and all of us on the team were excited. The morning passed in a blur as we collected our bibs at registration, got our lift tickets, and had the course inspected.  I found myself standing at the top of the hill, looking down at the course ahead. I knew I had to focus. Although I'd had a great time so far, it was time to concentrate and do my best. The pressure was on. I stood in the start gate, with my coach by my side and my friends watching and cheering me on. I didn't want to let them down.  The official's tense voice rang out, ""@CAPS2 ready,"" and then ""@CAPS3!"" I launched myself out of the start gate. I flew past each gate, staying in control and going as fast as I could. The wind rushed past my aerodynamic body, and my ankles and knees adjusted smoothly with each turn. Everything was going perfectly until I reached the knoll. As I skied over the roller, my body compressed, bringing my knees to my chest, and I lost my balance. I fought to regain control, but it was no use. My skis spun out from under me, and I was thrown off the course, landing on my back and sliding down the mountain.  I sat in the snow, frustrated with my performance. I desperately wanted a second chance, but I knew it wasn't going to happen. Then, @PERSON1, one of my teammates, came and sat beside me in the snow. I expected him to say something clichéd like ""nice job"" or ""you'll do better next time."" Instead, he told me one of his ridiculous jokes. I tried to hold back a laugh, but I couldn't. My mood instantly improved.  I gave him a quick ""thanks"" with a smile, and then we went to watch and cheer on our other teammates. Even though I didn't perform well in my race, I didn't let it ruin my weekend. The next day, I had two solid runs and achieved top finishes. If I'd stayed upset with myself, I wouldn't have been able to do that.  This experience taught me that sometimes, all it takes is a small laugh to turn a bad situation around. Laughter is essential in any situation. It's a powerful connection that can bring people closer, regardless of whether you've just met or known each other for a long time. It can break the tension of a competitive situation and unite people. Laughter truly is a universal language that we should all speak more often."
171	20927	8	2	"Laughter is a fundamental aspect of one's relationship with friends. Without laughter, there is no spark of interest in becoming someone's friend. When I think of laughter, I recall the times I went to @ORGANIZATION1. Even on the most dreadful days, the girls on the team, who are like a second family to me, could always cheer me up with their words and actions. The bond within the @ORGANIZATION1 team is not fully understood by outsiders. No one knows how much we laugh together or the amount of frustration that builds up among us. Sometimes, frustration gets the better of us, but I have many more memories of lying on the turf field, laughing uncontrollably because a player's foolish decision turned into one of the funniest things I've ever witnessed.  I remember my first @ORGANIZATION1 practice in @DATE1 of second grade. I was playing with girls from a different school whom I had never met before. They decided to see who was the best at juggling an @ORGANIZATION1 ball on their knees. When it was my turn, I bumped the ball with my knee in the wrong place, and it hit me in the nose, leaving it bloody. I was at a loss for how to react, so I started laughing. A girl I had never seen before joined me in laughter and offered me a tissue. To my surprise, that girl became my best friend and has remained so ever since. The laughter that day bridged the gap between us, and we've never experienced an awkward silence since.  In the fall of fourth grade, I joined the @ORGANIZATION1 team @ORGANIZATION1, still playing with most of the same girls. There were a few new people, and I wasn't sure what to think of them, so I kept quiet at first. During a game of monkey in the middle, I was guarding a short blond girl named @CAPS3. She was very talented but a bit clumsy. She started running for the ball and, out of nowhere, tripped. I was conflicted about whether to laugh. I worried that she would hate me if I did or that she might be hurt. However, I followed my instinct and burst into laughter. She rolled over, saw me laughing, and started laughing too. After the incident, we got up and started talking, realizing we had attended the same school but never interacted. From that day on, we became inseparable at school and best friends.  Another story unrelated to @ORGANIZATION1 is about a girl who gave me my first experience of laughing until I cried. I remember when she transferred to our school, and I was no longer the ""new girl."" At first, I thought she was the strangest person I'd ever met, but as time passed, I discovered that she was one of the funniest. If I had realized her personality earlier, I would have approached her right away to make friends instead of hiding in the crowd. Our friendship has been built on shared laughter, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  In conclusion, the person who said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" was absolutely right. These stories demonstrate that regardless of how shy or awkward a person may be, sharing a laugh with someone new is the easiest way to find a best friend. Through laughter with these three people, I became more social in middle school and continue to be so in high school. Without laughter, my life would be filled with dull memories not worth sharing, and that is not something I would want. Over the past six years, I've gained three best friends because of laughter, which truly shows that laughter is a precious gift."
172	20928	8	2	Laughter is an integral part of my daily life. Whether I'm at school or at home, I'm constantly laughing. Laughter allows me to express emotions that words alone cannot convey. To me, it's also a way of appreciating the good fortune in my life. There have been numerous instances where laughter has helped me solve problems. I firmly believe that laughter is a crucial element in relationships. In the following paragraphs, I'll discuss how laughter impacts my relationship and the benefits it brings.  Approximately three months ago, my family and I decided to take a trip to @LOCATION2. We planned to stay there for about a month. When I told my boyfriend I'd be away for that long, I saw the sadness in his eyes. It broke my heart, but our decision was made, and there was no going back.  During that month, our relationship was strained. We spoke a few times, but his voice sounded different. There was a sense of sadness in it, and I knew something was wrong. Even though he said everything was fine, I knew his sadness stemmed from my absence.  Finally, after a month, it was time to return to @LOCATION3! I was extremely excited. We arrived at @LOCATION4, @LOCATION1 at @TIME1 on a @DATE1 @TIME2. I immediately called my boyfriend, but we couldn't see each other that same @TIME2. However, just knowing that I was closer to him made me happy and eager. We talked for hours, promising each other that we'd never be apart like that again. We laughed throughout our conversation. The sound of his laughter was a sign of his happiness, and it was priceless to me. The laughter seemed to bless our relationship.  From that day forward, I realized how much laughter affects me in various ways. It brings happiness and prosperity to my life. With a simple laugh, sadness fades away, and happiness takes its place. In conclusion, laughter is a powerful force in my relationship, and I'm grateful for its positive impact.
173	20929	8	2	A couple of months ago, I was hanging out with my friend @CAPS1. It was a @DATE1, and I went to her place to spend the @TIME1. At first, we were really bored, so we went for a walk to find something to do. We met our friend Dylan at the skatepark and talked to him for a while. After about two hours, we headed back to her house.  When we opened the door, her sister started freaking out because we had left, and she was stuck taking care of their younger brother @PERSON1. @CAPS1 didn't respond angrily; she didn't want any drama. Her sister got even more angry because @CAPS1 wasn't reacting to her outburst. After about ten minutes, her sister exploded and started throwing herself around, acting crazy.  @CAPS1 and I looked at each other and started laughing really hard because her sister looked so funny. After her mom calmed the situation down, @CAPS1 and I made a @CAPS3 bed on her bedroom floor. As we were falling asleep, we both burst out laughing again. It was the most fun @TIME1 I'd had in a long time. In conclusion, that day was filled with unexpected laughter and great memories with my friend.
174	20930	8	2	As of this @DATE1, I can't precisely recall why I was laughing. However, the image of my grandfather's face is vividly imprinted in my mind. He wore the same warm smile that always accompanied moments of joy. It was a broad, inviting grin that he would share with us from time to time. As I laughed uncontrollably on that @DATE1, so many years ago, he showered me with his happiness and love for such a long time that I'll never forget a single wrinkle in his smile.  My @CAPS16, whom we all called @CAPS5, had a remarkable ability to maintain peace and happiness in every situation. No matter how difficult things were within our family, he always found a way to make things right. No one could get angry with @CAPS5, and no one could stay sad when he smiled. That was just the kind of person he was.  @CAPS5 played a significant role in our family gatherings, like the one we had on that @DATE1. That @DATE1 was our family's @DATE1 @CAPS8 @CAPS3 @CAPS5, and unfortunately, he passed away soon after. When I reflect on how important that @DATE1 was, I realize it was a perfect occasion for everyone. It was a happy day, and my most vivid memory of my @CAPS16 is his big, happy grin shining down on me as I giggled during a card game.  When the @CAPS8 began early in the morning, the weather was already fantastic. Everyone in my family was in high spirits and eager to enjoy the @DATE1 with the family. My favorite part of every family event is playing games with everyone. We have a few traditional games that are always played during family gatherings, and one of our favorites is @CAPS12 - @CAPS13.  @CAPS12 - @CAPS13 was a game that my @CAPS16 was exceptionally good at. He rarely lost and wouldn't stop playing until he had won at least once. When everyone gathered at our house, I convinced @CAPS5 and my cousin @PERSON1 to play @CAPS12 - @CAPS13 with me. We went into the spare room and started dealing the cards. About half an hour later, we were still playing, and, as expected, @CAPS5 was winning.  Just before the food was ready and when we were about halfway through the game, either my cousin @PERSON1 or @CAPS5 said something that I thought was the funniest thing my @NUM1 - year - old ears had ever heard, and I started laughing. My family was so entertained by my laughter that they couldn't hold back their smiles and laughter. It seemed that my senseless laughter brought instant joy to everyone, especially my @CAPS16.  @CAPS5's smile was one of the most amazing things I saw during my childhood. It was so vivid and colorful that it was like witnessing a solar eclipse for the first time. As a child, I didn't understand what was so fascinating about his smile, but now I do. His smile represented true, pure, and unbreakable joy. He didn't smile often, so when he did, you knew something wonderful was happening.  No one knew that was our @DATE1 @CAPS8 @CAPS3 @CAPS5. I couldn't imagine it being the last day I would spend with my @CAPS16. Everything was so perfect and happy that it seemed wrong for his life to end during such a joyous time. However, if I were in his shoes and had to choose my @DATE1 @CAPS8, that day would be ideal. My only memory of that day is laughter and happiness. I can't think of a better way to spend time with @CAPS5 than a day when we were both completely satisfied with our card game, filled with laughter and smiles.  In conclusion, laughter is a powerful and precious thing. It can bring people closer together and create memories that last a lifetime. My grandfather's smile and the laughter we shared on that day will always hold a special place in my heart. His ability to spread joy through his smile and laughter was a true gift, and I'm grateful for the time we had together.
175	20931	8	2	"Some people claim that laughter is beneficial for the soul, and this is indeed true. However, it also has a positive impact on the heart and mind. Laughter can enhance relationships, strengthen friendships, and even bring two strangers closer together. When you meet someone new or are with someone you hardly know, if they make you laugh, you'll feel a desire to get to know them better. I really love that feeling.  In fact, you can share laughter with people of any age or gender. It doesn't matter if you're both young and female; you could be with a little boy, an elderly lady, or anyone in between and still have a great time.  Last @DATE1, I had nothing to do, so I decided to start volunteering. I had two options: a daycare near my house or an old folks home about @NUM2 miles away. I thought long and hard about which one to choose, trying to make the best decision for myself. I couldn't make up my mind, and secretly, I thought both places would be as boring as staying at home. Eventually, I decided to volunteer at both to meet new people and have new experiences.  I started with the daycare. I woke up at @NUM3 am and walked to @ORGANIZATION1. I had no idea what it would be like there. I wasn't even sure if I was good with kids. When I walked in, I stood there awkwardly. The @ORGANIZATION1 manager approached me and asked if I could help in the @NUM4 - year - old's coloring room. I nodded nervously. I wondered if I was supposed to color for them. I thought it was impossible for three - year - olds to color a picture on their own. Oh well, I thought, if I follow the directions, the day will pass faster.  When I entered the room, all the kids ran up to me with smiles on their faces. One said, ""@CAPS1 by me!"" Another said, ""@CAPS2 here!"" They were all excited to show me their pictures. They said things like, ""I drew a rainbow!"" ""I drew a car!"" ""I drew you!"" When I looked down, I saw a bunch of blue and green scribbles that were supposed to be me. That day was a lot of fun. I laughed and had a great time with the kids. I discovered that I love kids and that I'm actually pretty good at interacting with them.  The next week, I went to the nursing home. I was even more nervous there. I felt so out of place. I didn't know what I'd be helping with, so I sat in the lobby. When the receptionist asked who I was there to see, I said no one. She then asked why I was there, and I told her I was going to volunteer. She led me down the hall and said it was almost lunchtime, so I needed to get ready to serve lunch. I did as"
176	20932	8	2	Looking back on my early childhood, laughter shines brightly in my memory. Since birth, I've always loved to smile and laugh. Through laughter alone, I've found comfort, peace, and confidence that I doubt I could have naturally found elsewhere. This might be partly because of my @CAPS1. He lives in @LOCATION2 and I live in @LOCATION3, so we rarely see each other. However, when we do spend time together, it's always filled with laughter and joy. I credit him for my love of laughter. My parents told me that as a baby, all my @CAPS1 had to do was laugh, and my eyes would light up and a wide smile would spread across my face like the @LOCATION1. It's been that way ever since.  One of my earliest memories is lying on my parents' bed, listening to my @CAPS1 tell jokes. Every time he finished, I'd burst into laughter, and seeing me laugh, he'd also start laughing. The remarkable thing is that when my @CAPS1 laughs, his belly shakes violently like @ORGANIZATION1. I found this the most enjoyable part of the jokes. Once his belly started bouncing, my laughter became uncontrollable. Our laughter escalated until tears streamed down our faces.  My @CAPS1 has one of the most distinctive and contagious laughs one could ever be fortunate to hear. It's a wonderful and enriching laugh that words can't fully describe, but once you hear it, you'll never forget it. His laughter can brighten the darkest room in a house. For me, his laugh has a kind of medicinal effect. Whenever I hear it, for a moment, the world stands still, and everything seems okay.  I'm not the only one who appreciates my @CAPS1's laugh. My father and he both love telling jokes, which, from my observation over the years, is one of the few things they agree on. Topics like politics, religion, and who should pay for dinner usually lead to arguments between them. So, they tend to avoid these topics to prevent confrontation. Although they've never mentioned it, I've concluded that the laughter they share often holds their relationship together. I sometimes wonder if they'd still have a loving relationship without it.  I'll always be grateful for the wonderful gift my @CAPS1 unknowingly gave me at a young age. He instilled in me a deep and passionate love for laughter, which has helped me through tough times. I truly believe that laughter heals the soul and that when two people share a laugh, they're bonded in a precious, fragile, and sacred way. Even on a bad day, when a joke is told and laughter fills me, everything brightens, and my worries and stresses seem insignificant. Finding humor in every situation is another lesson my @CAPS1 taught me. If you can find humor, you can find peace in the most difficult moments. Laughter, to me, is like a drug - a harmless, enriching, and life - saving one that I hope to be addicted to for the rest of my life, thanks to my @CAPS1.
177	20933	8	2	Laughter is an essential element in any relationship. If there's no sense of humor in a relationship, it's likely that the connection between the two parties is weak. For example, I was once in a relationship where there was no humor, and I didn't enjoy it at all.  All types of relationships, whether friendships, romantic relationships, or family bonds, need some form of humor to thrive. However, family relationships are unique. Sometimes, family members may not share a humorous relationship, but they still have a special bond. This is because family will always be there for you, unlike most friends. I know this from an incident involving one of my friends. She really liked a guy, and I thought she might even have loved him. When he told her he was dating someone else, she cried for weeks. Then, at her mom's house, one of her brothers, whom she thought hated her, said he wanted to hurt the guy who made his sister cry. They didn't have a humorous friendship, or even a typical friendship, but I believe laughter isn't always necessary, especially within family.  All relationships are like plants. The relationship is the flower, and laughter is the water that helps it grow strong. Without water, the plant won't grow, just as a relationship without laughter may wither. I know that if I don't find someone humorous, our friendship won't be very strong, compared to someone I find hilarious.  Laughter is also important in everyday life. For instance, in a job interview, it's crucial to connect with the interviewer and make a good impression. One way to do this is through laughter. I've heard many stories about job interviews. My mom had an interview for a @CAPS1 job recently. She said she connected well with the interviewer, and there was both seriousness and laughter during the interview. Three days later, she got an email saying she got the job. On the other hand, my sister had an interview at a pet kennel. She said there was no connection with the interviewer, and no humor or laughter.  In conclusion, humor is a wonderful element in relationships. With laughter comes greatness and happiness.
178	20935	8	2	Laughter is truly the key. We often don't think about how important laughter is, but it has the power to bring even the most different people together. Last year, I met one of my brother's friends at school. We didn't talk much at first, but she seemed nice. We had a class together and started talking more each day. Her name was @PERSON1, and she drove a bright orange @ORGANIZATION1.  One day after school, we hung out. I leaned the passenger seat all the way back and sat on it like a dog. She suddenly slammed on the brakes, and I flew into the front of the vehicle. I couldn't stop laughing, and at that moment, I knew we'd be friends. I was a freshman and didn't know many people, and she was always kind to everyone, so we started hanging out more.  I lived about @NUM1 miles out of town, and her brothers went to school about @NUM2 miles past my house, so we had to pick them up. We bought a game called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' with little jell - beans flavored like vomit, centipede, dirt, rotten egg, etc. While driving to pick up her brothers, we played the game, and @CAPS3 had to stop the car nearly @NUM3 times in our @NUM4 mile drive! Those beans were incredibly nasty.  After that, we'd drive to my house and listen to our favorite country songs, blasting them in her car. She became my ultimate best friend, and no one could replace her. When we had fights, we didn't create drama. Instead, we'd have an actual fight, but by the time one of us was pinned, the other would be laughing too hard to do anything.  Her dad and my dad became friends later on. We'd often have barbecues and family get - togethers. We also talked in a @CAPS4 accent because one of our friends was from @LOCATION1. When we went to @CAPS5 to shop, we'd use the accent, and people would always ask where we were from. Eventually, our dads started talking like us. We also created a bunch of slang words that the whole school started using.  She's an amazing friend who makes me laugh every day. When @PERSON1 had problems with her family, she knew she could talk to me, and I'd always be there for her. She called me sister instead of @CAPS6 because we were so close. She took @CAPS7 and @CAPS8 classes at my old high school. The fake baby doll she got would keep us up late into the @TIME1. It was so crazy! Once, while she was driving, the baby in the car seat started screaming, and we had to pull over to find out what was wrong. She'd be a great mom as she always cares about things, no matter how small.  One time, we painted her little brother's room out of boredom. @PERSON1 was rolling her paintbrush in paint while texting. She took her eyes off the phone and dropped it in the paint. She couldn't find it for about @NUM5 minutes, and when she did, it was completely covered in green paint! I laughed at her for a long time, and those are the moments I wish I could relive.  I realize now how important laughter with her was. About six months ago, I moved to a different state and don't see her often. There's no one like @PERSON1. She could make me laugh and was always just @NUM5 minutes away when I needed her. Now, I have to drive about @NUM2 hours to see her. I haven't laughed like that since I last visited. Laughter is key, and as the saying goes, if you frown, you'll never know who's falling in love with your smile.
179	20936	8	2	"A few years ago, when I was @NUM1, I decided to conduct an experiment on the relationship between laughter and the color of clothes people wear. I laughed a lot and was usually happy because of @CAPS11. I did well in school and had a positive attitude. My clothes were all in bright and 'happy' colors. I hypothesized that the less someone laughed and the darker the clothes they wore, the more their mood and attitude would decline.  The experiment would last one week. During this time, I would try not to laugh and gradually start wearing darker clothes until I wore black, to see if it would affect me. First, I had to tell everyone about the experiment and ask them not to try to make me laugh on purpose. Then, I went to the store to buy clothes without bright colors. This was the hardest part because I saw many cute but colorful clothes. After that, I just had to wait for @DATE2 to end and @DATE3 to begin.  On @DATE3 @TIME1, I woke up, did my usual routine, and tried on my new clothes. When I got to school, my classmates looked surprised when they saw my outfit. It was tough not to laugh at some of their expressions, but I couldn't, as it would ruin the experiment. Throughout the day, I got comments on my clothing, and some of my teachers were worried because I wasn't laughing as usual. When I told them about the experiment, they understood and wished me 'good luck'. At the end of the day, I was satisfied with my success and quickly fell asleep.  The next two days were similar, and I started to wonder if my theory was wrong. But on @DATE1 @TIME1, my mom noticed that I seemed different. ""Are you okay?"" she asked. ""You don't seem as energetic as usual, and you're not smiling at all. Are you sick?"" I told her I was fine. At school, I was asked the same question, and it got annoying. I got mad and yelled at them, which I never do. They apologized, and I felt bad and apologized too. They said it was probably just the experiment. The thought that my theory might be correct made me a little happier.  @DATE4 was the last day of the experiment, and I was glad. I didn't mind the dark clothes and liked how they looked on me, but it was hard not to laugh, and it was starting to make me feel depressed. That day, I decided to wear some of my bright clothes to see if it would make a difference. Some of my friends didn't recognize me at school because they were used to seeing me in dark clothes. However, I didn't feel any different from when I wore dark clothes.  In the end, I had to stand in front of the class to give my conclusion. ""My theory has been proven semi - correct,"" I said. ""Trying not to laugh did affect my mood and attitude. I was yelling at my friends and feeling sad when I shouldn't have. But wearing dark clothing didn't change anything."" Then, my teacher said something so funny that I couldn't help but laugh, and everyone applauded and said, ""Welcome back!"" It felt really good to laugh again."
180	20938	8	2	Laughter is everywhere, and lots of people are laughing right now. Why not laugh? It's good for you and feels great. Laughter can make your day better, help you through tough times, and cheer up your best friend. No matter the reason, it's always good to laugh.  My mom and I have a wonderful relationship. Every time we're together or talking, we laugh and have a great time. Laughter has helped us build a relationship where we can tell each other anything. I can go to her anytime for help or just to talk.  Before our great relationship, my mom wasn't doing well. She was involved in some bad things and was very depressed. Let me tell you about it. One normal school day, I got up, got ready, and took the bus to school. Before I knew it, I was on the bus on my way home. I got off a block or two from my house and walked home. About ten minutes later, I reached my house. I went to my room, put my bags on the bed, and went to say hi to my mom. She was sitting in a chair in her room. I asked her if she wanted to go for a walk, and of course, she said yes. We put on our shoes and walked down the driveway, and that's where our walk started.  We walked down the road after reaching the end of the driveway. We walked straight for about five minutes, then turned right. We walked that way for about ten minutes and then turned left. There was a little store on the corner. We stopped there to buy some water and snacks. After that, we started walking east on the road. I noticed that my mom looked like she was having a bad day. Like anyone would, I asked
181	20939	8	2	Rewrite for the first item (Subjective style) Laughter isn't something that fades easily. The simplest moments can trigger laughter or a smile, and that's a sign that happiness will linger. In my family, my dad, mom, and I all love to laugh. It's truly a precious thing to have. Without reasons to be happy, people would be constantly at odds, and countries might even be at war. Anger is a burden no one wants to carry all the time, and we all need to relax now and then.  My parents and I firmly believe that happiness is the driving force behind all the good things in our lives. That's why we cherish it at home and make sure to share it with my younger siblings. My dad and I have a great relationship, and the same goes for my mom. We get along well and often find ourselves in fits of laughter.  My girlfriend and I started off on a great note, but as time passed, our relationship began to lose its spark. We stopped communicating effectively, and that's what drove us apart. We were constantly arguing for no good reason. But then, we started talking, hanging out, and slowly, we began to get along better. We laughed at our jokes and playful teasing. She told me she loved these happy moments, and I realized that laughter was what brought us back together. It's the key to our happiness and the foundation of our relationship.  Laughter and happiness are intertwined. Without one, the other can't exist. Life would be so dull without them. We'd be stuck in a perpetual state of grudges and a colorless existence. In conclusion, laughter is not just a fleeting emotion; it's an essential part of a fulfilling life.
182	20940	8	2	Rewrite for the second item (Narrative style) A few years ago, my dad and I were sitting at home, watching @CAPS1. My little sister and her friend @PERSON1 were running in and out of our apartment. Every time they came in, they left the sliding glass door open. Finally, my sister shut it, but @PERSON1 didn't notice. He was running so fast that he crashed head - first into the door! My dad and I laughed so hard that I almost wet myself. After we stopped laughing, we went to check on him. He looked utterly confused. The door had a slobber mark, as if his face had been dragged across it.  After the laughter died down, we went back to watching @CAPS1. My dad fell asleep with his cat beside him. He woke up briefly, looked around, and then resumed watching. My older brother walked in, saw the sleeping cat, and took the opportunity to slam his hands on the chair. The cat jumped about two feet in the air, and once again, we burst into laughter. This time, my stomach hurt from laughing so hard.  On @DATE1, my dad, brother, and I were working in the garage and found an electrical @ORGANIZATION1 starter. My dad told me to hold the metal ends, and I did. When he flipped the switch, I got electrocuted. We all laughed. Then it was my brother's turn. He wanted to hold the ends and push the button himself. His muscles tensed up, and he couldn't let go of the nine - volt shock. My dad and I fell to our knees, almost in tears from laughing.  After shocking ourselves a few more times, we decided to put the starter on our tongues. I tried it first, and my tongue pulsed like a heart. My dad couldn't hold the button for long. In the end, our @ORGANIZATION1 starter broke, we gave our cat away, and @PERSON1 moved. Those funny times may be in the past, but they'll always be in our memories, bringing smiles to our faces.
183	20942	8	2	Rewrite for the third item (Subjective style) A @ORGANIZATION1 is an amazing gift. It has the power to connect our minds and bodies with others. It's the source of happiness and brings a sense of sanity to those who have lost hope. There was a time in my life when I felt utterly alone and confused. I was empty inside, and solitude was my constant companion.  I was six when my parents divorced. I couldn't bear to hear them fight. One day, we were a perfect family, playing board games and going to the movies together. But then, everything changed. My @CAPS1 grabbed his jacket, told me he loved me, and left. I constantly wondered if I'd ever see him again and why he wasn't living with us. I was too young to understand what was happening, and the days seemed endless. I became sluggish and glum.  About two weeks after my @CAPS1 left, some neighbors moved in next door. One of the kids was about my age. I didn't think much of them, telling myself that people come and go. One day, I was riding my bike and decided to stop pedaling and crash into the fence. I fell over, and the new neighbor kid started laughing. I crashed again, and he laughed even harder. That was the first time I'd smiled in ages.  I grew fond of making this new kid laugh. I asked his name, but he just laughed at my voice. I later found out he was from @LOCATION1 and didn't speak @CAPS2. Over the next month, I felt the emptiness in my heart start to fill.  My mom and I eventually moved, and we lost contact with the neighbors. But every time I hear laughter, I'm reminded of that new friend. His laughter was the beginning of my new start, and it still guides me today. Laughter truly is a precious gift that can turn our darkest days around.
184	20943	8	2	"Rewrite for the fourth item (Narrative style) Many people say that laughter is the best medicine, and I wholeheartedly agree. It has a magical way of making us feel better, and I've witnessed its power firsthand.  @CAPS27 mother recently had shoulder surgery. One night, three nights ago to be exact, at @DATE1 @TIME1, I was with her in her room doing a word - search. Every @DATE1, @CAPS27 step - dad's kids come over for dinner. That day, @CAPS27 mom wasn't feeling well and went upstairs to work on her word - search book. @CAPS27 step - sister and step - dad were outside looking at her new car. I went out for a couple of minutes and then came back in. @CAPS27 step - brother was on the iPad and showed me a game, and we started playing.  @PERSON2, @CAPS27 step - dad, said he was going to @ORGANIZATION1, and @CAPS27 step - sister and step - brother decided to go with him. @PERSON2 asked @CAPS27 mom if she needed anything and then they left. I went upstairs to check on her and started helping with the word - search.  I thought I saw a word that wasn't in the puzzle and said it out loud. @CAPS27 mom's surprised reaction made me laugh, and soon we were both in stitches. After that, we finished one word - search and started a new one called ""@CAPS3"". @CAPS27 mom spotted ""@CAPS5 - winks"" and got excited. I thought she was crazy at first, but then I saw it too, and we laughed even harder.  We continued with more word - searches. In one, we didn't know many of the words. I asked @CAPS27 mom about some, and her responses were so funny. We also had some silly moments, like when I circled ""ear"" by mistake, but then we found ""hair"" at the end of it.  When Katie and @PERSON1 walked in, they were confused by our laughter. We showed them the word - search, and they joined in the fun. Eventually, we finished all the word - searches. These funny moments made @CAPS27 mom's recovery a bit more bearable. Laughter truly is the best medicine, and these memories will stay with us forever."
185	20944	8	2	Rewrite for the fifth item (Narrative style) One day started like any other. I woke up, wondering what I'd do for the day. I asked my mom if we had any plans, and she said no. After chatting with her, I went back to my room and got a text from my @CAPS1 friend @PERSON3. He asked if I wanted to hang out, and since I had no family plans, I readily agreed.  @PERSON3 and I met at the @NUM1 bus stop on Royal and went to @ORGANIZATION2. I had a gift card from my grandmother and fifty dollars from my biological father @CAPS4. When we got there, @PERSON3 asked what we'd get, and I said I could get anything I wanted. He laughed at my statement. I bought a jackass shirt and some food.  From @ORGANIZATION2, we went to @CAPS6 @CAPS7 for food. As soon as we walked in, the delicious aroma made us drool. @PERSON3 filled a big bowl with all kinds of food. We ate so much that I felt like I'd gained ten pounds. We talked about life and how great the food was.  After finishing our meal, I paid for the food, and we went to the bus stop to go downtown @PERSON1. On the bus, @PERSON3 decided we should go to @ORGANIZATION1. When we got off the bus, we saw our friends @CAPS8 boy, @CAPS9, @CAPS10, @PERSON2, and @PERSON4 downtown. @PERSON3 smoked a cigarette while I checked the bus schedule for the @ORGANIZATION4 bus. We had to wait for @NUM2 minutes, so we hung out with our friends. @CAPS9 was incredibly funny, and I laughed until I cried.  We got on the bus, still laughing. When we reached @ORGANIZATION4, we weren't sure why we'd gone there, so we just walked around. @PERSON3 suggested going into the photo booth to make the day more memorable. We had a lot of fun taking pictures.  Next, we went to @CAPS11 - topic, a store I love. We spent about two hours there. At @ORGANIZATION4, there's a park across the bridge. @PERSON3 and I got bored and decided to explore it. I tripped on a branch, and @PERSON3 laughed at me. We danced to music on a piece of concrete, and I took pictures of @PERSON3 drinking my orange soda.  After a while, we realized it was time to go home. We missed the first bus but caught the next one. We hung out downtown for an hour, chilled at @NUM3 park, got a donut from @ORGANIZATION3, and some items from a cool store. As the day ended, @PERSON3 and I went our separate ways, still saying that it had been an epic day.  In conclusion, that day was filled with fun, laughter, and new experiences, and it's a day I'll always remember.
186	20945	8	2	One day after school, my friends @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 came to my house. They told me to put on clothes that I wouldn't mind getting dirty. At first, I refused, but then I agreed. @CAPS1 also told us to put on rubber boots. Then we started walking to a park. We walked on the train tracks. After getting off the train tracks, we walked down a very steep hill. I slipped and slid down on my bottom while they laughed at me from the top of the hill. Then they came down without falling. We kept walking and crossed a log to reach the other side. After that, they took me to a mud puddle. They said it was deep, so I walked in. I got stuck in the mud because it went past my boots. I tried to get out but leaned too far forward and fell into the mud. @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 thought it was very funny and laughed at me. My boots were still stuck in the mud. I was on a log, so I asked @CAPS2 to get my boots. She tried but fell in. I started laughing at her. Then I went in, and we both tried to get my boots out, but it was too difficult. So I put them back on in the mud and was still stuck. @CAPS1 came and helped me get one boot out and then the other. Then @CAPS1 got stuck, and @CAPS2 and I ran back in. We all started pushing each other, and everyone was falling and laughing at each other. Megan was in a tree watching because she didn't want to get dirty. After that, we got our jackets and started walking home. When we reached the steep hill, I fell down. Then I ran up the hill and didn't slip back down. @CAPS1, @CAPS3, and @CAPS2 were trying to walk back up, and it was really funny watching them climb the hill. After a while, we all made it up and walked home on the train tracks. Everyone was looking at us because we were all covered in mud except @CAPS3. We kept walking and reached Austin's house. He got his hose out and sprayed himself to get the dirt off. While he was doing that, @CAPS2 and I were talking. She told me to put a handprint on her face, so I did. Then she said it was her turn, and I thought it was funny and ran away, but she caught me. Then we both got rinsed off and went to my house.
187	20946	8	2	"Human beings are truly peculiar. There are billions of people in the world, including ourselves, and yet we often rely on others' approval to like ourselves. Even when others like us, we may still struggle to accept ourselves. What drives this behavior? We constantly use relationships to understand our identity, but it's a risky endeavor. We put so much on the line by depending on others; they have the power to either build us up or tear us down. As young people, one of our main goals is to find people who like us, and this need may persist throughout our lives. From my own experiences, I've learned that two crucial qualities in people who can build us up are trust and kindness. It's relatively easy to tell if someone with these traits can bring us joy. A kind person can make us happy just by being nice, but if we want to make a large number of friends quickly, kindness alone isn't the most effective approach. It's not that kindness is a bad way to make friends; it just takes time. To immediately recognize a friend, they should make us laugh. Laughter is essential for enjoying time with friends. In my view, it's a fundamental rule in the ""book"" of friendship. In @CAPS2 class, which was extremely stressful for me, laughter made the experience better. Every day, we either had a speaking assignment or paperwork, and the class progress was slow because students often interrupted with group discussions or other distractions. For example, during a class project, the instructions were given slowly, and I was on the verge of losing my temper. However, one day, the students seemed to understand the instructions right away and started working without asking for repeats. The assignment was for groups of three to four people to create a script using vocabulary from a booklet. It took a whole class period, and then we went home to do other work. The next day in @CAPS2 class was quite interesting. The teacher had various strange props. We were supposed to have the audience act out our scripts while we read them aloud. My group was the first to perform. We selected volunteers and actors. Tiffany, @PERSON1, and I sat at the back of the classroom, not knowing what to expect from the actors. Our play was a huge success! By the end of the first sentence, everyone was giggling, and the laughter grew louder as the plays continued. More students volunteered to perform, and it became difficult to choose actors. Even I, who was usually aloof in the classroom, had a great time. The plays were fun and random, and some made everyone burst into laughter. I clearly remember one group making me laugh so hard that my sides ached, tears welled up in my eyes, and it was almost impossible to breathe. This project was the best I've ever participated in. Moments like these help build strong unity in the classroom. We learned to enjoy the company of our classmates and ourselves. I was so used to being annoyed with them that I was surprised by how much I enjoyed their plays. Now, I no longer see them as annoyances but as an entertaining group of students, like a family. It's amazing how something as simple as laughter can change our perception of others and ourselves."
188	20947	8	2	"The Power of Laughter. What would life be like without laughter? Would our relationships and friendships be the same as they are now? Laughter creates a sense of closeness, a shared sense of humor, and a positive environment. Personally, I believe the world would be a miserable place without it. I'm certain that life would be completely different. During @DATE1 vacation, my friends and I decided to embarrass @PERSON1 (@PERSON5). However, it wasn't easy because nothing seemed to faze her. We tried various things, like throwing her into a pool when her crush was around, dumping drinks on her as cute boys passed by, and calling her old - fashioned names. But she was as tough as a brick, unbreakable. One day, my close friend @PERSON2 came up with an idea. We took a pair of shorts, removed the seam on the butt, and glued it back together, hoping it would rip when @PERSON5 bent over. I told @PERSON5, ""We found these shorts earlier and thought you might like them. They're really cute and would go well with your new yellow tank top."" @PERSON5 was excited and said, ""Thanks guys! They fit great!"" Then she suggested going to the mall. After walking around the mall for about an hour, I dropped my phone on purpose and pretended not to notice. @PERSON5 panicked and ran after it as it slid down the walkway. Just as she was about to bend over to pick it up, her crush, @PERSON4, walked behind her. Suddenly, her shorts split right down the middle, and her face turned bright red. @PERSON2 and I couldn't help but laugh. The look on her face was priceless. I wished I had my camera. @PERSON5 was extremely angry. She shouted, ""My crush saw this! He'll never talk to me again. I hate you guys!"" But @PERSON2 told her it was funny, and I agreed. A few minutes later, @PERSON5 started laughing too and apologized for overreacting. She realized it was all in good fun. By the end of @DATE1 break, we had been to many parties, and there was still one at @ORGANIZATION1. We all thought it would be the best one. At the party, everyone was having a great time. The strobe lights were flashing, the music was loud, the hot tub was at the perfect temperature, and there were many people in the pool. Just as the party was about to end, @PERSON5 pulled down my bikini bottoms and undid my top. Humiliated, we ran into @LOCATION2's room and locked the door. We later decided to leave the room and forget what happened. We realized what we did to @PERSON5 was wrong and wouldn't do it again. We also learned not to mess with her to that extent. This whole experience actually brought us closer. If this didn't ruin our friendship, nothing would. That's why I believe laughter is an important part of friendships and relationships. It makes the world a better place. Do you have any experiences where laughter brought you and a friend, partner, or family member closer?"
189	20948	8	2	"During the @CAPS1 break, my family went to @LOCATION4, but my older brother didn't go. We were heading to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4. The journey was long, but we finally arrived. When I woke up at my grandparents' house, there was already snow! I was extremely excited. They had about six to eight inches of snow. We rested before going out to enjoy the snow. Later, when I was outside, some old friends of mine came to visit. I hadn't seen them since @DATE1. We talked and hung out. They said I was lucky to get out of school early for the @CAPS1 break, as they still had to go to school. I told them that if they were lucky, they would only have to go for half of the week. And they were lucky. On @DATE3, they went to school, but the rest of the week was off because the roads were icy. I was glad they got the rest of the week off, so we could really hang out during the break. That night, my grandma made barbeque chicken, scalloped potatoes, green beans, corn, and rolls. It was delicious. I love my grandma's cooking. She's the head chef at the school where she works, and she's an amazing cook! @DATE2 was a very cold day. My friends invited me to shoot air - soft guns. It would be my first time. It was fun being with my friends again. When I was trying to shoot the air - soft gun, my friend @PERSON6 said I was shooting it wrong. I asked him how, and he said he wasn't sure and that I was bad at shooting. I reminded him it was my first time. Then he put his arms around me to help me aim better. It was really awkward, and I was a bit frustrated. Sometimes I don't like it when people try to help me when I don't want it, and this was one of those times. But since he was a good friend, it wasn't too bad. When we were done, @PERSON6 asked me to hold his air - soft gun while he got something. He said the safety was on. While I was waiting, I was spinning the gun on my finger, and somehow I shot him in the back. He was a bit shocked and asked why I shot him. I said, ""I didn't mean to. I was spinning the gun, and you said the safety was on!"" @PERSON6 forgave me and said it wasn't my fault. He saw our friends @NUM1, @PERSON3, @LOCATION3, @PERSON1, and my cousin @PERSON4 laughing. @CAPS4 confessed that he was the one who shot @PERSON6 in the back. So @PERSON6 decided to shoot @CAPS4 back. Then it turned into an all - out shooting between all of us. I had a great time that day, and it's one of my favorite memories from that trip. While I was still in @LOCATION4, my @CAPS5 asked me to babysit on @DATE4. The next day after lunch, I let my little cousin @PERSON2 play in the backyard after he finished eating. My baby cousin @PERSON5 was taking a nap, so I told @PERSON2 we couldn't be too loud. I decided to play outside in the snow with him. After we were done, we tried to go back into the house but got locked out. I remembered that earlier when my @CAPS5 was home, @PERSON2 was messing with the lock. I tried the front door, but it was also locked. @PERSON2 said the garage door could open, but he didn't know the code. I felt so stupid. After a few more minutes, we went to a neighbor's house so I could call my @CAPS5 because I didn't have her cell - phone number. The neighbor only had their house number, so I called my dad to get her number. I told him what happened, and he laughed. @PERSON5 was still napping, so things weren't too bad. I called my @CAPS5 and waited until she got home. She said it was okay because it had happened to her twice when @PERSON5 was napping. She also said she usually takes a key or makes sure the door is unlocked before going outside. I learned a lesson that day. Other than that, @PERSON2 and I had a lot of fun outside. I had a wonderful time in @LOCATION4. It's one of my favorite places, especially when I'm with my friends and family."
190	20949	8	2	Some people think that only money can buy happiness, but in my opinion, happiness comes from the simple and great things in life, and the greatest of these is laughter. Laughter not only shows kindness, happiness, and freedom but also makes both others and ourselves feel good. It's one of the best feelings we can experience, although excessive laughter can be painful. It can teach people how to express themselves and forget about the negative aspects of life. Everyone can laugh and make others laugh. Without laughter, life would be incredibly dull. However
191	20953	8	2	A while ago, I had a close friend named @PERSON4. We were inseparable, like two peas in a pod. On @DATE1, we would hang out the whole day. One day, we went to our friend @PERSON1's house to see if she could join us. We spent the entire day together when @PERSON1 came up with an idea. She wanted me and @PERSON2 to stay over at @TIME1. We stayed out a bit past dark and wandered around @CAPS1. We stopped at @LOCATION1's house for her to get her clothes and then headed back to @ORGANIZATION1. On the way, we stopped again at @LOCATION2's house and relaxed for a while. We were there for @CAPS9 @NUM1 minutes, laughing about all the crazy things that had happened during @DATE1. When we were about to leave for @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @LOCATION2's older brother, smacked @PERSON1 on the butt and complimented her. We teased her about it for a long time, and @CAPS3 kept talking about it until he moved to @ORGANIZATION2. After leaving, @LOCATION3, @PERSON4, and I were singing to @ORGANIZATION2's new @CAPS5 when a random guy stopped to ask for directions. I guided him, and he thanked me before driving off. As soon as he left, @PERSON4 exclaimed that he was the hottest guy she had ever seen. But when we saw him again near the @CAPS10 down the road, he didn't seem so hot. He had a scruffy face, long, brown, straggly hair in a ponytail, and was dressed like a hobo. I still tease @PERSON4 about it to this day. That @TIME1 of @DATE1 was truly amazing. We then went to the @CAPS11 @CAPS12 to buy drinks when @PERSON1 panicked about losing her @CAPS5. So we retraced our steps back to @LOCATION2's house, hoping to find it. On the way, a guy tried to help us. By then, it was probably @CAPS9 @NUM1 @CAPS14'clock at @LOCATION4. We finally gave up and decided to go back to @ORGANIZATION1. Just as we were about to enter the house, @PERSON1's mom rushed out and started yelling at @LOCATION3. Her mom then took me and @PERSON4 back to my house. Since the door was locked and everyone was asleep, we had nowhere to go. So @PERSON4 and I were homeless for that @TIME1. We walked around all night. We almost fell asleep in the laundromat when I remembered that my aunt @PERSON3 was looking at a small, white truck for sale in the @CAPS15 parking lot. The truck had a bed in the back, and although it smelled terrible, it was better than the hard floor of the laundromat, so we crawled in. It was a tight fit, but we managed. That was an unforgettable @TIME1 of @DATE1.
192	20954	8	2	Do you think being part of something is always fun? Sometimes, it isn't, especially when you're in a difficult situation. In my opinion, trust is extremely important in a relationship. Without trust, there is no real relationship. In @MONTH1, some people try to keep their distance. However, there are those you can trust. These trustworthy people will help you. They'll tell you what others are saying about you and the other person. In my view, a person who can get along with many people is reliable. If you know a lot of people, you can build good relationships with them. I have a good friend who trusts me, and trust is a wonderful thing. Without trust, you're nothing. Sometimes, being in a relationship is great. You feel happy when someone is with you, and you can share everything with them. For example, I used to have a strained relationship with my brother. I didn't trust him because he always wanted to tell my mom everything, and I would get in trouble. But now, I tell him everything. He doesn't do that anymore, and it's fun to hang out with him. Having fun is important. You can go to parties, hang out with friends, or even travel to places like Mexico. I always try to have fun. I take my friends to the park or the mall, and I also visit my grandmother. Trust and having fun are essential aspects of our lives, and they can bring us closer to others and make our experiences more fulfilling.
193	20955	8	2	Everyone has a unique way of laughing. Some laugh so hard that they cry, while others don't. However, the common denominator is laughter. People use laughter as a means to express joy, happiness, or when something strikes them as funny. Laughing is an excellent way to improve your mood. For example, if you're having a bad day and a friend tells you a funny joke, it can instantly make you feel better. A good sense of humor can help you navigate tough situations, embarrassing moments, or just a rough day. Being able to laugh at yourself and your own embarrassing actions is beneficial as it allows you to move on and not be overly self - conscious. Whenever I laugh, I feel better. It reminds me of all the good times I've shared with friends and family, the inside jokes we've created over the years that still make us laugh as hard as before. I firmly believe that laughing is enjoyable for everyone. It can lift your spirits regardless of the circumstances, and some even claim that it makes you look younger. Laughing creates long - lasting memories. When you revisit these memories in the future, they still seem just as funny. Some of my best friends have a contagious laugh. They find every little joke hilarious, and their laughter is unforgettable. Their laughter shows how it can bring happiness to anyone. Even if you don't think you're funny, saying something to them will likely make them laugh, and you'll probably start laughing too. One of the best times I spent with my friends was when we went to @ORGANIZATION1 at the beginning of @DATE1, right before starting high school. It was two days after our middle - school graduation. We packed my family's car and headed to @ORGANIZATION1. Within half an hour of the car ride, we were already laughing at every little thing. We sang and danced in the car as much as we could while buckled in. During the car ride, we got stuck due to construction, so we got out of the car and did a @CAPS1 fire drill around it. Other drivers and the construction workers laughed at us, turning a boring moment into a fun one. When we arrived at @ORGANIZATION1, we dropped off our bags, grabbed our bikes, and went exploring. The weather was perfect, with no clouds in the sky. During the bike ride, we laughed, told jokes, and talked about our excitement for high school. The next day, we decided to float down the river on a raft. It would have been a great idea if we knew where we were going. I had some experience with this, but with five girls, two rafts, and an unfamiliar river, it was a bit of a challenge. We jumped between the rafts and splashed each other with the oars, laughing the whole way. People we passed probably thought we were crazy because of how much we were laughing. After the rafting, we were hungry, and my mom had prepared lunch. @PERSON1 panicked about losing her @CAPS5, so we retraced our steps. A guy tried to help us find it, but by @CAPS9 @NUM1 @CAPS14'clock at @LOCATION4, we gave up and went back to @ORGANIZATION1. As we were about to enter the house, @PERSON1's mom came out and yelled at @LOCATION3. Despite the small hiccups, it was an amazing trip filled with laughter and wonderful memories. Laughter truly has the power to make life more enjoyable.
194	20956	8	2	"Laughter serves multiple purposes, and it is a crucial element in relationships. While there are many aspects to a relationship, the idea that ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" holds significant truth. Sometimes, laughter can alleviate sadness, but at other times, it may not have that effect. If laughter bridges the gap between two people, when a person meets someone they're interested in, laughter can be a powerful tool. For example, I once approached a girl and was at a loss for what to do or say. So, I made an effort to make her laugh. It might have taken a few days of trying hard, but in the end, I felt more comfortable asking her out and being around her and her friends. When I can make her laugh, I feel better about myself because seeing her in a bad mood is never pleasant. On some occasions, making people laugh may not have a deep - seated meaning. However, when I make my girlfriend laugh, it's always worth it. I can turn her from being sad or angry to being happy and full of laughter. Laughter can also help combat depression. When she's depressed, it's like a train going off the tracks, and the outcome is never good. But when she's happy, she's full of joy, giddy, and often very spontaneous. I understand that laughing alone can be good, but you might be thought of as crazy if you laugh for no apparent reason. One of the best indicators that someone is feeling better is laughter. If they're laughing, they're likely not mad, sad, or experiencing negative emotions, except perhaps sarcasm, which can usually be dismissed. I've learned that using sarcasm to make people laugh often ends up offending them, so I prefer to just be myself. The saying that ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" is indeed true. By using laughter, you can get to know someone better and learn valuable life lessons through closer relationships. When you hear this phrase, ask yourself if you're capable of making someone laugh and if you can build a close relationship through laughter. If you do, you'll realize that laughter truly has the power to bring people closer together."
195	20957	8	2	People entered the restaurant one by one, forming a human chain. Each time someone pushed the door open a bit more, the metallic red bell chimed once. As I walked in, I was greeted by the aroma of @CAPS1 food and the gentle hum of conversations. I took a few steps forward and stopped, unsure of where to go. To my right was a wall covered in @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 symbols with deep meanings, and to my left were numerous tables already occupied. Not knowing where to sit, I turned to my mom. I really wanted to sit at one of the adult tables, even if it meant sitting quietly. But my mom, always knowing what's best, nudged me towards the back of the restaurant, telling me to sit with my cousins. I reluctantly did as she said. I walked over to the table slowly, dragging my feet, and awkwardly stood in front of the circular table. I yanked out a chair and looked at my mom pleadingly, knowing she wouldn't change her mind. We had gathered at a @CAPS1 restaurant to celebrate my grandpa's @NUM1 birthday. His children had flown from the mainland to @LOCATION1 to be with him on this special occasion. I hadn't seen some of these cousins for over @NUM2 years, and for others, it had been even longer. Although I had seen them since we arrived in @LOCATION1, we hadn't talked much, especially when we were all together and forced to interact. Sitting at the table with my napkin on my lap, I looked at my cousins, and they stared back at me as if I were an exotic animal. After a while, they seemed to forget I was there and started chatting among themselves. The only person at the table I didn't feel like a stranger with was my cousin @PERSON2. She had wavy brown hair with bright blond highlights, a sun - kissed complexion from the tropical days, and beautiful brown @CAPS6 skin that made me envious. We started talking, and I soon found myself enjoying the moment. It wasn't until the food arrived that we really started interacting as a group. As teenagers with simple tastes, we all stared as the waiter brought the first dish. After asking the friendly waitress what it was, we understood from her broken @CAPS7 that it was buns with duck inside. She rushed off to serve other tables, and we all just stared at the food. No one wanted to take the first bite. Then, my cousin @PERSON1, being the daredevil, took a bite. After chewing and swallowing, he smiled, indicating his approval. As I started eating, I began to think that maybe these cousins were easier to get along with than I thought, and I had made a big deal out of nothing. From then on, I decided to just be myself and stop worrying about the long time since we last met. The way the courses were served gave us plenty of time to chat between each dish. Since I stopped worrying about what to say, I easily joined the conversations and started to relax. After the duck tray was removed, we noticed that my cousin @PERSON1 from @LOCATION2 pronounced certain words with an accent. We started comparing our pronunciations, and everyone started laughing at the differences. That evening, I realized that even when you're uncomfortable around a group of people you don't know well, finding common ground can ease that discomfort. While it can be difficult to find a topic that everyone enjoys talking about, finding something that makes you laugh is much easier. Laughter is something that everyone can participate in, even if they're not actively contributing to the conversation. When you feel like you're part of the group, you feel accepted, and that's what we all
196	20958	8	2	"People often say that laughter bridges the gap between two individuals. I witnessed the truth of this when I met a girl named @PERSON1. Three years ago, I was sitting on a swing in a city park, contemplating whether jumping off would hurt. I took a chance and let go of the swing chains, flying through the air. I felt an unbalanced sensation in my chest as I fell, and everything seemed to slow down. The allure of what would happen upon hitting the ground was overwhelming. I failed to stick the landing and struggled to get up. Just then, I felt hands on my shoulder and arm. I looked up and saw a girl - not just any girl, but a stunning one. She had dazzling green eyes that could stop an enraged rhino in its tracks, hair that flowed gracefully in the wind, and soft, delicate skin that made one think she could be easily hurt. ""Ouch,"" was all I could manage to say. ""Ouch, are you okay?"" she asked with genuine concern. ""I'm fine. I just forgot to stick the landing. Thanks for helping me. Um, what's your name?"" I replied. She giggled before telling me her name. ""Do you want to take a walk with me?"" I asked, a bit nervously. ""Sure, but I have to wait for my mom at the park because she'll be here soon,"" @PERSON1 said. As we walked around the park, we stopped at a monkey dome and started asking each other random questions. I learned that she was @NUM2 years old, her favorite color was baby blue, and she always dreamed of becoming a doctor. We continued walking around the playground, sharing past memories. I asked her if she had siblings, and she said she had a brother and two sisters. While she was talking, I noticed she was deep in thought and asked what she was thinking about. She quickly replied, ""I'm wondering why I'm so happy with you."" ""Well, it could be that my jokes are making you laugh and feel good. Or maybe it's my charm working on you,"" I said with a bit of an accent. ""Definitely,"" she said, barely able to speak through her laughter. Suddenly, a car horn honked, and we said our goodbyes. I watched her car drive away, hoping we'd meet again. However, I knew it was unlikely because my family was moving from the city to a small town across the country. As I walked back to my house for my last night in the city, all I could think about was her and how a little laughter had become the key to a new friendship."
197	20959	8	2	"A perfect day is often the result of multiple factors coming together. For many teenagers, perfect days usually occur during breaks, away from the stress of school. However, my perfect day was on a @DATE2 in the middle of @MONTH1 in @DATE1. It was on this day that I founded a friendship with @ORGANIZATION1, which has now become my best friendship. This friendship is built on fun times, shared memories, story - telling, and laughter. By @DATE1, I had spent several weekends with @ORGANIZATION1, but none were as hot as that late @DATE4 weekend. We decided to cool off and set off for @CAPS1. We drove down the road in a truck with two redneck boys and a mutt in the truck bed. Arriving in @CAPS1 was strange for me. I was far out of my comfort zone, and I hadn't met any of the people @ORGANIZATION1 was about to introduce me to. When I first saw @PERSON1, @PERSON3, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2, I couldn't understand how @ORGANIZATION1 had met them. She is athletic, driven, proper, and intelligent, while the boys were into big trucks, fishing poles, and loud country music. I didn't think opposites could attract or become fond of each other at first. But as the day went on, I started to feel more comfortable. As hours passed and we exchanged jokes and laughter, I realized how similar we all were. I didn't think the childish things we did that @DATE2 in @MONTH1 would matter to me months later, but they do. When we ran by the dirty creek with black lipstick as war paint and laughed until we cried, I knew the situation was perfect. If that day hadn't brought laughter and made me feel at ease, it would have been forgotten. Every happy memory has one thing in common - a joke or a funny face that makes you laugh uncontrollably. Every time I drive through @CAPS1, I think about that hot day when we sat by the fishing poles, laughing. I remember @ORGANIZATION1 and I running through the trees, tripping over our feet and laughing. I also recall @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 laughing as we tried to swim. After all the running and swimming, we were full of energy. @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2 invited us for a walk, and we agreed. We walked into the brush and stopped after five minutes on top of a hill of small round pebbles. I'm not sure what led to @LOCATION1 pushing @PERSON1 down the hill, but I remember @PERSON1 pulling @PERSON2 down with him, and @PERSON4 sliding down to join the fun. Watching the three boys wrestle on the sliding rocks was like watching a 50s movie. There was no texting or using machines; just laughter and peace around us. The day had no stress and the perfect amount of sunshine, like a dream. Once you're in such a moment, you never want to leave. When you're on a laughing high, you disconnect from the world, and for a few seconds, life is simple. You're just yourself, with no racing thoughts or rushing emotions. I never thought something as simple as laughter could create or strengthen a friendship. On that @DATE2, I realized that the laughter shared between @ORGANIZATION1 and me would be the first of many memories. Every event and laugh from that day will always be a precious memory that makes me appreciate life. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Before that @DATE1, I wouldn't have believed it, but that day, I saw how laughter could bring people closer and make life more wonderful."
198	20962	8	2	Moving from one place to another has always been difficult for me. I hated the idea of never seeing my friends and family again. I thought there was no hope; it was a futile feeling. I knew I would miss @LOCATION1 dearly, and @ORGANIZATION1 seemed so far away - a twelve - hour drive felt like the end of the world to me. I had visited @ORGANIZATION1 before, and it was boring. Moreover, the thought of looking for a new house there made me even more bored. All I could think about was @LOCATION1. But now, I was moving there! When I first heard about the move, I was furious and tried to fight against it. I was sure my parents were making a mistake. Despite my best efforts, I couldn't change their minds. My tears had no effect on them. I was heart - broken and had to spend twelve hours in the moving van, which felt like an eternity. Finally, when the journey ended, my legs were sore and tired. I didn't want to get out of my seat or touch the ground in @ORGANIZATION1. The ground was dirty, and the apartment complex was old and overcrowded. The rain and mud only worsened my mood. Everything about this place was disgusting, and the thought of sharing a room with my younger brother made me sick. I stepped into the apartment and went straight to my drab - colored room. I sat down to think about the pros and cons of my situation. The walls seemed to be closing in on me, like bars in a prison. I felt condemned to this fate until I turned @NUM1, which was more than @NUM2 years away! I stayed in my apartment for three days before going outside. It wasn't that bad since it was raining all the time, even at the end of @DATE2, which was unusual for me. I didn't want to leave my room or the apartment. All I wanted to do was watch @DATE1 @TIME1 cartoons in my room. I felt lonely and out of place. I had no friends to talk to, my parents wouldn't listen to me, and my little brother was only @NUM3, so he wouldn't understand. I was even more miserable when I found out I had to go to school the next day. Aloha Park School sounded like a well - funded school with rich kids, but it was the opposite. It was an old school with students from lower - income families. In a way, it was comforting to know that I was in a similar situation. The first day of school was terrifying. It was my first big transition to a new and unfamiliar place. My teacher was old and grumpy, and she seemed to be in a bad mood. To make matters worse, she held my hand in the hallway, which was humiliating and not at all comforting. I heard my new classmates laughing at me, and I thought I would never make friends. The humiliation was bearable, but the thought of spending the next nine months in this class was terrifying. My teacher told me to sit next to three boys on the far side of the room. They all had a confused and somewhat territorial look on their faces. I felt extremely unwelcome. When I sat down, I was worried about what the boys might do. Surprisingly, they just stared at me for a while and then there was an awkward silence. As the day went on, things became a bit more normal. Then, the boys started talking about the opposite gender, and I started listening. I smirked at their inappropriate conversation. They laughed and covered their mouths in embarrassment. I thought they were amateurs at being funny. I decided to take a chance and told a very inappropriate joke. They looked at me confused and asked what I said. I repeated it, not sure how they would react. Then, they all burst out laughing. I was so happy that they had a sense of humor. After that, we became friends, and my life in this new place started to get better.
199	20963	8	2	"Laughter is a universal ability that everyone possesses. It not only helps us make friends but also has the power to transform our days. The ability to laugh is of great significance in our lives. Without it, days would be dull, sad, and depressing. When I see someone laughing, it brightens my day, makes me smile, and often makes me laugh along. By laughing, we become happier, learn more about others, and can turn bad days into good ones. I have personally experienced the joys of laughter after a bad day, which is why I now believe it is an essential part of life. Not every day can be perfect. Bad days are inevitable, and when they come, a moment of laughter can completely change the course of the day. Many people, including myself in the past, scoff at the saying, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Most of my days were not as good as they could be, especially with the daily grind of school. People kept telling me that if I laughed more often, I would feel better and have more fun. I didn't believe them. How could something as simple as laughing change my perspective on life? I thought it was highly unlikely. However, a few years ago, my views changed. It was an ordinary, not - so - great day. My hair was a mess, my sister @PERSON1 and I were constantly arguing, and my brand - new phone broke at the start of our shopping trip to @LOCATION1. I was convinced that the day was going to be a disaster. As the day went on, nothing got worse, but nothing improved either. @PERSON1 and I continued shopping. At our last stop, something happened. While waiting at a stop - light, I saw a strange man sitting alone across the road. He seemed to have an injury on his foot, and our suspicion was confirmed when he started walking like a hurt penguin, shuffling his feet and bobbing up and down. The sight made me smile, and when I pointed him out to @PERSON1, she started laughing uncontrollably. I soon joined in. This man's funny way of walking completely changed my day. What I thought was impossible turned out to be possible. Laughter can bring people closer and make days more wonderful. After that day with my sister, my views on laughter changed significantly. I realized that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people. Even though my sister and I were arguing before we saw the funny man, after we laughed about him, we felt closer than ever. It's amazing how one incident can change our beliefs. That day will always be a precious memory, and it has made me appreciate the power of laughter in my life. I now consider laughter one of the greatest things and try to laugh as often as possible."
200	20964	8	2	"On @DATE1 seventh, I invited my two best friends, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, to go to my boyfriend's football game with me. It would be the first time they'd meet him since he went to a different high school. Our plan was to get off the bus at my house and then my mom would drive us to the game. When we reached the end of the lane and started walking towards my house, suddenly, @PERSON2 and I started screaming, ""Ahhhhh, my god!"" We had almost stepped on a dead snake lying in the lane. @PERSON1 had no idea what was going on and had a puzzled look on her face, which made us burst out laughing. She soon understood and joined in, saying, ""You guys are so funny. It's just a dead snake."" We talked and laughed all the way to my house. After catching up a bit and me changing into my boyfriend's #@NUM1 jersey, we went downstairs to eat. We sat at the table"
201	20965	8	2	In sixth grade, I participated in an outdoor activity. I woke up very early and went to the designated spot where the bus was taking students to the outdoor location. I boarded the bus and on the way, we were informed about the cabin we would stay in. There were seven of us in the cabin, including myself. I had brought my electronic device, but the teachers told us we couldn't use devices during the trip. The next day, after having lunch of pizza, pizza pockets, and hot dogs, we engaged in some activities. We caught some fish just to examine them and then put them back into the water. We also went on a mountain hike. On the way, we saw deer eating grass. I got really tired during the hike. When we returned, we prepared to go home. Overall, I really enjoyed this field - trip and would like to help out in similar activities in the future.
202	20966	8	2	Laughter is one of the most important aspects of life. On @DATE2, during breakfast at @TIME1, when my family and I were gathered around the table, my sister recalled an incident from her work the previous day. Her manager slipped on a banana peel in the hall as she didn't notice the banana on the floor. It was hilarious, especially because it was the manager. The memory of this incident made the @TIME1 pass quickly, and every time I thought about it, I couldn't stop laughing. It was the funniest thing she had shared since starting her job. At lunchtime, I was at school when my mom called. She told me that our dog, after taking a shower, was running around like crazy on the beds and couches to dry off. I couldn't believe it and started laughing so hard that I shared it with my friends, who also found it funny. I could vividly imagine the scene. Throughout the day, the thought of the dog's antics would make me burst into laughter, even in class, though I had to stop as everyone was staring. At dinner, when we were all at the table sharing our day, my brother tried to tell us about his school day but was laughing so hard he could barely speak. He said that after his lunch break, when he came out of the bathroom, his friends were laughing and pointing at him because a big piece of toilet paper was stuck to his pants. He thought it was funny too, and the rest of us laughed so hard that we even forgot about our cold dinner on the table. Without laughter, each day just wouldn't be the same.
203	20967	8	2	I was raised with two brothers who meant the world to me until my baby sister was born in @DATE1. I'm the second - born of seven children. Sadly, many of my family members have passed away. I've been locked up since I was twelve and a half years old, which means I've missed four years of being with my family and attending funerals. The only funeral I cried at was my mother's in @DATE2. Before she passed, she didn't want us siblings to be separated, but it happened. My brothers went to live with my grandpa, and my baby sister and I went to live with our grandma. I feel so sad that I can't watch my little sister grow up, see my brothers have their first kids, or welcome new nieces and nephews into the world. I remember the fun times in @LOCATION1 with just me and my brothers. We had a great time getting into trouble, running to the park, meeting new people, and having wonderful parents. But one night, my dad hit my mom, and our happy world turned upside down. I've realized I have to protect my family from such pain. I'll also never forget a funny incident from my childhood. One day, my brothers had the idea to cut our hair. We chopped each other's hair, but my hair didn't come off until my mom gave me a bath. When she went to get a towel, she saw all my hair in the water, and it looked like a boy's haircut. This happened when I was in first grade. This is the story of a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 sixteen - year - old girl.
204	20968	8	2	"Laughing is the key to happiness. It's a moment that many people cherish and share with friends, family, and sometimes strangers. When you laugh with someone, it shows you have something in common and can strengthen your relationship. For me, laughter means a great deal. One night, my dad and I had an argument about my grades in the kitchen. He thought what was done was done and that I couldn't fix my mistakes. I was extremely mad and wanted him to go away. I thought I'd never talk to him again because of the lack of trust between us. Usually, my dad was the kind of guy who always told jokes and made me laugh, which strengthened our relationship. But this time, our argument was serious. Later that night, when we were with the whole family cutting my niece's cake, my dad and I weren't speaking. As we sang ""Happy Birthday"" and then said ""@CAPS3 you will not believe what just happened"", my uncle accidentally blew out the candle. My dad and I stared at each other and started laughing uncontrollably. We were crying with laughter. It felt great to share this moment and put aside our anger. It was just the two of us who were really laughing hard, while the others just giggled. This incident not only improved my relationship with my dad but also built a stronger connection with my family. Although my dad was still disappointed about my grades, the laughter made it seem less important. It was a memory that would last a lifetime and was an important part of our relationship. Every laughing moment we share now is precious, and it helps us put aside our problems."
205	20971	8	2	"In @DATE1, when our family moved to @LOCATION1, it was a time of exploration, but we also started to miss our life in @LOCATION3 a bit. We missed our friends, our connections, and certain places. The place my brother and I missed the most after our farm was a @CAPS3 we called ""The @CAPS1, @CAPS1 @CAPS3."" It was actually a dump near a dairy farm, smelling of cow pats and cigarettes. The grass was always dry, and the old covered bridge over the @CAPS3 was constantly squeaking and in a dilapidated state. So, it was the happy memories associated with this place that we missed. One particularly gloomy day, our father roused us from our rooms, saying we were going to explore a new @CAPS3. We were familiar with our father's ""adventures"" which we called ""@CAPS4 - ventures"" because they were often strange. Usually, we'd end up far from civilization and stuck in the car with our lunch out of reach, so we were wary of them. However, our mother managed to get my brother and me into the car. During the trip, our father was overly cheerful. While my brother and I were in the back, longing for our comfortable rooms, our father laughed along to the radio and opened the car windows despite our protests. There were two inflated circular rubber lumps in the back with us, which I later learned were inner tubes for floating down the @CAPS3. After what seemed like hours on the road, we arrived at ""@LOCATION2 bend."" My brother and I got out of the car and were greeted by pristine beauty. The @CAPS3 flowed noisily in the shade, and we could hear it even though we weren't close to the bank. The grass was green and soft under our feet, and the smell of fresh water was delightful. The light filtering through the trees gave the water a crystalline look. We quickly changed into our swimsuits, and after our father had carried our food and supplies to the @CAPS3 bank, we chased after him as the water looked cool on a warm day. After eating, it was time to use the inner tubes. The water was fast with some white - water and a small waterfall at the end. As a petite child, these small obstacles seemed like dangerous rapids to me, but I managed to calm myself. At first, I held onto the inner tube tightly, but gradually I relaxed and let my hand trail in the water. As the water got faster and the waterfall approached, I got nervous again. The four - foot waterfall seemed like twelve feet in my panicked state, but I managed to stay afloat and ended up smiling after the ride. My brother came down the waterfall spluttering and giggling, and we laughed together. For the first time since the move, we felt completely at home."
206	20972	8	2	"Falling in love was effortless. I vividly recall the exact moment I fell for you. Everything about you radiated a captivating glow; you were utterly gorgeous in my eyes. We experienced a level of fun that seemed boundless. Whenever we were together, I never once doubted our happiness or worried about you leaving. I couldn't bear to imagine a life without you.  As a child, I was known as the always - smiling kid. When I thought of you, I'd get this warm, visible glow that everyone noticed. They'd ask, ""What have you been doing? You're so happy; I've never seen you like this before."" That happiness they saw in me was the power of love. What they didn't see was the special connection we shared.  When it was just the two of us, one of us would do something, and neither of us could stop laughing. Our stomachs would hurt from laughing so hard. That's what I love; I grew to love every part of you, especially your laugh. They say laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and I wholeheartedly agree. Being able to laugh with someone, to be your true self without a pretense, is truly magical. It's what makes a relationship endure, like glue.  My brother and I are as close as best friends. Guess what we do in our free time? We laugh. I can be silly, dumb, and goofy with him, and he still laughs and loves me. Laughter is wonderful. It's also a stress - reliever, as my health teacher told me. Laughter truly enriches our lives and relationships."
207	20973	8	2	Laughter plays a crucial role in any relationship, whether it's with a relative, friend, or a romantic partner. It has the power to make you forget your troubles. However, in a friendship centered around laughter, there comes a point when you need to shift to seriousness.  Olivia has been my best friend for as long as I can remember. Our friendship was filled with constant laughter. But when we entered middle school, we faced drama, boys, and arguments, things we'd never dealt with before. These issues, though seemingly small, started to drive us apart. Instead of sharing our feelings, we covered them up with laughs, which led to bottled - up anger.  I always thought we were the perfect best - friends because of our numerous inside jokes and the endless fun we had. But our anger kept building up, and we didn't know how to handle it at the time.  We started hanging out less, and our daily calls became weekly. We both noticed the change in our friendship but didn't know how to fix it. We apologized for our fights and sympathized over boy troubles, but it wasn't the same. I missed her, but as time passed, it got easier not to talk or hang out.  Then summer came, and our moms planned for me to stay at her house for a week while my parents were on vacation. I wasn't exactly thrilled. I worried that the week would be full of fighting instead of laughter.  Finally, the day arrived, and my parents drove me to her house. At first, things were okay. We pretended nothing was wrong and had fun for a few days. But on the third day, she broke the ice and asked what was wrong and why we'd stopped talking. That day, we opened up about our feelings and what was bothering us. It was a bit awkward at first, but we got through it together.  After that talk, our fights decreased because we understood each other better. Everything slowly got better than it was before. That conversation changed our relationship forever. I'm so grateful she spoke up when I didn't, or else we wouldn't be as close as we are today. This experience taught me that while laughter is essential in a relationship, sharing feelings and being serious are equally important. Everyone needs a best friend to laugh with, and I'm lucky to have Olivia by my side.
208	20974	8	2	"Laughter is an essential component of relationships. It demonstrates the chemistry between a couple and the happiness within a family or among friends. Without laughter, the world would be like the ""desolate void."" The joyful sound of laughter that strengthens relationships enables you to get to know someone better and shows that you have a kind - hearted nature. When someone has a warm heart, your conscience tells you that you can trust them. The ability to laugh is a valuable asset when meeting new people or spending time with family.  Last [DATE1], my youth group and I went on a missions trip to [ORGANIZATION1] in [LOCATION1]. We were going to hold a [ORGANIZATION2] for a week in the small [CAPS5] town, reaching out to many children. We picked up the children from their homes and drove them to the [ORGANIZATION1] to play games and sing songs.  When meeting each child, it was crucial to give them a warm smile and laugh with them. If we had arrived in the neighborhood with serious expressions in our large white vans, it would have sent a different message. Instead, we decorated our cars with crayon - like markers and jumped out of the vans with big smiles. We rang doorbells and asked parents if their children wanted to come to our [ORGANIZATION2].  We had to remember that these children lived in poverty and had endured a lot. To share the gospel, it was important to show them that we were friendly so they could open up to us and hear about [CAPS6]. When we laughed with the children, their eyes would light up. Many of them just needed love, and we provided it by laughing and joking with them.  Our youth group undoubtedly made a positive change in the children's lives. Our [ORGANIZATION2] was likely one of the highlights of the year for them. In [ORGANIZATION1], the town was flat like a desert, with no playgrounds or places for the children to have fun. [CAPS8] gave us the opportunity to share the gospel and give the children a memorable [DATE1]. [CAPS8] opened the hearts of the [CAPS5] children so they could hear the word of [CAPS8].  We couldn't have reached out to them if we hadn't been friendly. This shows how important it is to laugh with others, whether they are strangers or family. A lack of laughter within a family can be a sign of broken relationships and a loss of closeness. In commercials, families are often shown laughing together at the dinner table or in a restaurant. While not every family is like that all the time, laughter among family members shows unity. Usually, people laugh when they understand and respect each other. A family doesn't have to be blood - related; it can be a youth group, friends, or even a future spouse.  My cousin [PERSON1]'s story of meeting his wife is like a scene from a romantic movie. [PERSON1] was working at a ski resort, waxing skis at the rental check - outs. A brunette in baggy snow pants approached him and said, ""I can go down the biggest hill"" with a flirtatious look. [PERSON1] was confused but mesmerized by her. He replied, ""[CAPS9]."" The girl, [PERSON2], was pleased and asked about his next shift. An hour later, they were having lunch together. It turned out [PERSON2]'s friends had spotted [PERSON1] first and told her he had a great laugh and seemed like a good person. They encouraged her to ask him out.  This story proves how important laughter is. You never know who will hear your laughter and how that person might impact your future. Laughter is a vital part of life. It brings joy, creates opportunities to meet new people, and can change lives. It reflects who you are and transforms the atmosphere around you. After all, we don't want our world to be devoid of laughter."
209	20975	8	2	"Laughter is an integral part of life. It can either bring people closer or drive them apart if used inappropriately. There was a time when I didn't really get along with my cousin [PERSON1], but I had to stay at his house because my mom was out of town. After that night, we became as close as brothers, and there's a hilarious story behind it.  I was really reluctant to go to his house that night. But my mom told me to stop complaining and try to have fun. When I arrived, we watched [LOCATION1] in an awkward silence. Then his parents told us they were going out and wouldn't be home until late.  About ten minutes after they left, [PERSON1] turned to me and said, ""You want to do something really fun."" At thirteen years old, I couldn't help but be intrigued. I asked what it was, and he said it was a surprise.  We left his house, cut through his field, and went through a path in the blackberry bushes to a gravel road that led to a house with a large expanse of land. [PERSON1] told me there were fainting goats on the land. I had no idea what fainting goats were, so he said he'd show me.  He walked up to the goats and made a sudden noise. About a quarter of them fell over, stiff and unmoving. I laughed uncontrollably at the sight of these goats fainting when scared. We spent about forty - five minutes scaring them and watching them faint. Every time we did it, it was just as amusing as the first time.  The funniest part of the night started when [PERSON1] said he'd brought a [NUM1] firework. We put it in the middle of the goats and lit it. The bang was as loud as a gunshot, and all the goats collapsed at once. We laughed so hard that we were doubled over, until the people from the house came outside.  We ran for our lives, through the blackberry path, across the field, and into [PERSON1]'s house. We sat on the couch, looked at each other, and burst out laughing again. My ribs ached, and I was light - headed from laughter. His parents got home a minute after we calmed down, which we also found incredibly funny.  That night was one of the most fun times I've had with my cousin. Despite not liking each other before, we became as close as brothers. Laughter truly has the power to transform relationships."
210	20976	8	2	"Laughter is truly amazing. It's a universal language that doesn't need translation. It has no boundaries. [CAPS5] was the most withdrawn girl in school. She'd hide in the shadows during lunch and in the mornings, wishing to be invisible. When asked what she wanted to be, she'd say ""invisible."" People would pass her by without a second glance, thinking that if they didn't see her, she wasn't there. My heart ached for her because I knew she needed a friend.  I wondered how I could approach her. Would she think I was crazy? I was determined to find a way to make her talk or at least smile.  On [DATE1], as I walked into school, the hallway was as chaotic as ever. Paper airplanes were flying, and people were chatting loudly. I was used to being pushed around on my way to class.  Finally, in fourth period, as I sat down looking for a pencil, I noticed someone sitting down next to me. It was [CAPS5]. I didn't even know she had this class with me, let alone that she'd sit next to me. I was overjoyed, seeing this as my chance.  I noticed a picture on the front of her binder with her signature. I asked if she'd drawn it. ""Yes,"" she said in a soft voice. My heart was pounding. I had to say more. ""I think you're a very good artist. Do you have any other pictures?"" I asked. ""Yes, but they're all at home,"" she replied. ""Can I see them?"" I asked happily. ""If you'd like, you're welcome to come to my house after school and see them,"" she said joyfully. ""I'd be honored,"" I said.  After the conversation, the teacher started the lesson. I thought she was really nice. I couldn't wait for the end of the day.  When school ended, we met in the foyer. I could tell she was excited, and so was I. It was like she was finally gaining confidence, like a baby bird leaving the nest for the first time.  We drove to her house in my truck. I was nervous as we approached the door. When she opened it, I was in awe. The house was beautiful, smelling of fresh - baked cookies with a hint of cinnamon.  Her mother called from another room, ""Is that you, sweetie?"" ""[Mom], I have a friend over,"" [CAPS5] replied. ""How wonderful!"" her mother exclaimed.  We had cookies and milk with her mother and then went to her room. Her room was filled with beautiful drawings, each with a story behind it. She asked if I'd ever drawn. ""No, I'm not good at art,"" I said.  We both started to laugh and then began drawing. When we looked at each other's pictures, we laughed hysterically. ""Your clouds look like potatoes,"" she said, and we laughed even harder.  When I left her house that night, I realized something amazing. It doesn't take much to reach out to someone who needs a friend. A simple compliment and a shared laugh can make a big difference. Laughter is indeed contagious, and it has the power to bring people together."
211	20977	8	2	"Laughter is indeed a powerful force that can bring people closer together and brighten one's life. As the quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" suggests, it is a universal language that everyone on @LOCATION1 can appreciate. Everyone loves to laugh and have a good time, especially when it's with someone they care about. Laughter is an activity that can be easily shared between two people, and it has the ability to strengthen relationships and add joy to one's life.  For some, like myself, finding someone who can make them smile and laugh is a top priority. I believe that in a relationship, arguing should not be the main focus. Having a partner who can bring humor and light - heartedness is a key factor in a fulfilling life.  At the age of sixteen, I met my first boyfriend. I was the kind of girl who was very selective, waiting for the perfect guy. In @DATE2, I met @ORGANIZATION2. Although he was older than me and we seemed to be opposites, he had a knack for making me smile. My first impression of him was his cute smile. After getting to know him better through phone conversations, I realized that I was developing feelings for him. Every time we talked, he would always make me laugh, and I found him extremely attractive.  On @DATE1, there was a football game between @ORGANIZATION1, two rival schools. At that time, we weren't officially dating yet. I invited him to watch the game with me and told him about my love for stuffed animals. That day, he showed up with a fluffy stuffed animal. As we were walking around the track, I suddenly tripped. My nervous laugh was my immediate reaction. He put his arm around me and whispered in my ear, ""I would never let you @DATE3."" I blushed deeply. From that day on, he probably remembers me as the clumsy girl who trips all the time. Looking back, that memory makes me realize how funny it was. In a relationship, looking back at embarrassing moments can be a wonderful thing.  When looking for a life - partner, it's important to accept them for who they are and not expect them to change. The goal is to be able to spend time with someone with whom you can have a great time and share jokes. I often tell my friends that ""Laughter is a great ab workout,"" and it's true because I always have sore abs the next day after a good laugh.  I always look forward to having a good time with friends and laughing about random things. If there's no laughter, it means I'm not having a great time. Fortunately, I have amazing friends who are always cracking jokes. Whenever I'm with them, there's never a dull moment. Being able to make others laugh is also a great quality in a person. When meeting new people, I definitely prefer someone who can make me laugh rather than having an awkward silence. I've had personal experiences of those awkward situations, and I hate them. Even though I'm not the best at telling jokes, I use my embarrassing moments to make people laugh. I don't get mad; instead, I laugh along with them. My goal is to make people smile when they're down. Laughter truly brings people together and makes life more enjoyable."
212	20979	8	2	"My mom always says that laughter is the greatest medicine, and it's definitely true for me. Whenever I'm sick or hurt, a great joke can always make me feel a little better. When my family goes on long trips, we always make jokes and tease each other. Before we know it, the trip doesn't seem long at all. It goes by so fast that we wish it could have been longer.  One night, we were coming home from the store. My brother asked, ""What are we having for dinner tonight?"" My mom replied, ""Hamburgers."" My brother kind of freaked out because we didn't have @ORGANIZATION1's. My mom just said, ""All well."" Then my dad stopped at a small store called @CAPS1, hopped back in the car, and started driving home. My mom said, ""I feel like having Mexican food tonight. Can we eat at @ORGANIZATION2's?"" My dad answered, ""No, I thought we were having hamburgers tonight."" My mom laughed and said, ""We have no @ORGANIZATION1's."" My dad then stopped the car, turned around, and said, ""Why? We don't have @ORGANIZATION1's, but @CAPS2 has some chips at least."" That made us all burst out laughing.  When we got to the place and found a seat, we were all chatting. My sister suddenly said, ""Look, Dad, I can move the straw just by looking at it."" She stared at the straw in the cup, and everyone went silent. I knew it wouldn't move, so I tapped the straw to make it move. She laughed and said, ""Ha, look, it moved."" My mom was trying hard not to laugh because my dad actually thought, for a second, that she could move the straw just by looking at it. My dad then said, ""I can't believe I fell for that.""  After we finished our meal, we went home, laughing and joking all the way. Laughter can bring people together, whether they're family, friends, or even enemies sometimes. I laugh so hard sometimes that I can hardly breathe. Laughter adds fun to life. When you find that other people have the same interests as you, you might just gain a new friend. Just like on that @LOCATION1 trip with my family, everyone was laughing.  One snowy day, I grabbed my phone, gathered the neighbors, my brother, and my sister, and we went to the park. We decided to have a snowball fight mixed with capture the flag. We picked our bases and flags and started the game. We had so much fun that we were laughing so hard it hurt. Before I knew it, I got to know my neighbor better. After that day, we talked to each other more and understood each other better. Next time we have a snowball fight, I hope she'll be on my team, and we'll definitely win. Laughter truly makes life more memorable and enjoyable."
213	20981	8	2	"My cousin @PERSON1 is the funniest person I know. He and I are always having a great time, constantly laughing. What makes him so funny is that he's hilarious even when he's not trying to be.   @PERSON1 is a heavy drinker. Most of the time, he's either drunk or in the process of drinking. When he's sober, he's the most dull, depressed, angry, and unfunny person. But give him a couple of drinks, and he turns into a real fun - loving character, like funtime @CAPS1.  It's truly amazing to see this transformation. When he's sober, he's like a sad, caged, sociopathic lion at the zoo. There are so many judgmental people in society, who point, laugh, and even sob at this poor ""lion."" But when someone throws a beer his way, he catches it with his fierce teeth and devours a @NUM2 oz tallboy of @CAPS2 in seconds, can and all.   After that, he stands up on his large feet (like a feline's paws), and lets out a deep, vibrating purr. His big, fierce teeth then form a smile like a @LOCATION1 lion, and his unkempt, blood - stained fur - like appearance slowly changes into the scaly, scarred skin of a man. Standing there with a goofy grin, he shouts, ""I @CAPS3 @CAPS1 @PERSON1!!""  I've seen this transformation so many times, and I really can't find a single word to describe this incredible change. When he has a drink in his hand, @PERSON1 and I have the most wonderful times, filled with unknown comical amusements.  Laughter is a huge part of our relationship. It's amazing how a simple drink can turn a dull person into a source of so much fun and laughter. This shows that sometimes, a little bit of change in a person's state can bring out their true, fun - loving nature, and laughter can strengthen the bond between two people."
214	20982	8	2	"One day, my friends and I went to a friend's house and started playing @CAPS1 box. We were having an awesome time, laughing non - stop. My friend @CAPS2 started telling jokes, and everyone was laughing hysterically. At that time, my friend @CAPS3 was drinking milk. He laughed so hard that milk started coming out of his nose. It was both funny and gross at the same time.  @CAPS6 was the sad one in the group. We asked him why he was so sad, and he said that he heard his girlfriend wanted to break up with him. We told him to tell her some jokes to make her laugh. He said he'd think about it. @CAPS6 was really funny and a lot of fun to hang out with, so we weren't too worried. We thought everything would be okay.  After that, he left, and we started hanging out in my friend @CAPS7's living room. We were just chatting about who the hottest girl at school was. An hour passed, and @CAPS6 came back. He sat with us and shouted, ""It didn't work, man."" I told him to calm down and asked what happened. He said that his girlfriend didn't think his jokes were funny. She thought he was being dumb and silly. We all laughed when he said she used the word ""silly."" I said I was just joking with him not to get mad.  After he yelled at me, @CAPS6 left. We guys started laughing. I thought he was just hurt and would get over it. An hour later, my phone rang, and it was @CAPS6's ex - girlfriend. I was surprised but answered. I told her @CAPS6 wasn't with us and that I'd tell him to call her later because he usually used my phone to talk to her. But she said she wanted to talk to me. So we started talking, and she said she liked me. I started laughing out loud. She got sad and mad because of my laughter. I told her it was okay and then said I had to go and hung up. I just couldn't stop laughing. That day was full of laughter from start to finish, and it was really a great day."
215	20983	8	2	Laughter plays an extremely crucial role in maintaining relationships, whether it's with an individual or a group. It has multiple beneficial uses, such as relieving tension in high - pressure situations and enabling a more meaningful connection with others. Moreover, it is an excellent way to make new friends.  In my opinion, healthy relationships, be it a friendship or something more profound, are hardly possible without laughter. I use laughter daily for these reasons and many others, and it is a vital element in my relationship with my father's side of the family.  One way I use laughter in my family is to reconnect with relatives I haven't seen in a long time. Laughter is a fundamental part of my relationship with my father's entire family. Whether it's a small family meeting or a full - scale family reunion, laughter is always present.  My father's family members are scattered across @LOCATION2, and only a few live near @LOCATION1. So, visiting them is a rare occasion. The most remarkable thing about this side of the family is that everyone has an innate sense of humor. Laughter is like another form of communication for us, and it's the main reason we get along so well.  For instance, on @DATE1, my sister was pregnant with her first child, and her baby shower was scheduled for @DATE2. This event was a perfect example of how laughter strengthened the relationship between me and one of my family members. I was the only guy at the shower and was seated at a table with my aunt, whom I hadn't seen for over a year. I was dreading an awkward reunion and sitting in silence throughout the event.  On the day of the baby shower, I was surprisingly nervous. I helped with the setup and then found my seat. About ten minutes later, my aunt arrived and took the seat next to me. To my relief, the first thing she did was crack a joke about me being the only guy at the shower. This immediately eased my tension and reminded me why I get along so well with my father's family.  For the whole party, all I heard were jokes from my aunt, and we shared a lot of laughter. We reconnected not only as family members but also as good friends, and it was all thanks to laughter. We had so much fun that we might have been the ones who enjoyed the party the most. Whether we were joking about the party gifts or just having a good time, laughter was the key. On this day and many others, laughter was not just an element but the sole reason for our strong relationship. Laughter truly has the power to bring people closer and make family gatherings memorable.
216	20984	8	2	Laughter has the power to bring about significant changes in people and draw them closer together. It plays a crucial role in relationships, as making someone laugh is always a positive gesture. Whether you're with friends or in a romantic relationship, the ability to share laughter is essential as it fosters a deeper connection. When you're in a group of new friends, laughing together is even better, as it indicates that you're building a bond. My best friend and I share a special connection filled with laughter. We can understand each other with just a look, and this often leads to fits of laughter. Even when we're in a large group of friends and start laughing, our friends may look at us curiously. Usually, we explain what we're laughing about, but they don't always get it. My best friend and I are almost always together, except during school hours. We find humor in things that happened recently or even a long time ago. We have numerous inside jokes, and just the mention of a particular hang - out session can trigger a new round of laughter. In a romantic relationship, making your partner happy and laughing is a great plus. For example, my boyfriend always tries to make me smile, even when I'm in a bad mood, and it usually works. In a relationship, both girls and boys should be understanding. Girls shouldn't get overly upset about trivial matters, and boys shouldn't get angry when their girlfriends want to hang out with their friends. It's important to ensure that your boyfriend and best friend get along. In my case, my best friend is dating my boyfriend's best friend, so we can all hang out without any conflicts. We're even considering planning a trip to the coast. However, it's crucial not to give your entire life to your boyfriend or girlfriend. If the relationship ends, you may lose your friends because you've neglected them. I try to convey this to my boyfriend in a tactful way, and most guys understand that you have your own life. My friend once made her boyfriend the center of her life and was unhappy in the relationship. She was afraid to break up because she thought she'd have no friends left. Laughter is like a healing process. It can make you feel better, and there are many sources of laughter, such as people, videos, and family. When you're with someone who makes you happy, you feel full of joy and comfortable. If you can overcome struggles and still find reasons to laugh with someone, you know they're the right person for you. Family, too, has a way of making you laugh, like my dad, who always knows how to crack me up. In conclusion, laughter is a powerful force that enriches our relationships and our lives.
217	20985	8	2	"One time, I was sitting in the living room with my family, and we were talking about how every holiday, we always end up laughing. One holiday, we were at my great - grandpa's house. After opening our presents, there was a large box in the middle of the floor. My cousin thought my dad was inside the box. At first, we tried to tell my cousin that my dad was outside talking to my uncle. But he didn't believe us, even though my dad was clearly outside. He circled the box, examined it closely, and was convinced that my dad was inside. Then he started poking the box. We found it incredibly cute that he thought my dad was in there, so we couldn't help but laugh. He kept insisting, ""I know he is in there."" Finally, he opened the box, and of course, my dad wasn't there. Just then, my dad walked into the house and asked why we were laughing. We told him the story, and he started laughing too. Later that day, my cousin was playing in another room and wanted to show my dad the toy he was playing with. So, my dad climbed into the box, and we told my cousin that my dad was outside. He went outside to look for him but couldn't find him. When he came back inside, he searched every room but still couldn't locate my dad. After a while, he was standing by the box, and my dad suddenly jumped out, scaring him. My cousin let out a scream like a little girl, and we all burst into laughter. At first, he was mad, but then he started laughing too. He was only five years old at the time, so it's no wonder he got really scared when my dad jumped out. Then, my cousin thought it would be funny to scare my dad. So, he hid in the box. When my dad came inside, we told him to look for my cousin. My dad called his name, searched every room, and pretended he couldn't find him. My cousin started laughing because my dad acted like he was going to sit on him. When my cousin got out of the box, he asked, ""How did you know I was in the box?"" My dad replied, ""Well, you started laughing, silly goose."" Out of all the holidays I've had, that one was the best. It was a time when laughter brought two people - my cousin and my dad - closer together. In conclusion, this holiday memory shows how laughter can create fun and strengthen family bonds."
218	20987	8	2	When starting any kind of relationship, people usually begin by making jokes and being light - hearted. Whether you're trying to be flirty or just make a good first impression, these actions often lead to laughter, even if there isn't a strong reason for it. Shy people around new acquaintances are more likely to laugh at what others say. Laughter is almost always the most important factor in maintaining relationships with different people. In a strong friendship, friends are already very close. The shared experiences of laughing, crying, and even fighting can make the relationship stronger. I've had experiences where I became close friends with someone for a long time, then we had an argument and stopped being friends. But because of the many happy times we spent laughing together, we realized how much we missed each other when we were apart. The sadness of not having someone to laugh with made us reconcile. Although making new friends is easy, these new friendships often don't last as long as the one with the person I had laughed with so much. When you first meet someone, whether it's a boy or a girl, you'll likely spend most of the time laughing and joking. This pattern may continue as you get to know the person. After knowing someone for a while, you can tell what kind of relationship you'll have with them - whether you'll get along or constantly argue. The relationship with an acquaintance usually remains consistent. When you're not very close to someone, you may not care as much about the friendship, but the experiences you share can still lead to laughter. Time spent with others should always be filled with fun and laughter. In a romantic relationship, a special connection is formed. When two people choose to be together, they're exploring a deeper level of understanding. The fun and laughter they share can take their love to a higher level than that of a best - friend relationship. Couples should enjoy their time together, making each other laugh and happy. This shared laughter helps them become more comfortable with each other, gain confidence, and strengthen their friendship. In conclusion, laughter is the key to building and maintaining all types of relationships. The first impression often determines the nature of the connection with an individual. Different people bring out different behaviors in us, but laughter is a universal element that can enhance any relationship.
219	20988	8	2	"Laughter is like a sweet smile, a small piece of happiness, similar to a freshly - baked chocolate chip cookie with oozing chocolate. It can stem from a joke, an awkward situation, or just about anything. Laughter has the power to bond friendships. I'm going to share a true story about how laughter played a role in one of my relationships. It was my first day of high school. I walked into the school, looking down at my shoes. I could feel people staring at me, but I wasn't sure if I should smile back or keep to myself, so I remained silent. I went to the office to ask for directions to my drama class. They gave me a map that I couldn't read and sent me on my way. By then, I was scared. A tall, lanky guy with brown shaggy hair and a flannel jacket bumped into me. Instead of apologizing, he looked at me disgustedly and walked away. After some time, I finally found my drama class. The teacher, Ms. [PERSON1], was not friendly. She was a bit round, with short blond hair, and seemed to hate everyone. She was clearly in a bad mood that day. There was a girl sitting next to me who looked as scared as I felt. During the first few minutes of class, we glanced at each other but didn't say a word. About halfway through the class, she asked my name, and I replied in a very soft voice, ""My name is [CAPS3]."" As I turned away, she whispered to me and chuckled, ""Look at what she's wearing! What are teachers thinking when they get dressed in the morning?"" I started laughing uncontrollably. The teacher shouted, ""You two, go to the hallway now!"" I wasn't sure if I should laugh, but as soon as I stepped out of the door, I grinned and fell to the floor, laughing hysterically. I didn't find getting in trouble funny, but this strict teacher was such a letdown. I thought drama teachers were supposed to be fun and nice. In the next class period, I went to the auditorium and sat near the back, next to [CAPS6]. Ms. [PERSON1] was wearing a green top that looked like it had baby vomit stains, light - blue skinny jeans that didn't suit her, and hot - pink high heels. Today, she was in a good mood, which was evident from her big smile. But when anyone talked, she'd stare at them intensely. It was like getting stung by a bee on a hot day. We all laughed behind her back to get through the class. After a few minutes of talking, she sent us to practice our first scene. My group members included [CAPS6], my friend [CAPS8] whom I'd met in algebra the day before, and a girl named [ORGANIZATION1'montae]. We quickly got to know each other because we all loved to laugh. [ORGANIZATION1'montae] was tall and slender, about [NUM3] inches taller than me, with blond highlights in her bangs. She was extremely pretty. [CAPS8] was a quiet person, about [NUM4] inches shorter than me, with short, straight black hair. She was stylish, wearing a cute brown belt, matching shoes, skinny jeans, and a [CAPS12] jacket. Her whole outfit was adorable. We spent the whole time laughing, making fun of the teacher, and telling jokes. We hardly got any work done, but it was a day I'll never forget. To this day, I'm still good friends with all three of them, and we often talk about that day and how glad we are to have met. In conclusion, laughter has been a significant part of my relationships, helping me make friends and creating wonderful memories."
220	20992	8	2	"Many people write songs and stories about sad and depressing events, as if that's all life is about. We often overlook the little things. If we take the time to appreciate these small joys, we'll realize how much we actually have. Sometimes, we seem to seek pity and compete to have the worst story, but I don't want to be part of that. If we just ""go with the flow,"" life seems more carefree. People prefer to be around those who make them feel good and happy rather than those who bring them down. I've had situations where I could have chosen to be angry and upset, but instead, I chose to laugh and not make a big deal out of small mistakes. For example, on [DATE1], there was supposed to be a [CAPS1] dance. I was supposed to arrive early to help decorate, but I was late as usual. When I got there, I found out the dance was canceled due to a power outage. By then, my parents had already left and didn't have their cell phones. I was stuck at school. While I was trying to find someone to pick me up, two of my friends showed up, even though I'd told them the dance was canceled. My friend's mom kindly came to pick us up. We met the rest of our friends downtown and decided to go to [LOCATION1]'s and play arcade games. We had a great time! We all got matching rings, and I got two lollipops. After that, we went to a friend's house, watched movies, and ate popcorn. I had too much sugar and was extremely hyper, saying random things, but it made for a wonderful evening filled with laughter. We could have been really upset about the canceled dance, but we made the most of the situation and had a better time than the dance would have been. Another example was when I was a freshman. One day was particularly tough. I felt like no one wanted to be my friend or hang out with me. I remember sitting alone in the hall, feeling ignored. A senior came up to me and told me that it's harder to frown than to smile. He was right. Although smiling takes more muscles, frowning has a more negative long - term effect. If I could go back, I wouldn't have been so dramatic. I was making a big deal out of something that wasn't true. I often say things I regret, but if I just accept the situation, it doesn't seem as bad. If I could, I'd write many songs with no sad or depressing meaning and millions of books about the happiest things in life. When you fall down, it's better to laugh than to cry. Many things can make you stronger, like breakups, heartaches, [CAPS2.E] class, and of course, laughter. Laughter also helps you live longer, so there's"
221	20993	8	2	When I was younger, my sister and I used to fight constantly, either verbally or physically. Whatever the cause, our fights would drag on for hours. As time passed, we'd get more upset, and it also frustrated our mom and other family members. The fact that there was only @NUM1 months between us made the situation even tenser. My mom tried several tactics to get us to stop. One was grounding us, but since we shared a room, that only made things worse. Another was giving us chores, which was both time - consuming and annoying. The last one was making us sit cross - legged, face each other, and hold hands. We hated this method. However, every time we did it, we'd end up laughing uncontrollably and forget what we were fighting about. After that, we'd hug each other and move on. Laughter brought us closer and always helped resolve our issues. It's clear that laughter can be a powerful tool in mending relationships, even among siblings.
222	20994	8	2	"Life is full of uncertainty, unfairness, and harshness, but laughter can transform our perception of this cruel world. In our deepest concerns and darkest thoughts, laughter can bring light, like the sun. It is a cure for the sick, a balm for the wounded, and comfort for the elderly. We often take laughter for granted, yet it gives us joy and happiness. Laughter is the light at the end of the tunnel, a flashlight for the lost, and a lifeline for the hopeless; truly, it is the cure for humanity.  Explaining laughter is as difficult as explaining why we breathe; it's simply a part of life. It's natural for people to laugh, though not always at the right time. Laughter can turn dreams into reality, give hope, and dispel uncertainty. It's a friend, a helper, and an ice - breaker, spreading joy and hope wherever it goes. We should cherish every moment of laughter.  Laughter has helped me many times, but one instance stands out. I was slumped in my seat, listening to my sixth - period teacher drone on about unimportant things. I turned around, hoping for a distraction, and met the eyes of a man I'd never spoken to. He looked at me curiously. I took a chance and asked, ""@CAPS1 you watched wrestling?"" He smiled and chuckled. Without that laugh, our conversation would have been completely different. He could have ignored me, but his laugh changed the course of my life. Soon after, he became my boyfriend. That laugh made everything fall into place.  However, we also need to be careful with laughter. I remember a time from my childhood. I was playing with my Barbie, brushing her hair, when my father called me. He knelt down and told me that ""@CAPS3"" was leaving and that I should go with her to make sure everything was okay. I laughed without understanding the situation. By the time we got in the car, I realized how serious it was. Although my laughter didn't hurt anyone else, it made me regret not taking the situation seriously.  Life is unpredictable. Laughter is an emotion that can heal wounds, but it's also a power that we must use wisely. It gives us joy and fun and helps us get back up when we fall. We should respect its power and use it appropriately."
223	20996	8	2	"Laughter is often considered a contagious phenomenon that spreads among people. It should be an integral part of everyone's life during their growing - up years. Here's a true account of how laughter played a significant role in my childhood.  My family has five ""days of laughter"" throughout the year: birthdays, @LOCATION2, the @DATE1 of @DATE1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3.  On my birthday, the whole family gathers at my grandparents' house to celebrate my birth. A few days before, my mom allows me to invite some friends. We might go to an event or the arcade. When we get home, we stay up late playing video games and watching movies.  When @LOCATION2 arrives with its colorful eggs and candy, our family meets at my uncle's house. The adults hide eggs for us kids to find, and we always seem to miss at least one. The parents keep moving the eggs around. We first noticed when my uncle was climbing a willow tree in the backyard to re - hide the eggs. Watching him climb down was quite comical. After the egg - hunting, we play a game of hide - and - seek, which is challenging to win with fourteen people hiding on a one - acre lot.  On the @DATE1, everyone has their own plans. My dad and I go to @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, to light @CAPS6 on the third of @DATE1 for @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6. Before the show, we play laser tag, which often involves around fifty people. On the @DATE1 itself, my dad puts on his own show in the backyard for us kids, which is really exciting.  @CAPS2 is my favorite ""laughing day."" My dad turns his house into a haunted house. We get painted and shot with silly string from hidden places. When we go trick - or - treating, I usually dress up as a soldier with an unloaded @CAPS8 gun and full camouflage, which makes it hard for others to find me. After trick - or - treating, it's a competition to see who gets the most candy, and I usually win because I can stay out longer than my siblings.  Finally, there's @CAPS3, a time for gift - giving and receiving. We all cook a dish, and there's often some food mess in the kitchen. After dinner, we open presents, starting with the youngest. Sometimes, it turns into a free - for - all until the adults intervene. It's funny to watch my cousin getting chased around the house for taking a present.  In conclusion, laughter brings so much joy and relaxation to my life. It also helps build strong family relationships. As my grandparents used to say, ""A laugh a day will keep the @CAPS10 at @LOCATION1."" Laughter truly should be a part of everyone's childhood."
224	20998	8	2	Many people have heard the saying that laughter can extend one's lifespan. I'm not certain if it's true, but I'm inclined to believe it. When I laugh, I feel a sense of lightness, my stress eases, and I view the world from a different perspective. This transformation is especially noticeable when I'm initially overworked, exhausted, or sad.  I firmly believe that having people who can make you laugh is crucial for a fulfilling life. I'm grateful that my days are filled with wonderful friends and funny memories. Humor is an essential element in any relationship; being able to make each other laugh is a must.  I've had numerous occasions with my two best friends, @PERSON1, where we couldn't stop laughing. I cherish every moment we spend together because I always leave with a smile on my face and many great stories to tell. One such memorable event was @PERSON1's birthday party the @DATE1 before last. @PERSON1 wanted a small gathering with only her closest friends, so @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and I were the only invitees.  We live in a small, charming town, but there aren't many party options. So, everyone usually goes to @CAPS1, which is just half an hour away. It was a scorching @DATE1 day, and we wanted to show off our tans. @PERSON1 started the party with a float down the meandering @CAPS2 river. That's when the laughter began. Three twelve - year - old girls floating down the river with a giant beach ball (an early birthday present) named @CAPS3 was quite comical.  One of the things that makes our friendship so special is our ability to find humor in every situation. They found it hilarious that I have an irrational fear of any type of water weed and would yelp or scream when it touched me. I thought it was great that @PERSON1 couldn't hold on to her sandals and would make wild dives for them as they floated away. We also thought @PERSON1's reluctance to get wet was absurd, so we pushed her in the water several times.  Our relationship can be serious when needed, and I won't tolerate anyone disrespecting my friends. But when we're together, I can let my guard down and be my true, goofy self and still have a great time. Laughter can even change the course of a situation.  After our river adventure, we went to @ORGANIZATION1 for music and food. We all got huge ice - cream cones. My friends finished theirs and were playing with @CAPS3 a few yards away. Just as I was about to take another delicious lick of my waffle cone, the @CAPS3 ball flew over and knocked the ice - cream out of my cone. I was left with an empty cone, and I was devastated. But my friends started laughing at my comical expression of disbelief. Their laughter was contagious, and I soon joined in, and everything seemed okay again.  Laughter is the shortest path to connecting with others. My two best friends make me laugh more than anyone else I've ever met, and I doubt I'll ever find others who can make me feel the same way. Laughter helps us relax, be ourselves, and confide in each other. When one of us is down, laughter can lift our spirits. Our relationship grows stronger with every shared laugh, and these good times help us through the bad. In conclusion, laughter is truly invaluable to the three of us.
225	20999	8	2	"Some people think love is what brings people together. But before you love someone, you've likely laughed with them. Laughter starts conversations, fixes relationships, and brings happiness. It's an important part of any relationship and has helped me make friends.  When I was in kindergarten, everything was new. I got to leave home, go to school, have lunch, and go to recess. There were many kids like me, full of excitement as our daily routine began. Although we played together at school, there was no one to play with at home.  One day after school, I saw a boy near my yard. I remembered him from class. I said ""@CAPS2"", and he burped as loud as he could. We laughed so hard, and I knew I'd made a new friend that day. From then on, we were best friends. After - school adventures always ended with us laughing about something. Our parents didn't need to arrange playdates because it was easy to make friends by laughing naturally.  Laughter can ""break the ice"" when meeting new people. It's often hard to start a conversation because you're not sure how to act. But if something makes both of you laugh, it becomes easier to talk as the tension eases. It's like learning to ride a bike; once you get past the initial awkwardness, it gets easier.  Laughter can also help heal pain. Everyone goes through tough times, like break - ups, depression, or the loss of a loved one. Something funny and a laugh can take their mind off their troubles, even if it's just for a few minutes. People build better relationships by trying to make each other feel better.  In short, laughter is simple, fun, and has many benefits. It creates friendships, eases tension, and helps us deal with pain. We should embrace laughter in our lives because it can make our relationships stronger and our lives more enjoyable."
226	21000	8	2	"Many summers ago, I had a sleepover at my best friend @CAPS1's house. We were excited as only @CAPS1's dad was home, with her mom and brother out late. After indulging in popcorn and candy, we decided to try something new and fun. @CAPS1's house has a counter bar that can seat four to five people. Her dad turned on some hip - hop music. As if we were on the same wavelength, @PERSON1 and I jumped on the counter and started doing a runway model walk. We really got into it. It was comical to see @CAPS1's dad pretending to be a photographer, exclaiming ""gorgeous"" like a real pro. @PERSON1 and I strutted, posed, and turned until we got dizzy. We knew we couldn't do this with @CAPS1's mom, which made the whole thing even funnier. We laughed uncontrollably until we were breathless. After the runway fun, we decided to pillow - surf down the stairs. I was initially scared, but seeing @PERSON1's expression, I knew I had to give it a go. I grabbed a big body pillow and surfed down the stairs like a pro. It was an absolute blast! @PERSON1 and I pillow - surfed for what seemed like forever. @CAPS1's dad put on @ORGANIZATION1, and we laughed the rest of the night away. That night was one of the best and most memorable of @CAPS1's childhood."
227	21001	8	2	In my view, laughter is an essential part of life. Without laughter and jokes, the world would be a dull and uninteresting place. I can't even fathom such a scenario. The world and people need laughter, jokes, and comedy in their lives. I have plenty of laughter in my life. One day in fifth - grade gym class, my best friend and I were jogging around the track. It was boring, so we told jokes to pass the time. I told a really great joke (I can't recall what it was), and he started laughing uncontrollably. We laughed so hard we were in tears. He fell on the track and rolled into the grass. I urged him to keep going, or the gym teacher would be angry. He then confessed that he had peed his pants, which made me laugh even more. He went to the gym teacher, who sent him to the nurse's office. After class, I met him in the classroom, and he told me he'd called his mom, who brought him new underwear and pants. I often wonder what his mom thought. That day has always been a topic of conversation between us. I'd jokingly tease him about peeing his pants, but it was all in good fun. Our friendship was built on making each other laugh. Without jokes and laughter, a friendship can be boring. I have another friend, @CAPS2. When we hang out and play video games, there's hardly any communication or fun. It's a dull friendship, and I don't enjoy it much. Laughter is also crucial in a dating relationship. Couples who laugh together have more interesting and enjoyable relationships. No one wants to date a boring person. As these examples show, laughter makes a significant difference in relationships and life. It enriches friendships, makes people happy, and helps them get along. It's like a medicine for a down mood. Without it, relationships can be unfulfilling. Laughter brings people together, and it's something everyone should have in their lives.
228	21002	8	2	"Last year on the first day of school, I entered the school hoping to make a few friends. I wasn't sure how it would happen but was optimistic. In my first class, I sat at a table with unfamiliar faces. I wanted to say something but was afraid of their reactions. The teacher made us play some introduction games, but they didn't ease the tension. Everyone was awkward and quiet. Not knowing anyone made the situation worse. On the second day, I was determined to make friends. I thought about what to say, but all my ideas seemed silly. In humanities class, I sat at a table with a friendly - looking girl. When the teacher told us to introduce ourselves, there was an uncomfortable silence. I reached into my backpack for a pencil and found a note from my mom that said, ""Be yourself and make some friends honey, have a great day at school. :)"". I started laughing at the unexpectedness of it, feeling like a child. When I looked up, I saw the girl was laughing too. I knew I had to say something, so I introduced myself, ""Hi, my names @PERSON1, but you can call me @CAPS4 for short. What's your name?"". The girl smiled and introduced herself as @CAPS8. We started talking, exchanged numbers, and became good friends. A year has passed, and we're still friends. We often laugh about how our friendship began. I recently told her that I was scared to introduce myself on that second day, and she said she felt the same. I'm grateful to my mom for writing that note because without it, I wouldn't have made such a wonderful friend."
229	21003	8	2	"On the first day of high school, I was extremely nervous, feeling like I wanted to hide in the bathroom. I had no friends yet and was too shy to join any groups, so I went to all my classes alone. Students would approach me, asking about my previous school and wanting to know more about me. I just wanted to be left alone. Girls asked if I was upset because I wasn't smiling or having fun. Lunch was more crowded than at my old school. Students ate in the hallways or gathered around large tables, chatting loudly. I chewed on my lip, looking for an empty spot. I found an empty table at the front of the lunchroom and sat down to eat my peanut - butter - and - jelly sandwich. Two boys and two girls rushed over and sat next to me, laughing about not getting the seat next to me. A skinny boy in a black cap introduced himself as @PERSON3 and asked my name. I simply replied, ""@PERSON1"". @LOCATION1 said my name was pretty and introduced everyone at the table. @ORGANIZATION2 wore a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 t - shirt, and @PERSON2 had on a military uniform with @CAPS4 written on it. They all ate school - bought pizza or sub sandwiches and showed funny pictures on their phones. I made a comment about a picture of a boy on a slide that looked like a cheese - grader, saying the boy might get a razor rash. @PERSON3 started flinging pepperoni in the air. @PERSON2 was going to take a picture for an ID when the pepperoni in @LOCATION3's hand slipped and landed on @ORGANIZATION1's face. I burst out laughing, and everyone at the table joined in. @PERSON3 and I were holding our stomachs and wiping away tears. @PERSON4 went to the bathroom to wash his face. When he returned, @PERSON2 showed us the hilarious picture she'd taken. We all laughed and asked her to send it to us. I then asked if I could be their friend. @ORGANIZATION2 teased me, saying that if they didn't want me as a friend, they wouldn't be sitting with me. I was relieved. @PERSON3 said they would have made an excuse to leave if they didn't like me. I laughed at myself for worrying about not fitting in."
230	21004	8	2	Laughter can either be shared among many or used against a few, but ideally, it's a shared experience. It helps people feel more at ease in a relationship. A simple joke can turn strangers into friends who seem like they've known each other for years. While shared hobbies and similar likes and dislikes also help people get to know each other, laughter is usually a vital element in any relationship. I remember when I first met my friend @PERSON1. He wasn't very outgoing, but through joking around, he became more comfortable talking to others. We often talked about the challenges in our daily lives. Instead of complaining, we laughed at how trivial our problems were compared to those of people who work multiple jobs to support their families. A few days later, we discussed our future after high school. @PERSON1 said he wanted to be a taekwondo instructor and that he already had a small job at a taekwondo place. When I asked how he got the job, he replied that he'd kicked a kid in the face while his instructor was watching. We laughed heartily, and that laugh strengthened our friendship. Laughter truly has the power to bring people closer and make relationships more civilized.
231	21005	8	2	Laughter is one of the most crucial aspects of life. People should not go a single day without it. It is beneficial for health and enhances any relationship. Moreover, it can aid in the healing process. The most wonderful type of laughter is when one is out of breath and in tears. It brings immense happiness and makes people crave more. One should not take life overly seriously; instead, laugh and smile constantly.  The death of someone is a tragic event. When two high - school boys die, it is even more heart - wrenching. On [DATE1] at [TIME1], a group of high - school students were walking on the ocean rocks. Suddenly, a sneaker wave swept two of them away. The other students tried desperately to save them by making a rope out of their clothes to reach the boys, but their efforts were in vain. Two precious lives were lost that day and will always be remembered. The boys were well - liked and had promising futures.  The families of the students, the school, friends, and the community were in a state of shock and could not believe the terrible news. How could such a thing happen to such wonderful young men?  The following [DATE2], hundreds of students gathered at the church, most in tears. They spoke about the two boys and held a large group prayer. Friends shared fond memories of them, missing them deeply and recalling the good, fun, and memorable times. Laughter can help ease the pain. As someone once said, smile because they lived, not cry because they're gone.  At the school's basketball game, the boys were honored, and the team won the game in their memory. Parents and friends spoke about the wonderful boys in front of nearly [NUM1] people who came to support the school. The game was a time to have a good time, not to mope. It helped the community heal just a little more. Laughter and cheering truly have the power to soothe the heart.  As days, weeks, and months pass, people will still be heartbroken. However, as long as we laugh and smile about the good times with those who have passed away, we can overcome any hardship. Laughter makes us feel better. It shows that we should make the most of what we have and always have a great time without regrets. Always tell the people who matter to you that you love them. Never stop expressing your love, and never leave in the middle of a fight. You never know when it might be the last time you see them. Laughter is so important; without it, life would not be as fulfilling.
232	21006	8	2	"People can share various things, such as DNA, clothes, feelings, beliefs, religion, and laughter. For my sister [PERSON3] and me, laughter has strengthened our relationship like nothing else. When I was younger, it was the typical dynamic of an older sister and a younger sister; to be honest, we didn't like each other at all.  As we matured and entered high school, and became part of the same cheer - leading organization, we spent a great deal of time together, and now we're like the best of friends. In [DATE3], we were constantly together. We would watch Jerry [PERSON1], laugh at, or make fun of the people on the show. We also watched clips of the show Saturday [TIME1] [CAPS1]. That's where I introduced her to the character ""[CAPS2]"". [PERSON3] and I would talk to each other in the voice we adapted from ""[CAPS2]"" and laugh non - stop about [NUM1] [TIME1]. [CAPS1] is also where we came up with the ""demonic voice"". We would use these voices to talk to each other and our friends, and we still do it on [DATE1].  When we started high school, we had to drive to and from school together every day. We would listen to music, make up random dance moves. Sometimes, when her favorite song came on, I had to steer the car because she was such an energetic dancer. It was all in good fun.  However, once we entered the school, things changed. I understood after about a week that I was the annoying younger sister who couldn't say hi to her in the hall or wave when she was with her friends. She wanted to be left alone so she wouldn't look strange. She was a junior then, and juniors always think they're the coolest. Once she was a senior, she would say hi to me, smile when she saw me, and I even talked to her and her friends sometimes.  Our relationship grew even closer when I joined the student leadership class she was already in. We had the same class every other day, so it was hard not to talk.  The single thing that made our relationship stronger through laughter was the three weeks she stayed in my room. She decided to ""move in"" when she woke up with bug bites on her arms and legs and had no idea where they came from. At first, we thought she just didn't remember getting them the [TIME1] before, but she still got them even when she didn't go out. We found out the cause when her friend [PERSON2] came over; she had bed bugs.  That [TIME1], I separated the two mattresses I sleep on and made her a bed, thinking she'd only stay for two or three nights at most, so my parents could disinfect her room. But it ended up being two or three weeks. We spent almost every hour of every day together during those three weeks. The only time I had to myself was in the shower. We would stay up late, talking about our day, the people we didn't like, the outfits we liked, what we wanted to do in cheer practice, and who could have cheered better.  If you knew [PERSON3], you'd know how easily she gets scared by movies. So, half the time when we stayed up late, I'd try to scare her, and her reactions were really funny.  Even though she's back in her own room now, I don't think things feel the same as before. There are many sayings about laughter, like ""Laughter is the best medicine"", ""Laughter is the shortest distance between people"", and ""[CAPS5] two people in a room, they'll be laughing in [NUM2] minutes"". All these show how laughter can strengthen relationships. I believe my sister and I have the closest relationship because we can laugh at the same things. People say we have the same mind; we do a lot of the same things, think alike, and even wear similar clothes. I'm sure that laughter has made our relationship closer. I bet if you think about your close relationships, the first memory that comes to mind is a happy moment filled with laughter."
233	21007	8	2	"One day, I was going to my friend [ORGANIZATION1] [PERSON1]'s house for her [NUM1] birthday party. I knew it would be a lot of fun, even though it was just going to be [ORGANIZATION1], [CAPS1], and me. But I had no idea it would be as much fun as it turned out to be.  All day, I was waiting for [NUM2] so I could go to her house. I packed all my bags and got everything ready because it was a sleep - over. On my way there, she called me and said, ""Before you get to my house, look to the right.""  On the drive to her house with my dad, I kept my eyes on the right side of the road, but I wasn't sure what I was looking for. As we got closer, I saw something in the bushes. It was [ORGANIZATION1] and [PERSON2]. I told my dad to honk so they'd know I was there. When he did, they both pulled down their pants and mooned us! I laughed so hard that night, and I kept thinking about the look on my dad's face.  Little did I know that wasn't the funniest thing of the night. Later, [ORGANIZATION1], [PERSON2], and I went for a walk to the dock near [LOCATION1]'s house. While we were on the dock, a bat flew by, and [PERSON2] almost fell into the water because she was so scared. [ORGANIZATION1] and I were standing behind her, laughing uncontrollably.  By then, it was getting dark, and her neighbors were being really loud. So, we ran from the dock to her neighbors' house, hid, and started yelling at them to be quiet. It was so funny because they had no idea where the yells were coming from and just kept looking around confused. We laughed so hard that it was hard to be quiet. We had to wait a while for the neighbors to stop looking around.  That wasn't the funniest thing either. As we were walking back to [LOCATION1]'s house, we heard a car coming. We came up with a plan: I stood in the middle of the street, [ORGANIZATION1] stood ahead of me, and [PERSON2] hid in the bushes. The plan was for [ORGANIZATION1] and me to pretend to fight, and [PERSON2] to run out of the bushes and pretend to shoot me.  The car started turning the corner, and [ORGANIZATION1] and I began fake - fighting. As the car got closer, it slowed down, and [PERSON2] ran out of the bushes and [CAPS2]! Pretended to shoot me. I fell to the ground like I was really hurt, trying hard not to laugh. We thought we had fooled the people in the car. But then we realized there was no gunshot sound, so there was no way she had actually shot me.  The people in the car came closer, and we could hear them laughing before we even saw who they were. When they got closer, we realized it was just some of [ORGANIZATION1]'s family friends coming to the party. They knew it was fake the whole time.  When it got darker, we found a huge watermelon and took it to a bridge near [LOCATION1]'s house. We brought her video camera, put it on night - vision, and threw the watermelon off the bridge. When it hit the water, it made a really loud sound and split into many small pieces.  That night was one of the best and funniest nights I've ever had. The next day, the fun continued at the lake. We swung on rope swings into the water. [ORGANIZATION1] got a really bad rope burn, and it was hilarious. [PERSON2], [ORGANIZATION1], and I always have a great time together and lots of laughs. A lot more happened that night. Overall, it was a great [NUM1] birthday for [ORGANIZATION1]. I'm glad I got to be there with her."
234	21008	8	2	We all have experiences that seem like a nuisance at the time but make us laugh when we look back. I remember one such experience during a motorcycle camping trip this [DATE1].  It was a bright and sunny day when my dad dropped me off at the start of the main logging road in the area. I decided to ride at a slow and steady pace to enjoy the beautiful scenery. Later that day, I found a lovely spot by the river to camp for a few nights.  In the [TIME1], I remembered some side roads off the main road from when I'd driven with my brother in these woods. I decided to explore some of them near my camp. I chose to check out one across the river that looked like it would be a fun ride. As I was crossing the river, my front tire hit some loose rocks, and I fell into the water! Thankfully, I fell away from my motorcycle. If I hadn't, it could have fallen on me, which would have been a huge problem since I was alone in the woods.  After getting my [ORGANIZATION1] (presumably the motorcycle) out of the water, I went back to camp to dry my clothes. Since I'd only brought one set, it was necessary. While reading a book and waiting for my clothes to dry, I fell into a deep sleep.  When I woke up, I realized the sun had been up for a while. So, I decided to go for another ride before the day ended. This time, I stayed on my side of the river and took a steep road that led to the top of the ridge. As I climbed, it got warmer. Then, I broke through the woods and saw a magnificent sight: the sun was just rising over the ridge in front of me. I had to stop and soak in the sunshine.  After sitting for a while, I continued my journey. The road started to slope down into a valley. At the bottom, flood waters had covered the road with a large amount of silt, and it was still muddy. As I crossed it, my wheels spun out, flinging mud at me, and I got very dirty. Once again, I headed back to camp to wash my clothes in the river. This time, I had trouble falling asleep, and when I did, it was a fitful sleep.  When I woke up, I packed my few supplies and set out to complete my journey. It took me most of the day to get only halfway to my destination, so I had to stop and rest for the night. Setting up my tent and getting out food for dinner and breakfast in the [TIME1] didn't take long. With little to do, I sat by the fire and thought about my trip and life in general.  I slept soundly until [TIME1]. Waking up to the sound of birds chirping and the river rushing was delightful and energizing. It only took me a few hours to reach the place where my dad was going to pick me up and take me home.  This trip helped me organize my thoughts. It also made me appreciate the little things in life that we often take for granted. Looking back at it always makes me laugh. I realize that my mistakes could have been much worse, but they were just
235	21009	8	2	"Laughter is a natural reaction every human being has when they are either happy or have heard or seen something that is funny to them. It is healthy to be happy other than sad or mad. Laughter is pretty much a sign of happiness, as crying is of sadness. It is just another natural emotion any person is born with. I agree to the quote someone once said about laughter being the closest distance between two people because, if two people get along, they will have many moments in life together where they are happy. It is easy to get along with people who have a good sense of humor as for they won't take everything personally and can understand a joke. Its always good to have a sense of humor because its something everyone appreciates, also, that way people can see that you like to have fun when you know you don't have to be serious. When your with a group of friends that you get along with very well, one of the main things you will hear is laughter. It shows that you get along and that your having a good time.  Of course there are times when its better not to laugh, or when people laugh for no reason, which often gets annoying. Yes laughing means your happy, but when its not needed and is used just to cause noise, it is better to be quiet than annoy everyone around you. In my group of friends we are always laughing and joking around with each other, i like when people have a good sense of humor, i feel more relaxed and its easier to talk to them. Unless, that is, they take everything as a joke and never take anything seriously. Even though it is natural, you have to know when you can and cant laugh. Its a way to show happiness, but in certain situations, it can be disrespectful or rude.  Sometimes when I'm with my friends, they @MONTH1 joke around about a certain person, and once it happened like this;at my friends birthday party, we all went to a bowling alley and as always, were all standing around talking and having a good time. While we were talking, @PERSON3 and @PERSON4 were joking around about something so we all started listening to their conversation. They were joking around about something and then @PERSON3 said something as to turn him down in some way, ask a joke, and @PERSON4 said that hes going to get his heart broken. Right after that was said, @ORGANIZATION1 pitched in, adding again. So it turned out to sound like @PERSON4 was going to have his heart broken again. As everyone laughed at it, @PERSON4 looked at @ORGANIZATION1 with a hurt expression and was the only one not laughing. You see, @PERSON4 had a girlfriend that broke up with him about two months ago, @ORGANIZATION1 forgot about that and didn't mean anything when she added ""again"". She meant it as a joke but it turned out to sound very mean. In this case, the laughter caused by @ORGANIZATION1 was meant for @PERSON4, who was hurt by @ORGANIZATION1's comment. Good thing @ORGANIZATION1 noticed and remembered about @PERSON4's ex later that day. She ended up apologizing for saying something she should have thought through more carefully before saying.  How a person takes it when people laugh at them, has a lot to do with friendship. One time, my friends were driving to a party, or home from a party and were listening to music in the car, one of the guys in the car was singing his heard out to a song by @PERSON1. At one point, while he was singing, his best friend suddenly turned down the volume so everyone in the car heard @PERSON2 sing really loud, with no music. Everyone started laughing because @PERSON2 didn't know that @CAPS1 would turn off the music in the middle of something. Even though it was kind of embarrassing, @PERSON2 laughed along because it was pretty funny. If @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 weren't such good friends, i think for sure @PERSON2 would have gotten mad at @CAPS1 for doing such a thing to him while there where other people in the car aside from just them two. Friends understand each others sense of humor, and know when doing something is going to far, or when the other person will think it's funny too and will laugh along. So as you see, laughter can be happy, thankful, annoying, and or mean, you just have to know when it's okay to do, and when it is better not to laugh. Even though it's a natural reaction, it is one that can be controlled and thought about before doing. Next time someone says something that's funny, first think about if it can be insulting to someone before laughing at it and hurting someone. Otherwise, enjoy life and be happy."
236	21010	8	2	"One day, I decided to visit my friend @PERSON1. When I arrived, we cleaned the pool. Her dad chased me around with a booger on his finger, and I ran away. It was one of the days when @PERSON1 and I laughed more than ever. We started the day lying in her bed, watching a movie on her small @CAPS1. I can't recall the movie, but it didn't matter as we were too busy chatting about random things. After the movie, we went to the living room to watch @CAPS2 bob since @PERSON1's room didn't have cable. At that time, I had a knee injury, so it took me a while to get comfortable on the couch. @PERSON1 sat next to me. About @NUM1 minutes later, her dad came in with a booger on his index finger. He threatened to give me ""booger lip,"" so I got up and tried to run. I knew he'd do it because he had before. Putting pressure on my knee hurt, so I hopped on one leg as fast as I could. I hid in @PERSON1's closet, hearing her laughter and her dad's footsteps. I waited for about @NUM2 minutes and then came out when I thought it was safe. Back in the living room, @PERSON1 and I laughed about the incident. After that, we decided to clean the pool as we wanted to swim, and the pool had been dirty all winter. There were tadpoles, dirt, slimy green stuff, parasites, and who knows what else. We didn't want to throw the tadpoles out, so every time we scooped a bucket of water, we'd take out the tadpoles and put them in a can. Cleaning the pool and saving the tadpoles took about @NUM3 and a half hours. Then we went inside to find pool cleaner and soap but couldn't, so we used shampoo. We poured it on the pool bottom and scrubbed, but it was slow and not fun. So, we had the idea of putting shampoo on our clothes and sliding around. We both slipped about a dozen times. After the pool was clean, we had to scoop out the soap and water again. All this took about @NUM4 hours, but it was really fun, and we laughed a lot. @PERSON1's mom was happy we cleaned the pool when she came home from work. After my grandpa picked me up, @PERSON1 and I said goodbye. I went home and thought it was one of the most fun days of my life. Overall, I laughed more on that day than ever before."
237	21012	8	2	Have you ever felt that there isn't enough time in a day to do everything you want? That's how I feel daily. It's extremely tiring and frustrating, and it all started when I got a job at @ORGANIZATION1. Since then, I've had no time for school, can hardly rest, and my grades have been gradually dropping. I'm always tired, falling asleep in class or too lazy to do my work. I'd like to cut down on my working hours, but I need as much money as possible to help my mom. My mom didn't make much of her life, so she has little to live on. I feel it's my responsibility to assist her. My older brother should have taken on this responsibility, but he got his girlfriend pregnant and moved out to live his own life at a young age. As the second - oldest, I believe it's my duty to take care of my mom. I love my mom deeply. She's always been there for me, unlike my dad. I'll do my best to ensure she's well - off because I don't know what I'd do without her. My little brother is a nuisance. He never helps around the house or assists our mom when she brings groceries. I think I'll have to set him straight. I know mom won't like it, but he needs to stop being lazy and help our mom more. I think I'm a pretty good kid. I'm not a troublemaker, but I could be successful if I did the right things. Sometimes I try, but it feels like I'm trying to be someone else. I'm a loud and hyper kid, the class clown. People often ask me about my college plans, and I always say I'm not college - smart and I'll be lucky to graduate. I'm trying to improve my grades, but it's hard with so much to do outside of school, especially as work will get busier with spring approaching. I'm not sure how I'll manage it all, but I'm pretty sure I can handle it if I try my best. I need to find a better job, one that's less stressful, tiring, and with fewer working days but better pay, like at Jiffy Lube. Anything is better than working at a fast - food place.
238	21013	8	2	I firmly believe that laughter is of great significance. It's crucial to me because, for instance, if a student falls and you laugh at them just for the sake of it, it will surely hurt that student. Instead of laughing, one should be a kind - hearted person, ask if they're okay, and help them up. This shows the student that they have a true friend who cares deeply about them and doesn't laugh at their misfortune. One can also be rewarded for doing good deeds, but for me, it's not about the rewards. It's about the actions I take to assist my peers. We should refrain from laughing inappropriately and maintain a positive attitude. We need to be mature in our actions, words, and reactions, especially when it comes to situations like laughing at others. I also think that if I were to fall and get hurt, and kids started laughing at me, I'd learn the importance of respecting others as I'd like to be respected. Since I don't want people to make fun of me, I shouldn't make fun of others. That's why we should treat our peers with respect. In conclusion, showing respect through our actions and attitudes is the key to building a harmonious and caring environment among peers.
239	21014	8	2	"One day, I was with my friend @PERSON1. We had been friends for a long time. I was in a bad mood that day because my dog, Taco, had run away, and I'd had an argument with my parents. @PERSON1 asked me if I wanted to go for a walk, and I agreed. We were really close friends, and @PERSON1 could always tell when something was wrong, even though I thought I hid my feelings well. As we walked, we passed children playing at the park with their parents and a man playing fetch with his dog. It was a sunny and warm day during the summer. We stood on the bridge for a moment, and then @PERSON1 asked me, ""What's wrong?"" I told him everything that had happened - that my dog had run away and my parents were mad at me. I said I was sad. I don't know why I opened up to him like that since we rarely talked about our personal dramas. We usually just laughed and made jokes. I liked @PERSON1 and hoped he liked me too. We started discussing everything in our lives, including school, friends, and parents. @PERSON1 managed to put me in a better mood. We decided to go to the park and sit at the picnic tables. We sat across from each other and talked for a while. Then it started getting late, and I had to go home. I said, ""Thanks for cheering me up. I really needed to laugh and smile today."" @PERSON1 took my hand and said, ""You should always laugh because you never know who is falling in love with your smile."" Then he kissed me. It's a day I'll remember for a long time. We're still together, and we've been a couple for almost @NUM1 months now."
240	21015	8	2	"When extreme temperatures occur, the situation becomes extremely dangerous. In my experience, the extreme weather was a heatwave. I was eight years old and living in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. It happened in the middle of @DATE1, when an almost record - high temperature hit @LOCATION2. The temperature peaked at one hundred twenty - five degrees @CAPS4, and to make matters worse, the power in our entire neighborhood went out. Without air conditioning, many people got severely sick or injured. We lived in a gated community where everyone got along well. People in the neighborhood gathered, set up tents for shade, and provided cold water. When a situation like this occurs, there are important things to remember. You must have a good attitude because complaining won't help. You should also try not to focus on the heat and help those in need. I believe our community wouldn't have made it through if it weren't for everyone's positive attitude, spirit, and, of course, the laughter. Having a good attitude is crucial in such situations. What's the point of complaining and getting angry for no reason? I was told that it wouldn't last forever and to stay positive. I could tell that kids and adults who were complaining were having a much harder time coping. As an eight - year - old, it was difficult for me not to complain, but with the help of a lot of water, I managed. Keeping your spirits up and interacting with others makes the day pass faster. I remember when my whole family was under one of the tents, sitting around, telling funny stories and jokes. I'd rather have a day like that with my family than a normal, boring one. One of the most important things to do is to not think about the heat. If you don't dwell on it, you'll have a better time and won't complain. Keeping your mind off the topic helps you avoid stress. I saw many people who couldn't handle it. They only talked about how bad it was, and it was obvious they were stressed. If you try to make the situation positive and stop thinking about it, you'll get through it, no matter how bad it is. During this heatwave, many people needed help. The community was very helpful by setting up tents and providing water and snacks. However, the situation worsened as people suffered from heat exhaustion, and many had to be put on @CAPS5's. There were several ambulances to assist people and get them back to normal. Some people had to go to the hospital for further treatment. The community eventually got through the day with no serious injuries. The power came back on around six o'clock. Exhausted, people slowly walked or drove back to their houses. Our family walked home and immediately turned on the air conditioning. Everyone was relieved and happy to be out of that situation. Even at night, the temperature was still one hundred twelve degrees. We played games and told jokes the rest of the night and managed to get through it all. Our family stayed strong during the heatwave, while many others didn't. It truly shows that ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."
241	21016	8	2	Laughter is an immense source of joy in my life. Without it, life would be dull and uneventful. Many of my most cherished experiences involve laughter during enjoyable moments. One of my most memorable instances of laughter was a camping trip with my friends last @DATE2. I'll never forget that adventure.  On a beautiful, sunny @DATE1 @TIME1 in the middle of @DATE2, my @CAPS4 @CAPS1 called me, saying he and @CAPS2 were gathering a group of guys to go camping and invited me to join. I immediately asked my parents for permission, and they agreed on the condition that I submit my job application to @ORGANIZATION1 before leaving. After submitting the application, I got in the car, picked up my @CAPS4 @PERSON3, grabbed the ingredients for peanut - butter and jelly sandwiches, and set off on the journey.  After driving @NUM1 miles up the river, when I reached the destination, I didn't see anyone. There were only two large tents where my friends were supposed to be. Looking around, it was evident that the campsite had been attacked by bears. Trash was scattered everywhere, and the campfire was still burning. I started searching for my friends and found @CAPS1 passed out in one of the tents. I tried to wake him, but he was sound asleep. @PERSON3 and I didn't know what to do, so we sat in the shade of the large trees. It was about @NUM2 degrees outside.  After about five minutes, we heard a splash and went to investigate. We walked towards the river and found all our friends jumping off a @NUM3 - ft rock into the river. We joined in the fun. After each jumping about @NUM4 times, we headed back to the camp. @CAPS1 was awake. When @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @CAPS7, @PERSON3, and I returned to the camp, we huddled around the campfire and told jokes all night.  During that three - day camping trip, we really bonded through laughter and just being ourselves. I cherish those memories deeply. After the camping trip, I returned home and worked for the rest of @DATE2. Since then, I've developed great friendships with all my camping buddies.
242	21017	8	2	On @DATE1, I had my birthday party, and my friends came over. My friend Tree brought his projector and connected his @CAPS1 to it. We played @CAPS2: @CAPS3 on the projector and on my @CAPS4.V. using my @CAPS1. After a while, we got bored and went to the living room to hang out with the girls. Then we had cake, had an icing fight, and played games. We laughed so hard.  After that, we went to the park near our apartment. We played @CAPS6, made jokes, and laughed even more. Then we went back to my place and watched @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @NUM1. We laughed at the people who screamed in the movie. After that, we played spin the bottle/truth or dare and had a great time laughing.  Overall, it was an incredibly fun birthday party filled with laughter and good times with friends. I'll always remember this wonderful day.
243	21020	8	2	Approximately @NUM1 years ago, at the beach in @LOCATION1, I was with my mom and sister. I was running from the incoming waves when I decided to run into one. That wave swept me off my feet and spun me around. It felt like it lasted forever, but it was actually less than @NUM2 seconds. I laughed so hard that I tripped and started spinning again. I couldn't stop laughing, and my mom had to help me up.  I got many cuts from the sand, which I found hilarious. After changing my clothes, I got a big chest that my dad could fit inside.  That experience at the beach is the only time I remember laughter being like a true friend to me. It was a moment of pure joy and a memory that will stay with me forever.
244	21021	8	2	"My @CAPS1 year of high school began less favorably than most. At the end of my eighth - grade year, I discovered that my friends were not as loyal as I thought at the start of our friendship. As a result, I started high school without any friends. However, it wasn't all negative. It was one of the first times in my life that I was able to see things for myself. Of course, I was sad at the time, but looking back, I'm grateful for this period as it helped me get to know myself better.  Since one can't go through life without friends, I quickly tried to fit in with what was considered 'normal'. I had some initial luck, but I was still hurt from being deserted by those I once considered friends. So, I regarded the new people I met as mere acquaintances. Like most acquaintances, we only talked in class and had casual conversations about trivial things.  I wanted'real' friends, but I wasn't sure what a real friend was. I'm not certain if these so - called acquaintances considered me a friend. So, I went through my days with someone to talk to in each class but no one to sit with at lunch.  However, this situation was made a bit better because my sister was still at the high school at that time. Her presence made my life easier as I could confide in her and even have lunch with her. People who have always had friends may not understand, but having nowhere to sit at lunch can be lonely. Fortunately, my sister was always there for me, although she skipped a lot of school. When she wasn't around, I could rely on her friends to keep me company. I found that even if I couldn't find my own friends, I could share my sister's.  This nomadic existence continued until the second trimester of my @CAPS1 year. I had all new classes and felt like it was a new beginning. At first, it seemed the same as the previous trimester. I went to my first few classes and made more acquaintances. But then, in my apparel construction class, after sitting alone for five minutes, two girls walked in and sat at my table. Their conversation caught my attention. I knew it was wrong to listen, but I thought if they didn't want me to hear, they'd speak quietly.  I don't remember the exact topic, but it was hilarious. Even though I didn't participate in the discussion, I couldn't help but laugh. They laughed so hard that tears filled their eyes, and soon my eyes were also filled with tears from laughter. One of the girls looked at me and told her friend to ""look at her, she's laughing so hard at you she's crying!"" I could hardly stop laughing long enough to introduce myself.  Before I knew it, we became close friends. It was the power of laughter that brought us together, turning strangers into best friends."
245	21022	8	2	"I'm going to share a story of smiles, laughter, and love—the story of my @DATE3 and how I changed a girl's life and my own through smiles and laughs. I have three significant memories from my time with her: the first smile, the day at the beach, and the @TIME1 at the @LOCATION4.  It all started on a cool @DATE2 @TIME1 on the back lawn of my grandmother's house overlooking the @ORGANIZATION1 gorge, a perfect spot to watch the fireworks. @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 came to sit with me. @PERSON1 sat on my left, and @CAPS1, my neighbor and lifelong friend, sat on my right. I was curious about @PERSON1—what she was like, where in @LOCATION3 she lived, and how her costumes differed from ours. So, I started asking her questions as we waited for the fireworks. It was obvious that she was very shy. Finally, we got a conversation going about the fireworks that had started. @PERSON1 told us that the fireworks back home in @LOCATION3 were much bigger than ours. Being sarcastic, I said ""@CAPS2 really"". She just smiled. After that, the conversation between me and @PERSON1 flowed more freely, and it was a wonderful evening.  About @DATE1, for the second memory, @PERSON1 and I were good friends, and she had lost her shyness. We went to the beach on the @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION1. It was getting hot, a perfect day for the beach. We unpacked our towels and other beach stuff. Soon, @PERSON1, @CAPS1 (@PERSON1's host sister), @CAPS4 (@CAPS1's boyfriend), and I were in the water. In a flirty mood, I started splashing @PERSON1, who was near @CAPS1. This led to a big splash war where everyone splashed each other. Everyone was laughing and having a great time. The war stopped when no one wanted water in their face anymore. After that, I tried to lift @PERSON1 up underwater and drop her, but I only caught her right leg. It just led to more laughter. It was a great, wet day at the beach.  My third memory is the @TIME1 at the @LOCATION4. We had just finished dinner, and it was @PERSON1's @TIME1 in @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. By then, we were practically boyfriend - girlfriend. It was getting dark at @LOCATION2 @LOCATION4 when we arrived for Movies in the @LOCATION4. @TIME1 at the @CAPS7 was playing. I found a good spot and laid out the blanket. As we waited for the movie to start, I had a flashback of all the laughs that had brought us close. I realized that I was going to miss her more than anyone before. As the sun was setting over the valley, I leaned in and kissed her, and she kissed back. Afterward, we laughed and cried because she was leaving early the next morning, and we were in love.  We didn't want the movie to end, but it did. As I drove her back to her host family's house, we talked about the amazing @DATE3 we had shared, filled with smiles and laughs. I smiled and laughed a lot during that @DATE3, and it brought us very close. @PERSON1 and I still talk almost every day. It's difficult, but I've never felt as close to anyone as I do to her. I'll always cherish the memories of that @DATE3, the @DATE2 of @DATE2, the day at the beach, and @PERSON1's @TIME1 @TIME1 in @LOCATION1. I hope you enjoyed this story, and I hope you can have an amazing @DATE3 like I did."
246	21023	8	2	Summertime is the most anticipated season for teenagers. During this period, the temperatures soar, we can stay outdoors longer, and it is when we create indelible childhood memories. There is never a dull moment in summer. Everyone tends to gather and engage in exciting and crazy activities. @CAPS2, @LOCATION1, and I were at home with nothing to do. As we felt hungry and had no car, we decided to walk to the nearest place to @LOCATION1's house, which was @ORGANIZATION1 at that time. We left @ORGANIZATION1 around ten o'clock and started wandering around, looking for something interesting. We texted @CAPS1 and learned that he was with @PERSON1. So, we all agreed to hang out at @ORGANIZATION2's house. However, we had no idea where he lived, so they told us to meet them at the skate park. By then, it was quite dark, and we were still on the move. When we reached the park, it was already late. @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 arrived a few minutes later, and we began walking towards @ORGANIZATION2's house. @PERSON1 has the most mischievous cat I've ever encountered. @CAPS1 had told me numerous stories and shown me videos about this cat. When we got there, the cat was extremely hyperactive, and @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, and I were terrified of it. We didn't want it anywhere near us as we feared it would attack us, and it did so several times. @PERSON1 was using a laser pointer to make the cat chase it, while we sat there, still bored. They rummaged through our purses and found our bathing suits since we had been to the beach earlier. This gave them the idea of going fishing at one in the @TIME1. We all piled into the car and headed for the dike. We arrived wearing tank tops and short shorts, and it was freezing. We huddled together for warmth. We couldn't see the ground clearly and kept tripping over small holes and tree trunks. Eventually, we reached a dilapidated dock that seemed on the verge of breaking and sinking. @PERSON1 grabbed his @CAPS3 fishing pole and walked to the edge of the dock. There was no way the rest of us could stand on it without causing it to break. We took many pictures and had a great time watching @PERSON1 try to fish and @CAPS1 being his usual self. In conclusion, we managed to find something to do despite having no initial plans. When people learn to appreciate the little things, they can enjoy life to the fullest. That night was one of the most memorable of that @DATE1.
247	21024	8	2	When I was about ten years old, I was at the park with my grandma. I decided to put my head through the monkey bars. My grandma went to the bathroom, and I got stuck. The kids at the park found it amusing and laughed at me, which made me extremely embarrassed. After I managed to free my head, I told the other kids to try putting their heads through the monkey bars too. They did, and they all got stuck. What they didn't know was that I had practiced putting my head through the bars so that it wouldn't get stuck. I laughed uncontrollably at what I had done. When my grandma returned, I asked if we could go home. The next day, we went back to the park. I used the same trick on some different kids. I couldn't understand why they would try the same thing when they saw my head was stuck. These kids told their parents what I had done, and their parents informed my grandma. As a result, I got into a lot of trouble and was grounded for about two weeks. However, the next time I went to the park, I did the same thing again. This just goes to show that kids will always be kids and are prone to such playful and sometimes mischievous behavior.
248	21025	8	2	Friendship and laughter are inseparable. My best friend, @CAPS4, and I would spend hours on her bed, laughing about nothing. Our stories, which might seem silly to others, were hilarious to us. We would stay up all night watching sad movies and laugh at each other when we caught one another crying. However, all of this changed after a major fight. We had had disagreements before, but nothing like this. I knew that the decision I was about to make would end our friendship and take away all our shared laughter. But I couldn't let her actions go unchallenged. So, I said goodbye. @CAPS4 and I have known each other since we were two and have been inseparable ever since. We loved spending time together. But then, I was told that she had been spreading lies about a boy and me. I was deeply hurt and disappointed. Instead of asking her about it, I ended the friendship. I convinced myself that the rumors were true, although something inside me told me it wasn't her. I ignored that feeling and moved on. Ending the friendship was one of the hardest things I've ever done. At school, it was difficult to stay mad at her because we had the same friends and shared a few classes. I constantly had to remind myself that we were no longer friends. I missed talking to her, so one day, I said hello. After that, we talked non - stop, and it was as if nothing had happened. However, one thing was missing: the laughter. Since then, we've grown closer again. We haven't discussed the fight, but we can now occasionally laugh at something one of us says, though it's not the same as before. I never thought we would be able to talk again, let alone be friends. A few weeks later, we both signed up for a youth camp. During the camp, I learned the truth. We talked about the whole incident and agreed that the fight was both our faults. I was at fault for not wanting to know the truth, and she was at fault for not trying hard enough to show me the truth. During our conversation, we shed some tears and, for the first time in about four months, truly laughed together. The tension between us vanished, like a heavy burden being lifted. We apologized to each other and then went to dinner, laughing throughout the meal. I now realize that I can't take laughter for granted. It's an essential part of life, and we laugh the most when we're with the people we love. Sam and I are still working on our relationship, but we're on the path to being closer than ever. We laugh all the time and never have a dull moment. We've decided to work hard to avoid another fight. We've come to understand that friendship and the laughter within it are two of the most important things in life. I love my best friend deeply and cherish the laughter we share. I'll make sure we laugh as much as possible every day and never take our friendship for granted again.
249	21026	8	2	Laughter is truly the key to a great experience. It was freezing and dark outside, and the walk home seemed endless. However, the laughter in the air made the journey seem shorter and faster. Cars passed by and stared at us, but we just laughed more because we knew we were acting foolishly, and we didn't care at all. The strange voices we made, the crazy @CAPS1 dance moves, and our facial expressions were incredibly funny to us. Stupid things often turn out to be the most amusing. I believe that laughing more can strengthen friendships and make life more fulfilling. @PERSON2 and I were dreading the walk home from @PERSON1. It seemed like it would take two hours, even though it was only about ten minutes from my house. We walked slowly, constantly thinking about how long the walk would be. The cars passed us without staring at first, and it was quiet until I had an idea to make the walk more bearable. I remembered a voice my god - brother @CAPS2, who is younger than me but has a voice like @CAPS3, would always use. It always made people smile and was very entertaining. I decided to give it a try. Before we were even halfway home, I started yelling random words at cars in a dark, scary, and controlling voice. Then, I had the idea to sing in that deep, creepy voice. This was a bad idea because @PERSON2 started dancing, and the cars began to stare at us. @PERSON2 is my tall, thin best friend. She loves piercings and doesn't care what others think of her. I didn't care either because people knew we were weird. Watching @PERSON2 dance to my voice was the funniest thing I've ever seen. But it got even funnier when she wanted to try the voice. When she spoke in that voice, I burst out laughing and fell to the floor. After about ten minutes, we were almost at my house, and our stomachs felt like they would burst from all the laughter. I thought to myself that the walk seemed to take only two minutes. I realized that if we could find something to do during the walk, time would pass more quickly. When we walked into my house, my mom asked if we had been dancing on the @NUM1. We just looked at each other and laughed, telling her she had no idea how much fun we had. Laughter is what brings people closer. It doesn't matter if we look foolish because the most important thing is building a relationship and having a good time. Whether it's friends getting to know each other or a couple having fun, laughter is an essential part of life. We should always cherish the laughter we share with the people we love.
250	21028	8	2	"In the @DATE1, a group of friends, including @PERSON5@NUM1, @PERSON1@NUM2, @PERSON2@NUM3, and @PERSON4@NUM4, often looked for adventures. Around late @DATE2, on a hot day, @PERSON5 came up with the idea of going cliff - diving at @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, which he called the ""cliffs"". The whole group got together and took an hour - long car ride to @LOCATION2. Once they arrived, it got even hotter, and they were eager to cool off. They parked the car and walked along the train tracks. As they got closer to their destination, they could hear the voices of other people more clearly. The spot was a secluded area with a rocky floor. People were getting a running start to jump off the highest peak into the water below. @PERSON5 and @PERSON1 were eager to join in right away, while @PERSON4 and @PERSON2 were more hesitant. After @PERSON1 and @PERSON5 had a few jumps, @PERSON4 and @PERSON2 decided to give it a try, but not from the highest peak. They chose to start from the bottom of the cliff. Before they jumped, they noticed a small beach on the other side of the creek. They discussed it with the boys, and they all decided to jump at the same time and swim to the beach. Although they jumped from different heights, they all reached the beach around the same time. @PERSON5 had a harder time swimming that far, but @PERSON4 stayed by his side to help him. After relaxing for a while, they realized they were hungry but were too lazy to swim back, climb the rocks, and walk back to the car. However, hunger prevailed. As they swam back, climbed the rocks, gathered their belongings, and headed back, they started thinking about where to eat. @PERSON1 suggested going through @CAPS2, and @PERSON4 shouted out ""@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1!"" So, the decision was made. On the way back, they changed drivers and seating arrangements. When they reached @CAPS2, they stopped at @ORGANIZATION1 to fill their stomachs. They also stopped at @PERSON5's work, @ORGANIZATION3, to say hello to his friends. @PERSON4, who is @PERSON5's girlfriend, had a bit of showing off to do. After saying hello, they went back to @LOCATION1's house where the cars were parked. @PERSON4 and @PERSON5 decided to take a shower, @PERSON1 wanted to play video games, and @PERSON2 went home to shower and get ready to meet up with the group again. A few hours later, they all went to their hang - out spot, ""the spot"". They invited @PERSON6@NUM3 and @PERSON3@NUM7. As the sun set and it got colder, they made a campfire. @PERSON1, @PERSON3, @PERSON6, and @PERSON2 sat around the fire in chairs, while @PERSON4 and @PERSON5 rode around the campsite on a quad. One particular ride was memorable. @PERSON2 wanted to give @PERSON4 a ride. @PERSON5 got off, and @PERSON2 got on. @PERSON4 wrapped her arms around @PERSON2's waist, and they took off. There was a log on the trail, and usually, the driver could maneuver around it. This time, @PERSON2 hesitated, and @PERSON4 took over and hit the gas. They went over the log, and the quad rolled over. @PERSON4, who wasn't very heavy, flew off, and @PERSON2 got her foot caught under the handle. @PERSON4 managed to lift the quad off @PERSON2's foot. She called the boys, and they came to save them. @PERSON5 flipped the quad over and drove it back. This memory will always be a part of the group's shared experiences, even if the group's dynamics may change over time."
251	21029	8	2	I just woke up when I heard a sort of laughing noise from downstairs. I went down and saw my manager, @PERSON2, laughing with @PERSON1, one of my staff members. She drove @PERSON2, @PERSON3, and me to the airport for our flight to @LOCATION1. I was scared because my dad, Jack, died in a plane crash. But I decided to focus on the trip instead. When we landed, it was the most fun part of the journey. The bumps on the @CAPS2 were extremely bumpy. After we found our luggage, we took the shuttle to the hotel. We paid for the shuttle and headed to our hotel rooms. (I laughed when @LOCATION2 spilled soda on his shirt.) Since we only had two - day park hopper tickets, we stayed at the hotel on the first day. For dinner, we had food from a restaurant called Chubby's. It was the nastiest food I've ever had. The fries were cold, the meat wasn't fully cooked, and there was no ice in our soda. The next day, I got ready. I wore a polo shirt, sunglasses, shorts, and low - cut Converse shoes. I thought I looked really fashionable. @CAPS4 (laugh out loud).
252	21030	8	2	"As a child, I moved with my family from @LOCATION5 to @LOCATION4. We settled in the small town of @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, and have lived there for @NUM1 years. Over the years, we've faced many difficult times, but as a family, we always managed to overcome them by laughing together. The past year has been especially challenging. I believe we wouldn't have coped if we hadn't used laughter to get through this tragic period. When we moved to @LOCATION1, my @CAPS2 stayed in @LOCATION5 because he was ill and didn't think he could survive the journey. Last year, we finally convinced him to move up here with the rest of the family. He moved in with us and shared my bedroom. It was tough as he snored and made strange noises in his sleep, but I was glad he was with us. When I woke up tired from lack of sleep, I'd think about the funny noises and laugh. Six months ago, my @CAPS2 was diagnosed with a brain tumor. The doctors could do nothing, and they told us he only had a few weeks to live. We were devastated, and I couldn't stop crying. When we asked @CAPS2 what he wanted to do, he said, ""Stop looking so gloomy. Let's have some fun!"" That was so like him. He said we were going on a trip to @LOCATION2 so he could visit @LOCATION3 before he passed away. I couldn't help laughing at his crazy idea. Sure enough, when I got home from school on @DATE1, @CAPS2 told us we had ten minutes to grab our things and get in the van. He had rented a @NUM2 - passenger van so everyone in the family could go. We just stared at him. He laughed and said, ""@CAPS3 it or you're staying behind!"" I laughed too and rushed inside to pack. It was the best trip of my life. @CAPS2 told us all sorts of crazy stories from his childhood. Mom wrote some down so we'd always remember. When we reached @LOCATION3, we went on every ride in the park. @CAPS2's favorite was @ORGANIZATION1. He wasn't supposed to ride it due to his condition, but he laughed and said, ""I'm sure it won't kill me."" @CAPS4 though it made me sad, I still laughed because he was so happy. Two months after we got home, @CAPS2 passed away. @CAPS4 though it's been hard and I've cried often, I can't help but laugh when I recall that trip and the fun we had. @CAPS2 taught me that laughter can transform any difficult situation."
253	21031	8	2	I've been dating my new boyfriend for almost @NUM1 months. On @DATE1, it'll be a year. We have a great time together. We talk about everything. We don't really ride bikes or jog, but we've just started working out together. My parents love him and call him their son - in - law. I think it's kind of cute. On New Year's Eve, we hung out with one of Joe's friends, Randy. We did the usual things like having a BBQ. Around @TIME1, we decided to go to bed. Randy didn't know we'd stay the night, and neither did I, but we did. Randy owns a hotel near Grayback. Since there were no extra beds at his house, we asked if we could use a hotel room, and he said yes. The next day, we paid him a little money. When we entered the hotel room, it had a big hot - tub and a king - size bed. I jumped on the bed, and it was amazing. @CAPS1 put on a pair of shorts, and I put on my bathing suit. We got in the hot - tub and had a blast. When I tried to get out, I slipped but managed to catch myself. I was so glad I didn't fall. Then @CAPS1 got out and did the same thing. It was kind of funny. Me and @CAPS1 were really hungry, and all we had was a bag of chips and some cheese dip. When @CAPS1 ate a chip, he made a funny noise like Chewbacca from Star Wars. It was the best time. We decided to watch satellite TV. I don't have it at home, so we usually watch DVDs or VHS tapes. We brought the @NUM2 with us. We were in the room playing a game called Metal of Honor, a war - like game with lots of guns. We had the TV volume up, but I didn't think it was that loud. After about @NUM3 to @NUM4 minutes, there was a knock on the door. It was the neighbor, asking if everything was okay because he heard loud noises and gunshots. We said it was just a game and apologized. We turned the TV down and played for about @NUM5 hours. By the time we went to bed, it was @NUM6 in the morning. I was so tired the next day and had to go to school. We woke up, took a shower, and went back to Randy's house. We had breakfast, probably biscuits and gravy. It was delicious. After breakfast, we went home and ate more. Around @NUM7, we decided to take a nap and slept until the next day. @CAPS1 and I woke up at @NUM8 and couldn't fall asleep, so we played video games for about @NUM9 hours. Then I had to get ready for school. I went to my dad's house, took a shower, got dressed in my school clothes, brushed my hair and teeth, gathered my stuff, and relaxed. Around @NUM10, I went to the bus stop. When I realized no one was there, I went back home. @CAPS1 was laughing and told me it was @DATE2 and I didn't have school. I was shocked. It was the best New Year's ever. I hope to have another one like this. If we're still together on my birthday, I hope we'll have just as much fun. @CAPS1 has treated me so well, and I appreciate him and all he does for me. I hope we'll be together for a long time.
254	21032	8	2	"My great - grandmother once told me that laughing adds an extra five years to your life. She's currently @NUM1 years old. Laughter can bring a new dimension to relationships, whether between friends, family members, or something more. It's an essential element. Sometimes, laughter breaks down the barrier between acquaintances and friends, and that's how I met one of my good friends. During the orientation for incoming @CAPS11 at high school, we participated in a traditional ""name game."" We were lined up facing each other. In this game, we had to shake hands, share our names, and an interesting fact about ourselves. Everyone found it ridiculous and embarrassing, but we laughed it off. A new feeling filled the room, and the uneasiness disappeared because of laughter. It broke the barrier and allowed us to open up. It's true that ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Many of my best friendships were formed through laughter. When I joined the cross - country team, the team was like one big family. We shared clothes, water, and even watches, and we shared a lot of laughs. Running and laughing at the same time is not easy! My best memory was our ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9."" About a week before districts, the eighteen - member team met at @LOCATION1's house. The @CAPS10 brought snack foods, the @CAPS11 brought drinks, the @CAPS12 brought candy, and the @CAPS13 all contributed to buy the ""main ingredient."" The first part of the @CAPS8 was okay, but we were all waiting for midnight. When it struck, we were @CAPS9. The ""main ingredient"" was toilet paper, and we were going @CAPS9 on a tee - pee raid. First, we ""forked"" the coach's lawn. The coach had an odd obsession with @CAPS14, so some of the @CAPS7 photoshopped his head onto the bodies of lawn @CAPS14. It was so clever that I couldn't help laughing. After that, we went to tee - pee one of the team members' houses. But the dad was waiting. Then we went to the other brothers' house. We parked four houses away, turned off the radios and headlights. We started throwing toilet paper at the big tree, but we were really bad at it. Suddenly, three figures on skateboards with toilet paper came at us, yelling, ""@CAPS15! Get back here you forgot something!"" We were ambushed. We sprinted back to the cars. As we drove away, something hit the car. @ORGANIZATION1 stopped the car, and we got out to check. A deep voice yelled, ""@CAPS16 get your toilet paper!"" We were terrified. Fortunately, it was just @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @LOCATION2. The whole group burst into laughter, and I laughed so hard that I cried. Laughter brought nearly twenty of us together. When the district season ended, we were sad to see it go, especially since it was the @CAPS13's last season. But the great times and the bonds we formed will always be remembered."
255	21033	8	2	"How many true friends do you have, and what kind of relationships do you share with others? I'm in high school and don't have many friends, but I have a few. One of my friends is friends with someone I really like. I didn't know this at first. In my freshman year, I went to the church with some friends. An @NUM1 grader fell into the pond. I wasn't sure if @CAPS1 was okay, so I went up to him. Me: ""Are you okay? Do you need help?"" @CAPS1: ""Yeah, I just sprained my ankle."" Me: ""Okay, see you later."" Him: ""Later. Thanks for asking."" Me: ""Sure, no problem!"" The next year, when I was a sophomore, I was surprised to find that @CAPS1 (whose name is @CAPS11) was a freshman. I started hanging out with him more because he was funny and sweet. We went to the @CAPS12 ball together. Other friends were there, and I was worried about some things, especially that my ex might be there. But @CAPS11 helped me. I didn't know how to dance, and I didn't realize I was dancing until @CAPS1 told me. After dancing with him, I asked if I could dance with one of our friends, and @CAPS1 said yes. So, I danced with @PERSON1, and @CAPS1 was there when I needed him. We went outside and I called @CAPS13 @CAPS14 to pick us up. While waiting, we laughed at each other's jokes. For example, @CAPS1 pretended something in his hand was a wand and said the school building had turned into a gingerbread house. About a week ago, I snuck up behind him and scared him. We both laughed because he usually doesn't get scared easily. He said he'd get me back, and I'm a bit worried. @CAPS11 is really helpful when I need him. Laughter is important in life, whether you're upset or not. In my family, we like to prank each other. For example, my sister left her half - finished soda in the room where I was. My dad and I had the same idea of putting a little mustard in it. When she came back and drank it, she asked who did it. My family and I laughed. I think if it happened to me, I'd react the same way. Not all laughter is the same. It's better not to prank people close to your heart because they might get mad. My sister was mad at me, but it was my dad's idea."
256	21034	8	2	On the day of @DATE1, I turned @NUM1 years old. My best friend and I were at home. I called him to see what he had planned for that nice sunny day, but he had nothing in mind. We spent @NUM2 hours trying to think of something, but with no luck. I called him again, and we met at a grade school. We sat on a bench and started calling people, but no one answered their phones.  It was about @NUM3 pm when we stopped trying to make plans. My friend asked if I wanted to go get something to eat, and I agreed since we'd had no luck all @DATE2 @TIME1. It was the @DATE2 of the @DATE3, and school was starting on @DATE4.  As we walked to a fast - food restaurant, we noticed a flier about @ORGANIZATION1 on a familiar - sounding street. My friend asked if I wanted to go check it out. We followed the directions to a well - known street. From a distance, we heard music. After walking about a mile, we saw a good friend. He said he was going to pick up lights for @ORGANIZATION1. When I asked who was there, he told me to see for myself.  We turned the corner and saw @ORGANIZATION1. At the door, we saw another friend. We told him we'd been bored all day at my place, and he said it didn't matter as we were there now. We walked in and saw everyone we'd called on @DATE5 and more. They shouted @CAPS5 @CAPS1 at me. I was shocked that the @ORGANIZATION1 was for me and that I'd accidentally ended up at my own party.  I later found out it was planned from the start. The flier by the restaurant was placed there on purpose, and my friend had been part of this scheme to get me to the @ORGANIZATION1. Everyone had ignored our calls to lead me to the party. I thanked everyone, especially my friend. We all had a great laugh. The @CAPS8!
257	21035	8	2	"My @CAPS1, a friend, and I were driving to pick up a mutual friend for youth group one night. Our conversation was unremarkable. We were mostly sharing stories of past fun with our old friend and looking forward to new memories. She was an amazing person, always ready with a joke, eager to make new friends, and have a good time. Her smile was cute, and she could persuade anyone to do anything.  When we arrived at her house, we were excited to see her again. It had been weeks since our last get - together. She walked out of her front door and came to the car. Her smile showed she was as happy to be reunited as we were. We got out and received big hugs from her. Memories of our past fun flashed through my mind, and I hoped for many more.  We got in the car and drove off. I realized we were going the wrong way. I asked @CAPS1, ""@CAPS1, we have to go back the other way, don't we?"" She replied, ""@CAPS2, but the barrier in the middle of the road won't let me make a @CAPS3 turn until up the street a little ways."" I asked, ""@CAPS4, is that even legal?"" knowing the answer was no. She said sarcastically, ""@CAPS5, I don't really have a choice now do I @CAPS6?"" I knew she was joking.  When the barrier ended, she prepared to make the @CAPS3 turn. She turned the wheel, barely clearing the barrier but hitting the curb on the other side. She accidentally backed up onto the curb, and we in the back seat were jolted. We all laughed because she was usually a careful driver. She said, ""@CAPS8 everybody."" Her body language showed she was having fun but also sorry for the jolt. We just laughed. She said, ""@CAPS5, I guess that's our fun for the month,"" with a sparkle in her eye.  She pulled forward, and the back fender scraped the curb again. As we drove away, we were still laughing, replaying the incident in our minds. It became one of our fondest memories, a joke that could make us laugh just by being mentioned. When we got out of the car, my friends said, ""@CAPS10 for the ride @PERSON1."" We walked into youth group, laughing, knowing this would be a cherished memory that brought us closer."
258	21036	8	2	My best friend @CAPS1 and I have known each other since we were two. We've supported each other through good and bad times, like chocolate on a bad day. @CAPS1's best quality is her ability to make me laugh, no matter my mood.  This year, @CAPS1 decided to go to @ORGANIZATION4's, an all - girls @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1, instead of going to @ORGANIZATION1 with me. On the first day of @ORGANIZATION2, I felt something was missing: @CAPS1. Without her laugh in the hallways, it was oddly quiet. It made me think of our little brick @CAPS3 church, where we had many funny memories and were often told to be quiet.  Most @DATE1's, I helped the priest on the altar, and @CAPS1 was in the pews. One @DATE1 I'll never forget, @CAPS1 sat in the front row with my family and made faces at me during the mass. She has the power to make anyone laugh just by smiling. When she made faces, I usually ended up with tears in my eyes. I was standing in front of the congregation, using all my self - control not to laugh. The congregation probably thought I was deeply moved by the @CAPS8 because I had a big smile.  It's hard to stop laughing in such situations. I had to bite my lip, think of sad things, or do breathing exercises. Every time I looked at @CAPS1, I got a new wave of giggles, and when I looked at my mom, her angry look got stronger. After what seemed like forever, the choir sang the closing hymn. Once we left the church, I couldn't stop laughing for at least ten minutes. I'd bitten my lip so hard there were marks inside my mouth.  After church, we usually went to the @ORGANIZATION3 for coffee and doughnuts. We caught up on @ORGANIZATION2 and each other's lives since we didn't see each other as often. She told me about her new friends, and I told her about our old ones. I always looked forward to her funny stories and shared the latest gossip from her hometown.  Laughter keeps @CAPS1 and me close. If laughter adds years to life, we'll probably be the two old ladies on the hill with twenty cats. I can be myself around her, and I know she accepts me. When I laugh with her, it feels like liquid gold in my stomach and the world is at peace. That's the feeling I have when I'm with my best friend @CAPS1.
259	21037	8	2	"Shafts of light filter through fogged windows, casting a shadowy glare on the table. A large sign on a wide oak shelf bordering the dining area reads ""@CAPS1's"" in large letters covered in decades of dust. My eyes wander among the mismatched antiques and statues that fill every corner of the room. These unique objects belong to the restaurant.  Huge posters of All - @CAPS2 athletes stand beside @NUM1 - inch flat screens, and an acrid smell of molded wood and fermented beer lingers. Many bras hang from the ceiling of the bar next to the entrance. The sound of crunching peanut shells fills the air as waitresses walk over them. This is what sets the place apart. The floor is covered with barrels of @TIME1's broken shells and mashed peanuts, as it's customary for customers to throw them on the ground.  My family, a group of five, squeezes into a booth meant for four. We fit in well with the crowd, dressed in our '@DATE1 @CAPS3' skirts and dress suits. I'm distracted by the menu, looking for something flavorful and high - calorie.  A loud noise breaks my concentration. Across the table sits my grandmother, a petite @NUM2 - inch - tall old lady who tries stand - up comedy in her free time. I watch her pound a ketchup jar on a peanut. The shell cracks, and she picks out the nut, sweeping the kernels onto the floor. I laugh to myself, surprised at how far she'll go. She repeats the process with ten more peanuts until the whole family stops to watch.  She pauses, holding the jar, and says, ""@CAPS4? I'm just trying new ways to crack the nut."" With no response, we go back to choosing our meals.  A while later, a heavy waitress with a strong smell of perfume and a hangover sets down glasses of water and leaves slowly. @CAPS5 raises his glass and motions for us to follow. ""@CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 says, clinking our glasses. ""@CAPS6! And @CAPS6 @CAPS15 cherry people!"" my grandmother adds. I shout, ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10!"" My parents chuckle because my grandmother's jokes are usually not funny.  My brother once called her jokes the ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10"" because she acts like a comedian but isn't. Despite this, she keeps trying. She then asks, ""@CAPS16's noon. So are we having breakfast or lunch? Or should we have..brunch?! I'm dying here, just laugh."" For a moment, we stare at her. Then, we all start laughing. I give my mother a napkin to wipe her happy tears. My father pounds the table in hysterics. I laugh so hard my stomach hurts.  My grandmother is delighted that her joke finally got a real reaction. Other customers in the surrounding booths look at us with distaste, but this isn't the first time our family has caused a scene. Our family's silly jokes are part of our lasting memories. After the meal, we leave the restaurant still giggling. Laughter is a connection, and every ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10"" from my grandmother is worth it."
260	21038	8	2	"A long time ago, my family and I went to @LOCATION1 to visit my great aunt and uncle. They had a log cabin by the lake with an @CAPS1 tepee in the backyard. There was a dock with a big and nice boat. I went with my @CAPS2, another aunt, and my two half - sisters. I don't remember why we went, but I think it was because it was the @DATE2 and my great aunt and uncle were getting older.  I was very young, so I only remember bits and pieces of the trip. I remember watching cartoons with my sister on the couch, watching ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4"" in our bedroom. My sisters made me watch my first scary movie (I hate scary movies). I went to a go - cart track and drove for the first time. I took a small boat on the lake with an older half - sister and also went on the big boat with my great uncle. He would drive in circles so we could jump on the waves and have more fun.  When the @DATE1 came around, illegal fireworks were being sold everywhere in the state. I remember sitting in the car with my two half - sisters while my @CAPS2 got out to buy fireworks from a roadside stand. We were all tired, so we stayed in the car.  Outside the stand was a blow - up balloon guy, the kind that has a face and keeps moving and dancing. My oldest half - sister said, ""@CAPS5 look there he goes doing the macarana!"" I didn't understand until she pointed at the balloon guy wiggling and springing to life. Then my other half - sister joined in and said, ""@CAPS6 now he's doing the mash potato!"" I started laughing because it was so silly and funny. I really thought he was dancing all these dance moves.  Everyone in the car was laughing and giggling. We were naming all sorts of silly dance moves and random things. We shouted, ""THE @CAPS8!"", ""THE @CAPS9 @CAPS10!"", ""THE @CAPS11!"", ""THE @CAPS12!"" We couldn't stop laughing. When my @CAPS2 got in the car, she asked, ""@CAPS13!? @CAPS13 happened?!"" I tried to explain, but she didn't get it. You had to be there to understand how funny it was."
261	21039	8	2	"Laughter holds significant importance in everyone's life as it offers numerous benefits. Recalling my past, laughter has been a great help in overcoming emotional issues related to my ex - boyfriends. One day, after my ex broke up with me and I was in tears, my mom told me that ""laughter was the best medicine"". At that time, I didn't understand her words, but as I grew older, I realized that being sad over such a thing was useless. I was too young to cry over a simple crush and should live life to the fullest.  Laughter is not only relevant in romantic relationships but also crucial for maintaining healthy friendships. It serves as an expression of one's inner feelings. Even when I don't feel like laughing, I do it to show that I'm a strong and independent girl who can take care of herself. I also try to make those around me laugh during our hang - outs, as these moments create the best memories.  A simple laugh or smile can have a remarkable impact on someone's mood. Sometimes, a person can make another smile just by laughing at the simplest things. However, there are people who fake laugh. They laugh not because they find you funny but because they think you're acting dumb. It's often difficult to distinguish between real and fake people, as many fake laugh to pretend they like you when they don't. I believe this is foolish because you may end up thinking they're your friends while they laugh behind your back. But I don't let such people affect me as they're not worth my time.  Making the people I care about smile and have a good time makes me happy. It makes me feel that I've made a difference in their day. Although I can't change their lives, I can at least make their days a bit easier by making them laugh. My three - month - old sister is always laughing for no apparent reason. Her laughter makes me laugh too, and it brightens my day. It shows that a simple smile or laugh can truly make a difference.  My mom knows I sometimes have bad days at school, so she tries to make me laugh. When I laugh, I forget about all my problems. However, laughing at others' pain is wrong and not funny. In conclusion, laughter can be both good and bad, depending on the person laughing."
262	21042	8	2	I firmly believe that laughter plays a vital role in any relationship. Who doesn't enjoy a good laugh from time to time? I certainly do. Let me share my true story about the relationship between my @NUM1 - year - old toddler daughter and me. I'll explain why I think laughter is important, how it impacts relationships, and the benefits it brings to anyone's relationships.  My relationship with @PERSON1 is filled with mixed emotions that are constantly changing. There are times of complete happiness and admiration, as well as moments of anger, frustration, and stress. Despite these feelings, I love her with all my heart. When I'm extremely stressed and on the verge of screaming, she'll say something funny or make an adorable face. It's impossible not to smile and laugh, and in that brief moment, all the difficulties fade away.  The cold, angry, and hurtful people in the world rarely laugh. They isolate themselves and struggle to form good relationships. We all need laughter to avoid depression and sadness. If we're always frowning and stressed, we won't have the opportunity to focus on the good things and just laugh.  When @PERSON1 does something that makes me laugh, she laughs too, and our moods improve. She knows I love her, and she knows exactly how to make me smile. I just want to pick her up and hug her tightly. At the end of the day, when we reflect on the events, whether good or bad, laughing is often the best response. It makes the whole day worthwhile.  Laughter doesn't have to come from children; it can be present in any relationship. For example, in a long - term relationship with a boyfriend, laughter is essential. How can one claim to love someone and be with them all the time but never laugh together? A relationship can't be truly good without laughter, especially with someone you love and are constantly around. The good in life should outweigh the bad, so more laughter is better.  As a teen mom, parenting is extremely stressful. But when my daughter makes me smile, I forget about my stresses for a moment, and everything seems better. Let me give an example of how laughter made a difference in my day and even my week. There are days when nothing goes right, and we're arguing with family or friends, feeling miserable. We don't laugh or have any fun. Then, on the weekend, I find a babysitter and hang out with friends. We start sharing old memories, both good and bad. Eventually, we come across a story that makes us burst into laughter. We laugh for hours (though it's only @NUM3 minutes), and we laugh so hard that we cry. Our stomachs hurt, but we feel great.  In conclusion, laughter has the power to turn sadness into happiness and make us forget about stress. It makes life worth living, and every relationship should have a dose of it.
263	21043	8	2	"@LOCATION2 is a place that @CAPS1 desires to visit. Traveling is enjoyable, and it's even more exciting to travel with loved ones. However, sometimes we end up traveling with people we don't know well. Every two years, the choir at my @ORGANIZATION1 gets the opportunity to go on a trip. During these trips, students can work with college professors, eat a lot of junk food, get away from their parents, and have a great time together. It's an experience that every @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 dreams of.  At the beginning of my @CAPS3 year at @ORGANIZATION1, the choir director announced that we would be going to @LOCATION2. I was excited but also nervous. I'm an introvert, and I didn't have many friends in the choir. Moreover, I have a disability that prevents me from walking, and I was worried about being left behind in a store because I couldn't open doors or being unable to cross a street corner without a @CAPS5 dip. I was so scared of being separated from @PERSON3, my only friend in the choir, that I almost didn't go. But my mother convinced me that everything would be okay.  When we arrived in @LOCATION2, we split into groups. Some wanted to explore the @PERSON7, and others wanted to go up @ORGANIZATION2 street, one of the windiest roads in the world. My worst fear came true when I was separated from @LOCATION3. I tried to reassure myself that the chaperons wouldn't leave me behind, but I was still worried. Somehow, I got on the bus that was taking me away from @LOCATION3. A girl named @PERSON4 sat next to me and tried to start a conversation. It was a long and uncomfortable bus ride.  When we reached the bottom of @ORGANIZATION2 street, we split again. One group would walk up the steep hill, and the other would take an old trolley to the top and then walk down the less - steep part. I had to take the trolley because of my disability. Several other kids, including @PERSON4, were in my group. After getting lost and taking wrong turns, we found the trolley station and bought tickets. I managed to avoid talking to @PERSON4, and the ride up the hill was pleasant. The locals smiled at us as we were excited to ride the trolley. We saw houses, stores, and @LOCATION1 during the ride.  At the top of the hill, two kids, @PERSON6 and @PERSON5, needed to use the restroom, so one of the chaperons went with them. This left me with @PERSON4 and @PERSON1, the remaining chaperon. As we walked down the hill, @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 talked a lot. They occasionally asked me questions, and I answered briefly. When we passed a group of arguing men in front of a store, one of them shouted, ""@CAPS4, @CAPS5 @CAPS6! Whatcha doing? You goin' to your @CAPS7's house?"" We didn't know who he was talking to, but as we reached the end of the block, @PERSON4 and I started laughing. We realized he was talking about me. On the rest of the way down the hill, we came up with funny responses, and we got to know each other better. We found out that we had many things in common, like loving musicals, reading, and having annoying younger brothers. Since then, @PERSON4 and I have become good friends, all because of that shared moment of laughter."
264	21044	8	2	"I'm convinced that laughter has the power to bring people together. In my friendships, we often laugh about the random and silly things that happen in our daily lives. Laughter is an essential part of any friendship or relationship.  A significant example of how laughter helped me was during fourth grade. That year was full of ups and downs that none of us anticipated. My friends and I had a huge fight over a small issue related to my favorite sport, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. The fight involved my best friend @PERSON2, my neighbor @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. We were all very close until this fight. @PERSON4 sided with @PERSON2, leaving me alone. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 didn't take sides; they just wanted us to get along. It was especially hard for @DATE2 and me because we were best friends and did everything together. The other students in our class were shocked by our fight.  @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 tried to hang out with both of us, but @LOCATION1 and I felt that they were neglecting us. Eventually, our teacher and student teacher informed our parents about the fight. I remember that almost every day, someone would go home crying. Our parents had a meeting with the teachers and the principal to figure out how to help us. They decided that @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I would see a counselor, while @PERSON3 was excused. Our teacher announced this to the whole class. As @PERSON1 recalls, ""That was the first time, in a long time, you and @PERSON2 actually talked!"" I don't remember talking, but change was starting to happen.  When we went to the counselor, she was very kind and made us feel comfortable. She asked us what we missed most about our friendship, and we all answered ""laughing"". We said that we used to laugh every day, but now we went home crying. She also asked if we liked to play games together, and we said yes. She let us play games like Monopoly, which was really fun. At the end of the session, we went back to class smiling and laughing, much to the surprise of our classmates.  After school, my mom asked me how the counseling session went, and I told her we had a great time. The next day, we went back to the counselor, played more games, and wrote a paper about how the fight had changed us. When we read the papers to each other, we all had the same message: we wished the fight had never happened, we missed the laughter, and we would laugh about this fight in the future.  To a large extent, this message is true. @DATE1, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and I are still best friends. We often tell this story to others and laugh every time. Our friends are either shocked that we had a fight or laugh at how silly the fight was. When they ask about the moral of the story, we simply say, ""Don't let small things ruin your friendship and remember to laugh about the good times."" Laughter about this silly fight has brought us closer and kept our friendship strong. Now, we have even more things to laugh about.  In every friendship, there are ups and downs, and laughter or crying accompanies them. In the end, laughter is the key to making a friendship stronger. We should never miss an opportunity to laugh with our friends and should always embrace change in our relationships. Our friends will be with us throughout life, and laughter will keep our bond alive."
265	21045	8	2	Laughter has always been an integral part of my life. When one laughs, it means they're having fun, and having fun puts a person in a good mood. In my friendships, when my friends and I have arguments or disagreements, laughter can act as a mediator. It can make a bad situation a bit more bearable. Moreover, laughter has significant health benefits, such as working out the core and lungs.  My best friend @PERSON1's mom, @CAPS2, passed away right before @CAPS1. She was like a second mother to me. I had known her for @NUM1 years, and for a short period, I even lived at her house. Since I don't live with my birth mother, she was a mother figure to me. I used to see her almost every day because of my friend @PERSON1, who is @NUM2 and with whom I hang out daily.  I remember the morning when @PERSON1 called me to tell me that his mom was found dead on the floor of her bedroom. I rushed to his house as soon as I saw the ambulance lights. My friend @PERSON2 was at @PERSON1's house when his mom died. When I arrived, @PERSON1 immediately started crying on my shoulder. It wasn't appropriate to try to make him laugh at that moment because nothing seems funny when a loved one passes away.  As time passed, @PERSON2 and I thought of ways to cheer up @LOCATION1. We wanted to distract him from the loss of his mother. We found that laughter was the best way to do this. I'm known as the jokester in our group of friends, and I can make people laugh without much thought.
266	21049	8	2	"At the start of my freshman year, I first heard about the sport @CAPS2 @CAPS1. I was intrigued but hesitant. In eighth grade, I played volleyball for fun and enjoyed it, so I initially planned to join the high - school volleyball team. However, once in high school, I realized the high - school volleyball environment, including the people and attitudes, wouldn't allow me to have fun. So, I started considering joining the @CAPS2 @CAPS1 team and eventually signed up.  On the first day of practice, after school, I went to the girls' locker room, changed, and headed to the track shed. There, I saw many unfamiliar faces, except for some classmates and my best friend. Coach @PERSON1 talked to the new members, saying it was a great experience and more of an individual sport, though we also did team activities. After the talk, we jogged a warm - up lap, stretched as a team, and then started our run. The daily workouts varied between road runs and track workouts.  At first, I was extremely sore, but as the season progressed, I got into shape and looked forward to practice. I was nervous about my first race, having no idea what to expect. But after running it, I felt good and proud of myself.  Since my freshman year, I've loved @CAPS2 @CAPS1. One of my favorite races was ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6"". I ran it in my freshman year, around the third or fourth race of the season. It was exciting as it was the first time we'd done it in a couple of years. Everyone said it would be thrilling, and it was. After the race, my team and I had a great time, enjoying each other's company.  My freshman year was the best for @CAPS2 @CAPS1. Laughter was a big part of our team. It helped us bond, and without it, our team wouldn't have been as happy or excited. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 has been a source of joy for me ever since I started running."
267	21051	8	2	It's quite odd how people have different ways of doing just about anything. One of the most noticeable differences I've seen is in laughter. There's the polite laugh when you don't understand your boss's joke, and the laugh at an inappropriate time. One of my favorite types of laughter is when you're crying and your best friend makes you laugh.  A few weeks ago, on the train, I saw a lady sobbing about her recent breakup. Her friend comforted her and then mentioned how gross her ex - boyfriend was when he ate, comparing him to a cow eating grass. The crying girl blushed and started giggling. Her eyes were still red, but a slow smile spread across her face. It was clear she'd be okay because she had someone to make her laugh and remind her that life is more than just a guy.  I've had similar experiences with my best friend. Even after seven years, it never gets old when we burst out laughing, often at something stupid when we're thinking alike. Sometimes, one of us is upset, and the other knows just what to say.  Friendship is like this, and laughter is the cure for any problem. After watching those two women, I saw a teenage boy and girl on the train. The girl was nervous, smoothing her skirt, and the boy was fidgety, shaking his knee. When the train jolted and the boy spilled water on his pants, they both started laughing. The boy's deep laugh echoed, and the girl's was contagious. This broke the ice, and they started chatting. It could be the start of young love.  The train stopped, and I got off. Outside, I sat on a bench and watched the teenage couple holding hands. Suddenly, someone covered my eyes. It was my dad, smiling widely. I laughed, a high - pitched laugh muffled in his coat. This kind of laughter, just from pure happiness, makes all the bad things go away, even if only for a little while.
268	21052	8	2	Everyone knows how to laugh, and we've all laughed at least once in our lives. But I laughed harder than ever one day when my friend @CAPS1 and I were waiting for our friends @LOCATION1, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3 to pick up @PERSON3 from @LOCATION3 and come hang out.  @PERSON1 came to my house. Since my @CAPS3 had a cold, we went to the garage (or shop) to wait. When @NUM1 finally arrived, we went straight to the shop to find something to do. @PERSON1 suggested we just sit and talk, which I was fine with as long as it was fun and didn't involve going out late at night.  We talked about many things, and then the topic of TV commercials came up. I told her my favorite were the old freecreditreport.com commercials because they had real - life situations that were both believable and hard to believe. @CAPS1 said her favorite was a car commercial with dancing hamsters. She even started dancing in the garage while describing it, which was both funny and a bit disturbing.  @PERSON1 is a great friend, even if she's a bit goofy. After her dancing, I wanted to be full of energy. I went to the kitchen and had some sugar to get hyper. Time flew by, and before we knew it, @PERSON2, @LOCATION1, and @PERSON3 were there.  @PERSON3 got out of the car and hugged everyone. We all had a great time. @CAPS1 showed her dance to everyone, and we all laughed hard. Having @CAPS1 as a friend is a blessing. I'm lucky to have her, and I'm glad I had the courage to say hi to her in art class.
269	21053	8	2	My life is filled with laughter. I can't recall a day without it, even during the toughest times around @DATE1. There was always someone or a reason to make me laugh. I believe laughter is the best medicine. If there's someone who can go a day without laughing, I'd like to change that.  One memorable laughing moment was when my parents showed me a picture of myself as a little girl. It was @DATE2, and I was sitting on a sled, facing uphill, shirtless and in shorts, with the sun shining. My family and I laughed uncontrollably just looking at that picture.  Another moment was when I was about six @DATE1 old at my best friend's house. Her family had eight llamas, and I always walked one named @CAPS1. One @DATE2 day, @CAPS1 dragged me across a busy highway. People were yelling for me to let go of the lead, but I was afraid the llama would get hit by a car or not come back. An adult finally helped me, and I was all scraped up. Looking back, I always laugh at this incident but never forget it.  My favorite laughter - filled times are when I'm with my boyfriend. Our first trip to the beach was amazing. We tried to ride bikes on the sand, failed, and just laughed. Then we walked around the beach stores. Later, we tried to take pictures of each other jumping in the air with the ocean behind us. People thought we were crazy, but we had fun and laughed almost the whole time.  Laughter is an important part of daily life. Looking back at old pictures, having memories with friends and their animals, and spending time with my boyfriend are all great sources of laughter. It lifts me up when I'm down.
270	21054	8	2	Laughter is essential. It's frustrating when you can't make someone laugh, and it seems almost impossible to be so upset that you can't even smile. There's always something to laugh at in every situation, sometimes it just takes a bit of thinking.  Last @DATE1, I was babysitting on a nice, sunny day. We all wanted chocolate frostys from @ORGANIZATION1. Since I couldn't legally drive non - family members, we called my sister, @PERSON2. She had the day off, so it seemed perfect for frostys.  We waited a long time for @PERSON2 to arrive. Finally, she pulled into the driveway, and the kids were excited. The four of us got in the back of her car and went to @ORGANIZATION1. When we got out, I noticed something was wrong. @PERSON2 had locked the keys in the running car with the keys in the ignition!  I asked her about it, and she said she'd locked the keys too and told me not to close the door. But it was too late; I'd already closed it. The kids were laughing so hard they were rolling on the ground, and I didn't understand why at first. Then I realized how stupid the situation was.  We were stuck in the @LOCATION2 parking lot with three kids, outside a running car. Our first idea was to call my mom for the spare keys, but we didn't know where they were. My mom didn't have them, so we called my dad. He laughed at us first and then said the keys were in his truck, but he was about to go into a meeting.  We called my mom back, and she agreed to go get the keys, though she wasn't happy about leaving work. She told us to go inside @ORGANIZATION1 and get our frostys. The kids were role - playing the incident and found it hilarious. @PERSON2 and I watched and started laughing too.  We sat there for almost two hours until my mom showed up with the keys. It turned out the keys were at home, not in my dad's truck. The kids still laugh about this adventure. It makes me realize that kids bring so much laughter and happiness to the world. Everyone needs a little laughter, even on the worst days. Laughter truly is the best thing.
271	21055	8	2	Laughter plays a significant role in building friendships, relationships, and partnerships. People are born with the ability to laugh, and it is the first skill one acquires. For me, laughter is the starting point of a friendship. If I can make someone laugh, we become closer than when we first greeted each other. For instance, when I started working at the current daycare, getting the other teachers to laugh was a sign that they accepted me as part of the team. On my first day, I entered the daycare nervously and was sent to the preschool classroom. My boss seemed to notice my nervousness, which made me laugh and feel welcome, as if we could be friends. The children in the class also made me laugh with their actions. When working with children, if you can make them laugh or laugh at their jokes, they are more likely to trust you, and you can make them feel comfortable around you. Gaining someone's trust can be difficult, but once you have it from the start, it's easy to maintain yet also easy to lose. When someone is down, simply making them laugh can improve the situation. Laughter is like medicine, making you feel better when nothing else can. I naturally have the ability to make people laugh, and jokes come easily to me. Laughing is not only beneficial for the mood but also a form of exercise. When I'm at work and the kids laugh, it makes me feel better, even on the worst days. Being around happy people makes me feel better about myself. It's even more delightful when babies laugh because they are so adorable. In conclusion, laughter is a powerful force that can enhance our social connections and well - being.
272	21056	8	2	On @DATE1, laughter filled the air as I and my family visited the house of our @CAPS2, the @CAPS5, on an @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Their home, located on eighty forested and meadowed acres outside a quaint old town, had a small green house overlooking brown fields and a blue pond, with tall trees in the backdrop. We arrived mid - morning. Sometimes we found our @CAPS2 in the house, and other times they came tromping out of the woods, shovels and chainsaws in hand, to greet us. After the usual pleasantries, we wandered around the yard, admiring the new fruit trees and listening to stories about the birdhouse tenants. During the hottest part of the @CAPS4, we headed to the shade of the lush @ORGANIZATION1 woods. A short walk led us to a trail. I loved walking among the sun - streaked ferns and fallen logs, carefully crossing rickety bridges over burbling streams, and bouncing on the sturdy new ones while avoiding the dogs splashing in the water. @PERSON2, who knew all about the local flora and fauna, provided a constant stream of knowledge during the hike. He also talked about the trees he'd planted, like the well - growing redwood and the struggling douglas fir. One of the highlights was seeing the dead - end section of the trail my family helped build three years ago. We always walked to the end and discussed its potential extensions. After the hike, we returned to the house, sweaty and chatty. Then it was time to put on swimsuits and jump in the pond. The new dock they built was a great improvement. We swam for most of the @TIME1, racing and splashing. Finally, tired, we sat by the pond to dry off in the warm sun. By @TIME1, dinner was ready. Laura usually made salmon with delicious side dishes. We dragged chairs to the hill above the pond and enjoyed a leisurely supper, watching turtles, birds, and bugs. After the meal, we sat on the porch until @TIME2. @PERSON2's favorite part was at dusk when the bugs created a swirling tornado in the sky. These days with this wonderful family are filled with friendship and comradery. The parents knew each other long before we kids were born, and we always have much to talk about. @PERSON2 is interested in science and always shares the latest articles. We laugh constantly, and I often get hiccups. Even on serious topics, someone can find a joke. And let's not forget the @DATE1 camping trips, winter ski trips, and autumn cider - pressing we do. In conclusion, these @DATE1 traditions are a source of great joy and connection.
273	21057	8	2	As I glanced over and saw @CAPS7 give me a nasty look, I thought, “What the heck is her problem?” Clearly, @CAPS27 thought the new girl, @CAPS3, was weird. @CAPS7 had a killer look in her eyes. My cousin, @PERSON1, asked, “What's up?” while staring at @CAPS3. I glanced at @CAPS3 and then back at @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 whispered, “Come on! She can't hear us.” But @PERSON1's whispers weren't very quiet, and @CAPS3 could probably hear us. When I looked at her again, I noticed that behind those cold eyes, she seemed lonely and sad. It's possible, as she's been the talk of the whole @NUM1 grade class since she arrived about @NUM2 days ago. @PERSON1 was now in my face, saying, “Hello! Taylor? Are you there?” I said, “She may look tough on the outside, but maybe she's actually a nice person.” But I knew this wouldn't satisfy @PERSON1. @PERSON1 replied, “Definitely not. Her parents probably belong to a mafia. She gives off that aura.” I responded, “We shouldn't judge someone by their looks.” @PERSON1 gave me a confusing look. I added, “We never know unless we ask.” @PERSON1 challenged me, “If you're such an expert, why don't you go sit with her at lunch and ask her?” I thought it was impossible. Even though I said not to judge by appearance, she looked so intimidating. I was in a predicament. @PERSON1 kept pushing, “Aren't you the one who wants to get to know her? Then ask.” I knew I had to give in. It was now @NUM3 in the morning, and lunch was at @NUM4. I couldn't focus in class, imagining possible scenarios at lunch. Maybe she wasn't mean, and people, including me, were misunderstanding her. But I didn't know what to say. I couldn't just casually walk up and greet her. As the time passed, @PERSON1 said, “@NUM6 minutes.” I sighed. @PERSON1 laughed and said, “I kept watching you. You looked like you'd jump out the window.” I said, “I have no clue what I'm going to say.” @PERSON1 advised, “Say something that won't offend her. Ask about her hobbies or what she likes. Talk about school.” Then it was time. After getting my lunch, I walked towards @CAPS3's table. No one was around her. I asked, “Can I sit here?” My voice was shaky. She smiled and said, “By all means, go ahead.” She was really cute when she smiled. I sat down and started a conversation by introducing myself and asking how she was and how she liked the school. To my surprise, we shared a common interest and bonded. We laughed together. After that day, and even now, we are the best of friends. Laughter and taking the initiative to get to know someone can break down barriers and form wonderful friendships.
274	21058	8	2	It is widely believed that laughter can bring people together, and I wholeheartedly agree. Everyone has laughed at some point in their lives, whether alone or in a group. Laughter holds different meanings for different people. For me, it can signify happiness or a way to cope when I'm unsure of what to do. One cold and rainy @DATE1 day in @DATE2, I was with my friends watching movies. As @PERSON1 and I walked into my room, we heard @PERSON2 scream, “Oh my gosh @PERSON3!” I thought, “Here we go again. It was a mistake to have them both here at the same time.” @PERSON1 and I exchanged glances, knowing we had the same thought. When we entered the room, we saw @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 attacking each other, pulling hair and slapping. I couldn't stand seeing my friends fight like this. I finally yelled, “Stop! What are we going to do? You,” I pointed to @PERSON3, “go and sit over there.” @PERSON3 left the room. I then said, “Come on, relax. Can't you two just act like friends for at least six more hours?” They nodded. I suggested finishing the movie or playing a quiet game, hoping the worst was over. @PERSON3 came back and lay on the bed, and we watched the movie peacefully. Then @PERSON2 said, “Isn't he just a comical genius?” while staring at the screen. We started laughing because @PERSON2's eyes were fixed on the actor. @PERSON3 laughed and said, “Who's calling who crazy?” @PERSON1 and I nervously chuckled. The tension in the air was thick. @PERSON2 got defensive. I whispered to @PERSON1, “This isn't going to be good.” I told @PERSON1 to grab @PERSON3 if needed. @PERSON1 got @PERSON3 out of the room just in time for me to pin @PERSON2 to the bed. When they left and the door was closed, I let @PERSON2 up but stayed between @PERSON2 and the door. I nervously asked what was going on. @PERSON2 let out a villainous cackle, which made me give a scared chuckle. I knew things were bad. I went to see @PERSON3 and asked what had happened. @PERSON3 was weeping and said she just wanted to ask @PERSON2 what had happened that day. I was shocked to learn they were fighting over a guy. I said, “This is pointless. Just forgive and forget.” @PERSON3 crawled over to @PERSON2 and apologized. @PERSON2 forgave her, and they hugged with tears in their eyes. In the end, laughter and the ability to resolve conflicts can strengthen friendships.
275	21059	8	2	Laughter is an essential part of life. When you're feeling down, a simple smile or laugh can send positive messages throughout your body, making you feel better. Scientists claim that it takes more muscles to frown than to smile, and I believe this is true. Frowning involves the whole body, while a small smile can show happiness. My family is a great source of laughter. During daily conversations, someone will bring up a story or a movie quote with the right accent, causing everyone to laugh. For example, my brother or sister often brings up quotes from @PERSON1 or @PERSON2, two comedians we love. We all contribute with hilarious quotes, and the fun can last all night. A while ago, my favorite movie was Get @CAPS1. We would quote it during supper or randomly in the kitchen for at least half an hour, filling the room with non - stop laughter. Sometimes, random comments also lead to laughter. At a dinner party at my house, when we were talking about @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because my little sister was learning about them in school, she suddenly said, “What about @CAPS6?!” Everyone thought she said “What about @CAPS9 @CAPS10?!” We all laughed when we realized what she meant, and she was initially confused. However, our family has also faced difficult times. About four years ago, our next - door neighbor was brutally attacked and died on our doorstep. He was very dear to us, and for a long time after that, there was little laughter. But we knew his spirit was protecting us, and this thought would sometimes break the sadness and bring back moments of happiness and laughter. I believe my family has a strong bond because of our shared sense of humor. There is no stress among us, only a sense of familiarity and connection. Someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,” and I think this is very true. Even between strangers, a shared laugh can spark a connection and potentially lead to a long - lasting friendship. Laughter is a valuable human trait that is often overlooked, but it plays a crucial role in our lives. In conclusion, we should cherish the power of laughter and use it to build stronger relationships and a happier life.
276	21060	8	2	"The human brain is an extraordinary organ. It reigns over our lives, sometimes infuriating us, at other times guiding and helping us, and in certain circumstances, even destroying us. Our brains have the power to make our bodies experience any sensation they desire. One of the most valuable capabilities of our brains is a sense of humor, manifested in laughter. It allows us to not take life too seriously for a moment, like a light - switch that triggers uncontrollable happiness in our minds. Laughter is our brain's sole means of coping with the world, enabling us to spot the comical events life presents.  Personally, I find almost everything in life funny or can always find a way to make it so. I rarely take things seriously, and the same goes for my friends. We always have a great time because we make life interesting. It could be our exaggerated facial expressions or perhaps we just look funny. In any case, we possess a sense of humor. That's what life is about: finding happiness with those who fill our lives with joy. As @PERSON1 said, ""live simply, so that others can simply live."" I believe we can all achieve this with a bit of humor.  Last year, a few friends and I went to Mission Ridge for a weekend of snowboarding. We had a great setup, a hotel suite with two king - sized beds and a plasma TV. @PERSON2 and I slept on one bed, and @PERSON3 on the other. We've always gotten along well and shared many laughs. Nothing could come between us, except for a midnight prank.  On the second night at the hotel, @PERSON3 fell asleep first. @PERSON2 and I were watching a boring ghost movie. @PERSON2 was eating popcorn and started throwing small pieces at @LOCATION1 to wake him up. ""@CAPS3, I have the funniest idea,"" @PERSON2 whispered to me. ""@CAPS4?"" I mouthed back lazily. Without a word, @PERSON2 jumped out of bed, went to the bathroom, and returned with a tube of @ORGANIZATION2 toothpaste, a sack of coins, and a package of peach rings. ""I had nothing to do with this,"" I stated, still looking at the TV.  @PERSON2 began squirting toothpaste on @PERSON3's arms, then down his legs, up to his face, and into his hair. She stuck quarters, dimes, and pennies, along with the peach rings, into the minty paste. ""@CAPS5 is going to kill you,"" I gasped. ""@CAPS6 @CAPS5 won't! It will be hilarious,"" @PERSON2 blurted and then plopped back on the bed, admiring her work. She then resumed throwing popcorn at @LOCATION1's face.  The next morning didn't go as @PERSON2 planned. @PERSON3 woke up, but his expression wasn't what @PERSON2 expected. ""@CAPS7 done for @PERSON2!"" @PERSON3 hollered. @PERSON2 still thought it was a joke and smiled. I saw the fury in @LOCATION1's eyes; he was extremely angry. His body was covered in dried toothpaste, with coins and peach rings stuck to him. @PERSON3 rushed to the bathroom, then stormed back into the room with a shampoo bottle. @PERSON2 turned to face him, and her smile disappeared. ""@CAPS4 are you gonna do with that shampoo bottle?"" @PERSON2 asked, confused. @PERSON3 got closer, and @PERSON2 backed away, unsure of his intentions. They switched positions, with @PERSON2 now facing the door and @PERSON3 by the window. @PERSON3 raised the shampoo bottle and shouted ""@CAPS9 fast,"" then threw it as hard as he could at @ORGANIZATION1's face. Fortunately, @PERSON2 ducked in time, and the bottle hit the door behind her, creating a mess of blue liquid on the walls. There was an indent on the door where the bottle hit, and @PERSON2's back was covered in blue sludge.  I got out of bed and ran to the place where the ""explosion"" happened. @PERSON3 reached @PERSON2, and they both burst into laughter. @PERSON2 sat in a puddle of shampoo and laughed. I stood there, smiling at them. @PERSON3 was still covered in the mess, and @PERSON2 was coated in blue goop. I sat down with them, and we just stared at each other in silence. Everything was fine. It then occurred to me that no matter what we do to each other, whether we get angry or try to get even, we will always find a way to laugh about it. A sense of humor is our soul's way of telling us that everything will be okay, a value in life we can cherish forever."
277	21061	8	2	"It was my 13th birthday. Waking up on that sunny day was strange for @ORGANIZATION1 because it was late @DATE1. I got up all excited and ran to the kitchen where my parents were. My dad asked if I wanted to go to work with him, and I said yes. Since my dad is a roofer, I couldn't go on the rooftops as I was too young. I had to stay on the ground and pick up the trash they threw.  After doing that for a while, I took my soccer ball out of my dad's truck and started running around, kicking the ball. While running, I noticed a slippery spot. I knew I shouldn't go there, but I forgot and stepped on it. As I fell, somehow I kicked the ball, which hit the wall and bounced back to hit me in the face. My dad and uncles were laughing so hard while I turned red with embarrassment. They said it would be even funnier in slow - motion. I was so embarrassed that I put the ball back in the truck and went back to work.  As the sun started to set, we headed home. When we arrived at my house, I walked towards the door. When I opened it, I heard ""@CAPS1!"" Surprised, I looked around and saw my friends and family. My dad took me to work because my mom was planning a @CAPS1 party for me.  I greeted my family and friends and then went to take a shower. While I was in the shower, lathering up with soap, the lights suddenly went out. I got scared and screamed as loud as I could. I ran out of the bathroom and into the living room, where the lights came back on. My family and friends looked at me and started laughing. I was confused as to why they were laughing. Then I looked down and realized I was naked. Everyone was enjoying the moment, laughing, while I turned bright red and almost cried. I ran to my room, put on some clothes, and then went back to the living room to enjoy my party."
278	21063	8	2	"What would life be like without laughter? Every day, people smile or laugh, and it makes them feel better. Laughing is like a healthy drug that has a positive impact on both the person laughing and those around them. There have been many times in my life when all I needed was a good laugh and someone to bring up my spirits.  I remember when I moved to my @NUM1 high school. It was a sunny but late @DATE1 day, and I felt completely alone. I knew no one, and there was no one to make me feel less lonely. The whole @NUM2 hours at the new school were dreadful. As I waited for my mom to pick me up, I was hating my new life. I kept thinking, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS4 one talked to me on the first day, then @CAPS4 one will talk to me at all.""  I recalled the good old days when I walked home from school with my friends. We'd tease each other, say silly things, and always be laughing and happy. As I sat there waiting, I heard my name being called by a familiar voice. I looked up and saw my friends @PERSON5, @PERSON1, and @PERSON2 sticking their heads out of my mom's car window, waving at me. Since school had just ended, there were still lots of teenagers around. "" @PERSON2, @PERSON6!!"" I exclaimed. My unhappy thoughts vanished, and I started smiling. I could feel people staring at me as my friends got out of the car to hug me, but I didn't care. All I cared about was being able to smile again and be happy with my friends.  I grabbed my purse and ran over to them for hugs. They had skipped two classes to pick me up. My mom had told them how unhappy I was and that I needed a friendly face. She was absolutely right. After the hugs, smiles, and laughs, @PERSON5 said his classic line, ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @PERSON3?"" Everyone couldn't help but laugh, and even my mom smiled.  When I got in the car, I forgot all about my bad day and how miserable I'd felt. I'd wanted my friends to be there to make me feel better, and when they actually came, I was overjoyed. After that, school was great, and I made new friends. My three friends reminded me of who I was and encouraged me to be myself. They made me laugh, and when I smiled at school, people were more welcoming. Soon, I was able to go to school every day with a smile and a laugh.  Friends have a huge influence on our lives. They remind us to smile and show us the power of laughter. Laughing is truly the key to happiness. It was because of laughter that I made new friends and had a great high - school life. It makes us seem friendly and fun, and it's the cure for unhappiness."
279	21064	8	2	"In the year 2048, after @DATE1 when there were only a few people left alive, there lived a girl named @PERSON1. Her friend @PERSON2 was a big @CAPS1 fan. One day, out of boredom, @PERSON2 sat in front of her computer camera and made an ""I'm a @ORGANIZATION1"" video.  @PERSON1 thought it was the funniest thing she'd ever seen. @PERSON2 was wearing a @ORGANIZATION1 hat, part of the @CAPS1 uniform, and a @CAPS1 shirt with some well - known characters. She was singing, ""I'm a @ORGANIZATION1. I'm a little @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. I'm slitherin' slitherin' in the garden, snatching me up a mouse, a mousey mouse. I'm going to move my tongue to taste you."" After finishing the video, @PERSON2 posted it on the website. @PERSON1 showed it to her friends, saying it was an ""epic failure,"" but both @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 actually loved it.  After about two and a half days, the video lost its novelty. No one really watched it or laughed at it anymore, even though it was made to be funny. But when someone watched it for the first time, they'd go to school, laugh a lot, and then feel stupid because everyone else had already seen it and didn't find it funny. From then on, people called @PERSON2 all sorts of names, and the one that stuck was @ORGANIZATION1.  In @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2's friend group, everyone laughed. If @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 didn't laugh, their friends would call them losers. However, laughing at someone being teased isn't funny. People laugh at and put down others because they're insecure about themselves, and it's not a matter to laugh about.  The video of @PERSON2 saying she was a @ORGANIZATION1 was meant to make people laugh, but it didn't give others the right to use rude words to put her down.  Laughter is important in conversations and is healthy for people. When others see someone being made fun of, it's not the time to laugh. It might seem funny in some cases, but we should put ourselves in the other person's shoes. We should stop those who are being mean and stand up for those whose feelings are being hurt. Laughter should be reserved for truly funny things.  For example, if you see some punks poking and throwing trash at a homeless man and his dog, and the man is in pain on the ground, you shouldn't just walk by and laugh. Instead, you should go to the man, check if he's okay, and maybe call the police. Laughing at people who are down, whether because of words or physical abuse, isn't right, and people need to stop. In a world where there are only a few people left, if others know you laugh at people's pain, they're not likely to help you.  If we laugh at the right things, we can feel good and have people to support us in difficult times. We should tell our friends that if they laugh at others' pain, one day no one will stand up for them. We can be the change in schools, workplaces, and in life in general, for our kids, grandkids, future friends, and the future world."
280	21065	8	2	When we look back at the past, we often find that everything seemed to have a deeper meaning. As we grow older, our perspective of the world changes. We see the harsh truth, no longer hidden by the illusions of our youth. Laughter, however, can help us rediscover the joy in life and remind us that it still exists.  When was the last time you lost yourself in a fit of laughter? Studies have shown that laughter releases endorphins, the body's feel - good chemicals. It can even extend our lifespan because our bodies thrive on happiness. Laughter is a highly addictive and
281	21067	8	2	"Rewrite for the first item It all began with a book @DATE1 ago. My mother noticed I was having trouble making friends, so she took it upon herself to assist me. She had some school friends with children around my age. I'd been around these girls a few times as a child, but not recently. I'm unsure what my mother saw in @LOCATION1 that made her think we'd get along, but she was right. What seemed like a minor action would significantly change my life.  In @DATE2, at my new house, I first met @PERSON1. That evening before her arrival, I was quite annoyed with my mother for arranging this. I felt I was fine and capable of making friends on my own. She acted as if she knew me better, not believing the few acquaintances I had were good for me. I didn't think she was right this time and didn't want to waste my time.  An abrupt knock on the door interrupted my thoughts. I could hear muffled voices and footsteps downstairs. I quickly retreated to my room and onto my bed. The heavy front door opened and closed, followed by footsteps approaching my room. When @PERSON1 first entered my room, I thought there was no way we'd get along. She was a beautiful blond girl, clearly popular and confident. I kept thinking she'd call me a freak and mock my differences, like the other girls at school.  ""@CAPS1, what are you reading?"" @PERSON1 asked as she sat on my bed. ""Come look for yourself,"" I replied, offering her the book in my hands. I knew she'd hate it. It was about the microorganisms that live on and feed off the body. I was right. As she leaned over cautiously to read the book, she had a disgusted expression. Laughter welled up inside me, and I couldn't hold it back. My small, dull room filled with my laughter. @PERSON1 looked at me with a strange look and started laughing with me.  After the laughter subsided and the ice was broken, we began discussing other interests. The @DATE1 short hours passed quickly, and we found many things in common. We shared funny stories, introduced each other to new music, and talked about hobbies. I couldn't remember the last time I felt so in tune with someone, especially someone I'd just met.  Suddenly, a brisk knock on the door downstairs interrupted our conversation. We looked at each other and smiled. In that smile, I saw a genuine person smiling with real pleasure, very different from my previous encounters with schoolmates. Downstairs, we said our goodbyes. As the cool @DATE3 air rushed in through the open door, I reached out to hug her. To my surprise, she reciprocated. Her hair smelled of hair products and powder, an unfamiliar but comforting scent.  After she left for the night, I started thinking. I really liked @PERSON1 and wanted to see her again soon. I felt a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment that this wonderful opportunity had come to me so easily and perfectly. I also felt guilty about my initial impression of her. Despite being judged throughout school, I'd been hypocritical. That night, I stayed up later than usual, thinking about our next meeting, how she looked, and how we could get along so well. Despite these questions lingering in my mind, I slept happily, looking forward to seeing her again.  All those @DATE1 questions and concerns have been answered over time, and we've become the closest of friends. Not long after we started spending more time together, we developed strong feelings for each other. One of the best aspects of our relationship is how people are confused to see two such different individuals so close. We can handle the stares, comments, and any challenges we face and find a way to laugh together, reducing their significance.  I've thanked my mother many times over the @DATE1, mainly for what she did for our relationship. If it weren't for her, my life would probably be much darker. No one on that cold night expected that one meeting to evolve into our beautiful friendship. Laughter is an essential part of a relationship, whether it's being built or maintained. Thanks to the laughter that sparked our conversation @DATE1 ago, I've had the best experience I could ask for."
282	21068	8	2	Rewrite for the second item Since I was a little girl, I've lived without my biological mother. @CAPS1 gave me up for adoption when @CAPS1 was only @NUM1, as @CAPS1 wasn't ready to be a mom. @CAPS1 has always been a risk - taker and never considered the consequences. My adoptive parents have always been honest with me about her and why @CAPS1 gave me up. I accept how my life has turned out and am very grateful. If I hadn't been adopted, I wouldn't have gotten to know my @PERSON1, the most loving, adventurous, funny, and wise woman one could ever meet.  As soon as I could walk, @PERSON1 would take me camping and hiking with her. On a nice sunny day, there was no doubt where we'd be. Whether we were at @PERSON1's house in @DATE1 or @DATE2, we'd always be in her garden. @PERSON1 loves her gardens and flowers, but actually, @PERSON1 loves nature in general. @CAPS1 has taught me to appreciate everything around me, especially nature. @PERSON1 and I are extremely close. If she's the sky, I'm her stars; if I'm a bird, @CAPS1's my wings. It's as simple as that.  Our relationship hasn't always been easy, but our way of coping is to laugh at everything and everyone, not in a bullying or mocking way, but in a positive way. Laughter comes naturally to @PERSON1 and me. It's what keeps us going and assures us that everything will be okay.  A few months ago, my favorite cousin @CAPS7 passed away. @PERSON1 and I hadn't seen or talked to each other much, but then everything happened so fast for @PERSON2. We saw each other at his funeral. My Sizemore family was all there. Even though @PERSON2 was gone, his presence was still felt. That night after the funeral, everyone went to my auntie's house and spent time together. Finally, @PERSON1 and I got a chance to talk. We were both teary - eyed but laughing. We laughed at all the funny times we had with @PERSON2 and all the crazy things he did. One time, he went to pick up my uncle from the airport and waited there in his Elvis costume, holding a Sizemore sign. @PERSON2 was really a funny guy.  @PERSON1 was telling me all these things, and that's when I realized @PERSON1 had taught me another thing to appreciate: laughter in times of sorrow, rejoicing in times of death, and having hope when it seems there's none left. I've learned that even though people might not think so, laughter is the key medicine for everyone's pain. People don't think of laughter as a cure; they think of it as something to do after hearing a joke. But laughter is so much more than that. My @PERSON1 taught me all these things and the real meaning of laughter, and that will always stay with me.
283	21069	8	2	"Rewrite for the third item Laughing is one of our greatest abilities. @PERSON1 and I talk almost every day and never tire of laughing. We can talk about anything, and even if it's the saddest thing in the world, we can find a way to make it funny. It's just what we do.  In @DATE3, my uncle died. I called @PERSON1, crying uncontrollably. She told me everything would be okay and to think of all the good memories I had of him. One of the only memories I could recall was the funniest story of my life. Even though I was still crying, there was laughter through my tears. I knew my uncle would want me to laugh, and I felt he was there laughing with me.  @PERSON1 and I met @DATE1 at @ORGANIZATION1. We spent a week there to meet new people and get closer to @CAPS1. That week was one of the funniest in my life. Although we didn't ""click"" at @ORGANIZATION1 that week, we later discovered we were more alike than we thought.  Some people say that when two people are too similar, their friendship won't work. This is both true and false. When we're alike, we can talk about everything. But when we encounter differences and one disagrees, it can start a fight. However, fights can bring people closer together.  Even though @PERSON1 and I don't see each other often, it doesn't mean we can't be best friends. Just because a best friend lives in a different state doesn't mean they're no longer a best friend. It just means we don't see them as much as we'd like. Even though we live close, we don't always have time to meet. But when we do, there's never a dull moment.  About a month after @PERSON1 had a bad car accident, we went to Skate World. @PERSON1 was on crutches and couldn't skate, but that didn't stop her from having fun and filling the @TIME1 with laughter. She was dancing to the music, standing on seats and yelling, ""You won't ever see these people again in your life, so why not just have a little fun?"" By the end of the @TIME1, she got almost everyone in our group dancing on the stools. I don't regret a single thing that happened that @TIME1. It was the most I'd laughed in about a year. We danced and screamed for about three hours until one of the parents arrived, and then we all went home. It's a @TIME1 I'll never forget. A girl recovering from a horrible car accident made the most of the situation.  When things don't go as planned, we often wish they had turned out differently. But looking back a few years later, we'll see that it was okay and that it will just make us laugh. Some things are hard to laugh about, but when we reach that point, it's good to think of something happy or funny and try to laugh.  Laughing has always made me feel better. Knowing that I can make someone with a difficult life laugh until they're about to pee makes me feel good. It makes me feel like I've done something meaningful with my life by helping @PERSON1 with her struggles. To me, that makes life worth living. Although we can't help everyone through every struggle, just being there sometimes helps more than we realize.  @PERSON1 and I have planned many lives we'd like to live. Looking back now, all I can do is laugh because I know in my heart they'll never happen. Even if we try our best, it's doubtful. But it was worth the laughter and the good time we had imagining them. I know we'll both laugh when we look back in a few years.  Laughter is a great way to get rid of fear, anger, and stress. It makes us think of all the good times in our lives and reminds us that we've had fun. Despite our fights, I don't think anyone can separate @PERSON1 and me, given all the laughter we share. We are true friends."
284	21070	8	2	"Rewrite for the fourth item Laughter is a natural, universal human behavior. It's said that children laugh more than adults, perhaps because it keeps them in a state of childlike wonder. Everyone's laughter is unique. Some have musical laughs, while others have deep belly laughs. There are also those who snort or snicker, the kind of laugh that makes others laugh just by hearing it. Those are my favorite.  Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" and I wholeheartedly agree. Laughing with others has had the greatest impact on my friendships. I have five girlfriends I can't imagine living without. They support me, love me, and encourage me to be bold and step out of my comfort zone.  There have been numerous sleepovers where, at two in the morning, all we can hear is the sound of our laughter over some shocking @TIME1 confession or a ""would you rather?"" question someone came up with. One particular @TIME1 was especially hilarious. It was last @DATE1, and we were sleeping on @ORGANIZATION1's porch. It was a wonderful @TIME1. The stars were out, the air was cool but comfortable, and there was going to be a meteor shower later that evening.  @PERSON3 started the conversation with her favorite catch - phrase, ""@CAPS1 guys, how's life?"" We all laughed because if you're around @PERSON3 for more than an hour, you'll hear this saying several times. ""@CAPS3 as five minutes ago,"" I replied. ""@CAPS4 guys, my life has completely changed,"" said @PERSON1 sarcastically. ""@CAPS5 really?"" @LOCATION1 asked, her small body curled up in her sleeping bag. ""@CAPS6 have you had a personality flip? Are you now blond and stupid?"" ""@CAPS7,"" @PERSON1 said sarcastically, rolling her eyes, a very @ORGANIZATION1 gesture. We laughed at the absurd mental picture of ""the brain"" being stupid.  ""@CAPS8 guys want to play would you rather?"" @ORGANIZATION2 piped in. I thought she was asleep. All I could see was her red hair covering her face. ""@CAPS9!"" yelled @PERSON2. ""I can't handle my mind being filled with horrible mental pictures!"" She buried her face in her pillow to block the images. ""@CAPS10 are you sure? I have some new ones,"" @PERSON1 said in her best evil voice. ""@CAPS11 would you rather have"

We were setting up party stuff and cleaning the house and the apartment because that's were the boy's will be hanging out and sleeping. My cousin @PERSON4 and I were helping mom and the boy's that were already here and their names would be @PERSON5 , @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. @PERSON6 was already here of course because he's the @DATE1 boy. The boy's were suppose to be cleaning the apartment but their boy's and the only things on theirs minds are girls and video games. They played video games instead of cleaning and mom got mad. Lucky for them mom was in a very good mood or they would have got @CAPS7. The last to boy's showed up now.   The last two boy's showed up and their names are @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 is showing up tomorrow after noon. @PERSON6 was so exited that he was turning @NUM1 years old , he said "" I'm @NUM1 years old now no one can tell me what to do"" and I laughed and said ""@PERSON6 go make me a sandwich"" and he said ""@CAPS3"" and I said ""so much for no one can tell me what to do"" and everyone laughed at him. He gave me my sandwich and all the boy's went to the apartment to clean @CAPS7 but when I got in there they set up @PERSON5's x-box @NUM3 and was playing @CAPS7. I told them to get cleaning but they decided not to listen so I got mom and they sure listened to her. She took @CAPS7 and put @CAPS7 on the kitchen table. They were not happy. They finally cleaned the apartment and got the x-bow back. @TIME1 all of us were watching movies and playing broad games then mom told @PERSON4 and I to clean my room , maybe a hour after that she walked by and said "" bed time"" and boy's go to the apartment. The next mourning.  The next mourning @PERSON4 and I woke up to the sun hitting us in the eyes and I said ""what a great way to start off the day"" and @PERSON4 said ""I know"". The best part of today is that we get to hang out with the boy's. When @PERSON4 and I got into the living room everybody was in the kitchen and partly in the living room. @TIME1 that @TIME1 the boy's thought @CAPS7 would be fun if they played cops and rubbers. The apartment was the jail. @PERSON2 , @CAPS2 , @PERSON6 were the cops and @PERSON5 and @CAPS1 were the rubbers. @PERSON4 and I wanted to play so we went outside and ran into @PERSON5 on the otter side of the apartment , he was the only one who knew we were outside. When I was running to hide behind the trees I felling in the hole that turns off the water for the apartment and my leg looked like cottage cheese and @CAPS7 was gushing blood and you could see my bone. I had to stop playing for the @TIME1. Mom told @PERSON4 and I to go to bed.  The next mourning mom woke us up and asked if we want eggs and bacon and we said ""yes"". I crawled out of bed because I needed to go to the bathroom so @PERSON4 helped me up the stairs and when we were coming down the stairs @PERSON5 saw me hurting and being the amazing boyfriend he is he picked me up and carried me to the couch in the living room and sat me down on the couch and kissed the top of my head and said ""good mourning beautiful"" and I said ""good mourning to you to baby"". Now everybody is standing around for their food to be done. The boy's are making pizza if you wanted to know. Then my little sister @CAPS6 walked in to the kitchen and said ""ma'am I want a cookie"" and mom said "" okay , here you go baby"". @CAPS6 ran off with a very big smile on her face. The boy's got their pizza now and they just went back to the apartment. @PERSON4 and I looked at mom and said ""wow"" mom's like i know. We all laughed and started talking about boy's and friends , family , animals. @CAPS7 was a very fun weekend and even though I got hurt we still made the best of @CAPS7. Even though I got hurt and cant do anything for the next two months or so , we still had a blast with each other and @PERSON6 said "" @CAPS7 was his most favorite @DATE1 he's ever had so far . @CAPS6 wanted her friend to come over but she had fun with mom and @PERSON4 , the boy's when they came in the house and I. Sometimes you got to work with what you got and @CAPS7 might turn out more fun than your normal plan you made. Just make sure your happy with the people around you. "

I'll start with my ""blond moments"" as blond is my natural hair color. When I was young, I'd take off my shirt, throw it on the ground, and then claim I couldn't find it. My mom would tell me I'd just thrown it down, but I'd look in all the wrong places and end up crying on the floor. Mom would pick up the shirt and give it to me, and I'd repeat the whole thing. I was a bit embarrassed when I got older and saw it on video, but now I can laugh at what was once embarrassing and move on.  Another time, we noticed that my initials spell a certain word. Whenever I swim with my brother and our friends, they sing the associated theme song, and I laugh. If I act like I don't care, they'll keep going, and they still haven't stopped. I think I might be stuck with that nickname for life.  In first grade, my second - grade brother told my teacher I had a certain condition. The teacher called my parents, who laughed and explained it was just a normal thing. Looking back, the teacher's expression was classic.  As I entered high school, I joined an organization where black was prohibited at functions. On the night of my initiation, I wore all black from head to toe. I wasn't embarrassed; I just wanted to laugh. I've also found that I make jokes when I'm nervous during a speech. Once, in front of about 120 people, I made some not - very - good jokes, and I even hit my head on a dream catcher, but people laughed with me.  This organization has taught me that it's okay to cry at life's depressing moments, fear what scares you, love whomever you want, and live your life. Most importantly, it's okay to laugh at your mistakes. I'll remember this lesson and pass it on to my children one day. I learned this lesson while babysitting my sick cousins; it's a big responsibility. My brother helped me a lot. Thanks to the positive people around me, I've become a better person. I've learned to laugh when there's no way out, learn from and laugh at my mistakes, and understand that there's a deeper meaning to life. Remember, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade and have a good laugh with your friends."
287	21073	8	2	"Laughter is a significant part of who I am. I'm a happy and outgoing person who loves to laugh, especially those belly - laughs that make you feel like your stomach will fall out. That's why I surround myself with like - minded people, like my best friend PERSON1. People often say we look like twins, and when we're together, there's a whirlwind of loud, crazy laughter.  One day, PERSON1 and I were strolling downtown and window - shopping. We saw an auburn tank top with blue swirls and a pair of dark blue jeans with a knee - rip in a store window and fell in love with the outfit. An idea popped into my head, and I asked PERSON1 what if we switched identities when we met CAPS3 later. Her eyes lit up, and we bought the outfit. We looked in the mirror and knew we could pull it off. The pants fit our identical curves perfectly, and the tank top rested on our bodies the same way. The only differences were her height and my longer hair, so we put our hair up in buns.  As we left the store, people asked if we were sisters, and we replied, ""Yeah, kinda."" This made us more confident that we could trick anyone. When we got close to the county library lawn where we were meeting CAPS3, PERSON1 told me to hide behind a tree and then sneak around to scare him. She went up to say hello and told him she didn't know where I was. Meanwhile, I sneaked around and jumped out, saying, ""Here I am!"" He was a bit startled, and I asked if I scared him. He said no, but I rolled my eyes. I told him to close his eyes, and when PERSON1 tapped him on the shoulder, he was completely baffled. PERSON1 shouted a funny phrase, and CAPS3 nearly jumped out of his skin. PERSON1 and I laughed so hard we almost wet our new pants. CAPS3 was confused but eventually giggled a little. He told us not to do it again, but we joked around, and he just smiled because he knew we were having fun.  After that, we had a great time acting like twins around town. When it was time to leave, PERSON1's mother did a double - take when she saw us. We told her it was a long story. This was a perfect memory with my best friend."
288	21074	8	2	"Somewhere, someone said, ""A laugh a day keeps the doctor away."" I didn't understand the importance of this until I experienced a traumatic event. Do you remember the first heartbreak? If so, you might understand how I felt. If not, you might learn why you're single.  Before the heart - breaking event, when CAPS2 and I fought, we'd make jokes to get through it. We'd even watch romantic movies to laugh at the over - the - top crying of the characters.  When the break - up happened, CAPS2 and I had been together for two and a half years. It was in the middle of math class. CAPS4 convinced me to sit in the corner of the room. She was wearing white bleached jeans and a black band t - shirt, with porcelain - like skin, dirty blond hair, rose - petal lips, and amazing curves. I was in my PERSON1 t - shirt, black jeans, and a burgundy beanie, with tan skin and dark brown curly hair.  As I sat down, I had a bad feeling, like an oncoming storm. Then, she said, ""We have to break up."" My heart stopped, and her other words became a blur. I sat there like a statue, silently laughing at myself inside my head. I didn't trust my voice to speak. I walked out of the room, tears streaming down my face.  Looking back, laughter helped us through many things in our relationship, but it wasn't enough to save it. However, I can still laugh at how I reacted. I'm not like those overly - emotional movie characters who sob obnoxiously."
289	21075	8	2	"My best friend PERSON1 and I walked to a park in LOCATION1 on a rainy DATE1 at TIME1. The weather wasn't great, but the sight of the lost and hopeless at this park was appealing to us. As I approached the grass and benches, my shoes got covered in mud, and I started to have second thoughts about the fun.  We sat on the damp, leaf - filled benches and noticed a man and his children walking towards us. The man looked odd, in his late thirties, with tight pants covered in what seemed like sharpie markings, a knitted scarf, and a matching small hat. He had a stroller with two kids, one in his hand and the other in a storage pocket below.  The man pretended his NUM1 - year - old daughter was whispering in his ear, shouting things like ""WAS THAT?!"" and asking if she wanted him to offer us raisins. We secretly pushed the raisins between the bench cracks when he looked away. When he started ranting about how beautiful his daughter's eyes were, we looked at each other, and laughter welled up in us.  He then took out his phone with a video of a country singer and compared faces. After a while, I looked away as the phone was in LOCATION2's hands. PERSON1 nudged me because she didn't want me to stop watching the ridiculous video. I looked up and saw the father staring at her, waiting for a reaction. I noticed how uncomfortable everyone was, including his kids, but he seemed oblivious.  Throughout the interaction, I said very few words due to the silent laughter. My polite friend PERSON1, who hates being impolite, handed the phone back with a red - cheeked smile and said something about the resemblance. We had no answers to his questions, just laughter inside us. When he asked if we could act and said he wanted to direct us, we couldn't take it anymore. We rushed to her house, letting out all the laughter we'd been holding in. We thought it was just another day in LOCATION1, but for us, every day had something to laugh about."
290	21076	8	2	"Have you ever gotten detention for laughing too much in class? If not, you're lucky. I'm the kind of student who randomly bursts into laughter, especially at my own jokes, making me a teacher's nightmare.  One beautiful afternoon, it was time for CAPS1 class. I walked in and noticed the teacher was in a bad mood, but I ignored it and put on my music. I like listening to music as it helps me relax and focus, but the downside is that I can't hear well. When I listen to music, I feel like I'm in a slow - motion movie, secluded in my own world until I start laughing.  Class started, and everyone was very loud. The teacher was getting angry and impatient. He warned that anyone who talked would get their name on the board and detention.  About five minutes later, my friend PERSON1 walked by and started talking to me. I tend to talk loudly when listening to music. When I wasn't looking, the teacher was staring at me. He turned around and wrote my name on the board as a warning. When I saw this, I couldn't control my laughter. The teacher told me I owed him 30 minutes of detention.  I'm easily amused and laugh at almost everything. The teacher's facial expression when he yelled at me was so funny that I laughed even harder. My friend PERSON1 also started laughing with me and told the teacher she was the one who made me laugh, so she got detention too.  A week later, PERSON1 and I went to detention with other ""rebels."" We learned that we shouldn't sit next to each other because we can't stop laughing. Even in detention, we almost got more detention.  We've learned that ""Life's too short to live with tension and regrets, so just laugh it off!"" I believe laughter is important in my life. It helps me forget my troubles. Even though I get in trouble for laughing, I don't regret it. Laughing releases tension and brings me closer to my friends. So, live your life, laugh as much as you can, and love those who matter most."
291	21077	8	2	Starting with the incident at the farm, one day was going as usual on the farm. My mom instructed me and my brother to cut corn after dinner. Reluctantly, we went to the shop, got the skid - steer out. I started the machine and drove towards the garden. My brother came running, tried to jump on the front forks, missed, and fell. My uncle called the ambulance. We were horrified to see the bone sticking out of his leg. During this time of uncertainty, our family stood by us, preventing us from feeling too down. We didn't know the severity of his injury. The ambulance arrived, examined him, and asked me questions. That night, I stayed at my grandparents' house, having a hard time falling asleep. The next day, being a school day, I went to school. I learned my brother had a compound fracture. My friends at school told jokes to distract me. Later that night, we visited him in the hospital and found out he'd only broken the big bone in his leg and it had realigned well. My mom stayed with him, so my dad, sisters, and I had to take care of the house, which was a chore as I dislike housework. After about a week, they returned. My brother had a device on his leg to draw out fluids and giant screws in his leg attached to an external bar. He healed well and has a large scar. It was truly heart - warming to have the support of family and friends during this tough time, which is why laughter is so important in difficult situations.
292	21078	8	2	We all recognize the advantages of laughter. Laughter is not only a means of expressing emotions but can also strengthen friendships and relationships. For numerous people, laughter is an indispensable part of any relationship. In a friendship, laughter is crucial. A friendship lacking fun and happiness is not a good one. Building a friendship can be challenging; a shared laugh or the absence of it can define the friendship. Having a friend you can trust, talk to, rely on, and most importantly, laugh with is an excellent feeling. Laughter also plays a vital role in childhood memories. When I was a child, I was constantly laughing. Even though my parents left my brothers and me, my grandparents, brothers, cousins, aunts, and uncles kept me occupied and ensured I had a great time. I believe laughter is essential for children as it is healthy, helps in keeping others' spirits high, and fosters a strong, fun, and happy family relationship. In a romantic relationship, laughter is equally important. It builds character in the relationship and shows that you are content with your partner. It also paves the way for a good, strong, and healthy relationship, reducing the likelihood of divorce and conflicts. In conclusion, regardless of age, gender, or the type of relationship, laughter is of utmost importance. It helps in building a strong - willed person and adding character to oneself.
293	21079	8	2	Have you ever used laughter to ease an awkward situation? I have, and many others have too. In my view, laughter makes people more at ease, enabling them to be themselves. It can also attract a positive and friendly crowd. Here are some instances where laughter has benefited me. Years ago, at a homeschoolers' group in @LOCATION1, I knew no one. After wandering around for a while, a funny girl approached me. Our shared laughter made me comfortable, and I had a great time. I just needed to find the right person. Another time was at a birthday party of a friend I hadn't seen in over two years. There were others I hadn't met in a long time, and the whole event was awkward. I tried to blend in, but if I had laughed and been more at ease, I could have shown my true self. When I first entered public school, I was nervous about meeting new people. After a week or so, people got to know the funny, happy, and laughable side of me, and it clicked with many. That's why I'm friends with the people I am today; our personalities match. Laughter has brought me to a good place in life. It can make people happy and comfortable in awkward situations, encourage them to show their true selves, and attract like - minded people. I firmly believe the world would be a happier place if everyone could laugh more.
294	21081	8	2	"One morning, my mother rushed to pack her things, shouting, ""Wake up, kids!"" I knew I'd made a mistake; I'd set my phone alarm for 6 pm instead of 6 am, and now we were late. I quickly packed clothes for the week: six pairs of pants, shirts, underwear, and socks. I placed my bag by the front door, next to the one I'd packed the day before. My sisters took forever putting on makeup and straightening their hair. Finally, at 7 am, when we were supposed to be in @LOCATION2, we were still at home. Once my sisters were done, we got in the car and headed to @LOCATION3. Our family had planned this trip for a month, and now it was @DATE2! I was extremely excited, with butterflies in my stomach. We lived in @LOCATION1, and we were only halfway through @LOCATION2, with eight out of ten hours left to reach my mom's cousin's house. I fell asleep for the first two hours of the journey and couldn't sleep anymore. Bored in the back seat, I started singing ""The Song That Never Ends."" My sister in the front seat harshly told me to stop, but I continued. She yelled again, and when I persisted, she punched my arm. For some reason, I found it funny and started laughing. My little sister joined in, which made my older sister scream at us to be quiet. She punched me again to stop me from laughing. I laughed so hard that I could hardly breathe, and my face turned purple. My mom couldn't hold back and started laughing with us. She wears dentures, and they almost fell out while she was driving, which made us laugh even harder. My older sister turned blue from yelling, threw her arms up, and slumped back in her seat in disgust. After a minute, we stopped laughing and were quiet for an hour until we stopped for lunch. After lunch, we continued our long journey. I fell asleep in an awkward position in the car. We were in the middle - west of @LOCATION3, and the mountains were incredibly beautiful, full of colorful trees, squirrels, and life. It was the farthest I'd ever been from @LOCATION1, and I was glad to be with my family. My stay in @LOCATION3 was a bit of a blur. I played video games with a neighbor kid and ate junk food. My mom was the happiest as she hadn't seen her cousin in about three years. On @DATE1, it was time to go home. At first, I was quiet, but then I started singing the song again, and I had one of the best laughs of my life."
295	21083	8	2	The members of my immediate family are notoriously clumsy and easily startled. In our house, broken dishes, spilled drinks, stubbed toes, and blood - curdling screams when the toaster pops up are common occurrences. While we're used to these things, others around us aren't, leading to interesting situations. Some people enjoy poking me to hear me scream and laugh when I trip over a small crack on the floor. Although it can be annoying at times, it also gives me a reason to overcome my pride and laugh at myself, thus relieving any social tensions. A few years ago, I was with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 troop at @LOCATION1. Being in a large group, especially a group of girls aged four to eighteen with only a few adults to keep the peace, was intimidating. I was staying in a place that was a mix between a cabin and a tent, and most of the girls were in middle school. We didn't always get along. However, there were moments when we put aside our petty differences and had a great time chatting and joking. On one such occasion, I was making my bed on a top bunk. I was stretching the sheet over a very old mattress that might have been from @NUM1 @CAPS3.C. In an attempt to balance, I leaned against what I thought was a wall but was actually a thin, cloth - like material that couldn't support my weight. Realizing my mistake, I frantically reached for something to hold on to, trying to avoid falling to the floor. Just before hitting the floor, I grabbed a bar on the side of the bed and hung on, swinging back and forth. Finally, I let go and landed on the bed below. The laughter lasted a long time. In that short period, all the cliques, biases, and grudges were forgotten. We became a united group, not just a random collection of girls in a room. The adolescent years are tough, and there are times when we feel lonely. However, it's comforting to know that there are others who experience the same joys and embarrassments. One of the most important skills is to be able to laugh at ourselves and be vulnerable in front of others. We may not all be the same, but we all share the basic desires for love, acceptance, and laughter.
296	21085	8	2	"While residing in @LOCATION5, I encountered two individuals who are now my closest friends, @PERSON1 @CAPS14 @CAPS1 @PERSON6. I met them through distinct means. I met @PERSON1 via school, and @CAPS14 @CAPS1 through paintball. I first crossed paths with @PERSON1 when she relocated from @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. Her father was in the @ORGANIZATION1, and @CAPS14 had been transferred to a base nearby. We shared two classes and lunch. Initially, @CAPS14 and I didn't converse much. It was only when my friend @PERSON3 invited her to join us for lunch that things changed. That day, our friend @PERSON4 was extremely hyper and ended up falling backward in his chair, scaring some passing girls. We laughed so heartily that our faces turned bright red. After lunch, we had class together, so we walked side - by - side and discussed the lunchtime incident. I then asked her to sit with me during @CAPS3. We couldn't stop chatting. Fortunately, it was a free sketch day; otherwise, we might have gotten into trouble. After about a week, @PERSON1 and I discovered we had numerous things in common, which seemed almost unbelievable. I had never met a girl who could make me laugh so hard and who I enjoyed spending time with daily. She would make funny faces and tell me stories from her past that would have me in stitches. We communicate via the internet almost every other day. Even though she is over @NUM1 miles away, she can still make my stomach ache from laughter. As for @CAPS1, he grew up in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION5, and later moved to @LOCATION4. We met when my dad, brother, and I went paintballing at a place called ""The @CAPS5"". It was a slow day at the fields; there were fewer people than usual, and somehow, there were not enough tables. We offered to share ours with two guys who I later found out were @CAPS7 friends, @CAPS8 @CAPS14 @CAPS9. As the day progressed, @CAPS1 and a few other friends, @PERSON5 @CAPS14 @PERSON2, arrived. The games became more interesting, but no one had managed to eliminate me before the referee called time. I was getting annoyed by the lack of experienced players when I suddenly felt the impact of two sharp paintballs and heard a splat. I had been hit on the leg, mask, and trigger finger. When the game ended, I spotted the person who had eliminated me, which was @CAPS1. I ran over to him and said ""@CAPS12 @CAPS13"". He laughed and said, ""That wasn't luck; I intended to get you out."" I retorted, ""Well, then why hadn't you gotten me out before? Huh? You know that was totally a @CAPS12 @CAPS13."" He replied, ""I was going easy on you; I didn't want to make you feel bad."" By then, I was smiling and giggling as I said, ""Sure, that's why."" We continued to joke about the game and the other players. When it was time for me to leave, he wrote his email on a small torn piece of cardboard and asked me to keep in touch. As soon as I got home, I sent an email saying, ""I still think it was a @CAPS12 @CAPS13"". Since that day, we have been best friends. In almost every conversation, one of us mentions the @CAPS12 @CAPS13, and it always makes us laugh. Although I don't see my best friends daily, we still manage to make each other laugh from a distance. Now, I can spread the laughter to new people, and hopefully, I'll make more wonderful friends like the two I've already made."
297	21086	8	2	"A few years ago, when I first met my cousin @ORGANIZATION1, the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 began. The first time I spent the night at his house, the day before, we spent the entire day outside, running around his yard and jumping off their roof. The activities were highly enjoyable and entertaining. However, regardless of what we did, @ORGANIZATION1 always had something to say about every little thing we did or saw. He would exclaim, ""This looks like that!"" or ""She sounds like this!"" His tone of voice and his unique way of shouting @CAPS3 had me in fits of laughter. The laughter was so intense that my stomach started to ache, and @ORGANIZATION1 himself began laughing as he watched me succumb to uncontrollable laughter. The fun didn't end there. Later that evening, we stayed up almost all night watching @CAPS1 videos on @CAPS6 and playing @CAPS7 on the @NUM1. As we grew extremely tired and our minds raced with thoughts, the laughter became even more intense. I fell over, holding my stomach, laughing uncontrollably. Every word that came out of my cousin's ineffable mouth made me burst out laughing as if I were hearing the funniest joke for the first time. The next morning, I experienced severe muscle pain in my chest, a tell - tale sign of a fun and humorous night. Even then, @ORGANIZATION1 still managed to turn my stomach pain into a @CAPS1 subject. At breakfast, the morning was just as enjoyable as the night before. We listened to non - stop comments and jokes on every possible thought and subject. The day continued with the never - ending laughter between my cousin and me. As I left, I thought about how much more fun I would have the next time I visited. From that moment on, @ORGANIZATION1 and I became the best of friends, and our times together only got better and more enjoyable. Without laughter, life would be incomplete."
298	21087	8	2	"One day, as it was almost @CAPS1, my sister, mom, and I were in the kitchen preparing desserts and a variety of food for @CAPS1 eve dinner. My mom had to leave to go to the store to buy more ingredients. After she left, my sister and I continued to work in the kitchen. I was focused on one task, and she was working on another. Eventually, she finished making the cookies and decided to assist me with the lemon blossoms (small lemon - glazed cakes). The recipe called for a fourth of a cup of lemon juice, so I told my sister to extract the lemon juice from the lemons. At that time, I was making the cakes when my sister shouted at me and asked, ""Do I just squeeze @CAPS3?"" Assuming she had cut @CAPS3, I answered yes. However, I was wrong. She shouted again, saying, ""@CAPS3 isn't working."" I turned around to find her squeezing an un - cut lemon in an attempt to get the juice out. I simply told her she needed to cut it and then burst into laughter. I don't think I've ever laughed that hard in my life. I was on the floor, crying from laughter, when my mom entered the kitchen with a bag full of groceries. Her first words were, ""@CAPS5 did @CAPS6 do."" Believe it or not, I started laughing even harder. To this day, my sister is still nicknamed ""lemons"". My family and I thought the incident was so funny that we wanted all our family and friends to know about it. From this experience, I've learned that laughter is important in numerous ways. It can bring friends and family closer together and strengthen relationships. This incident brought my sister and me closer in many aspects. Now, we always laugh together, and I prefer laughing with her to arguing. Since then, my sister and I have become extremely close. We can share anything and everything with each other. I believe everyone should laugh because laughing about the silliest things can improve relationships and bring people closer."
299	21089	8	2	After a long day at the @ORGANIZATION1, my mom said it was my turn to choose where we would go for dinner that night. I selected @CAPS1 @CAPS2 because I love their seafood. We ordered @CAPS6 legs, popcorn shrimp, and coconut - battered shrimp. After the meal, we had two slices of double - chocolate lava cake. For some reason, it triggered a fit of laughter. We laughed so hard that we started to cry. Earlier, we had just finished clothes shopping at the @ORGANIZATION1, and mom said I could pick the restaurant. My brother started complaining, but mom said it was fair since he had chosen last time. I picked @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for two reasons: it was close to the @ORGANIZATION1, and I love seafood. Mom didn't have much money, so she suggested we share a few items instead of each getting our own. We bought two pounds of @CAPS5 @CAPS6 legs, an order of popcorn shrimp, and coconut - battered shrimp (mostly for her). I'm glad we shared because it was more cost - effective, and we had just the right amount of food, so we didn't need to take home leftovers as we never eat them anyway. After dinner, my brother and I pleaded with our mom to buy a dessert. After much thought and persuasion, she agreed and ordered two slices of the most delicious cake I've ever tasted. It was so rich that my mom and I could barely finish our slices, while my brother gulped his down easily. After we were done, the waiter brought the bill. We all looked at it and decided not to get dessert again (though that never actually happened). Then, mom started giggling uncontrollably. Soon after, my brother and I caught the giggles like a contagious disease. The giggles turned into laughter, which became hysterical. We couldn't figure out what was so funny or how it started. People were starting to stare at us, but we couldn't stop. Soon, our eyes watered, and we were in tears. I assume they were tears of joy. We knew we had to leave. Mom managed to pay the bill, but as soon as she got in the car and heard my brother and me laughing, she started laughing again. She was convinced it was the cake; she said there was no other reasonable explanation for our non - stop laughter. I now believe her because we've tried other desserts, and none have had the same effect. We go back whenever we can afford dessert and want to have a good laugh. I guess I don't just like the seafood; I also really enjoy the cake. We call it the double - chocolate laugh cake.
300	21090	8	2	The @CAPS1 of Laughter: My friends and I always find ways to make each other laugh and have a great time. My friends, @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION1, are similar yet distinct. Both are active and humorous girls. Their personalities are so alike that one could almost mistake them for sisters, but their appearances are quite different. @PERSON2 is tall and slender, with short, black, curly hair. Her clear skin has an olive - green tint. Her baby - blue eyes seem to hide a deep secret. My other friend, @LOCATION1, has hair that seems to glow like sunshine. Each golden curl reaches down to her belly button. Her fair skin is lightly covered with freckles that are mainly on her perky cheeks. Her eyes resemble the deep blue ocean, and one can only imagine swimming in such a beautiful shade of blue. On @DATE1 @TIME1, as the sun was setting on a cold @DATE2 @CAPS1, my friends and I decided to learn the @PERSON1 @CAPS4 dance. After practicing for a night, I gave up and lay on the plush couch that cradled my body. Two hours passed, and the girls mastered the dance. They had every leg step and movement just like @PERSON1. They were so good that they could have been @PERSON1's backup dancers. After a moment of celebration, we realized how absurd the idea was and stopped. @ORGANIZATION1 begged to do the dance one more time, but this time with the camera recording. After pressuring @PERSON2 for a few minutes, I started the music and pressed the record button. The girls were doing well at first but started forgetting some steps. Suddenly, they ran into each other at full speed. There was silence except for the music. We all looked at each other and then burst into laughter. @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION1 got up, crying from laughter, and apologized to each other. I was recording the whole thing. After calming down, we watched the amazing home video. Remembering moments like this makes me extremely grateful for my friends. It makes me happy to know that we can be ourselves around each other. Without them, I wouldn't know the true meaning of laughter.
301	21091	8	2	Can one envision a life devoid of laughter? A life without laughter is plain, dull, and uninteresting. Laughter is an essential part of life. If laughter did not exist, there would be nothing to anticipate. Laughter creates memories and relationships and fills the awkward silence between two individuals. Some individuals fail to recognize the significance of laughter. A life without laughter is akin to a life without water. This truly highlights how important laughter is. The quote “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people” holds true, yet laughter is more than just an element; it is far more crucial. While it is possible to live without laughter, who would desire such a life? The absence of laughter means no enjoyable moments, such as swimming, visiting water parks, ice - skating, or dancing. These enjoyable activities often lead to laughter. Without anything fun to do, no one would look forward to tomorrow. Every day would be a waste if there were no laughter in the world. Some may simply view laughter as an element. Why is this the case? Laughter is important enough to be more than that. For instance, water is an element as it is related to the earth and represents the ocean. Laughter does not fit into this category. Laughter has a profound impact on our lives. It makes everything ten times better. Laughter creates memories, and memories build relationships. This is why laughter is an important part of any relationship. It is remarkable how such a small thing can make a significant difference in our lives.
302	21092	8	2	Laughter plays a significant role in most people's daily lives. It's a common emotion that I witness countless times each day. Whether it's a simple funny face, a joke, a picture, or the little things people say and do, even the most serious individuals can be made to laugh. My friends and I laugh all the time. We can find humor in almost anything. I believe that the ability to laugh and joke around is a great trait for a person, as it makes life more fun and optimistic. I can't even count the number of times I've had a complete laughing fit because of my friend [LOCATION1]. She is one of the funniest people I've ever met. Although she's extremely funny, she's not the most intelligent. She asks questions after being given the answer, repeats what I say without realizing, and sometimes even trips on the concrete when racing to her car after practice. Her actions may not always be smart, but they always make people laugh. I remember just last week, I was in the car with [LOCATION1] on the way to volleyball practice. She belted out the wrong words to the song we were listening to. What made it funnier was that she knew the words were wrong but kept singing as if she knew every word. By the end of the song, we were laughing so hard we cried. We laughed for about ten minutes straight until we reached practice. During practice, our [CAPS3] was explaining the directions for a drill. She clearly told us to serve the ball to spots one and five [CAPS2]. [LOCATION1], not fully understanding, put up her hand and asked, “[CAPS3], so do we [CAPS2] serve to spots one and five?” The whole team burst into hysterical laughter. [LOCATION1] looked confused at first but joined in when she understood. This happened about three more times during our two - and - a - half - hour practice. She was put in the front row, which was hilarious because she's very short and looked funny next to the tall girls. By the end of practice, I think we got a better workout from laughing than from playing volleyball. On the way to the car, [LOCATION1] decided to race a girl on our team. They took off in a sprint. Suddenly, they disappeared. I ran up the stairs and found [LOCATION1] face - down on the ground with [CAPS5] sitting next to her, laughing hysterically. I felt bad, but it was so funny I couldn't help laughing. We laughed for about fifteen minutes and talked about it all the way home. It was one of the funniest days I've ever had, and I'll never forget all the times we laughed together. I think our ability to laugh so much brings us closer as friends. Even when we get irritated or something bad happens, we can always find a way to laugh about it in the end, and that's what every good friendship should have. Laughter can't always solve everything, but it can brighten someone's day, and you never know the positive impact a little laugh can have.
303	21093	8	2	Many people wrongly assume that [ORGANIZATION1] is just like any other institution. In fact, [ORGANIZATION1] is quite distinct, as it is filled with humorous individuals who contribute to its bright side. These funny people can be found everywhere, but the best places to spot them are in the hallways, especially on [DATE1] at [ORGANIZATION1], during lunch, or after [ORGANIZATION1] activities. Most of the people I'll mention are my friends, and there are also many whose names I don't know. I'll even talk about a teacher. Let's start with the teacher. I can't recall her name, but she likes to speak with a [CAPS1] accent and is extremely enthusiastic. She often says, “[CAPS3] we go!” It's quite amusing, and I've never seen her without enthusiasm. Some students find it disturbing, and it can be annoying at times, but at least she's not gloomy. In fact, [ORGANIZATION1] and many other places could use more people like her. There's also a student named [CAPS4] who is often enthusiastic. He loves to sing, even if he doesn't know the words. People often make mean jokes about him, but he tolerates them and laughs along. It's really admirable how he can handle such rudeness and still find the humor. He's very jolly and always makes people laugh. [CAPS4], keep being funny. There are two boys, [PERSON3] and [PERSON1], who are incredibly humorous and sometimes even dangerously so. They play with a [CAPS6], a toy shaped like a bowl. Instead of using it as intended, they hit each other with it. Eventually, the [CAPS6] got worn out and tore, but they just couldn't stop playing with it. I haven't seen them play with it lately; it might have broken. [PERSON2] is easily distracted in the hallways. If she sees someone she wants to talk to, she'll just twirl around and rush over without telling anyone. It's best to let her lead if you're with her. Despite this, [PERSON2] is very funny as she makes lots of random sounds that always make people laugh. [CAPS9] not only makes sounds but also does hilarious facial expressions. She mimics the funny things her goats and pets do. During the [DATE1] finals, [CAPS9] and I drew goofy pictures of each other and cracked up. She redrew a comic her brother thought of years ago. There was also a guy pulling his friend through the hallways, and the friend said it was comfy, and they told a teacher about it. [LOCATION1] is far from an ordinary [ORGANIZATION1]. You could call it a “clown [ORGANIZATION1].” You won't know how much fun it is until you visit. Come on over and join the fun.
304	21094	8	2	Long car rides can be both physically and mentally exhausting. Imagine a family of four—a father driving, a mother in the passenger seat, and two sisters in the back. The sun is rising, and they're still on the road. The father is tired from driving all night, the mother has just woken up and is wondering how much further they have to go, and the sisters are looking out of the windows, bored. Even with coffee and loud music, the atmosphere is dull. What could liven up this lifeless atmosphere? Entertainment, perhaps. As a child, I was often on the move because of my father's job. We lived in [ORGANIZATION1], a state known for its snow, wonderful wildlife, and beautiful landscapes. In winter, the snow covered the ground like a blanket, and sometimes there would be two feet of new snow overnight. Despite the cold winters, the summers were extremely hot, which was a surprise to those unfamiliar with [ORGANIZATION1]'s weather. This was about a decade ago, and the environment may have changed, but it's still a beautiful state. One [DATE1] after school, my mother told me to start packing. I knew we were leaving that [DATE1], but I was sad to leave my friends. Every time we moved, it was hard to say goodbye. I went to my room and began packing for a long trip. My father said we were moving by car and asked my sister and me to go with him to pick up the uHaul. The trucks weren't in the best condition, but it was better than nothing. My father drove the uHaul back home, and we started loading the packed boxes. The valuable and necessary items were put in my mom's [CAPS1], along with our cats in their cages. After everything was packed and loaded, the hired uHaul employees drove the uHaul to our new destination, [LOCATION2]. Everyone had mixed feelings about leaving. My mother loved her neighbors, my father had great coworkers, and my sister and I had made wonderful friends. But we had to say goodbye. It's never easy, but it's something we've had to do many times. Off they went, driving from [LOCATION1] to [LOCATION2]. The only downside was that they had to reach [LOCATION2] in less than a week, which meant less time for stops and fun. At first, the car was full of chatter and energy, but everyone soon got tired of being on the road. My sister and I didn't handle it well at the beginning. Half - way to [LOCATION2], the conversation stopped, and the excitement faded. There was nothing to do in the small space of the car. To make the rest of the drive fun, I started singing badly. My voice cracked, which made everyone laugh. My mother said I was adorable, and my father mocked me. Then my sister started singing, and soon everyone was singing along. The mood lifted, and they became more active. The rest of the trip passed quickly, and it was clear that spending time with family in a fun way is the best. We should always try to make things enjoyable and keep a positive outlook.
305	21095	8	2	Laughter benefits not only ourselves but also those around us. We typically use laughter only when we want to feel happy, but that shouldn't be the sole reason. Laughter is not just about feeling better; it's about releasing pent - up emotions. Enjoying oneself is a source of pride and can boost self - esteem. When you laugh, do you feel as if a weight has been lifted off your shoulders? You don't have to laugh uncontrollably; a simple chuckle can have a positive effect. Watching your favorite movie or having fun with friends can make you laugh and feel better about yourself. This brings me to my experiences with my family. When I was younger, I lived in [LOCATION1] and would go on trips with my family to [LOCATION2] every [DATE1]. We'd cram five to nine people into a van and set off. With so little personal space, you'd think it wouldn't be fun, but we had a great time despite some minor arguments about where to stop for food or when to turn. As the youngest, I was often bored, so I'd make my family tell jokes or make funny faces. When someone did, I'd burst into laughter. It was pure bliss and innocence. Sometimes, it wasn't even about how funny they were; I just laughed to relieve the tension. When we reached my great - grandparents' land, we'd cram into a small area to sleep. Everyone got a cot and had to endure the warm days and cold [TIME1] nights. The cold nights were the worst because the place didn't have proper heating. We only had sleeping bags and the clothes on our backs. I often didn't listen to my family and would drink a lot of water before going to bed. As a result, I'd need to use the restroom during the night. My aunt, who was only [NUM1] years older than me, would have to wake up and take me outside to the porter potty. One night, as we walked down the driveway, the wind was fierce, and my aunt had a strange grin on her face. After I finished in the porter potty, I felt it shaking, and a “monster” voice said, “[CAPS1] y is coming to get me, run!” I panicked, pushed the door open, and ran. When I looked back, I saw my aunt laughing uncontrollably. This shows that a bad situation can be turned into a good one by finding the humor in it. Instead of dreading the situation, we can make it a laughing matter. My aunt's actions turned a potentially unpleasant experience into a memorable and funny one, and it's a reminder that we should always try to find the light side of things.
306	21096	8	2	Have you ever experienced a great feeling after a good laugh? Studies indicate that laughter not only makes you feel better but is also an effective way to burn calories. Once, when I was feeling down, my cousin came over and made me laugh. This was a crucial part of our relationship; she not only brightened the day but also infused it with more energy. How can one have as much fun without laughter? Research shows that laughter offers numerous health benefits. It enhances a specific blood flow in the brain, which helps a person become more energetic and happy. It has also been found that laughter can lead to a longer lifespan. Additionally, every time a person laughs, it aids in burning calories. Since it's beneficial for you, why not laugh more? Just imagine a world without laughter. It would be dull and filled with unhappy people, similar to that day when my cousin visited me. One day, I was feeling depressed. Nothing was going my way, and it was turning into a terrible day. Suddenly, my cousin came to @ORGANIZATION1 and surprised me. I was at @ORGANIZATION1 after school, looking at some things when she entered @ORGANIZATION1 and snuck up behind me, scaring me. We both burst into fits of laughter. She transformed a bad day into a fun one. We had a movie night, ate candy and pickles all night, made up songs, and sang them. We had an amazing time. The party lasted all night. I can't imagine what would happen to everyone if we never laughed. Without laughter, our relationship definitely wouldn't be as strong. It would seem like we were constantly sad or depressed. If there were no laughter, I wouldn't look forward to seeing her as much if we just sat around without laughing. For me, laughter is a significant part of having fun in any relationship. It shows that you're comfortable with the person and having a good time. If you've ever been down and wanted to give up, you know it's not enjoyable at all. But whether you watch a funny movie or talk to a friend and it makes you laugh, you know the joy it brings to your life. So, laughter must be an important part of your life and any relationship you have. Overall, laughter is one of the most important things a person can do to make others feel welcome and comfortable around them. It's also a great way to have fun and burn calories simultaneously. If you need more happiness in your life, watch a funny movie or hang out with people who make you laugh.
307	21097	8	2	"Some people view laughter as a way to express emotions, almost like an emotion itself. However, I perceive laughter as a form of communication. Of course, you laugh when something is funny, but the fact is that you can control it. So, why do people laugh? They laugh to convey a message; essentially, they're letting you know that what you said or did amused them. Over time, laughter can build or even initiate relationships because when someone laughs at or with you, you're sharing common ground. I know that laughter is vital in my life because, without it, I would have never met my best friend. When I started sixth grade, I was terrified. I was afraid of losing all my old friends and becoming one of those kids who sit alone in the cafeteria, longing for someone to share their greasy pizza with. I was clearly overreacting, but the thought lingered in my mind during the first few days. Soon, I noticed that my friends were finding new people to hang out with, and I began to feel like the outcast I feared to be. Then I met him. He was a skater with dark hair that fell past his eyes and pale, almost white skin. I was with one of my few friends, @CAPS3, when I saw him riding near the front of the school. I didn't think much of him except that he had the coolest shoes I'd ever seen. I was surprised when @CAPS3 walked up and started talking to him as if they'd known each other for ages. I followed to avoid looking like more of an outcast. As soon as we stood in front of him, he said something like an insult that I'd usually ignore, but this time it made me really angry. I retorted, and before I knew it, we were in a verbal fight. In the end, I knew one thing: I hated that kid, and he hated me. Towards the middle of the year, our school had a dance. It was my first dance, and I was extremely nervous. I got a ride with an old friend, @DATE1. I liked @DATE1 because he was friendly and non - judgmental. On the way to the middle school, he said he had to pick someone else up. It didn't bother me until we reached the house. The house wasn't impressive; I didn't care much about it. When I saw the kid's left foot step out of the house, I recognized the shoe immediately. As he got in the car, I pretended not to see him, but I failed. The car ride was incredibly awkward. When we arrived at the dance, I walked on the right side of @DATE1 to avoid confrontation. @DATE1 sensed the tension and stopped. His next words surprised me. ""Why don't you guys just get along?"" We stared at each other, and then the skater kid made another ""nice comment."" I thought it would be like the beginning of the year all over again, but I did something unexpected: I laughed. He laughed too. It was as if, for the first time, we were friends. We spent the whole night hanging out and dancing. We became friends. Throughout the rest of the year, our friendship grew stronger. We visited each other's houses and hung out at school. That's when I realized we were best friends. Even now, in ninth grade, we're still best friends. It's amazing how a small laugh can lead to such a great friendship. Laughter is truly important."
308	21098	8	2	"As I entered the classroom, anxiety made me shiver. I was the new fourth - grader, transferring from a public grade school to a @CAPS1 school. My mind was filled with questions, but I put them aside as I stepped into the room with a large white ""@NUM1"" on the exterior wall. I could literally feel my bones shaking from nerves. Surprisingly, no one approached me when I came in. I noticed that they were all gathered around a carefree brunette. No one even noticed me until the teacher looked up. After introducing myself to her and the class, I looked back at the brunette. She smiled at me as I stood there, my feet glued to the ground, staring blankly at her for a few seconds. When I learned that she was also a new student in the class, I understood why everyone was staring at her. I soon became envious of her because of all the attention she received. I was an unintentionally jealous child. As I noticed that everyone wanted to be her friend and I was somewhat ignored, my stomach twisted into knots each day. I developed feelings of suspicion and dislike towards her. Even her name, @PERSON1, sounded suspicious to me. I'd never heard of anyone with that name before. Fortunately, I sat on the opposite side of the classroom from her. Even after a month, I still felt uncomfortable around her, so I stubbornly avoided her. My birthday was approaching after my first month at @LOCATION1. I was starting to figure out who I wanted to be friends with and who to avoid. Unfortunately, I had to invite even the people I'd grown tired of to my birthday party because it was a class party, and I didn't want anyone to be left out. Since the class only had thirty people, I knew the news of the party would spread, and people would talk. I knew I hadn't established enough of a reputation for people to know who I really was or what my personality was like. As I put an invitation in each person's beige, square cubby, I hesitated when I reached ""#@NUM2"". This was her cubby number. The number of the girl with the strange name whom I'd developed an unjustified, grudge - like suspicion of. I cursed myself after putting the invitation in her cubby. When the party day finally arrived, everything was set up as I'd imagined. I even had the perfect @CAPS2 @CAPS3 cake. The guests started arriving, knocking on the glass door and leaving little grimy knuckle prints. @PERSON1 came alone. When I opened the door, she timidly and immediately thrust a gift at me and shyly mumbled ""Happy birthday."" I welcomed her as I did with everyone else and showed her to the backyard. The party went in different directions until my mom gathered everyone so I could blow out the candles. @PERSON1 stepped up next to me. With a confused look on my face, my mom leaned down to whisper that @PERSON1 had the same birthday as me and would blow out the candles with me. I couldn't believe it. The person I'd selfishly ignored was the one I had to share my cake with. After blowing out the candles, everyone left as the party ended, and I silently pouted about having to share my birthday. After the party, I went into the house and found @PERSON1 sitting on the steps. Her mom couldn't pick her up for another hour. I walked over and started making small talk with her. A few minutes later, my brother ran in with a big glob of frosting in his hand. He yelled ""Happy birthday"" and threw the frosting at my face. I was shocked and didn't know what to do. He ran downstairs to his room as I stood there with my mouth open. Then, I heard someone laughing behind me. I turned around to see @PERSON1 giggling. Without warning, I started laughing too. We couldn't stop. At that moment, I realized I was wrong about her. We spent the rest of the hour playing and laughing. By the time her mom came, we were begging for a sleepover. Although we didn't get one, I'd come to understand that @PERSON1 was someone I wanted to get close to. Through that first laugh, @PERSON1 became my best friend and remains so to this day."
309	21099	8	2	"My best friend @PERSON2 and I have a made - up tradition. Every time she comes to my house, we slide down the stairs in a sleeping bag. We came up with this idea @TIME1 when she was spending the @TIME1 at my house. While sitting on the staircase with nothing to do, an idea struck me. I turned to @PERSON2 and said, ""What could two little girls possibly do to have fun in the middle of the @TIME1, when all they have is a long staircase right in front of them?"" She replied, ""I'm listening."" We both got excited as we finally found something fun to do. I said, ""I'll show you. We need to get all the pillows we can find."" We scurried around the house, searching every room, and brought all the pillows back to the staircase. ""@CAPS3 Why do we need all these pillows?"" @PERSON2 asked, surprised when I said, ""For padding."" After the pillows were placed at the foot of the stairs, I told her my brilliant plan. She loved it! We couldn't wait to start. ""@CAPS5 The purple sleeping bag will be perfect for this,"" said @PERSON2. I ran to my room, grabbed my sleeping bag, and rushed back to the staircase. My purple sleeping bag is very slippery and was exactly what we needed to slide down the stairs. Even though @DATE1, @DATE1, we are fourteen and fifteen @DATE1 old, we still have a great time doing this. Over the @DATE1, we've improved it, making it more thrilling and a lot more fun. @PERSON2 and I have agreed on some safety precautions, which we thought were necessary. Although we're just using a sleeping bag, we've added to the activity and now agree to wear a helmet and sometimes add a few pillows. The helmet scares my mom because it's needed. One @TIME1, when my parents were out, @PERSON2 and I had eaten too much sugar and were extremely hyper. We were sliding down the stairs, but it was getting too easy and not as much fun as when we were about @DATE1 @DATE1 old. We wanted to make it even better. We started brainstorming. My brother's room was upstairs, and we wanted to incorporate his mattress into our fun. @PERSON2 and I dragged the mattress onto the staircase. We sat on the mattress, pushed off, and went flying down the stairs. We could hardly hold onto the mattress. As we went down the stairs, we slid off the mattress. We were laughing so hard that when we reached the bottom, we almost hit the wall! It was so much fun. After the first ride, we decided to put an extra pillow on the wall. One thing we didn't think about before going down the stairs was how heavy the mattress was. It was difficult to get it back up the stairs, but we didn't mind because we were having so much fun. @PERSON2 and I were getting tired, so we decided to take a break. We hauled the mattress up the stairs one last time and then plopped down on the couch in the other room. Not long ago, my mom bought an inflatable exercise bean. It was shaped like a real bean and had handles on both sides. @PERSON2 started playing with it and said, ""@CAPS6 Try it?"" We rushed back to the stairs, ready for more of the wild fun we love. Our imaginations were running wild. This time, we decided to combine everything for the ultimate ride. We put the mattress at the top of the stairs and positioned my sleeping bag. The plan was to sit on the exercise bean on the mattress, slide off the mattress onto the sleeping bag for a boost, and then fly into the pillows at the bottom of the stairs. I found some duct tape so @PERSON2 could tape the sleeping bag to the floor. @PERSON2 let me"
310	21101	8	2	THE @CAPS1  A couple of weekends ago me and my cusin were at my grandmas house. She lives up in the woods and has a bunch of quads and motorcycles. All me and my cusin did was ride,have airsoft gun wars, and build giant forts. We planned on only staying one night but ended up staying three.   So the first night we were there we built a fort out in the woods. The fort seemed really good at the time, but the next morning we had other ideas. So the next morning we were getting ready to go outside and work on the fort. He got done before me so he went down there first. By the time I got half way down there I heard him scream and come running out of the fort. He was yelling @CAPS2 .....MICCCCEEEEE! So i figued we must have a little @CAPS2 problem and laughed to myself. So I walked in there to see for myself and sure enough there was a bunch of little @CAPS2 running around in there. That was the end of forts on the ground for us.  The next day we decided to have airsoft wars(guns that shoot little plastic bb's). We were having alot of fun shooting eachother mainly because it hurt. Like I said we were having alot of fun until I decided to try and hid up in a little tree. He found me and shot me I fell out of the tree and broke my gun. That was the end of the wars plus I almost broke my leg. I guess that was payback for laughing about the mouse thing.  After the wars ending we decided to go ride quads for a while. There are alot of trails around her house to ride on. He road a dirtbike and I rode a quad, I road a quad so I could make new trails. We made some really good trails up there. It was really muddy up there and very wet. While we were way out in the woods on a long ride I ran out of gas. So I had to walk all the way back to the house for gas then walk all the was back up there.  The last day we were up there we got up early. We wanted to go out and look for a place to build a new fort. This time we were going to make a tree fort so we didnt have to worry about critters. We spent from the time we got up till the time we went home on this awsome tree for. My granndpa has alot of wood that he dosn't use because he really to old to build anything so we never ran out of wood.                          
311	21102	8	2	"We, including @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1, planned to go to the woods to ride quads and trikes. @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 had quads, while I was the only one with a trike. We loaded the trike and quads onto the truck and trailer and headed to the woods. Once there, we unloaded our vehicles and warmed them up, except for the quad with a clutch. The only way to start it was to pull it with the automatic quad. Wilber told @PERSON1 that he would get it started and asked @PERSON1 to pull him. I hooked the rope to each quad, and @PERSON1 took off quickly. Somehow, the hook came off and hit him perfectly on the back. He got up, looking like he was dancing. He lifted his shirt and asked if there was a mark. There was indeed a hook - shaped mark on his back. @PERSON1 started to tear up a little while holding his back. I didn't blame him; I would have reacted the same way. You could hear the snap when it hit him. I saw @PERSON1 trying not to laugh, and then @PERSON1 got off the quad and started chasing him. I finally got their attention and said, ""We came here to ride, not to fight."" Eventually, we got the bike going, but @PERSON1 was too scared to pull the quad, so I had to do it. As soon as the quad with the clutch warmed up, a cop car came and turned on its lights. We knew what we had to do. As soon as I saw @PERSON1 take off, I followed. @PERSON1 and I looked back, but @PERSON1 wasn't behind us. @PERSON1 suggested leaving him, but I thought that would be wrong. We went back, and the cop was surprised we returned. We asked @PERSON1 what happened, but he didn't know. After dealing with the cops all day, we tried to figure out what was wrong with the bike and found that someone had messed with the carburetor. It was a bummer that we can't get our licenses until 18, and for @PERSON1, it's 21. After that day, @PERSON1 promised never to go with @PERSON1 and me again."
312	21103	8	2	My family and I would occasionally visit our vacation house and stay for a couple of days or a week. It was a pleasant experience. We got to hang out with neighbors, ride quads, feed rabbits, horses, and cows, and even put on makeup. Sometimes, my dad and I would sit on the porch and enjoy the scenery. The sunset was beautiful, and the trees had lovely colors. There were deer wandering around, eating scraps on the ground, and cows walking along the fence, waiting for their dinner. While sitting there, we would talk about random things, play jokes on each other, and have a great time. One evening on the porch, my dad asked if I wanted to take a walk. I agreed, and we went into the pasture. He had a camera with him. As we walked and talked, he took pictures of everything. Suddenly, he started taking pictures of me. I saw the camera facing me and his finger on the button. I ran in circles, laughing so hard that I was crying and couldn't stop. He kept following me in circles, still taking pictures, and we just laughed and laughed. These moments at the vacation house were filled with joy and created wonderful memories for me.
313	21105	8	2	I believe laughter has the power to pull me out of the dark place where I sometimes hide. It creates a bubble of joy in my stomach that finally bursts, spreading happiness throughout me. Laughter feels like a warm @DATE1 day, with the bugs humming in the breeze. It makes me feel like I can float up to the cotton - candy clouds and laugh at everything I do. It turns my gloomy days around and makes me realize all the reasons to be happy. Sixth grade is a significant milestone for everyone. We get lockers, more freedom, and the chance to be around older kids. I always dreamed of laughing with my old best friend and giving boys our numbers, but that all changed when she moved away. At school, no one talked to me or hung out with me. My old best friend was always by my side, so walking through the crowded school hallways alone was uncomfortable. School became an unpleasant place to be for eight hours a day. Most sixth - graders dislike school because of homework, but for me, it was the feeling of being alone. Other sixth - graders, mainly girls, made fun of my appearance and my good grades. They stole my projects, books, papers, and supplies. I learned new knowledge but not how to socialize. Three - quarters of my sixth - grade year passed, and I felt incredibly alone. At night, I would cry a lot. @PERSON1 was my other best friend, but she stuck with the girls who bullied me. It was hard to be around them. One girl from another elementary school noticed my loneliness and talked to me. She invited me to hang out with her and her friends at lunch, but they were the ones who teased me. I went anyway, feeling nervous. At first, they said I was adorable, but then they spread rumors about me being a goody - two - shoes. @PERSON1 left the group to talk to me. She said she didn't know why she was with them. I was relieved. After that, @PERSON1 and I laughed together. We laughed at everything, even during boring assemblies. Laughter pulled me out of my lonely pit and helped me find true friendship. It has made me forget the bad times and realize that I have many reasons to laugh. Laughter is an essential part of my relationships, making my days more enjoyable.
314	21106	8	2	Many people think laughter is just an emotion, but in fact, it's a way of life. We use it to cheer others up or get out of trouble. People do silly things to make others laugh. I think laughter is a reason to live, and everyone needs more of it in their daily lives. I've always been the one to make people laugh and feel better, even if it means putting myself in pain. When I was a child, my friend was often picked on at school for no reason. I wasn't usually one to take action, but that changed when she came home covered in food and crying before school was over. She told me that some girls threw their lunches at her and called her names. So, the next day, I went to school with her, bringing @CAPS1 filled with chocolate milk, smoothie, egg yolks, and soured milk. When she pointed out the girls, I threw the chocolate - milk balloon at one of them, hitting her in the chest. She started complaining about her designer clothes. My friend was shocked but trying to hold back her joy. Then I threw the egg - yolk balloon into a girl's hair; her scream was very loud. The smoothie balloon hit two girls who were hugging for protection. They panicked and ran to the others. By the time they realized what was happening, I threw the biggest balloon filled with soured milk at them. It exploded among them, covering all of them. The school officials came out because of the loud screaming. The kids who saw the whole thing told me it was amazing and the girls' reactions were funny. Some were still on the ground, laughing so hard they couldn't breathe. Some thanked me because the girls had been bullying them. My friend was on the verge of tears and hugged me tightly. It's been ten years, and I still talk to my friend. The girls were transferred to different schools. Laughter is the source of joy and can bring people closer. My friend still says it was the best day of her life. Some of the kids who witnessed it now ask about me and want to see me do something like that again, but I told them they need to deal with their own bullies. I hope they can come up with creative ways to stand up for themselves.
315	21107	8	2	Laughter is an important part of any relationship. It can eliminate uneasiness and bring people closer, whether they are in the same room, talking on the phone, or communicating online. My best friend, @LOCATION1, and I have a special bond strengthened by laughter. Laughter can keep people together even in difficult times. @LOCATION1 is @CAPS1, and we've been friends for @DATE1 years. We met while playing an online game and immediately enjoyed each other's jokes. We would burst into laughter at the slightest funny comment. We shared many laughs over the next two and a half years. Recently, his family had financial problems and couldn't pay the internet and phone bills for several months. Work became more burdensome for me because I had few people to relax and laugh with. Only the occasional laugh with local friends could make me forget the disappointment of missing my best friend. @DATE1 weeks ago, there was hope that we could communicate again. While staying up @TIME1 one @TIME1 doing homework, I got a message from @LOCATION1. I remembered the good times we had just a month earlier. However, the message was just to thank me for the @CAPS2 gift and to say he was at a friend's house for the @TIME1. He also said he'd like to play games with me, but his computer didn't have the microphone drivers, so it didn't fully satisfy my need for laughter. That afternoon reminded me of our great times together. One @DATE1 ago, my hopes were fulfilled when @LOCATION1 told me he had internet again. We were thrilled to communicate after the @DATE1 break. I'm glad he got internet on a @DATE2 because we played and laughed until @TIME1. The laughter that @TIME1 washed away our disappointment. Now, my days are a good balance of work and laughter. Laughter truly brings people together. Even though my best friend and I are thousands of miles apart, when we laugh together, it feels like he's right beside me. I hope that someday we can be in the same room, sharing laughs and enjoying life. This is just one example of how laughter can improve a situation and make people closer.
316	21109	8	2	Laughter holds a significant place in my life. Spending time laughing with friends and family is the best way to pass the time. Reflect on all the enjoyable moments you've had, and you'll find that most of them involve laughter. This is because laughter and fun are inseparable. Since everyone loves having fun, it follows that everyone likes to laugh.  Laughter offers numerous benefits. It keeps you happy, helps maintain healthy relationships, and relieves stress. I'm one of those people who laugh when nervous, especially in awkward situations. For example, during my first high - school speech, I was extremely nervous.  It was a particular year, and I slouched in my chair, trying to make myself as small as possible so the teacher wouldn't notice me. I avoided eye contact and even placed my backpack in front of me to block her view. Every time she scanned the room to pick a student, I held my breath, hoping it wouldn't be me. When it wasn't, I'd breathe out in relief.  As the number of students left decreased, I knew my turn was near. I took a peek over my backpack and, unfortunately, made eye contact with the teacher. It was too late to hide. I pondered whether to tell her I wasn't ready or try to get out of it. I wiped my sweaty palms on my jeans and then stood up and walked to the front.  My speech was about school uniforms. My words were quiet and shaky, and I soon started tripping over them. Then, as always when nervous, I began to laugh. I could hear others in the room snicker, but I smiled, looked at my note - card, and continued.  After the speech, I felt a great sense of relief. It wasn't perfect, but laughing at my mistakes helped me get through the speech without succumbing to my nerves. Although not everyone reacts this way, laughter can relieve tension in some situations. However, one must be careful not to laugh in inappropriate situations. Chronic stress is harmful, and finding things to laugh about can be an effective way to relieve stress. While laughter may not guarantee a top - grade on a speech, it helped me stay composed. Laughter is essential for everyone as it's a great way to have fun with others and maintain happiness.
317	21110	8	2	Laughter is an innate ability that doesn't need to be taught. It has been with humanity since the beginning, yet we often overlook its importance. Laughter provides relief, joy, and has the power to bring people together, regardless of differences in background or language. In my opinion, one of its most crucial roles is fostering connections. When meeting someone after a long time or being in a group of strangers, a bit of laughter can break the ice and draw people closer.  I recall a time when I visited my family in @LOCATION2. I hadn't seen them since I was two. My brother and I were the only ones from our family making the trip, so we didn't have our mom to make us feel at ease or introduce us. I was worried about communication because, although I can understand and speak @CAPS1, I'm not fluent. Bonding with this part of my family was very important to me, and I feared the language barrier would prevent it. I was also concerned for my brother, who has limited proficiency in @CAPS1.  On the plane, I thought about how to introduce myself, topics to discuss, and prepared answers to potential questions. I didn't want the language difference to create an awkward atmosphere.  Upon arrival in @LOCATION2, specifically at @ORGANIZATION1 where many relatives live, my brother and I collected our baggage and looked for our uncles and aunts. We saw them waving enthusiastically, and we reciprocated. When we met, we exchanged hugs and greetings, but it still didn't feel like a family reunion. Everything was new and different, and jet - lag made it even more challenging.  The first night, we stayed at our oldest uncle and aunt's house. We had dinner and talked about our family back in @LOCATION1, but the conversation was awkward. Communicating with elder relatives who couldn't speak @CAPS4 was more difficult than I anticipated. I slept in the uncomfortable humidity that night.  The next morning, our uncle and aunt planned a dinner with our cousins and other relatives. Before that, my brother and I explored the area. We immediately noticed the differences from what we were used to and had fun embracing the novelty of being in a different country.  At the restaurant overlooking the ocean, I felt more at ease. My cousins, being younger (in their mid - twenties), were easier to relate to. As we ordered food and admired the view, my cousin started cracking jokes, and soon everyone was laughing. My brother and I laughed so hard we teared up. Throughout the dinner, there was constant laughter and smiles. At that moment, I truly felt a connection with my family. I'm grateful to my cousin for starting the laughter, as it helped us bond quickly. This experience made me realize how important laughter is in bringing people closer to those we love.
318	21111	8	2	"Everyone knows that coach @PERSON2 sr. is a source of laughter, with his jokes and pranks. If you don't experience any of this, then you're missing out.  It all began when my sister @PERSON3 made it to @CAPS1 in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2. She brought @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and me. We promised to create wonderful memories together. There's nothing better than sharing emotions with those who care about each other.  We arrived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 on a lovely morning. We were tired and hungry, so coach took us to @ORGANIZATION1 to buy snacks. He rushed to the @CAPS2.Pepper section. That old man always had to have one with him. As a cross - country coach, he wasn't always a good influence on his athletes. He disliked people touching his stuff, especially his @CAPS2.Pepper.  Seeing @PERSON2 all excited gave us girls an idea: we would take his @CAPS2.Pepper. It seemed as easy as stealing candy from a baby.  When we reached the hotel, coach told us to unpack so we could tour the place. While he got the room keys, @PERSON1 and I took all his @CAPS2.Peppers and stuffed them in our bag. We acted non -chalant. When we got the keys, he said he'd stay and unpack the rest. We didn't want him to do that, fearing he'd notice the missing pop. So we ran to the rooms, threw things on the floor, and planned to make him forget about unpacking and go on a @LOCATION3 tour instead.  That night, when we returned to the hotel, @PERSON2 hadn't mentioned his @CAPS2.Peppers. We thought we were so cool. It was late, so we had to go to our rooms. We were disappointed as none of us were tired, especially @PERSON3, who had raced in the morning.  Later, still awake and bored, we looked at the @CAPS2.Peppers. We considered drinking them but decided against it. We couldn't leave the room or have a party, so we went to sleep as the next morning was important for us and coach.  The morning of @PERSON3's second - biggest race, @PERSON2 woke us up. He stood there and said, ""I'm only going to say this once. I need my @CAPS2.Pepper."" We pretended not to know what he was talking about, finding it hilarious. His face turned red. When he threatened to stop @PERSON3 from racing, we got scared. Eventually, we gave him back the @CAPS2.Peppers. We learned that messing with @PERSON2 can be messy, but in the end, it was all part of the fun."
319	21112	8	2	"Laughter is an integral part of my family life. We often make each other and those around us laugh. When two or more of us get together, someone is bound to start laughing. Sometimes, the kids in our family play games to make each other laugh.  There's a game we play named the ""Laughing Game"" (though it has no official name). In this game, one person stands in front of the others. The goal is to make someone else laugh, and the first one to laugh takes the turn of the person in front. We don't play it often, only when there's nothing else to do.  One night, my two nephews and I were looking for something to do. My little nephew @PERSON2 suggested we play the laughing game. His older brother @PERSON1 and I weren't very keen at first, but since there was nothing else to do, we agreed.  As usual, no one wanted to go first, but eventually, someone stepped up. Once the game started, everyone was laughing and having a great time. However, after about an hour, it started to get boring. @PERSON1 and I were getting extremely bored and wanted to quit, but my little nephew didn't want us to.  When @PERSON2's turn came, he began by making silly faces and funny sounds, which we'd seen before, so they didn't work. Then, realizing we weren't going to laugh, he started telling a story. He said, ""There was this guy who only had his chair and his box. He loved them."" The story didn't seem funny at first, but he continued.  ""The guy went to bed because he was tired. When he woke up, his chair and box were gone. He searched all day and night but found nothing. So he decided to go to bed, hoping it was a dream. When he woke up, he'd turned into a wild boar.""  As he told the story, @PERSON2 started acting like a pig, and we all burst out laughing. The story got funnier as it went on, with strange things happening every time the ""guy"" went to bed.  My family values laughter and enjoys sharing it with each other. This experience with my nephews showed me again how laughter can bring us closer and make our time together more enjoyable. Laughter truly plays a huge role in my life."
320	21113	8	2	"Hey, Dad, do you know where the wax for my skin - board is?"" I shouted as I walked out of my room. My father replied, ""I think it's on the bookshelf. But why do you need it?"" ""It's for @PERSON1's birthday present. I don't have any money, and I promised him an amazing gift. We're going to take the canoe and ride down the giant sand dune at @PERSON2 @PERSON2."" My dad gave me a look as if I were the stupidest kid he knew and said, ""Why don't you just get money from us and buy him a card at the dollar store?"" I retorted, ""Dad, you know I don't take handouts. I'd rather work for the money, but I don't have enough time to work and hang out with @PERSON1 all day. It's his birthday, and this will be more fun."" I said with a mischievous grin. ""Alright, the canoe is already hooked up to the truck,"" my dad replied. ""Great, Dad. Can you give us a ride there and back?"" I asked, trying to make the puppy - dog face my sister uses to get what she wants. ""Only if you stop making that weird face. Do you want to drive?"" he asked as we walked out the door to pick up @PERSON1. ""Yes, please,"" I said as he tossed me the keys.  When we pulled into @PERSON1's driveway, I shut off the truck, stuffed the keys in my pocket, and walked into his house. I knocked on the wall, and two heads turned. One was my friend @PERSON3, a sandy - haired boy with a pale face, and the other was @PERSON1, with the same hair color but rosy cheeks. ""I thought I'd find you here,"" I said. ""What adventure are you taking me on today?"" @PERSON1 asked. ""You'll see soon. Put on some shorts and grab a pair of old shoes. I'll be in the living room watching @ORGANIZATION1 win their game,"" I replied. I waited outside @PERSON1's room while they changed. ""Alright, tell us now,"" @PERSON3 said. ""Not yet,"" I said with a mischievous grin.  @PERSON1 said goodbye to his mom as we left and headed for the truck where my dad was waiting. As @PERSON1 got in the back seat, he asked my dad, ""Do you know what your son is going to make us do today?"" ""Yes, but it's a surprise,"" my dad replied. @PERSON3 asked, ""Why is there a canoe on the truck? Are we going fishing?"" My dad laughed and said, ""I wish.""  I drove out of @PERSON1's driveway and headed towards @PERSON2. When we arrived, I found a parking spot, shut off the truck, and gave the keys to my dad. There was a drunk man waving a beer bottle and sitting on a log. I put the canoe in the water, gave each person a paddle, and said, ""Row to the other bank."" When we reached the other side, we pulled the canoe onto the sand at the bottom of a massive sand dune. ""We're going to push this up the dune, wax the bottom, and ride down,"" I said with a big smile. They said, ""You're crazy,"" but they started pushing the canoe up the hill.  At the top, we flipped the canoe, waxed the bottom, and pushed it to a good spot. We all jumped in,"
321	21114	8	2	"Laughter is a powerful force that can transform a bad mood into a good one and turn an awkward moment into a memorable one. It has the ability to bring people together and create a positive atmosphere. One bright day, my friend @PERSON1 called me and invited me to long - board to @PERSON2's for lunch. I was excited as I always loved their chocolate malt milkshake, croutons, and ranch. We long - boarded to @PERSON2's in downtown @CAPS1. On the way, we shared that we were both having bad days. @PERSON1 was upset because her friend @PERSON3 was treating her poorly, and I was in a bad mood as my friend @CAPS2 was mad at me for something that never happened.  When we arrived at @ORGANIZATION1's, it was crowded. After being seated, we started venting about our bad moods. Just then, we heard a strange sound that was a mix of a goose's honking and a donkey's braying. It was a lady's laughter. @PERSON1 and I looked at each other and burst into laughter. We couldn't believe such a sound could come from a human being. The fact that it was happening in a public place made it even funnier. Our laughter continued for about @NUM1 minutes straight.  Gradually, our bad moods started to lift. @PERSON1 began to smile more, and I couldn't stop smiling and laughing. Laughter truly has a unique way of relieving stress and making people feel better. Whether it's a normal chuckle or an unusual laugh, it can bring people closer. As someone once said, ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" and this experience proved it."
322	21115	8	2	In my view, laughter is an essential element in any relationship. You can't be serious all the time. Laughing allows you to relax, relieve stress, and lighten the mood, making people more comfortable with each other.  Take my relationships with @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1. We're always joking and laughing when we're together. For instance, when our varsity cheer squad went to @LOCATION2, a series of hilarious events took place. First, our coach left the keys on the locked bus. One girl noticed when she went to get her iPod. We tried to put @PERSON1 through the window, but it didn't work as the windows were locked. The coach had to call for another set of keys.  After the game, we went to @ORGANIZATION2 as the coach promised us cookie dough if we behaved. When we arrived, @PERSON1 and I ran out of the bus screaming. We were told not to run, so we started doing cartwheels and round - offs in the halls. That was also prohibited. Then we found a baby stroller and took turns pushing each other, which was also not allowed. We also put short dresses from a clothing rack over our cheer uniforms. When a staff member saw us, @PERSON1 ran off, and we got kicked out.  The craziest event of the night was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. When the bus stopped at a red light, I begged the coach to let us out. I ran out but fell in the mud. Another girl also fell. Even though the light turned green and we were being honked at, we were having so much fun.  In conclusion, laughter is crucial in relationships. It creates unforgettable memories and helps us connect with others. The night at @LOCATION2 will always be etched in our minds because of the laughter and the fun we had.
323	21116	8	2	Laughter is a vital component of a relationship. In my opinion, it ranks among the most important aspects. Take my relationships with @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1, for example. We're constantly laughing and joking whenever we're together.  When our varsity cheer squad went to @LOCATION2, a chain of comical incidents occurred. First, our coach left the keys on the locked bus. One of the girls realized it when she went to get her iPod. We attempted to get @PERSON1 through the window, but the windows wouldn't open. The coach had to arrange for another set of keys.  After the game, we headed to @ORGANIZATION2 as the coach had promised us cookie dough if we were well - behaved. When we arrived at @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON1 and I ran out of the bus shouting. We were told not to run, so we started doing cartwheels and round - offs in the halls, which was also forbidden. Then we found a baby stroller and took turns pushing each other, which was against the rules too. We also put short dresses from a clothing rack over our cheer uniforms. When a staff member saw us, @PERSON1 ran away, and we got kicked out.  The final crazy event of the night was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. When the bus stopped at a red light, I pleaded with the coach to let us out. I ran out but slipped in the mud. Another girl also fell. Despite the honking from passing cars when the light turned green, we were having a great time.  In conclusion, laughter is what makes our relationships special. It turns ordinary moments into extraordinary ones and helps us bond with each other. The events of that night at @LOCATION2 will always be a source of laughter and fond memories.
324	21118	8	2	"From birth to young adulthood, parents or guardians play a crucial role in raising children. Their responsibility is to instill good morals, life skills, and teach children how to thrive in society. @CAPS24 parenting involves being firm and strictly enforcing rules, which prepares children for adult life.  Although I'm still a teenager, I've learned a lot about raising kids from the stories passed down by my parents and grandparents. These small bits of family history are not only interesting but also significant. The memories my @CAPS1 shares about her childhood, especially those from the dinner table, are particularly precious.  My @CAPS1 grew up in the @DATE1's in a small - sized house with her @CAPS1, @CAPS3, and four siblings. Her @CAPS5 (my @CAPS6) aimed to teach his children proper manners and etiquette at the dinner table. The @PERSON3 children were expected to be calm, courteous, and mindful of their actions. However, for a fun - loving family like theirs, it was a challenge.  Spilling milk was a common occurrence at the dinner table, usually due to kids' funny antics or reaching for the butter dish. It was always hilarious, but laughing at the table was not allowed as it disrupted the formal atmosphere. As the children grew up, milk - spilling became less frequent but didn't disappear completely.  One night, it was my @CAPS6 who spilled the milk. The whole family was shocked. Everyone offered their napkins to clean up, and @CAPS3 maintained a controlled but annoyed look. After the mess was cleaned, @CAPS6 had a subtle smile on his face.  Years later, @CAPS1 and her siblings grew up, got married, and some started their own families. When the whole family gathers in @LOCATION1, there's always laughter at the dinner table. As @CAPS3 says, ""@CAPS24 we laugh so hard that tears run down our legs.""  I believe that the bond of love and the element of laughter are what make our family gatherings so special. My @CAPS6 successfully prepared his children for life, and now they can relax, enjoy each other's company, and laugh freely, even if there's a risk of spilling milk."
325	21119	8	2	Laughter is closely linked to happiness, and happiness is a key to life. When you laugh, it gives you a warm feeling inside. Let's consider a first - date scenario. You're excited and nervous about going on a date with a wonderful guy. You have a lot of thoughts like whether he'll like what you're wearing or think you're beautiful. Chances are, he's having the same thoughts.  When you get to the restaurant, if he's a gentleman and makes you laugh right away, it changes the whole atmosphere. You feel comfortable. On the other hand, if he talks about boring subjects, doesn't smile, and is quiet, the date will likely be uninteresting. Clearly, the couple where there's laughter is more likely to have a successful relationship.  Laughter and smiles are closely related. When you smile, you're happy, and when you laugh, you have to smile. Usually, when you're laughing, you're happy about something or someone. I love it when people make me laugh and smile because it makes me feel that everything will be okay, even when it might not be.  Many people don't realize that smiling and laughter are important parts of communication. Ignoring them makes a person seem boring. Everyone needs some joy in their lives. If they're lacking it, there are people who can help.  Think about gloomy people who are sad all the time and seem afraid of life. Maybe they've gone through tough times. A simple smile from you can lighten their hearts. It shows that you might sense they're not doing well, and it can make them feel a little better.  I work as a waitress at a restaurant in @LOCATION1. I love making people smile and laugh. One day, a sad - looking lady came in. She seemed to be going through a tough time, perhaps a divorce or a breakup. I sat down next to her, told her everything would be okay, and smiled at her. Immediately, her face lit up. It just goes to show that the little things like a smile and laughter can have a big impact on people's lives.
326	21120	8	2	"Whenever I think of laughter, my mind drifts back to the wonder years. Even though the memories are a bit hazy, I can still recall the times when I believed friendship was everlasting and laughter was the cure - all for every problem. When I was twelve on @DATE2, I remember the adventures that made me feel like I was soaring towards the sky. I was free - spirited and lived in my own world, an unstoppable soul. But I wasn't alone. Through various adventures and explorations, I found a trustworthy companion. Her name was @PERSON1, and she was my best friend.  @PERSON1 lived in the countryside, where the grass grew tall and the land was vast. We found a hideaway from the world among the forests and streams, and we named it our wonderland. Now, the small stream with a bridge is just a forgotten place.  On a typical @DATE1 @TIME1 in @DATE3, I drove to @PERSON2 on my way to @PERSON1's house. As soon as I walked through the front door, the sweet smell of fresh cinnamon scones drizzled with honey filled my nostrils. It sent shivers down my spine. @PERSON1 came down the stairs and greeted me with a hug. She had her long, dark hair in braids and was wearing a white sundress. Her brown, shimmering skin glowed in the sunlight, and her dark - brown eyes gave me a happy look. I was extremely envious of her. Next to her, I was just a simple, blond girl with a blotchy complexion.  Suddenly, she rushed to the window and looked out at the perfect, blue sky. ""Wow, finally @DATE2 has arrived,"" she whispered, then exclaimed, ""Another day free from grumpy, sleepless classmates, stuffy classrooms, and annoying teachers. It's the first day of many great days!"" We burst into laughter as I made fun of her poetic outburst, but we both knew every word was true.  Sighing, I took one last look at her beautiful dress and ran out to the field in her backyard. @PERSON1 grabbed a red cardigan, held a basket like Little Red Riding Hood, and followed me. I frolicked through the meadow like a radiant fox chasing its prey. When I stopped to catch my breath, I felt the wind blowing the tall, wispy grass around me in a rhythmic motion.  As I raced towards our secret place, I looked back only once to find @PERSON1. When I turned back towards my destination, a branch came into my view and knocked me down painfully. Blood trickled down my chin, leaving crimson droplets on the green grass. I gasped, choking on the salty blood, and then saw her standing there. Like a worried hare, @PERSON1 rushed to my side and helped me to the house.  We went into the upstairs bathroom. Standing at the sink, I shed a few tears. In the mirror, I saw a girl with a bloody slash across her chin and red, misty eyes. The pain was bad, but it was my appearance that really got me down. People would ask for days, ""What's on your face?"" and ""How did that happen?""  @PERSON1 came to my side and softly asked, ""How are you?"" My face turned bright red, as if I might explode. I turned to @PERSON1 and blurted out, ""Wonderful! Ecstatic! Before this, I was so plain. Now, with this terrible mark, I'll look even worse! I hate how gorgeous you are, @PERSON1. You're exotic, distinguished, and everything about you is so perfect!""  My friend just stood there, taking in every word. A confused look crossed her face, which slowly turned into a crooked grin. Suddenly, @PERSON1 burst out laughing. Embarrassed, I wanted to leave immediately, but she stopped laughing and grabbed my arm. I shook her off and continued down the stairs.  ""Hey,"" she called out, ""I'm not agreeing with you at all. You have a small cut on your chin, but you've always been beautiful. I feel like a simple field mouse next to you. The way your blond, thin hair forms perfect ringlets and how your freckles highlight your amazing, turquoise eyes. I've always been jealous of you! That's why I'm laughing!""  I thought about it for a second and then started laughing. I ran up the stairs, gave her a big bear hug, and laughed even more. All my thoughts about her beauty and mine suddenly seemed unimportant. At that moment, the pain from my cut became more noticeable. Lee, her dad, used his sewing skills to fix me up. With each stitch, I laughed with @PERSON1 to ease the pain. The seven stitches and the nasty scar remind me every day that laughter can help you through the worst, and it strengthens our everlasting friendship."
327	21122	8	2	"The wind howled, battering the side of the house with full force. My mom said she had never witnessed such a fierce storm in her life. The storm shook the house, causing the floorboards to creak in odd places. My relatives, @PERSON1, sat at the kitchen table, deep in thought and filled with worry. They had rental houses located acres away, surrounded by trees. The ground was soft and saturated due to the rain and flooding that had engulfed the valley. Hundreds of trees had already been uprooted, and it was likely there would be more.  The little homesteads near @LOCATION1, including my papa's, were well - built, weathered farmhouses. Most were surrounded by hundreds of acres of land. It was rare to find someone with less than @NUM1 acres there. The area was mostly covered with wheat fields, but you could also easily spot fields of corn, alfalfa, and rows upon rows of huge blueberries, so big that only @NUM2 could fit in the palm of your hand. It was like a small piece of paradise on earth, a slice of heaven that had either accidentally or deliberately been placed here. The sun was bright, and the sky was a clear, crisp blue. When the weather changed, giant fluffy clouds made the sky look like it was dotted with large pieces of cotton. The land was so flat that it almost seemed surreal.  I had spent many wonderful, laughter - filled summers there. I would run barefoot through the fields, play in the large expanse of lush, green grass, and feed the goats, chickens, and pigs with my siblings. On @DATE1, my mom said she had never seen a place so beautiful turn so ugly in such a short time. She said if she had known what was going to happen that day, she would never have let them get in the car.  My papa, @PERSON1, and @PERSON2 @CAPS3 left the driveway. Since the car was small, @PERSON1 volunteered to sit in the back. The storm had been raging for over two hours and showed no sign of calming down. They had set out to assess the damage on their acres of land and see what needed to be fixed once the storm moved over the mountains.  There was no explanation for what happened. No one understood why @CAPS3 walked away unscathed. No one knew how the tree fell or why it only landed on the back of the car, but it did. It was as if a destructive force had swept down. @PERSON1 was killed instantly, and my papa was seriously injured but alive. He spent weeks in the hospital.  In the small town, news of the accident spread like wildfire. Everyone loved @PERSON1. She was a social butterfly, always laughing, talking, sharing joys and sorrows with others. She knew everyone, and everyone knew her. That day, the heavens seemed to cry. The rain fell so heavily that it felt like the whole world was mourning with us.  It was incredibly painful to lose someone so dear. My papa cried until he had no more strength to feel. He loved her deeply and needed her. Lightning struck the giant oak in my papa's backyard that day. It was the same tree that held my grandparents' initials. The lightning split the top of the oak clean in two. Everyone saw it as a symbol of how my papa and @PERSON1 had been forcefully separated.  However, a few days before my papa returned home from the hospital, my dad climbed the giant oak and chained the severed part back together. In doing so, he created his own symbol, suggesting that they would always be connected, even if not physically. When my papa returned home and saw the oak, for the first time in weeks, a glimmer of understanding appeared in his eyes. A little hope settled over everything again.  @PERSON1's funeral was a beautiful, elegant, and simple affair, just like her. The whole town came and spent hours reminiscing about her crazy yet lovable nature. Then, from across the room, laughter started. At first, it was soft, but it grew louder. There were tears with the laughter, but it was laughter nonetheless. I had never seen the saying ""laughter is the best medicine"" more fitting. @PERSON1 believed that laughter, love, faith, and hope were essential in life. She brought joy to many, and now they were returning the favor."
328	21123	8	2	"When we were kids, simple things like watching @CAPS1 or seeing a kid squirt milk out of his nose would make us laugh. As we approached high school, we still found ourselves stifling giggles, suppressing outbursts, and laughing until we cried, each for our own reasons. We just couldn't hold back the urge to laugh. Some say laughter is the best medicine, but for my sister and me, it often got us into more trouble.  No matter how many times we were scolded, we always ended up nosing around in each other's rooms because we were so curious. I remember a few summers ago, I saw my sister, @PERSON1, hiding a bag of chocolate under her mattress. I was sure it was still there, even though there was a chance it might be gone. As I lifted the mattress and reached for the chocolate, the bed was suddenly pushed down, almost smashing my fingers. @PERSON1 stood there, glaring at me with her hands on her hips. I didn't know what to say or do. I let out a shrill scream and bolted for the door before she could get angry with me.  I ran up the stairs, around the couch, and through the kitchen, but I wasn't fast enough. Before I could lock myself in the bathroom, she grabbed my ponytail and yanked hard. I was in for a hair - pulling fight with my nine - year - old sister. Fortunately, my @CAPS4 heard my scream and came to check. Fighting was not allowed in our house, but that never stopped us.  @CAPS4's punishments were mild. We could either hug and make up or stand in the corner. The anger in @PERSON1's eyes had already disappeared, and a mischievous smile played on her lips. @CAPS4 was trying to be strict, but to us, the past four minutes were just a joke.  ""Stop,"" @CAPS4 said. That one word was all it took. We erupted in a fit of giggles and laughter. Although @CAPS4 couldn't have known, we didn't mean to be disrespectful; we just couldn't keep quiet. Our boisterous laughs echoed through the hallway, drowning out @CAPS4's words.  @CAPS4 grabbed our hands and pulled us towards the living room. We were half - dragged because we were shaking with laughter. We stood ten feet apart, looking straight ahead. But one look at each other and we started giggling again. We might have seemed like we were drunk, but in reality, we were just two rambunctious kids having fun.  Everyone has their reasons to laugh. Maybe it's as simple as reading an email that makes you laugh until you cry, or perhaps my amateur writing style amuses you, or you've witnessed a child's nose spurt chocolate milk. We all have things in life that make us want to laugh uncontrollably. From my experience, it's really hard to hold back, so we should just let it out."
329	21126	8	2	My friend @PERSON2 and I went to hang out with our friends in @LOCATION1. We knew how to get there but didn't think about how we'd get back. We just wanted to have a good time. We had a lot of fun, but as it started getting dark, we realized we needed a ride home.  I decided to call my dad to pick us up. Knowing my dad, he thought it was hilarious that we were stuck in @LOCATION1. He started laughing. After he stopped laughing, I asked if he could come and get us because it was getting dark. He said no, claiming it wasn't his fault that we were stuck there.  Then @PERSON2 suggested calling her dad. She made the call, but just like my dad, he also laughed and said no. Soon, we had no one else to call. We told each other that we could worry about it later since it wasn't that dark yet and we could hang out a bit longer. But then I thought that it would get even darker later and we definitely wouldn't have a ride home.  I told @PERSON2 that we should keep trying to find someone while we continued to hang out with our friends, but she didn't seem too concerned. I called my sister @PERSON1 to ask if she could pick us up from @LOCATION1. I called her multiple times, but she didn't answer.  An hour passed, and we still couldn't think of anyone. Then I thought of my other sister, @CAPS1. She always did favors for me. I called her and asked if she could pick us up. She said yes and would be there in @NUM1 minutes.  I went to tell @PERSON2 the good news. When I got back
330	21127	8	2	It was a normal sunny day in the country hill's of @ORGANIZATION1. The sun was out and shineing on the creek that me, my twin brother and my best friend were swimming in. The creek was fantastic. It was a deep swimming hole that all the neighborhood kids would swim in. Since all the other kids were either too old and busy to swim, or they were too young it was just us three that swam in the creek that @DATE1. We loved it. It helped cool us down during the heat of the day. We would play games like @PERSON1, and tag in the water. There was even a rope swing off the little brigde that one of the older kids made. The swimming hole was the place to be that @DATE1.  Eventually we got hungry and tired of swimming in the hole for a while. There was this trail we would use to walk back to my house. The trail was the fastest way to get home. From the trail you could see farm animals grazing in the sun filled fields. The day we walked this trail was a little different then normall. All the farm animals were making noise. One of the farm hands was walking the trail listening for a bell. He said one of his goats had gotten out. He warned us that the goat was alittle mean and if we saw it to keep our distance. So we took the warning and walked on. Once we reached the gravel road that lead to my house, @PERSON2 said she heard the bell. My brother and I didnt believe her at all. We thought she was playing another joke on us. We walked on for about @NUM1 seconds. All of the sudden @PERSON2 screamed run! My brother and i turned around and saw the white goat with big horns chasing us! We ran as fast as we could. I tripped over my feet and fell. I got up as fast i could and sprinted faster. I could tell my adrenaline was up because I was running really fast and i wasn't getting tired. We reached the hotwire fence that surround my house. We all stopped and questioned if we could jump over it or not. The goat was getting closer and closer, we didn't have much time to deside weather we could or not. My brother was the first to jump. Of course he made it and soo did @ORGANIZATION2. I was the last one. I started to panic in my head. I backed up alittle and ran and jumped over the fence. I thought i was gonna make it but then my foot caught the fence and i flung over the fence and face planted it. It was super embbarrasing. My friend and brother were both laughing histarically at me. I could tell my face was beat red and i was mad that i fell. Again. Although i still found myself laughing. The goat had stopped at the fence and started to charge it with his horns. That made me jump and run. I dived over a row boat were my brother and friend was and I said oh my lanta that was the funniest most scareiest thing i had experianced all @DATE1. We walked up to the house laughing and talking about eachothers faces as we where running and how funny it was that i face planted it. They made fun of the face i made when the goat started to charge the fence. Even though i was embarrased that i tripped over the fence, I still found my self laughing and making fun of myself for what had happened. I would have to say that was the best day all @DATE1. We got up to my house and went into the kitchen to find my mom laughing so hard that she was crieing. We all asked her what was soo funny and she said she saw the whole thing from the window. We all started laughing to point we all cried. We all told the story the story to our parents when they all came over for dinner and they laughed and laughed. All of our cheeks hurt by the end of @TIME1. Laughing is great. It mends the soul. Plus its a great ab work out!!!!
331	21129	8	2	Laughter holds a crucial place in a relationship. It is something we all require, as it helps us navigate through the world and our daily duties, especially when we often get frustrated. When someone is upset, they might watch a comedy movie or read a comic featuring funny or humorous characters. Many also prefer talking to someone to lift their spirits.  Once, I was distressed about my schoolwork and the lack of a job. After an argument with my mother about my dropping grades, I went for a walk. My mom was quite angry, and my dad was also disappointed because they knew I was more capable than my grades showed. They thought I shouldn't focus so much on getting a job and neglect my studies.  As I walked along the lakeside, I heard someone playing the guitar beautifully. I was eager to meet this person but couldn't find them. Eventually, I sat down, wondering who it could be. Suddenly, a boy with a guitar approached me and asked for the time. I told him and inquired about where he learned to play so well. He said he'd been interested in playing the guitar for a long time and wanted to join a band.  We started sharing our feelings, and before we knew it, we were confiding in each other things we'd never told anyone else. After that meeting, we became close friends and met every day. He knew I was tense, so he played the guitar for me, and we sang songs together. He also told me jokes, but sometimes I remained silent and didn't respond. I didn't realize that my lack of laughter was hurting him.  However, he never gave up on me. He kept telling funny stories, and we talked on the phone all night to ease my tensions and make me laugh. One day, he took me to my favorite place, @ORGANIZATION1's, for lunch. Then, he took me to a comedy movie about superheroes, but nothing could make me laugh. All the while, I was in his arms.  After the movie, he took me to a beautiful place near a beach, decorated with colorful lights. We sat on a swing and talked. He finally found a way to make me happy. He told jokes, and we read comic books. Surprisingly, I started to enjoy his jokes and the comics.  Whenever we met, he'd do something special to make me laugh. Once, he dressed up as a clown and tried to juggle balls, which made me laugh out loud. I knew it was a bit rude, but I loved spending time with him.  One day, he came to my home, held my hands, and proposed to me. He brought me a beautiful ring and took me for a drive. He gave me advice respectfully, not to put me down. He said that laughing and smiling are good for life. He believed we should live as we want and not force ourselves to be overly serious. He held me in his arms and said that no matter how much we love each other, laughter is essential in a relationship. When I asked why, he replied that it's for our happiness, health, and togetherness.  After spending some time together, he dropped me home and told me to live life to the fullest. From that moment, I realized he was right. I started looking at life differently and decided to live it in a way that would make me laugh and enjoy.
332	21130	8	2	"I've always adored hermit crabs. These cute little creatures that hide in their shells fascinated me. When I was around six, my family decided to take a road trip along a @CAPS1 coastline. We were joined by another family with four kids. In total, there were @NUM1 kids for me to play with, and the one closest to my age was @PERSON1, who was just a couple of years older. I really looked up to @PERSON1. We explored, swam, laughed, and played pranks on our siblings together. I basically did everything he did.  We visited so many beaches that I can't even remember half of them, but one in particular stood out. It was a narrow and short beach with a cave on one side. The cave was filled with hermit crabs. I'd never seen so many in my life. There were tiny ones, big ones, and even larger ones! It felt like our dreams had come true. @PERSON1 and I built sand castles, makeshift prisons, and water channels to keep the hermit crabs in one place. Our older siblings weren't interested in them at all, which was fine with us because it meant more crabs for us.  When it was time to leave, @PERSON1 and I were heartbroken. We knew we probably wouldn't find another beach like this in the future. We also realized we couldn't keep the crabs. We spent hours on the beach near the cave saying goodbye. When my mom finally shouted across the beach that it was time to go, we made a hasty decision. I'd seen girls hide shells in their bathing suits before, so I thought, why not? @PERSON1 liked the idea, so we quietly slipped two hermit crabs into our swim trunks. His crab went in the pocket of his shorts, and mine in my one - piece swimsuit. The swimsuit sagged at the bottom, but I tried to ignore it. I felt so guilty, as if I'd put a ten - pound rock in my suit instead of a tiny crab. When my mom asked me directly if I'd left all the hermit crabs on the beach, I just nodded, unable to speak.  On the road, my sister and I played word games. Everything seemed fine, with the music playing, my parents chatting, and the car rolling down the narrow dirt road. Every now and then, I'd have to shift a bit because I could feel my little hermit crab exploring its new surroundings. After about an hour of driving, I let out a blood - curdling scream. My dad slammed on the brakes, and dust swirled around the car like a hurricane. My mom turned around in her seat and asked what was wrong, but I couldn't answer. When the crab's pincers grabbed me again, I let out another urgent scream. I decided it was time to stop hiding my little friend. I let out one last long scream and pointed to my crotch. My sister quickly pulled off my swimsuit and found the little crab. I was so embarrassed and guilty, but my mom just laughed. She said I'd already been punished for lying and that I'd learned my lesson. I definitely wasn't going to argue with that.  A few minutes later, our friends also pulled over. When we asked if everything was okay, they said, while laughing, that one of the girls had been pinched by @PERSON1's hermit crab. That made all of us burst out laughing.  We still laugh about that story to this day. My family loves to tell it in front of friends, guys I like, or even adults I don't know. Every time my mom says the crab grabbed ""where it counts,"" we all start laughing, and I turn bright red with embarrassment. But I guess I deserve it.  @PERSON1 and I both learned our lessons. I think I learned a few extra ones. First, never put an animal near your ""sensitive"" parts. Second, don't lie because you'll probably get caught and punished. And finally, learn to enjoy something while you have it and let it go when it's time. If I'd just said goodbye to my hermit crab friends, I wouldn't have lied or felt so much pain. These were all valuable lessons, and I'm grateful for them because they made me a bit wiser, and I have a great story to tell that always makes people laugh."
333	21131	8	2	"I firmly believe that laughter is a significant part of life, a belief I've held since childhood. The quote ""@CAPS1 quote"" has had a profound impact on my life and the people around me.  My mother is a natural entertainer. People have even suggested that she become a comedian because our family stories are so amusing, many of which involve my brother. He's an adventurous, spontaneous person who isn't afraid of anything, though his decisions aren't always the smartest.  Most of the stories my mom loves to tell are from my brother's childhood. One particular story took place when I was around eight or nine, and my brother was eleven or twelve. We were at one of my soccer games. My brother needed to use the bathroom, and when he came back, my mom was far from happy.  He'd gone to the port - o - potty. He'd just gotten two new shirts: a white t - shirt to wear under a new button - up. It was a hot afternoon, so he took off the white t - shirt but kept the button - up on. Unfortunately, he dropped the white shirt into the foul - smelling excrement. He claims it was an accident, and my mom was not pleased.  My mom is the one in the family who truly cherishes laughter. I often think about her words of wisdom: ""@CAPS3 when it seems like nothing can get better, think of the positives in your life and laugh. Because really, that's all @CAPS4 can do. If @CAPS4 embarrass yourself in front of a lot of people, @CAPS4 need to laugh it off. If @CAPS4 can laugh about it, it won't matter if anyone else does."" We need to find a way to get through life, and laughter is the best way. It improves my mood and makes me feel at home.  There are numerous stories about my brother's antics or my own silly moments. But the most important thing is that we can laugh about something every day. It brings us closer as a family. The quote ""A day without laughing is a waste of a day"" truly holds true."
334	21132	8	2	"Laughter is what binds me and my friends together. It is an extremely important aspect of any relationship. Most of my memories involve my friends making me laugh, and @PERSON1 and I have been friends for a long time.  One of my favorite funny memories was when @PERSON1, another friend, and I went to @LOCATION1. We were on our way back home after a cultural performance at @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1 kept complaining about needing to use the restroom. Her dad told her to wait until we reached @LOCATION2. @PERSON1 and I suggested @ORGANIZATION2. By the time we got there, @PERSON1 was doing the potty dance.  @PERSON1, the other friend, and I got in line to order chocolate - dipped ice cream cones. While waiting, @PERSON1 was looking for the restroom. After about four minutes of searching, @PERSON1 finally asked the lady at the counter where the bathroom was. The lady gave her a key with a large, bulky wreath attached and told her the restroom was outside behind the building.  @PERSON1 took the key and ran towards what looked like double doors. She didn't know that only the left door opened. She ran straight into the right door and fell over. We all started laughing uncontrollably, especially @PERSON1. She laughed so hard that she had an ""accident"" on the floor of @ORGANIZATION2.  When you can laugh with your friends about things that might not seem funny to others, like wetting yourself in public, it strengthens your friendship. Laughter is a huge benefit in any relationship. It not only strengthens existing relationships but also helps build new ones."
335	21133	8	2	"My @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was a warm evening on @DATE1 @TIME1 in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. The stars were shining brightly, and the sky was cloudless. As is typical on weekends, most of the family and some friends had gathered at our place. I was a little girl who loved everything and everyone, especially laughing. Anyone could make me laugh and have a good time, but one person, my @CAPS1, could make me laugh for hours on end.  My @CAPS1, @PERSON1, came over to hang out with the rest of the group. He was chatting, laughing, and clearly having a great time. At that time, I was only about five or six years old. To me, aside from my dad, my @CAPS1 was the coolest person in the world.  That @TIME1, I was playing with my friends and not really paying attention to the adults. Suddenly, my @CAPS1 came up, gave me a big hug, and started talking to me. I was overjoyed. Since I loved joking around and laughing, I relished the attention. I used to call these bouts of uncontrollable laughter ""laugh attacks."" Whenever my @CAPS1 talked to me, I'd start laughing so hard that I couldn't stop.  That @TIME1 was no exception. My @CAPS1 and I were joking and teasing each other. Then, I realized that I was laughing so hard that my stomach hurt. The laughter continued for about an hour, even after my @CAPS1 left and went back to the adults. My friend, @LOCATION2, sat next to me and tried to get me to stop, but she was also laughing, though not as much as me.  After about an hour, I finally managed to calm down. The rest of the @TIME1 was great, but every now and then, I'd start laughing again. I couldn't stop giggling until I went to bed.  After a fun - filled @TIME1, everyone left. When my @CAPS1 came to say goodbye, I was sad to see him go, but I knew I'd see him again. The next day, I was able to stop the uncontrollable laughter. I still smiled and spent time with my family, but I wasn't laughing non - stop.  My @CAPS1 has always been and still"
336	21134	8	2	I've always strived to be a happy individual, and over the years, I've come to understand that laughter is a crucial element of my happiness. Throughout most of my life, I've managed to be a joyful girl. Even as an infant, I rarely cried; I was constantly laughing and giggling. As I've grown up, I've attempted to maintain my carefree spirit. Of course, there have been times when this wasn't possible, but that's just life.  There have been numerous instances in my life where laughter was all around me. I depend on laughter to strengthen my bonds with friends, and so far, this approach has always proven successful for me. I frequently find myself reflecting on the fact that laughter and happiness are truly what life is all about.  When I was born, I didn't cry. As a baby, I hardly ever shed tears. Whenever I ask my mom about my infancy, she always reminds me of this. As a young child, I wanted to be involved in everything around me! I was constantly seeking laughter and exciting experiences; I didn't want to miss a single moment! My mom would have to take drives just to get me to take a nap, and even then, I rarely fell asleep. After all, I was terrified of missing out on a moment of laughter! If someone else was laughing, I'd laugh along with them. Sometimes, I had no idea what was so funny, but I loved the feeling of sharing laughter with others.  Looking at my baby pictures always brings back memories of my happy toddler years. Unlike most kids' baby pictures, there isn't a single one of me crying. In every photo, I'm either laughing or wearing a wide smile! Laughter is what kept me a happy baby.  As a pre - teen, I was still the girl who was always laughing and smiling. I sometimes wondered what it felt like to cry because I'd never experienced it. I was so immersed in laughter that I never had time to dwell on the negative. Unfortunately, I now know what sadness and being upset feel like, and I try very hard to return to the time when I was oblivious to these emotions. Whenever I'm feeling down, I try to find humor in everything I do. When I do this, I can always find something to laugh about, and my spirits are lifted.  My friends are always a source of comfort for me. Especially my best friend, @PERSON1. Every time I'm with her, I find myself laughing for one reason or another. @PERSON1 and I haven't always had a stable friendship, but what always brings us closer is laughter. Our arguments always end when we find something funny in common. Usually, she's the one who finds this and makes me laugh. Laughter is what has kept @LOCATION1 and me close for the past few years. If laughter didn't exist, I'm sure we wouldn't be friends right now.  In conclusion, laughter has been the key to my happiness throughout my life. It has helped me build and maintain friendships, and it has allowed me to see the bright side of life even during difficult times. I will always cherish the role that laughter has played in my life.
337	21135	8	2	"A moment when laughter truly made everything better was when I was in @LOCATION1 with my cousin @CAPS1. He's soon off to the @CAPS2, so spending quality time together was our top priority. @CAPS1 and I share a close bond; we talk on the phone as often as we can. This trip held great significance for both of us, as we have no idea when we'll see each other again. Every laugh and smile during this time will be etched in our memories forever.  My parents and I traveled to @LOCATION1 for @CAPS4. In @LOCATION1, I met up with my cousins while my parents were constantly occupied. As expected, a group of teenagers was bound to be noisy. I vividly remember that on @DATE1, my cousins and I got lost in the tiny town where we were staying. It's almost impossible to get lost in such a small place, so we found it incredibly funny and unbelievable. Fortunately, it was during the @DATE1, so it wasn't too scary. We blamed the taxi driver for not following our directions rather than taking the blame ourselves. The entire situation was such a hilarious mess that we didn't stop laughing until we reached our destination. In the car, the three of us argued about which way to go and which turns to take, while the taxi driver just listened and laughed at us. It was so embarrassing that none of us wanted to see that taxi driver again.  @CAPS1 is older and much taller than me, and he was the tallest person in town. He always boasts about being fearless and brave. However, one night, all that bravado was forgotten when he spent the @TIME1 in a state of panic. I shared a room with two other cousins, and @CAPS1 stayed in the next room with my brother. At around @TIME1, when we all went to bed, we suddenly heard a strange noise outside our room. The next thing I heard was @CAPS1 yelling in the other room, wanting to come sleep with us. I was also scared, so my cousins and I let him in. I turned on the light as @CAPS1 and my brother entered the room. My brother @PERSON3 came in with all the blankets and pillows, while @CAPS1 brought in the airbed. It was such a comical sight that we all burst into laughter. @CAPS1 said, ""I may be big and tall, but I get scared easily,"" which made us laugh even more. The noise turned out to be two cats fighting in the street.  This moment stands out clearly in my mind as it encapsulated our entire family vacation. While my parents and grandparents were outside on the front lawn with the guests, my cousins, @PERSON3, and I were in my room, as usual, where the funny moments always seemed to happen. We were bored and didn't know what to do. I was starting to fall asleep on top of a suitcase when my cousin @PERSON1 came up with the crazy idea of fitting me into the suitcase. I thought she was joking at first, but when I looked around and saw everyone's serious faces, I realized they were being serious. So, I opened the suitcase, emptied it, and @CAPS1 went to get his camera. Next thing I knew, I was trying to get into the suitcase. I'm not very flexible, so when I found it surprisingly easy to get in, I freaked out. My brother was laughing so hard that he was practically wetting himself, and my cousins were stunned by what they were seeing. When it came to zipping up the suitcase, I initially refused, but they convinced me to do it so they could roll me around. @CAPS1, @PERSON1, my brother, and my third cousin @PERSON2 took turns rolling me. They even suggested going out to the front lawn to surprise my parents. I finally got out of the suitcase feeling dizzy after my brother dropped it on the cement floor. After I recovered a bit, we laughed and joked about how small I am and how much fun we'd had. Since then, @CAPS1 has called me ""@CAPS13"".  Saying goodbye to everyone was difficult, but saying goodbye to my cousin @CAPS1 was even harder. Knowing that I won't see him for a long time is unbearable. @CAPS1 and I have a strong bond, and I see him like a brother. During our trip, we chose to focus on having fun and ignore the pain of the impending separation. Laughter made that pain more bearable and made our trip truly unforgettable."
338	21136	8	2	My best friend @PERSON2 turned thirteen on a lovely @DATE1. Her family owned a boat, and since the weather was neither uncomfortably hot nor chilly, @PERSON2 decided to have a sleep - over birthday party on the deck with some of her closest friends. I was nervous about meeting her school - going friends because I'd always been homeschooled and wouldn't know anyone there.  When I arrived at the boat, @PERSON2 introduced me to her friends @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. I greeted them all, and @PERSON2 suggested we go @CAPS2. I was ready to head to the beach, but @PERSON4 said she wanted to go @CAPS2 right on the docks. Swimming by the boats was not allowed, and I was sure @PERSON2 would say @CAPS1 immediately. However, she walked over to the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sign, tore it down, and tossed it in the harbor. Her friends laughed, and I joined in. I'd never witnessed such behavior before, but their disregard for rules was contagious.  As the day passed, I observed how they talked and behaved. The girls used bad language and spoke harshly. Their words were loud and shocking, and their actions were wild and challenging to authority. They seemed so free, but there was something forced about their interactions with each other. I wondered if they were truly like this or just pretending. I realized that to be part of the group, I had to act like them. It was my first experience with peer pressure, and I was unsure what to do. But their attitudes were straightforward, so I adapted and started behaving like them.  It became evident that for there to be a group, there had to be someone outside of it, and that someone was @PERSON3. @PERSON2's parents had made her invite @PERSON3, and @PERSON1 knew this. They would sit close together, leaving no room for @PERSON3. When @PERSON3 tried to make a joke, they'd look at her disinterestedly without laughing. I understood that if I hadn't adapted quickly, I might have been the one left out. I also knew they could turn on me if I made a mistake.  We were sitting on the boat's deck talking about movies. @PERSON3 was trying to tell the group about a movie she'd just seen and loved. @PERSON1 stared blankly at her, refusing to smile. @PERSON4 looked off into space, and @PERSON2 rolled her eyes at me. Suddenly, @PERSON1 interrupted @PERSON3 and started talking about a scary movie she'd seen. @PERSON3's eyes widened, and then she looked down at the ground. Without thinking, I laughed and reached out to her arm, saying I wanted to hear more about her movie. I'll never forget the way her face lit up at my simple act of kindness. She smiled and began to excitedly talk about how amazing the movie was. @PERSON1 continued her story while watching @PERSON3 and me.  At @TIME1, when we went to the movie theater and the girls chose a row with only enough room for four, I moved to sit with @PERSON3 in the next row. We talked about the absurdity of straws for drinks and how we'd never wear skinny jeans. It was easy to talk to her; I didn't have to filter my words to avoid making anyone dislike me. Even when we were back at the boat, I tried to be myself. I'd never had to focus on being true to myself before, but I knew that if I did, @PERSON3 would have someone to talk to. To my surprise, everyone became more natural. Soon, we were all joking about what ridiculous things @PERSON2 should wish for on her birthday. I suggested a lifetime supply of marshmallows, @PERSON4 suggested the original @CAPS3 of @CAPS4, and @PERSON3 suggested that everyone in America should speak with a @CAPS5 accent on @PERSON2's birthday from then on. Everyone laughed.  This experience taught me that kindness is more powerful than cruelty. Making someone an enemy or an outsider doesn't strengthen a friendship, nor does constantly worrying about saying or doing the wrong thing. Integrity and kindness can bring people closer together.
339	21137	8	2	"In my view, laughter is an extremely important part of life. Without it, life would lose a great deal of its charm. Laughter can be a wonderful thing, but it can also be a bit hurtful at times. Fortunately, my story is about the wonderful side of laughter.  It all began on a day when my cousin @ORGANIZATION1 and I were at home. It was an ordinary day. My mom was out in town, and my dad was at work. @ORGANIZATION1 and I were having a great time because it was a @DATE1, which meant school ended at eleven o'clock. Since we knew mom wouldn't be home until later, we had plenty of time to get things done.  The first thing we usually do when mom is away is to get our music and turn it up @CAPS3 loud. Since it was just the two of us at home, we didn't care how loud it was. That particular @DATE1 was a bit of a surprise. We felt an unusual sense of positivity and high energy, as if we were on a ""natural high."" We were ready for anything.  While we were cleaning the kitchen with the music blaring, we could hardly understand each other when we talked. Then, after a while, when the music stopped, there was a sudden rush of silent cleaning in the kitchen. @ORGANIZATION1 and I often think alike. It's really strange; sometimes I feel like she's my sister rather than my cousin.  Out of nowhere, in complete silence, we started to sing. We didn't realize that we were singing the exact same song at the exact same time. Once we became aware of this, it gave us a bit of a creepy feeling. We thought to ourselves, ""@CAPS4, how can two people be so similar?!"" After that incident, we continued with our work.  Even to this day, @CAPS6, we often do a lot of the same things. We are very @CAPS2"
340	21138	8	2	"Closer @CAPS1 @CAPS2  In life, I think that laughter is a very important element. Without it, everything just wouldn't seem as fun. Laughter can be a great thing, or it can be a little hurtful at times. Luckily my story is of great laughter. So, i will be telling a story of one of my adventures of laughter.  It all started one day when me and my cousin @ORGANIZATION1 were at home. It was pretty much a normal day. Mom was out and about town, and dad was at work. @ORGANIZATION1 and I were having a great day because it was a @DATE1. Which meant school only went until eleven o' clock. With mom out and about town, we figured she wouldn't be home until much later. That gave us plenty of time to get everything accomplished.  First thing we usually do when mom's gone is go get our music, and turn it up @CAPS3 loud. Since it was just the two of us home, we didn't care how loud it was. That particular @DATE1 was a surprise to us though. For it was strange enough to seem as a ""natural high"" day. We felt very positive with high energy. We were practically ready for everything.  With the music so loud while we were cleaning the kitchen, we could barely understand each other talking. Then @CAPS5 awhile when the music stopped, it was just silent rushed cleaning in the kitchen. @ORGANIZATION1 and I tend to think a lot alike. It is so weird. Sometimes I feel like she's just my sister instead of my cousin. Anyway, out of no where, and complete silence, we started to sing. I don't think we realized we were singing the same exact song, at the same exact time.  Once we realized that we were doing the same exact thing, it sort of creeped us out! We thought to ourselves... ""@CAPS4, how can two people ever be so much alike?!"" @CAPS5 that happened, we went on finishing our work. '@CAPS6 this day, all the time, we do a lot of the same things. We are very @CAPS2, much like sisters. I'm going to miss her so much when she leaves!"
341	21140	8	2	Laughter is a powerful force that makes the world a better place. It is the essence that cements friendships and relationships, often leading from romance to marriage. Without laughter, people would be perpetually sad, depressed, and stressed. They would trudge through life with a heavy heart, and the world would be fraught with more wars. In essence, the world could not thrive without the presence of laughter. This is the significance of laughter as I understand it.
342	21141	8	2	Laughter is an integral part of life. The act of laughing provides comfort, as it gives the feeling that everything is alright at that moment. It serves as a form of communication that brings people together. When one person laughs, it often triggers others to join in, creating a shared sense of happiness. It's like silently telling everyone around to be happy.   However, there's a difference between laughing with someone and laughing at them. I recall one day at home while doing the dishes. Everyone in my family, including me, was frustrated. I dislike anger, both in myself and others. So, I said something (I can't remember what), and suddenly, everyone started laughing. This lightened the mood for all of us.   I view laughter as fire, where one candle can light many others. When we hear people laughing, our first thought is that something funny is happening, and we're eager to find out what it is so we can laugh too. This is a common reaction for those who enjoy laughing. Personally, I love laughing because it gives a strange yet wonderful feeling. It truly enriches our lives.
343	21142	8	2	"Laughter between friends is a tell - tale sign of a strong bond. It can lift your spirits on a bad day and is a clear indication of a great relationship. Laughter has been the glue between my two best friends, @PERSON1 and @PERSON3, and me. We've been friends for @NUM1 years. We're extremely close, doing everything together: hanging out, playing soccer, living nearby, and, of course, laughing.  @PERSON1 loves camping with her family in the @DATE1. For the past @NUM2 years, she's invited @PERSON3 and me along. On the last trip, I was texting a lot since I was the only one with service at the campsite. @PERSON1's mom scolded me, which made me angry. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 sided with her and also yelled at me. I yelled back, not liking that they were ganging up on me. I snapped, ""I know, I'm getting off the phone. Just shut up!"" They were shocked and intimidated. The atmosphere became awkward, and we stopped talking.  Then, our friend @PERSON2, who was also on the trip, fell flat on his face while attempting a cartwheel. Despite our anger, we couldn't help but burst out laughing. This made us realize that we shouldn't be mad at each other. We knew a small fight wouldn't end our friendship. We hugged and apologized. This incident shows why laughter is so great. It can strengthen bonds and repair relationship damage. In my case, laughter has fixed many problems and will continue to do so."
344	21143	8	2	Laughter is the cornerstone of all my friendships. If I can't make a person laugh or vice versa, it's difficult to find common ground. The simple joys in life bring about laughter, and in friendships, when differences surface, a shared funny memory can quickly mend the rift.  My best friend, @PERSON1, and I have a unique dynamic. Things that aren't usually funny become hilarious when we're together. Since we no longer go to the same school as we did @DATE1 @DATE1 and don't hang out as often, our time together is even more precious. Three nights ago, I had dinner with @PERSON1 and her mom at @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We had numerous laughing fits during the meal. People around us either find us annoying because we can't stop laughing or understand the joy of having a best - friend who brightens your days and think we're funny.  @PERSON1 and I have never had a real fight. Over the @DATE1, we've become so close, realizing we're like twins, so conflicts rarely arise. However, @PERSON2, another close friend who goes to my previous school with @PERSON1, has been having issues with @PERSON1. Their friendship is crucial to me, and I'd do anything to reconcile them, though I may not have the power.  I've been with both @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, so I understand their feelings. I tried to bring up the subject with @PERSON1, and at first, she rejected it. I knew they had only had a small, silly argument and that both were being stubborn, refusing to apologize first as they thought they were right. It was just a miscommunication.  I detailed @PERSON2's feelings to @PERSON1 while making her laugh. Once she started laughing, she began to see things from @PERSON2's perspective. She wasn't ready to fully make up, but she was willing to consider communicating again, which made me feel good.  For the rest of the @TIME2, we put aside the drama and had a great time, laughing at the smallest things. I know that as I grow older, I'll look back on @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 and cherish how they made my high - school years amazing. Laughter is truly the key to my friendships, especially in our youth.
345	21144	8	2	Laughter has the power to draw people closer, especially when it comes from shared memories. When we laugh at the moments spent with someone, it can strengthen our bond and be vital to the relationship. This happened to me when I watched a special video from my past.  It was at a family party when I was three and my favorite cousin was two. My cousin was chubby with straight hair and sick with a fever that day. I had curly hair and was short. We both wore dresses, but in different styles. Everyone at the party was having a great time, and so were we.  The video showed us bouncing up and down, grabbing our dresses, and putting on a show for the party - goers. We were supposed to be dancing and seemed to be having a blast. Then, my youngest brother came over to watch us, carrying a cup of soda. A grown - up got up from their chair, bumped into him, and he dropped the soda, splashing my cousin and me. Our dresses got wet, dirty, and sticky. We stopped dancing, sat on the ground, and cried.  My aunt and mom changed our clothes. We were mad at my brother and ignored him for a while. But later, we had fun again and started talking to him.  When the video ended, my cousin and I laughed at the memories. We realized how innocent we were at that age and how much we had changed. We also understood that it wasn't my brother's fault. Laughing at these shared moments helped us become more united.  Laughter at different times in life can bring people together. Even if feelings change over time, sharing the moment of happiness through laughter is important. I often recall these family memories, and they bring us closer, making laughter a precious part of our relationships.
346	21145	8	2	I firmly believe that laughter emanates from the heart and soul. It truly reflects one's innermost feelings towards another person and vice - versa. When someone makes you laugh, it's a clear indication that they genuinely love and care about you. Similarly, if you and someone else share laughter, you've found a truly special connection.  Laughter can be sparked by various things like jokes, funny videos, and stories. It's an essential part of any relationship, as it brings joy and fun. My mother always said that laughter helps clear the mind and body. In fact, when someone makes you laugh, they see the real you and your potential.  There are times when people laugh uncontrollably, and it's just a natural feeling. Sometimes, you might tell jokes that don't make much sense, but they still manage to evoke laughter. For instance, at a party with friends, a moment of quiet can be broken by a shared laugh.  As a teenager, I've heard many funny things over the years, but I tend to forget them easily. I'm not always quick to understand jokes, but after some thought, I usually get them. I've also been the subject of some light - hearted jokes, and I don't mind at all.  The first time I laughed could be because someone special tickled me or told a funny story. Laughter is a way of showing your feelings and connection to someone. If you don't laugh, it might seem like you're missing out on what they're trying to convey.  I often tell myself that if I don't laugh, I haven't cleared my mind or soul. Whether it's looking at myself in the mirror and making funny faces or having a great day, laughter is a vital part of life. In conclusion, laughter enriches our relationships and makes life more enjoyable.
347	21146	8	2	"Laughter serves as a powerful means to share memories and is a crucial element in storytelling, indicating that the listeners are engaged and enjoying the narrative. When you share a laugh or a smile with someone, it's as if you're sharing a unique and intimate secret. It transcends differences in wealth and age, as everyone has the ability to burst into laughter. Inside jokes are particularly special, as they can bring smiles and giggles from the moment they're created to the slightest mention of them.  I feel a personal responsibility to make people laugh. A vivid memory from my childhood was when I was seven, spending the night at my friend @PERSON1's house. After watching @CAPS1 @CAPS2, we were extremely hungry for lunch. Unfortunately, @PERSON1's big sister @PERSON2, who was the only one home, wanted nothing to do with us, so we had to fend for ourselves.  Instead of a mundane @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 sandwich, we decided to make @NUM1 cupcakes. Despite the seemingly absurd goal for two seven - year - old girls, we were full of ambition. However, it quickly turned into a disaster. We had no idea what a mixer was, so we mixed everything by hand. The real chaos began when I brought out the flour. Just thinking about opening a jar of flour now reminds me of the huge mess we made that day.  I slipped on some spilled vegetable oil while pouring a large quantity of flour into the bowl, and the flour went everywhere. @PERSON1 started laughing immediately as the room filled with a white powdery cloud. I was initially in shock, covered in what felt like enough batter to feed the world. As a child, laughing was the most important thing, but as an adult, I realize I'd probably be less light - hearted about such a mess.  We started playing in the flour, throwing it in the air like confetti. When @PERSON2 came downstairs and saw the kitchen, she was furious and demanded that we clean it up. But we ignored her and continued playing for the next twenty minutes, even building a fort out of what we called ""snow.""  When @PERSON1's mom came home and saw the kitchen, she was shocked and angry. We ran to the basement, but eventually climbed back up. @PERSON1 started explaining the situation, and I stayed quiet as I'd never been in trouble with someone other than my mom. Just when we were on the verge of crying, @PERSON1 pointed out the flour in my hair and started laughing again.  From this experience, I've learned that laughter can be the best way to cope with difficult situations. Even though I've moved away, I'm certain that just the mention of this story will make @PERSON1 and me laugh if we ever talk again."
348	21147	8	2	"Laughter holds a significant place in my life, especially in relation to my grandparents. I always hoped to see my grandfather @PERSON1 laugh during his final days. When I was five, I loved drawing, and my grandpa would offer me valuable tips on shading, texture, and the overall image. The smile on his face when I mastered his techniques was one of my favorite sights.  I spent a large part of my childhood in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, where my grandparents lived. I can't recall my last visit to @CAPS1 lanes bowling alley, but I vividly remember my first time there with my grandparents. There was so much for a young child like me to do.  Around @NUM1 years ago, my grandpa put potatoes in the microwave instead of his coffee and made hash browns, which made us laugh. There were many things I wished I could have done with my grandparents, like fishing or camping. However, I also have many wonderful memories. My grandpa painted my boy scouts derby wooden race car and came to all my races. Strangely enough, I often got @NUM2 place.  My grandparents had a collie dog named @ORGANIZATION1, which I named when I was young. My grandpa, @ORGANIZATION1, and I would go on walks together, and my grandpa loved training the dog. @ORGANIZATION1 was incredibly obedient, fetching the mail, opening and closing doors, and even getting my grandma's slippers.  When I lived in @LOCATION4, @ORGANIZATION2, my grandparents would pick me up from school every day. Grandma would help me with math homework and cook dinner, and then grandpa would assist me with drawing or turn on my favorite @CAPS2 show. In the morning, grandpa would have recorded my favorite show ""@CAPS3 the @CAPS4"", and then we'd have breakfast.  As I became more independent, I didn't visit my grandparents as often, and I deeply regret that. Some home videos I recently watched reminded me of the good times we had. For example, my grandpa recorded me chasing the dog around the kitchen table and stubbing my toe, which made the whole family laugh.  My grandpa was a barber shop owner in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2. One time, I convinced him to give me a mullet haircut, which I immediately disliked.  During the last @CAPS5 with my grandpa, I used the money from my @DATE1 job to buy him presents, including a heating blanket, movies, and his favorite "" @CAPS6"" chocolates. It was heart - warming to see him so happy.  Looking back on my life with my grandparents, I realize that the best moments were filled with laughter. Although I can't change the past, the memories of laughter will always be precious to me."
349	21148	8	2	Laughter is an indispensable part of any relationship. I know of a couple who firmly believe that their relationship wouldn't have survived without laughter. Laughter shortens the distance between two people. Even if you don't see each other frequently, shared laughter can maintain a strong and meaningful relationship.  In my own experience, I had a boyfriend with whom I could laugh all day. Our laughter was a way of expressing our feelings for each other. Instead of long conversations, we would just laugh, and that was enough to show our happiness and connection.  We would sit on the couch, look into each other's eyes, and start laughing at something one of us had said earlier. Even during our fights, we would still find things to laugh about. When I was upset, he always knew what to say to make me laugh, which showed that he cared about my well - being.  A real relationship is hard to find, especially with a guy who can make you laugh when you're angry or sad. Even when he was mad at me, he would try to make me smile. If you can't be happy and laugh with the person you claim to love, then the relationship might not be right for you.  Laughter can bring a relationship closer in many ways. If a relationship doesn't work out but you've shared laughter, it's likely that you'll remain great friends. I firmly believe that laughter is the shortest distance between two people and makes the bond between them stronger. In conclusion, laughter is the key to a happy and lasting relationship.
350	21149	8	2	"Laughter is of utmost importance in all types of relationships. A friendship without laughter seems rather pointless. I have four dear friends, @PERSON2, @PERSON3, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS1 (whose real name is @PERSON1, but we call her @CAPS1 because of her behavior). @PERSON2 and I have always been able to make each other laugh, no matter the situation.  One night, around nine p.m., when @PERSON2 and I weren't getting along well, my phone rang. It was @PERSON2, and I was hesitant to answer, fearing an argument. However, I decided to pick up because I knew she would have been there for me.  As I was about to say hello, I heard @LOCATION1 crying. @PERSON2 wasn't one to cry over small things, so I was extremely worried. I asked her what was wrong and listened to her story, even though we were in the middle of a fight.  A few weeks before, our group had gone to @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, and everything seemed fine except for the usual petty arguments that always ended in laughter. Little did we know that @PERSON2's @CAPS3 had been ""house - sitting"" and had no intention of returning home. He told @PERSON2 about his decision to divorce her mother @DATE1 @TIME1 after we left for @ORGANIZATION1.  I could relate to @PERSON2's pain, as my parents divorced when I was young. It was clear that @PERSON2 was deeply affected, as she and her @CAPS3 were very close. She felt it was all her fault and wanted to bring him back.  As her friend, I listened to her and assured her that things would be okay. Eventually, she began to calm down and accept the situation. I invited her over to hang out and try to take her mind off things. We played guitar hero, and every time I messed up, she would laugh.  Hearing @PERSON2 laugh again made me feel relieved, as it showed that she was starting to move past the pain and realize that it wasn't her fault. Without the laughter in that room, I'm not sure our friendship would have recovered.  Now, @PERSON2 and I talk or text for hours about everything. When we're not laughing, we know to ask each other what's wrong. In conclusion, laughter is essential in a relationship, as it can heal wounds and strengthen the bond between friends."
351	21150	8	2	A few years ago, my mom, my sister @PERSON1, and I went to a sub - shop for dinner. While we were in line waiting for our sandwiches, @PERSON1, who was several inches shorter than me at that time, claimed she was taller than me. I straightened up and insisted I was still taller. Then she stood on her tiptoes, making herself taller than me, stuck out her tongue, and said she was taller. I followed suit, standing on my tiptoes and sticking out my tongue at her.  There was a cute guy standing behind @LOCATION1. It looked as if I was sticking my tongue out at him. He had an amused expression on his face, as if he was looking at a cute little kid. I quickly retracted my tongue and returned to my normal height.  I then told my mom that @PERSON1 and I were going to find a place to sit. Once we found a spot, I told her about the guy behind @PERSON1. We both laughed. It was really funny, and we still joke about it today.
352	21151	8	2	"Laughter can forge a bond that's difficult to break. I can attest that I've made fast and true friends simply by sharing laughter. When people laugh, it's an amazing phenomenon. Sometimes, it may not seem logical or particularly funny at the moment, but it can make anyone feel better, regardless of the situation.  I'll share a story that opened my mind and led me to have one of the best and truest friends in my life. I need to go back to when I was around nine. As a young girl, my sister, @CAPS1 (whom I always called @PERSON2), and I despised each other. We never got along, perhaps because we shared a room. I remember her never wanting to play or hang out with me.  My oldest sister @PERSON1 had just gone to college, so @PERSON2 and I had more opportunities to get to know each other. We still fought and didn't get along well, but we were on our way to becoming the best friends we are today.  One day, when our parents went shopping, @PERSON2 and I stayed home to clean the house. In our family, cleaning is always accompanied by loud music. As usual, @PERSON2 ""ordered"" me around, and I, being a stubborn little sister, disliked taking orders.  @PERSON2 told me to clean the bathrooms, which I hated. I refused, and this led to a huge fight. It was incredibly loud; we were yelling and screaming so much that the music couldn't be heard. Frustrated, we stormed into our own bedrooms.  While the music was still blaring, a popular upbeat classic song, ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"", came on. I loved this song, so I opened my door. My sister, who seemed to have the same reaction, did the same.  I started singing and dancing in my room. My sister heard me and came into my room. When she started laughing at me, I stopped and glared at her. I challenged her to do better, and when she tried, it was my turn to laugh.  We ended up making fun of each other's dances and laughing all the way downstairs. We hugged, apologized, and realized how silly our fight was. Then we looked at the work still to be done, laughed, and quickly got to work. We finished just in time before our parents returned.  Later that night, after our parents went to bed, @PERSON2 and I watched movies and laughed uncontrollably. Now, my sister lives in @LOCATION1, and I don't see her often. But whenever we talk, whether through web - chat or phone, we spend hours laughing. Laughter has created a deep bond between us, and it will always keep us together, no matter what the future holds."
353	21153	8	2	"The quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" rings true. I firmly believe that laughter is crucial in any relationship. When people laugh together, they understand each other better. Usually, when you say something funny and laugh with others, they think you're a cool person. It's more enjoyable to be around people who can laugh with you or make you laugh.  Throughout my life, many problems have been solved by telling a joke, sharing something funny, or recalling fun memories. I have several friends (@CAPS4) that I cherish, but like any friendship, we've had our share of small fights.  I remember one time when my friends and I went to the mall. Two of my friends got into a huge conflict over something strange, which escalated into an argument. We'd had minor conflicts before, but this time, the two girls were really serious and angry with each other. My friend @PERSON1 and I watched them, not knowing what to do. @PERSON1 was even a bit scared that they might hurt each other.  I told them, ""Come on, you guys! Don't be like that!"" They looked at me and stopped. As we started walking, I remembered something funny and crazy that those two girls and we had done at a camp the week before. After that camp, we had said we'd be ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 For @CAPS5"" for life and that we'd never forget the fun we had.  I started laughing at the memory, and they looked at me like I was strange. I reminded them of all the fun we'd had at the camp, and they looked at each other and started laughing hard. Their conflict was related to the camp, something they'd forgotten.  After that, they started talking to each other and forgot about the conflict. Sometimes, I remind them of it, and they just laugh and say, ""We were so dumb to have that conflict!"" And we all laugh together.  This is why I believe laughter is so important in friendship. That problem was solved simply by recalling funny memories and making them laugh. Reminding someone of something they'd forgotten can work wonders."
354	21154	8	2	"Laughter is of key importance in life, family, and relationships. It can help people get through tough times. In my life, laughing is a big part. When something happens, I often use laughter to cover it up. Some people may think I laugh too much, but it helps many people endure difficult situations.  If there were no laughter in the world, it would be dull. I feel that people would miss out on the experience of laughing and making jokes. Making others laugh gives me a good feeling, even if it's a lame joke. It makes me feel good about myself because it's something I know how to do.  My family has always been the joking type. We mess around and laugh about everything. There are many good memories with my family, filled with jokes and fun. We cherish every moment of laughter because it's a bond we don't want to lose.  One situation where laughter was really helpful was in awkward moments. On my sports team, during games, we'd quickly get down on ourselves and start blaming each other. This led to many errors as we stopped paying attention to one another and stopped acting like a team. After losing several games, we started to lose hope.  Our coach always tried to comfort us, but some people took it seriously, while others didn't care. Some team members would shut themselves off and only focus on their close friends.  One morning, before a game, the atmosphere was tense. The captain noticed two team members talking about her and confronted them. Everyone was shocked, and no one knew what to say. I said, ""Well, this is just awkward."" The whole team started laughing, which relaxed the situation, even if it didn't completely solve the problem.  Another time when laughter was important was during road trips. Being in the car with my family is a great bonding time. We talk crazily, act out of character, and have a lot of fun. One example was a trip to @LOCATION1. We made up many inside jokes, and it was a moment I don't want to forget.  I believe that in these situations, laughter can help relieve tension and make things less awkward. Just being yourself and not changing is important. These moments are special to me, whether they're good or bad, as they help me remember things more easily. They remind me of how much I care about the people around me and that no moment is completely lost when there's laughter."
355	21155	8	2	On the warm @DATE2, there are children cooling off in pools, parents having picnics and potlucks with friends and family, and late - night slumber parties. This was my @DATE2 @CAPS1.  The bright sunshine filled the room through the window, waking me up. I ran into my brother @PERSON2's room to make sure he was up to start the day with me. He was an early riser, so he was already awake. As we left his room, we smelled the sweet aroma of chocolate chip cookies. We rushed down the hall to the kitchen to ask our mom what we were going to do that day. When we got there, she turned around, showing her huge belly with my soon - to - be baby brother inside. We asked about our plans, but she had nothing arranged.  @PERSON2 and I were disappointed but quickly got dressed and went to the backyard to play catch. The ball hit my leather glove softly, while it made a slapping sound on my brother's. Our mom came outside and called @PERSON2 to the sliding glass door. For a second, I thought I was in trouble for pitching too hard, but that wasn't the case. She then called me over and told us our cousin @ORGANIZATION2 was coming.  My first thought was that @ORGANIZATION2 was coming, but then I remembered how weird she was. She always made up lies, told unfunny jokes, played with @PERSON1 @CAPS2 cards, and played strange video games. I asked my mom when she was coming, and she said fifteen minutes. I ran to my room to call my neighbors @DATE1 and @ORGANIZATION1 to see if I could hang out. Their mom said I could come over after the girls finished their chores. I told my mom I'd be at the neighbors' and that @PERSON2 would have to hang out with @ORGANIZATION2 while I was gone. She agreed as long as I left before @ORGANIZATION2 arrived.  Noon came, and I still hadn't received the call. @ORGANIZATION2 would be there soon, and I was tired of waiting. I decided to go outside and roller - blade around the block. I told @PERSON2, and he came with me. As we were about to leave the garage in our roller blades, our mom came out and said @ORGANIZATION1 had called and we could go over. We rushed to get inside, but we slipped on the stairs in our roller blades as we tried to push each other out of the way. Just as I was about to open the door to leave, there was a knock. It was @ORGANIZATION2. I quickly said hello and rushed to the neighbors' house. At @ORGANIZATION1's house, we went outside to play with her new puppy. After a while, we went inside for a snack. When the doorbell rang, @ORGANIZATION1 let @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON2 in. I suggested we watch a movie. @DATE1 picked out a brand - new @CAPS3 movie. We were almost done watching when the doorbell rang again. It was our mom, who came to pick us up. The puppy, excited to see my mom, peed on the floor. @ORGANIZATION2 didn't notice and slipped on the pee, falling backwards. Everyone, including @ORGANIZATION2, started laughing. We said our thanks and went home to have dinner and get @ORGANIZATION2 ready to leave. The most enjoyable moments are with the people you love, as they can make you laugh and cry.
356	21156	8	2	"It was a cloudy @DATE1. Despite the weather, being with friends made it a pleasant day. A group of friends had just spent the entire weekend together and were now on their way home. I, a young @CAPS6, had known this group for three years. Three years ago, I was shy, but something had changed me. The group was called @ORGANIZATION2, which was for teenagers and some college students. There were only a few of us. This was our last year as members of @ORGANIZATION2, after which we would no longer be allowed to meet at the church.  Together, we made that weekend our best and last @ORGANIZATION1. The boys were very at ease around the girls. In fact, they proposed a deal: during the car ride, if the girls rubbed their backs, they would rub the girls' feet. At first, the girls thought it was a crazy idea, but as time passed, the idea of a foot rub seemed quite appealing. Three pairs were formed, each consisting of a boy and a @CAPS6. The boys sat in the second - last row of the car, and the girls sat in the back. I rubbed @PERSON3's back. Among the girls, besides his sister, I knew @PERSON3 the best, so I was well - suited for the task.  The girls were in fits of giggles, and the boys were very relaxed. As the boys started to fall asleep, the girls found an easy way to wake them up: kicking them, since their feet were right beside the boys. This caused more laughter and made the boys more alert.  After the foot and back rubs, we needed something new to laugh about to pass the time. It was the @DATE1 before @DATE1, and our @ORGANIZATION2 leader gave each of us a bag of candy hearts. The little messages on these candy hearts entertained us for about an hour and a half. We would randomly pick one and hand it to someone. I gave both @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 candy hearts that said, ""@CAPS1"". They were confused, which led to more laughter. @PERSON3 accidentally gave one to @PERSON1 that said, ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"". Andrew got hearts multiple times that said, ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"".  When this started to get boring, we came up with a new way to make the candy hearts fun. We would read the message on the heart out loud and then give it to someone, saying it was from someone else. Kyrene gave one to @PERSON4, saying it was from @PERSON2, and it said, ""@CAPS7 @NUM1 @CAPS4"". Whenever we got a heart that said, ""@CAPS9"", we would give it to @PERSON1, saying it was from @LOCATION1. Earlier, she had said to him, ""I thought you were @CAPS10 for a moment there"", but many people thought she said, ""I thought you were @CAPS9 for a moment there."" So, we tried to make it up to @PERSON1 by giving him ""@CAPS9"" candy hearts.  The @DATE1 ended with hugs, goodbyes, and the laughter of retold inside jokes. A few phone numbers were exchanged, and some that should have been weren't. The trip ended well, and everyone felt a little closer. In my opinion, laughter is not just an element; to laugh, you need to love the people you're with. If I didn't love the people in the car, I wouldn't have laughed with them. I believe that love is the shortest distance between two people, and laughter is just a manifestation of love."
357	21157	8	2	"On @DATE1, which was my birthday, I decided to have my party at @ORGANIZATION1. I invited my two best friends, @PERSON4 and @PERSON3. We all love having fun and laughing, so inviting them was an obvious choice.  As soon as we arrived, we agreed that our favorite water slide in the park was the large and slightly oversized @ORGANIZATION2' @CAPS3. It was a huge funnel with flashing red and @CAPS15 lights inside. We went on it again and again. The adrenaline was rushing through our veins as each ride ended, and we would jump out of the inter - tube and rush to the stairs where the waiting line was. We talked, chatted, sang, and yelled, probably annoying the other people in line.  When we finally reached the top of the stairs, we were in awe of the lifeguard, not because he was good - looking, but because he looked like a little leprechaun! We stifled a small laugh and got on the ride. @PERSON4 asked him to turn the inter - tube around so she could go down backwards. When he started talking, we couldn't help but smirk. He flirted with us, saying in his manly voice, ""@CAPS4 want me to ride down with @CAPS4 ladies?"" As soon as he said that, @PERSON3 was the first to break into laughter, then me, and then @PERSON4. We couldn't hold it in anymore. He awkwardly cackled and pushed the inter - tube down the slide. We were laughing so hard that we weren't even paying attention to the ride.  Then I realized, ""That dude looks like @PERSON1 @PERSON1!!"" I screamed to @PERSON3. After the ride ended, we thought for a moment and then decided to go again. In truth, he did look like @PERSON1. We laughed throughout the ride until I made a very strange sound. It was like a pig having its tail yanked, almost a shriek but more of a squeal. @PERSON4 was the first to say, ""@CAPS6 the heck was that?"" @PERSON3 also expressed her surprise, saying, ""@CAPS8 @CAPS4 just @CAPS9?"" This made us laugh even more, and I started making more unusual noises like squealing, snorting, and hiccuping.  After we had enough of the @ORGANIZATION2' @CAPS3, @PERSON4 suggested going to the wave pool. @PERSON3 and I agreed. The speaker system in the area started playing the song ""@CAPS11"" by @PERSON2. @PERSON3 is the one who always breaks out in song, so she started singing, and we all joined in. When it came to the chorus, ""I throw my hands up in the air sometimes..."", we all changed it to ""I throw my banana in the air sometimes..."" @PERSON4 said, ""@CAPS12 my @CAPS13, we should totally make a song of our own."" We started thinking of lyrics. At first, we knew what to say for the chorus, but coming up with more lyrics was difficult. Eventually, we decided to make the song about food and the way we eat it. We had a great time. People stared at us as we sang our song.  Then, the strange noise came again. @PERSON4 started laughing, then @PERSON3 and I joined in. My @CAPS9 interrupted, and @PERSON4 and @PERSON3 laughed at my strange sound. I also laughed at myself. That night, we went to bed humming the tune of our new song, ""@CAPS14 @CAPS15"". Now, whenever we hang out, we sing our song and sometimes even dance. People still look at us strangely, but then we just start laughing, and I start making those strange sounds again."
358	21158	8	2	"I realized that just one @DATE3 could change the entire purpose of my life. Two things made my life more meaningful than I ever imagined: @CAPS4 and one special girl. Over the course of that @DATE3, I came to understand that there is more to life than what we can see or hear. There are indescribable emotions that one has to experience firsthand.  Looking back on the three - month period of life - changing events, I'm amazed at how quickly my life took a turn for the better. I'm also struck by how one girl could lead me to church and how @CAPS4 could strengthen a relationship. We are part of a movement that will last forever, and she and I are on the perfect path to an eternity together.  Have you ever met someone who made you so overwhelmingly happy that it made you change your life plan forever? I have found things on this earth that explain my purpose here. The first time I saw this girl, it was like an electric shock. I felt an immediate need for her, as if something was whispering in my ear, ""go get her.""  One day, I was talking to a friend about this girl who was constantly on my mind. I told him that I was going to talk to her on @DATE4 and nothing could stop me. He said, ""I have a class with her."" He thought about us being in a relationship. After some intense thought, he looked up at me and said, ""actually, I think you guys would be perfect together."" I replied, ""sweet.""  I talked to her that day. She was even better than I expected. I needed backup, so I brought a different friend with me to talk to her and her friends. I saw her in the hall and we started walking over. When we reached them, my friend just kept walking. I thought, ""what a great friend."" It was just me, alone with seven other girls, trying to look my best. To my surprise, I managed to impress her. She actually found me attractive. Was it love at first sight? I'm not sure.  As @DATE3 approached, I got my license. I was looking forward to what my @DATE3 would bring. Everything seemed to be going well until I got a job at an ice - cream factory. Waking up at four in the @TIME1 wasn't the best start to my @DATE3, but I still wanted to impress her and be with her all day.  I met a guy named @PERSON1, who asked if I wanted to study the Bible with him. I knew that @PERSON2 went to the same church, so I agreed. About two months after @DATE2, they went to a church event in @LOCATION1, and @PERSON2 was baptized there. After they got back, I was also baptized. We both had @CAPS4, and love was growing between us. Naturally, we started dating on @DATE1. The moments we shared were wonderful and unforgettable.  One rainy night, I went to her house. I lost track of time and realized I was going to be late getting home. After saying goodbye to her parents and giving her a big hug, I ran out the door, got in my truck, and took off. I couldn't see well, and suddenly, a corner appeared. I started sliding across the road, and a tree was coming towards me. I hit the tree. In that moment, time seemed to slow down. The only thing in my mind was her face. I landed with a loud scream. I got out of the truck with cuts and bruises, but that was all.  I'm grateful to @CAPS4 that I survived the crash. I'm so lucky to be alive. I believe I was put on this earth to be with her, and that's what I'm committed to. Times like these make me realize how amazing life is. Laughter can truly change your life around. I finally told her I love her, and we are still together to this day."
359	21159	8	2	My cousin @PERSON1 and her boyfriend, @PERSON2, had been dating for three years. They planned a special date for their anniversary. They made reservations at the @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1 and intended to take a walk on the beach afterwards. For @PERSON1, it was a bit more special than an ordinary date, but for @PERSON2, it was the most important day of his life. On that late @DATE2 evening, he was going to propose to @PERSON1.  @PERSON2 arrived at @PERSON1's house precisely at five o'clock pm. He held a bouquet of roses in his hands and gave them to @PERSON1, the most beautiful girl in his eyes. She was dressed in a white and pink dress, matching pink heels, and her hair was done up nicely. @PERSON2 was speechless as he handed her the flowers. After putting the roses in water, he escorted her to his car, @CAPS1 number one. However, he couldn't start the car. In great embarrassment, he asked @PERSON1 to drive her car to dinner. She giggled and said she didn't mind.  When they reached @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2, they were disappointed to find that their reservation had been double - booked, and the other couple had arrived just before them. In despair, they went in search of another place. Every other place that @DATE1 @TIME1 was full, so @PERSON1 suggested @CAPS2's, her favorite restaurant. After waiting for forty - five minutes, they were lucky to get a window seat.  @PERSON2 ordered a burger and fries because he doesn't like seafood. On the contrary, @PERSON1 loves seafood, so she had a bowl of @CAPS2's world - famous clam chowder. After dinner, @PERSON2 excused himself to use the restroom. As he got up, he knocked over his @ORGANIZATION3, and it spilled all over @PERSON1's new dress, creating a sticky, brown mess. @PERSON1 tried to clean it up, but it was almost hopeless.  Things were going badly, but it got even worse. When it was time to pay the bill, @PERSON2 panicked. He realized he had left his wallet in his car. His
360	21160	8	2	"It was another warm muggy @DATE1 @TIME1, when @LOCATION1 my best friend and i decided to go to our friend @PERSON1's house. As soon as we we walked the three mile walk to get to @PERSON1's house @LOCATION1 realizes that he forgot his phone charger at my house. We didn't want to walk all the way back to my house and we had no ride either because none of us have our license yet and and @PERSON1's parents aren't home. So @PERSON1 and i start brainstorm on how to get back to my house to retrieve @LOCATION1's cell phone charger, when suddenly...We heard a loud bang come from the backyard from the old rugged y shed in the back dark corner of the yard; @LOCATION1 and I go to check it out to see what the noise was. we open the shed and one of @PERSON1's dirt bikes had fallen over. @PERSON1 and I pull the dirt bike out of the old spider-web infested shed. @PERSON1 and i both got a light-bulb above our heads and suddenly looked up at each other with the same idea. not being so smart we figure @LOCATION1 can just ride the dirt bike the three mils back to my house on main roads and he will be fine. @PERSON1 tells @PERSON1 about are idea and @PERSON1 says its a bad idea because he mom is not home and he doesn't want us getting in trouble for a phone charger. @PERSON1 repeatedly tells us to put the dirt bikes back, but next thing you know @LOCATION1 has the bike out front testing it out around the neighbor hood. I tell @LOCATION1 ""since there is only one dirt bike you take it and ill follow on the @CAPS1 bike!"" next thing you know me and @PERSON1 are side by side riding a dirt bike and a @CAPS1 bike down the busiest road in town and its pitch black outside. ""@PERSON1 you go and ill meet you there!"" i yell. @PERSON1 takes off down the road at about @NUM1 mph and im about @NUM1 yards behind him. suddenly I see a white figure start to creep out from a driveway, i cant quite make out what it is... When suddenly i see flashing red and blue lights! i try to warn @LOCATION1 and shout ""@PERSON1 @NUM3!!!"" yet he is to far away to hear me but since its pitch black outside the lights light up the whole street, @LOCATION1 tries to loose him by going down a side road but its no match for a charger cop car. It's out of my hands now so I bike back to jeremys house and get him and we run the the scene of the crime to see whats happening. we keep are distance and act like we don't know him. the cop has @PERSON1 in cuffs standing behind the cop car and the cop goes back to his car to write @PERSON1 a ticket and I see @LOCATION1 shadows under the street light throw something into the bush's.. Since it wasn't his dirt bike and he couldn't ride it him the cop calls a tow truck and has him take the bike and the cop gives @LOCATION1 a ride home with @MONEY1 in tickets.. As soon as they leave the scene I go check to see what @LOCATION1 threw in the bush's and it was a can of chew because he is a minor.. so i grab it. the next day @LOCATION1 is home and his parents are at work so I bring him his chew, and he starts to tel us what his mom punished him with when suddenly we heard the garage door start to open; his mom was home from work so i hand him his chew and I run out the backyard and over the fence. he tells me to not tell to many people because he doesn't want everyone knowing but its already the talk of the town..."
361	21161	8	2	"It was an ordinary day. I headed to the chess club to challenge the board - one holder. As a new member of the club, I'd never met him before. But I knew that if I didn't play my best, I'd lose. I entered the room, secretly hoping the holder wouldn't be there, but he was. He wore a blue baseball cap, a blue T - shirt, blue jeans, and black shoes. His hair was as dark as his shoes and looked unbrushed for years. His skin was very pale, and I wondered how he could go out in the sun without protection. The chessboard was set up, and there was a clock with an hour on each side. I walked up to him. He didn't notice me until I spoke, ""I'm gonna lose fast. I know I will."" He just sat there, staring at me as if I'd insulted him. ""You're the kid they think can beat me,"" he scoffed. ""I guess. I never really thought about it."" I was unsure why that mattered, but I was playing him, and I was certain it would matter soon. ""Please take your seat. We can begin the matches!"" the coach called out. ""Everyone, we all know the rules. The black player starts the white player's clock. No talking."" ""What's your name?"" I asked. ""My name is [CAPS8]."" I hit the clock. Expecting him to move quickly, I made a move. It was a bad move. He pointed out that I'd moved when it wasn't my turn. The coach came to the clock and pressed some buttons. He seemed unconcerned about whether a board - ten holder could beat a board - one holder. When he set the clock, it showed fifty to fifty - five. I was already behind on time, and the game hadn't really started. [CAPS8] picked up the king's bishop's pawn and moved it up one square, then hit the clock quickly. It was strange that he moved the weakest piece. I had to think for a long time. I looked at the clock; it was bad. I'd been sitting there for about ten minutes without moving a single piece. I picked up my king's pawn and moved it up two squares, hoping he wouldn't do anything to harm me in the game. I hit my clock. We sat there for about half an hour. I got up and went to the bathroom. When I came back, I checked on the other players. Only one game was over; it was [PERSON1] and a kid I didn't know. I asked who won, and it was the unknown kid. Odd as it was, I had to get back to my game. He still hadn't moved. For a moment, I thought he was having trouble breathing. He yawned and moved his king's knight's pawn up two squares and hit the clock. That was strange; it seemed like a foolish move. Without thinking much, I picked up my queen and brought it in front of his rook pawn. I said, ""[CAPS9] [CAPS10]"" loudly. He started to laugh. At first, I was confused because I thought I'd beaten him. Then he said, ""I do this opening with everyone I play for the first time."" He laughed again, and this time I joined him. We were both laughing because I'd beaten him. He said, ""You're the first one to see that you could win in the first two moves."" That surprised me. I thought he always won, but he'd been giving people games without them knowing. We laughed again. The coach came over, saw that I'd won, said ""good job,"" and walked away. [CAPS8] said, ""This is the start of a new beginning. I can quit board one now because there's someone who can beat me."" He walked up to the coach and must have told him that he wanted me on board one. Now I'm on board one, and my new friend, [CAPS8], is on board two with me."
362	21163	8	2	“Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many folks claim that laughter is the key to life. If you can't laugh, you're not much fun to be around. A lot of people believe laughter is a crucial part of relationships. In my view, I also think laughter is extremely important. It lightens the mood in awkward situations and makes you and others happy. I'd rather be around happy people. A few days ago, my mom, sister, and I decided to go to the bowling alley in [LOCATION1]. We were all invited, along with about [NUM1] other women from the [ORGANIZATION1] we attend. We'd made reservations at [CAPS1] [CAPS2] at [NUM2] [CAPS3]. We got there first and waited for about [NUM3] minutes. Then some of our friends walked in. We ran to greet them and show them where we were sitting. Our friends got their bowling shoes and came over to us. Once everyone was there, we started bowling. We had three lanes in total. My mom, sister, and I were in one lane with two other friends. In the first game, it was a normal one. As usual, everyone was getting strikes except me. I was really discouraged. In the second game, we decided to change the rules. This time, we couldn't bowl the normal way. Each turn, we had to come up with a new way and position to send the ball down the lane. After a while, people ran out of ideas. Some started lying or sitting on bowling balls and sending another ball down. It was really tough. Towards the end of the second game, everyone was tired. Their arms and fingers hurt. In my last frame, I picked the ball I wanted. I waited for the people in the next lane to finish their turn and then went to bowl. I got ready, pulled my arm back, and flung the ball. But my fingers let go, and I dropped it. Everyone on my side of the bowling alley burst out laughing. I was so embarrassed. My face turned red. Then, on my next turn, I brought the ball back and threw it, but I accidentally threw it into the other lane. I fell to the floor laughing. It was so funny. That night turned out to be one of the best in a long time. Now, whenever we have a bad day, we just talk about that day when we laughed at ourselves, and the day gets better.
363	21164	8	2	"Laughter is commonly used in various ways, such as releasing tension, appreciating a funny joke, or expressing a light - hearted mood. In my opinion, laughter is the key to building a close relationship with others. Each person's laugh is unique. When someone laughs, they're not worried about their appearance or what to say next to break the awkward silence. For a moment, their guard is down. Growing up, my relationship with my father has been based on using laughter to deal with problems and difficulties. However, my relationship with my [CAPS7] has always been strained. I believe one reason is that we've never been able to laugh together and enjoy each other's company. My father and I have always been very close. Whenever I talk about him to others, they seem to know him. Maybe it's because of his humor, his attractiveness to older women, or his kindness. He's been popular his whole life. He's never been a serious person. No matter the situation, he'll make a humorous comment or joke. Whether I'm sad or angry due to adolescence and hormones, my mood changes completely because of his jokes. This shows me the power of laughter. My [CAPS7] comes from [LOCATION1], [LOCATION2]. In [LOCATION3], things are different. Laughing or fooling around is considered disrespectful or immature. People are expected to act properly, and children should respect their elders. When my father married her, I tried to introduce her to sarcasm and jokes, but I never got the reaction I wanted. Without the connection through laughter and humor, I always felt guarded around her. I've never been able to express myself freely. I constantly feel judged and awkward, which shows me the negative effects of the absence of laughter. A person's laughter is emotional and personal, like crying. It can instantly make you happy, almost like a drug. When you make someone laugh, you're allowing them to open up to you a little. You also start to build a connection with them. Without laughter in a relationship, it becomes awkward, and neither person feels comfortable opening up. Since I'm my [CAPS9]'s daughter, I tend to use jokes like him. When there's tension or someone's upset, I try to make them laugh to solve the problem. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I think this means that laughter is something everyone enjoys and can build or maintain relationships. In conclusion, laughter plays a vital role in relationships. It can bring people closer and create a positive atmosphere. The lack of laughter can lead to awkwardness and a failure to connect. So, let's laugh more."
364	21166	8	2	"It was a really bad day. We'd all just heard some terrible news, and no one was even close to smiling. Even the people who always smile had serious looks on their faces. But then, one of our friends, [PERSON1], had a great idea: to go online and find something to cheer us up. We spent hours on the computer, looking up ridiculous videos we knew about, trying to make each other laugh. That's when our day started to improve. But it took a bit of a downturn when a few people left to go home. Only three of us - [PERSON2], [PERSON1], and I - were left at [LOCATION1]'s house. We were sitting there watching [LOCATION2] when our favorite show, Psych, came on. It was a new episode! It turned out to be a great day. The show has a lot of silly humor that suited all of us, especially [PERSON1]. We were all laughing and having a good time. After the show was over, [PERSON1] kept laughing. We asked him what was so funny, but he just kept laughing for five minutes. When he finally stopped, we asked again. He said, ""I was laughing at my own laugh. I sound really weird."" That's when we all started laughing. It was so hard to stop. In the end, the day turned out to be okay. Now, whenever we have a bad day, we just talk about that day when we laughed at ourselves for ten minutes, and the day gets better."
365	21167	8	2	Recently, on [DATE2] of [DATE1], I was lucky enough to meet my uncle, whom I'd never consciously met before. This was a significant part of learning about my family. I met my uncle, my aunt (who's a real comedian and I've known since I was a kid), and my father at a local [CAPS1] restaurant called [ORGANIZATION2]. They were all siblings, and it gave me a glimpse into what siblings joke about, talk about, and the nostalgia they share. I have a stepsister, but the level of nonsense I witnessed was beyond what I could imagine. Everyone was constantly laughing at the stories of the mischief my father, his brother, and [CAPS2] got into. At one point, I had a hard time breathing from laughing so much. The stories and bad jokes made me realize that in my family, there's a long - standing tradition of telling bad, not even inappropriate but just plain stupid jokes. I realized that my children will probably tell bad jokes too. We ate there for a couple of hours. Then my dad had to go home to [LOCATION3], and I needed to be taken home to my family in [LOCATION4]. But we'd planned to explore [ORGANIZATION3] the next day and exchange more stupid jokes. The next day, I woke up, got dressed, and prepared for a day of laughter. When I met my uncle, aunt, and my uncle's girlfriend, we headed to the fish hatchery on what I think was [LOCATION1]. The jokes started slowly because everyone was tired and still waking up for the day's trip. At the hatchery, we started by feeding the fish in a pond. We watched the fish swim in the concrete canals for at least twenty minutes. Then we walked through the hatchery and got back in the car to go to [ORGANIZATION1]. When we parked outside [ORGANIZATION1], we could hear the beautiful sound of rushing water. I really needed to pee. We walked along the paths and climbed up to get a closer view of [ORGANIZATION1]. I was so distracted by the need to use the restroom that I couldn't fully enjoy it. I managed to hold it, but it shortened our visit, which was inconvenient for everyone, but they understood. I'll always remember [ORGANIZATION1] for its natural beauty. After visiting [ORGANIZATION1], we were going to the tourist - friendly town of [CAPS2]'s [ORGANIZATION3]. As we drove by, I was amazed when I saw the alpacas. Before doing anything else, I found a restroom. Then we all agreed to get something to eat. A [CAPS4] - themed restaurant was an obvious choice. We were seated by a nice young woman. I saw that this restaurant had won awards for the tastiest burgers. I gave in to temptation and ordered one. It was one of the best burgers I've ever had. After eating, we started browsing the gift - shops and novelty stores. We went from bookstores to art galleries to a shop that sold nuts and spices. Then we came across an [CAPS5] - cream shop. After a long day of walking, [CAPS5] - cream sounded perfect. I had a strange flavor with berries.
366	21168	8	2	I was running late for the bus, as usual. Barely had I sat down when the bus started moving. I spotted my friends sitting one behind the other. I stopped and said to them, “Guys, you make it so hard to choose.” I forced a sarcastic smile. Person1, who was sitting behind Caps3, motioned for me to sit with her. I quickly smiled at her and told her that Caps3 and I would turn around and talk to her. Person1 smiled as Caps21 leaned her head against my seat. Caps3 and I gave Person1 about five minutes of quiet before we started chatting with her. By the time we reached the middle school, we were all having a great time. Until then, Caps3 and I were fine. But as soon as the bus left the middle school, we were in fits of laughter. Everything Caps21 said made me laugh, and everything I said made her laugh too. After we left the middle school, a sixth - grader came to sit in front of us. He was incredibly annoying! He kept turning around, giving Caps3 and me strange looks and asking us how many joints we had smoked. Of course, that made us laugh even more. I was talking about having stuff in my biology book, but I meant notes. The boy obviously thought I was talking about joints. I found it absolutely hilarious that he misinterpreted me. Caps3, sitting to my left, had her head on the seat, crying from laughing so hard. Seeing this, I laughed even harder, and the sounds we made were the silent, intense kind of laughter. The boy still turned around, staring with raised eyebrows. As soon as we passed the fruit - packing company, he started speaking in Caps8 to us. I was trying to learn Caps8, but I had no idea what he was saying. Neither did Caps3. Of course, he probably didn't know what he was talking about either. He leaned over in the aisle to talk to the native Caps8 speakers, who were also watching us with big smiles. Being a bit of a joker, I decided to say that he couldn't know more Caps8 than me when he was only in sixth grade. He quieted down, but the Caps8 speakers were howling with laughter. By the time Caps3 got off the bus, I was in tears. After Caps21 got off, I went to check on Person1. She looked like she was trying to sleep, so I gently nudged her, and she looked up at me. I had forgotten about Person1 in the back until Caps3 got off. “Do you need a doctor?” Person1 asked with a confused grin. I tried to talk, but I was laughing so hard that my words came out jumbled. “Now you really scare me!” Person1 said seriously. “Come on, Person1! Freshmen are supposed to scare sophomores, sophomores scare juniors, and juniors scare seniors!” I explained, still laughing. My speech still sounded a mess. I put my face over the seat, lowering my head so that only my eyes were visible. Then I did my eyebrow - wiggling thing. I thought I was making her laugh, and I was, but it also made more people look at us. The boy still interrupted Person1 and me, blurting out, “Bueno? Bueno?” Person1 and I just looked at him. He was clearly loving the attention. Then, I think he insulted my mother, which Person1 pointed out. But I didn't care because I was in such a good mood. Person1 and I saw her stop approaching. It was nice to think about all the fun we'd had on the bus together, like the famous disappearing bus - driver ride and the bus ride when I was proof - reading my paper. Good times. I told her this as she was getting off the bus. She laughed, and so did I. Finally, when the bus reached my stop, I crossed the road and headed home. For fun, I looked back at the bus and saw the boy staring at me. I lost it then.
367	21170	8	2	I first met my best friend, Person2, in kindergarten. At that time, we were both shy and found comfort in each other. Little did we know that our initial acquaintance would grow into a wonderful friendship filled with great memories and lots of laughter. Last Date1, my family took a trip to my grandparents' house in Location1, Location3. My grandparents usually only used the house once a year during Date2. Since they were at home in Location4, my parents decided to take advantage of the empty house. My siblings are in their twenties and busy with college, so my parents invited Person2 to come with us. We were extremely excited as this was our first time going to Location3 together. Person2 and I had many activities planned, and I was eager to show her around Organization1 in Location1. The only drawback of the trip was that we had to drive, and it would take about Num1 hours in the car. I was aware of this because I used to go to Organization1 a lot when I was young, so I brought a notebook for us to draw and write in. By the time we reached Organization1, the notebook was filled with drawings and funny quotes that Person2 and I had shared. Person2 and I have a unique sense of humor. When we're together, we find everything funny, even the most ridiculous things, and we'll burst out laughing without anyone else understanding why. After a long Num1 - hour drive, we finally arrived in Location2. It was late, and we had to unpack, so I couldn't show Person2 around until the next day. However, our night was still exciting. There's a pool house in the backyard of the house. To ensure someone was on the property when no one was at the main house, my grandparents rented out the pool house. My parents knew that a man named Caps1 lived there. None of us had met him, only heard stories from when my brother lived in the main house while attending college at Organization1. That night, my mom asked me to go get my dad from the backyard because dinner was ready. Since it was dark outside, I made Person2 come with me. When we got outside, we saw that my dad had introduced himself to Caps1. Caps1 looked exactly as I had imagined. He was wearing red shorts, no shoes, and a peach - colored T - shirt. He had sandy - blond hair and was a bit scruffy, looking like a beach bum. Caps1 quickly came over to me and Person2 and introduced himself. He was very nice and goofy. Throughout our conversation, Person2 and I couldn't keep straight faces. Caps1 said he had to go and wanted to teach us a handshake he'd made up. He stuck his hand out, curling his index, ring, and middle fingers towards his palm, leaving only his pinky and thumb sticking out. He motioned for us to do the same. We all put our hands in the center, and he tapped his pinky and thumb against ours, said good evening, and ran back to the pool house. It was very strange but so funny that my dad, Person2, and I still do it sometimes. The next day, I took Person2 downtown and showed her around. On our way back, we stopped at a craft store that neither of us had ever been in. When we walked in, it looked like an ordinary craft store, but as we explored more, we noticed a large section of armor and helmets worn by Caps3 soldiers. Being a bit silly, we decided to put them on. We put on the helmets and armor and stood by the front - shop windows, waving at people. The ladies working in the store were laughing at us, and that made us laugh at ourselves too. We laughed so hard that we fell down. At that point, the workers were no longer laughing; they were angry that we'd fallen while wearing the armor. They told us to take it off and leave. We did as they said. By the end of the trip, we'd made so many memories, and we couldn't wait to return the following year. In my opinion, laughter is crucial in relationships. It helps us get to know others and brings people closer together. This Date1, Person2 and I will be going back to Location1, looking forward to creating more memories and having more laughs.
368	21171	8	2	In Date1, during the month of Date2, I experienced an intense bout of laughter. If I remember correctly, it all started on the day of Caps1 when my family gathered for a celebration. The day began like any other Caps1. Everyone was busy preparing for the feast, and I was just wandering around, oblivious to my surroundings. Still, I managed to help my parents with the preparations. Then, a sudden wave of joy overtook me. I started laughing without any reason, just enjoying the moment. My family looked at me with confusion and kept their distance. I worried that if I seemed to have lost my mind, they would lose faith in my social skills. On that day, I saw a different side of myself, a side I wished would disappear. I could no longer look at myself in the mirror and see the sane person I used to know. The day after my strange behavior among my peers, I tried to apologize for my actions. My first attempt seemed to startle them, perhaps because of the way I spoke and the excuses I made during our short conversations. After that, I went on with my life, still a bit unaware of my surroundings, but it was different from before. I felt a kind and gentle side of myself being released. A heavy stress was lifted from my shoulders, allowing me to continue with my daily routine. That's when I noticed another personality emerging within me, my alter - ego coming to the surface and taking over my body. I named this alter - ego Person1. With these new emotions, I was able to achieve great things. Even today, he sometimes appears when I've accomplished something significant in knowledge or endurance. He gives me strength by promising laughter to me and those around me. I don't see him as a separate person but as another part of myself. Before that day, this side of me had never been so clearly visible. I believe that we all have such a hidden personality within us, one that empowers us to move forward without looking back.
369	21174	8	2	Laughter is truly a remarkable aspect of human existence. Since birth, we've all laughed, and it serves multiple purposes. It can relieve awkward situations, bring people together, and make life more bearable. Everyone can laugh, even if we find humor in different things. In my life, laughter has often helped me through tough times, brought me closer to others, and made life more enjoyable. I remember trying out for a volleyball team. On the first day of tryouts, I was extremely nervous because I didn't know anyone. I had never even heard of these girls, and now I was going to compete against them. The only thing we had in common was the goal of making the team. Tryouts started, and I felt like the girls were wondering why I was there. I ignored them and worked hard. The rest of the week's tryouts went okay, but something still felt off. I felt like I didn't belong. On the last day of tryouts, the girls had loosened up a bit, but I still felt uncomfortable. After the final practice, it was time to announce the teams. I was very nervous. What if I didn't make it? Or what if I did, but the team members hated me? The coach announced the names, and as I was losing hope, he said mine. I was overjoyed, but the girls seemed annoyed. When I got home, I told my parents, and they were happy for me. I also told them that I didn't know anyone and felt like an outsider. They asked if I had tried talking to the girls, and I said no because they hadn't tried talking to me. My mom told me that I needed to put myself out there to get to know them. I realized that I had ignored them as much as they had ignored me. I hadn't been myself either. I'm actually a fun and cool person, but for some reason, I had become withdrawn. I decided to be more outgoing at the next practice. At the next practice, I was paired with a girl named Person1. It was incredibly awkward at first, and we just silently passed the ball back and forth. Then I started making jokes, and we both laughed. The rest of the practice was great. The awkwardness faded away, and we bonded through laughter. We all worked hard, joked around, and laughed together. I really felt like we were becoming a team. Laughter had brought us together. It had seemed like we were so different, but in reality, we had a lot in common. That day, I learned how important laughter is in relationships, in getting to know others, and in bringing people together. I'll never forget that day. During that volleyball season, I made many new friends. I also learned that an awkward situation can always be turned around by laughter. Even today, I still talk to those girls, and we still laugh together. Just because you've known someone for a while doesn't mean the fun and laughter should end; it should only get stronger. Whenever I meet new people, I always try to break the ice with something funny because I believe that being happy, having fun, and laughing together are important parts of life. That's what I plan to keep doing.
370	21175	8	2	Every day, people laugh for various reasons known only to those who are laughing. There are times in everyone's life when we just need to laugh, whether it's to relieve stress, make a situation more comfortable, get to know someone better, or start a conversation. When I was Num1 years old, I got hired for a job at Organization1. As the youngest guy on the crew, I wanted to make a good impression but didn't know how. My first few days were awkward and quiet. I was so nervous, constantly thinking, “What am I doing? I don't belong here. I don't know anyone or what I'm doing.” On one of
371	21176	8	2	Laughter is often the way I connect with my friends, and it's how I've become friends with many of them. When I'm in a new class and don't know anyone, it can be quite awkward, like I'm a loner. I try to make the best of the situation and make new friends, but I'm not always great at it. So, when I get the chance, I make them laugh. We start slowly, and the more we laugh together, the closer we seem to become.  By the end of the semester, I might not really like the class, but I don't want it to end because I've made a great friend. In the next semester, I find out I have a class with that friend, but they don't like the class and decide to switch. Then, I realize we start to grow apart because we hardly see each other, and when we don't talk, it gets awkward.  Our friendship started by accident. I didn't know many people in the class, and those I did know weren't really my friends. We sat next to each other, and after a long, awkward silence, she made a joke, and I laughed. Within a week, we were talking, and soon we started hanging out. About halfway through the semester, we got in trouble for talking too much in class, and we realized we were becoming best friends.  As the semester went on, we hung out more and more, and sometimes she was the only one I hung out with. When the semester was almost over, we didn't know our class schedules, so we thought we'd be separated. When we got our schedules, we found out we had one class together and were excited.  On the first day of the second - semester art class we had together, we laughed the whole time. But at the end of the period, she told me she didn't want to be in the class because she's not into art. I went to my sixth - period class, wondering if she'd really switch. At the end of sixth period, I saw her, and she said she'd switched to a class she wanted.  I still know people in that class, but it's not the same. I knew our friendship would fade because we'd rarely see each other. It's been a couple of weeks into the last semester, and we hardly talk. Sometimes it's just awkward to be around her because it's not like it used to be. Laughter brought us together, but classes tore us apart.
372	21177	8	2	"The atmosphere was warm and sweet, with most of my family and friends gathered in the room. My brother was missing, and at the time, I was around @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old. I can't quite remember the exact age, so I'll just make an educated guess.  Anyway, getting back to the story, I was searching all over our @NUM1 - story house for my brother. For some reason, it seemed impossible to find him this time. All I could hear in the background was my family's laughter as this little @NUM1 or @NUM2 - year - old me ran full - speed up and down the hallways, opening and closing doors to rooms I'd never been in before. I was shouting at the top of my lungs, ""@CAPS1, where are you? I can't find you!""  There was one more door to open, and it was at the beginning of the hallway where everyone was sitting or standing. I came running down the hall in a panic, unable to find my brother. I opened the door, and out popped @PERSON1, my brother, wearing a scary monster mask. He said, ""I will get you tonight if you don't eat all your dinner.""  I did as he said. I ate my dinner so fast that I ended up throwing up because I was so scared he'd come after me that night! The funny thing is, this was a memorable moment in my life, and that's what makes it so special."
373	21178	8	2	"In my opinion, laughter is incredibly important. How does laughter affect someone's life? And is it important to me? Laughter is vital for numerous reasons, whether in relationships, daily life, or with the people around us.  Imagine a world without laughter. It would be dry and dull. Laughter helps connect people, especially those with the same sense of humor. Having a good sense of humor is crucial these days. Many people use sarcasm, which may or may not be considered ""laughter."" Some find it funny, while others may be hurt by it. Those who are hurt by it usually lack a sense of humor.  It's a well - known fact that ""it takes more muscles to frown than to smile."" In my relationship with my significant other, sharing laughter is wonderful. The affection we show through laughter brings us closer. Without it and communication, our relationship wouldn't be as strong.  For most people, a sense of humor is essential in a relationship. Who would want to be with someone who bores them or can't make them laugh when they're sad? I certainly wouldn't.  Laughter enhances communication. When we laugh with someone, it shows our attitude towards the topic. In a relationship, it's hard to imagine it without laughter. How would you feel if the person you love isn't humorous and doesn't like to laugh often? I couldn't stand that. I want to be with someone who is funny and has a great sense of humor.  Laughter is important to me for so many reasons. I'd rather be around happy people than those who bring me down. I believe laughter is one of the most important things in my life and my relationship. It brings us closer.  People sometimes ask, ""Doesn't it get old being happy all the time?"" I'd firmly say, ""Of course not!"" Why would anyone think that? Being in a great mood all the time, with my partner by my side, is the best place I could be in my life.  While everyone is entitled to their own opinion about the importance of laughter, I think most people would agree with me to some extent. Laughter truly enriches our lives."
374	21179	8	2	When I think of a day filled with the power of laughter, I think of @DATE1. It was one of the worst days of my life. I had decided to break up with my girlfriend that day. That morning, my decision was final. But for some reason, when I woke up, I felt sick. Everything seemed to be falling apart that day.  Around @NUM1 @CAPS1, I went to my girlfriend's house and broke up with her. The next day, I couldn't force a smile if I tried. My friends spent the whole day making me smile, showing me they cared.  The day after that, I felt so much better. I was smiling and laughing as if nothing had happened. All day, my friends told me jokes and did silly things, making me laugh non - stop.  In the following weeks, I met another girl. I've never been more positive about my life. Now, all I do is smile and laugh. I don't want to live a life full of sadness. I choose to be positive and smile.  Laughter is incredibly important. No one should go a single day without it. We should live our lives to the fullest, leave the past behind, and always look on the bright side and smile.
375	21180	8	2	"My high school @CAPS1 basketball team isn't the best, but we have the ability to make each other laugh. At the start of @DATE1, the school held try - outs and formed the teams. After some seniors graduated and some players didn't return, our team was brand new, with players of different ages. At practices, we were civil to each other but weren't close friends who hung out outside of practice.  The @CAPS1 team decided to take a weekend retreat to the beach and stay there. When we left for the beach, our phones were taken, and we were assigned seats in the cars. It seemed like it would be a long trip without my phone.  We arrived at the house @TIME1. After finding places to relax, shower, or sleep, most of the team and I ended up in the living room, chatting with the coaches. We sat on the floor, sharing stories about the game from that @TIME1 or funny memories from our past.  By the time we finished storytelling, it was @TIME2, and everyone in the house was either tired or hungry. As we sat on the floor complaining, our attention turned to @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 started ranting about how hungry she was. She thought the house should have been stocked with food for us when we arrived, but there was none. As her rant continued, she got angrier, and we laughed harder.  Finally, she exclaimed, ""@CAPS2's no steak or chicken up in these mother - freaking cabinets!"" That made the coaches and players laugh uncontrollably. @PERSON1 didn't understand why it was so funny, but we just kept laughing at the idea that there should be steak and chicken in the cabinets. The laughter lasted for five to ten minutes.  When we finally calmed down, @PERSON2 came downstairs. She had missed everything, and as we were about to tell her, @LOCATION1 interrupted. ""@PERSON2, get up on the counter and look in the cabinet,"" @PERSON1 said. @PERSON2 hesitantly climbed on the counter and slowly opened the cabinet. All she saw were chips. She turned to @LOCATION1 and asked, ""@CAPS3?""  @PERSON1 just sat there smiling. Then she replied, ""@CAPS4 me some of those chips right @CAPS2!"" Everyone in the room laughed as @PERSON2 was confused about why she was asked to get on the counter just to get chips for @PERSON1, who had been sitting next to the counter the whole time.  The whole basketball team laughed again. @PERSON2 got off the counter without any chips. We kept laughing and talking about what had happened for the next @NUM1 minutes.  As we settled into our beds that night, we still talked about the funny moments. That first day at the beach brought us closer. We bonded over our love for basketball and the shared memories in the kitchen.  Today, we still annoy each other sometimes and lose our tempers, but we always laugh about the crazy things that happened on the trip, especially what happened in the kitchen that day."
376	21181	8	2	"It was an ordinary day in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. On that particular day, we were scheduled to commence our state writing tests. I wasn't overly concerned as I've always performed well on state - level tests and have never failed one. For @PERSON1, it was pretty much a regular day. However, I had no idea what awaited me in the computer lab.  Due to new @ORGANIZATION1 state testing regulations, we had to take the writing test on the computer. The only places in school with enough computers for the whole class were the @ORGANIZATION1 computer lab or the old computer lab. (I'm not sure why we chose the @ORGANIZATION1 lab, but we did.)  I was already in a hyper mood because @CAPS1's sense of humor usually cheers me up. As we walked to the computer lab, @CAPS1 and I started joking about @PERSON3, as others often do. When we reached the computer lab, the door was locked. While waiting for @PERSON2 to lock her door and come to the lab, we made a few more jokes about @PERSON3. Little did I know the real fun was inside.  When @PERSON2 unlocked the door, I was the first to enter and sit in my preferred seat. @PERSON4 sat next to me, and @CAPS4 next to him. I knew a computer trick: press @CAPS5 @CAPS19 @CAPS6 @CAPS19 @CAPS7, and when the screen changes, press @CAPS8 to put the computer to sleep. I tried it a few times while he was looking, and he'd swat my hand away.  After planning, about @NUM1 minutes later, I tried again. I caught him looking at @CAPS4 and pressed @CAPS5 @CAPS19 @CAPS6 @CAPS19 @CAPS7, then @CAPS8 when the screen changed. My plan worked. @PERSON4 turned around as the computer was going to sleep and freaked out, cussing and hitting me. I found it a bit funny and got a few laughs.  After @PERSON4 woke his computer up and started the test, @CAPS4 asked what I was laughing about. I told him, ""You should have seen it. I put @PERSON4's computer to sleep, and he went crazy."" @CAPS4 laughed and went back to his test.  Two minutes later, @CAPS4 tapped my shoulder. I asked what was up, and he held the power button on @PERSON4's computer, shutting it off during the test. It was so funny that @CAPS4 and I laughed out loud. @PERSON2 wasn't happy and told us to quiet down, but it was worth it. Eventually, we returned to our tests. I hope I do well; I really need the grade to pass."
377	21182	8	2	"Have you ever been in a situation where you just can't stop laughing, no matter what? That's the kind of thing my good friend @PERSON1 and I experience when we're together. Most of the time, we talk about random things and find it extremely amusing. Fortunately for the teachers, we only have two classes together. But even so, we sit next to each other in both classes.  The other day, in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, we were allowed to change seats. The girl sitting next to me moved to sit next to @PERSON1. Since I didn't like that girl much, I offered, ""@PERSON1, you can sit next to me!"" @PERSON1 quickly grabbed her stuff and sat down beside me, saying, ""You saved my life."" For some reason, we started laughing uncontrollably. In truth, it wasn't that hilarious; it was probably just the way she said it.  I'm glad @PERSON1 sits next to me in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Without her, the class would be incredibly boring. In @CAPS6 class, which is at the end of the day, we're usually eager to go home. We sit next to each other, and while taking notes, we pass notes back and forth. We talk about everything, from the problems teenage girls face in high school to boys and parents. I can confide in her about anything, and that's what makes her a great friend.  Over the years, @PERSON1 and I have grown closer. Last year, we had at least three or four classes together. We've become more familiar with each other and more open. We find the same things funny and have similar interests. She's a wonderful friend, and I'm really glad to have her. As the saying goes, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" and I wholeheartedly agree."
378	21183	8	2	My name is @CAPS1. I'm an ordinary girl with a story to tell. I'm writing this because this story is meaningful to me. I rely on laughter in my daily life. Without it, life wouldn't be the same. Laughter has shaped me into who I am today and has brought me closer to my friends and loved ones.  Take my relationship with my boyfriend @PERSON1, for example. We're like any other couple, having both good and bad times. Our tough times often start in the morning. When I wake up, it's still dark outside, and the fresh @TIME1 air makes me feel refreshed. I always feel like the happiest girl in the world. After waking up, I text @PERSON1 good @TIME1, and we usually talk throughout the morning. Sometimes he comes to see me, or I see him at school. When I see him, I'm overjoyed.  We go for walks and talk about life. Then he'll make fun of how I look, what I'm wearing, and what I say. He doesn't think it's hurtful, but it is to me. Many times, I might say something mean back, which only makes things worse.  Within seconds, we start fighting. He either doesn't understand he's hurt me or doesn't care. He claims he's done nothing wrong. I try to explain, but he doesn't listen. Eventually, I stop trying. I get so upset that I cry, and he gives me a blank look, which makes the situation even worse. There's yelling, screaming, and mean words, and I usually storm off because I can't take it anymore.  After a day of not talking, someone finally musters the courage to break the silence. I say something stupid or funny to lighten the mood because I can't stand seeing him unhappy. I love him, even if we've wronged each other. When he smiles, I'm overjoyed and start laughing. He then asks for a hug, and we reconcile.  Laughter is essential in my life. Without it, I might be depressed. A simple joke can make a big difference. I hope people understand the power of a small laugh. It can change your day and, ultimately, your life. Looking back, I realize that even on tough days, laughter brought me back up.
379	21185	8	2	"It's true what they say: time flies when you're having fun. On a warm @DATE1 @TIME1, a rehearsal for ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2"" was in progress. I went to bring my best friend @PERSON2 some inexpensive but delicious food. After chatting and eating for a while, it was time for me to leave. As we walked down the stairs to the back doors, I asked if they needed help with the play. ""@As a matter of fact, we do!"" @CAPS7 replied enthusiastically. ""We need someone for a ladies costume position."" I had no idea what that meant, but I sensed potential in the role.  ""I can do that. Just one question..."" I said, a bit confused. ""@What?"" @CAPS7 responded, slightly amused. ""What exactly will I be doing?"" I inquired. We then headed to the costume room so @CAPS7 could introduce me to @PERSON1, who would be my boss for the next two weeks. When we arrived, we found that @CAPS7 had already gone home. A bit frustrated, @PERSON2 explained the job to me.  ""Basically, you'll be in charge of the changing rooms and costume changes on stage,"" @CAPS7 said quickly. ""Okay, I can handle that,"" I replied confidently. As I asked more about the job, @CAPS7 said she had to go as the break was over. ""Be here at @NUM1 tomorrow morning, and you'll learn everything,"" she said hurriedly.  As @CAPS7 ran into the theatre, I heard the lead actor start his lines: ""In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice...."" I left feeling happier and more excited than I had in months.  The next morning, I went to the theatre at my old school. It felt strange yet normal to be back. Knowing I'd see my friends every day comforted me. I craved social interaction, which I'd lacked due to online school. When I entered the theatre, excited people hugged me and asked why I was there. ""I'm helping with the costuming!"" I said, equally excited.  I found @PERSON2 on stage directing the lighting. After talking, she took me to the costume room, where @PERSON1 was waiting. @PERSON1 was a classy - looking woman in a light grey cardigan, a colored top, corduroy pants, and sensible shoes. She immediately explained my duties and what I'd be doing that day.  ""I'll have you watch the rehearsal today to get a feel for things,"" she said, handing me a pen and paper. ""Take notes on the lighting cues."" I went to the auditorium and sat in the second row. The lights dimmed, and the rehearsal began with the same lines: ""In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice....""  By the end of the day, I wasn't eager to leave. The actors and crew were doing an amazing job. I knew I had a challenging task ahead, but it all worked out well. We had some great shows and a few not - so - great ones. The most important thing was the time I got to spend with the people I love. I'll miss them when I'm back doing schoolwork alone. But I'm also looking forward to helping with the next two productions at my old school."
380	21186	8	2	"In life, we share many joyful moments filled with laughter. Laughter can instantly bring us enjoyment, even in the face of life's struggles. One such moment stands out in my memory: the @CAPS1 before my grandpa passed away.  It was a white @CAPS1, and the snow wasn't the only thing shining. Everyone in my family was smiling because my grandpa had survived a sudden heart - attack the week before, though we knew his time was limited. We were determined to make his last @CAPS1 unforgettable.  My grandpa was the kindest man. He could always make us smile, no matter how sad we were. He loved the laughter of his grandchildren and wanted to have a positive impact on our lives. This @CAPS1, however, was when our laughter had the greatest effect on him.  On @DATE1, my dad's side of the family drove over the hills to my house. The house was decorated for @CAPS1 and radiated our collective happiness. My grandpa was the first to enter. I jumped into his arms and said, ""I love you, grandpa, with all my heart! Merry @CAPS1!"" He smiled and tickled me, just as he'd done since I was a child. He grabbed my hands, twirled me around, and hummed his favorite song. As we twirled, I burst into laughter. Looking into his eyes, I saw the love he had for me. He always said, ""The laughter of a young child can bring joy to anyone, even the cruelest of people.""  As we were twirling, the rest of the family entered the house. They smiled and laughed at us, but we didn't care. We knew this would be a wonderful @CAPS1. Once everyone was inside, we sat in the living room and shared stories of our past. We knew this was what my grandpa needed, and in his eyes, we could see his happiness at having a family that could put aside our troubles and enjoy each other's company.  My aunt @PERSON2 knew all the stories by heart and could even act them out. My grandpa sat there, laughing and enjoying himself. When dinner was almost ready, my grandpa and I sat at the dinner table alone and played our usual game. I'd crawl under the table and hop into random seats like a cat. He'd say, ""Sit down @PERSON1, that food isn't for you."" Then I'd sit next to him and meow, and we'd laugh. No one else understood our special bond, but it didn't matter.  At dinner, my mom's food looked amazing. My grandpa and I sat across from each other and made funny faces. Our laughter filled the room, making the @CAPS1 even more special. As we finished dinner, my grandpa got up and looked outside at the snow - covered landscape. I walked to his side, and he smiled down at me. He said, ""You never realize the beautiful things in life until your time is near. The most beautiful thing to me is your laugh. It always brings joy to my heart. If I could only hear one more sound, it would be your laugh, and if I could only see one more thing, it would be your smile. I'm happy to be your grandpa and glad to see you grow into such a wonderful girl. Always enjoy every moment, especially with the ones you love."
381	21188	8	2	Many people claim that laughter is a significant aspect of any relationship, and I concur. While not everyone always laughs, in every relationship, laughter can turn someone's day into the best they've ever had. There are always individuals having a tough time at school, home, or elsewhere. When you encounter someone like this, you should cheer them up, perhaps by saying something kind or simply wishing them a good day on @DATE3, and offering a smile. This can help them set aside whatever is preventing them from laughing, and you'll have brightened their day by sharing your smile and laughter. Many people need someone to turn to when facing a difficult situation or problem they can't handle alone, whether at home or school. They need someone to talk to, share their feelings with, and cry on their shoulder. Allowing all that pain and inner turmoil to be released to others makes people feel better. We should all make those going through a hard time smile and laugh, as it's a healthy part of a relationship and a way to help those in pain or sadness heal.  This reminds me of a true story. In elementary school, there was a girl who was extremely happy. She shared her laughter and happiness with others and was always there for those with problems or in need of someone to talk to. She was one of the nicest girls in school, and everyone liked her. She seemed to have a perfect life with no worries, and as an only child, we assumed her parents always gave her what she wanted.  It was @DATE1, and by @DATE2, we were all at school except for this girl. She never missed a day of school, so her absence was strange. We initially thought she was sick, but as she missed more days, I began to think she had moved away. However, the next week, she returned. I was glad to see her, but something was different. She wasn't laughing or smiling anymore; she had lost that special sparkle. I wondered what was wrong with her. Eventually, I learned that her mother had passed away. I was heart - broken. She had been so happy, and suddenly, she had lost her mom. I realized I had both my parents while she didn't, so I decided to share the happiness she had once shared with me and others back with her and support her during this difficult time. This shows that being happy and sharing that happiness with others is the greatest thing you can do, as you never know what others are going through, and they need someone to make them smile and laugh.
382	21189	8	2	"From a very early age, my uncle would bring the funniest cards to my brother's and my birthdays just to see our reactions. Later, when he moved to the west coast near us, we would playfully provoke each other to see how the other would respond. We've always been attuned to when the other is having a bad day and know when to lift each other's spirits.  When my family and I were young, we'd celebrate birthdays with our uncle. He'd bring hilarious cards, and we'd spend hours laughing about them. As time went on, my older brother @PERSON1 and I started getting him funny cards, competing to see who could get the best one. We'd get cards with various types of humor, from sexual to gross. We'd arrive at each other's birthdays grinning, waiting for the recipient to open the card. One year, for his birthday, I got him a card with older ladies and some sexual humor. To this day, no one has been able to top that card.  My uncle and I work in the same building but have very different jobs. He's the sales manager, and I assemble the items he sells. When I come to work, I always stop by to check on him. Usually, he's either laughing or annoyed about something in his day. On days when he's upset and goes outside to make a label for @ORGANIZATION1, I start teasing him right away. Sometimes, he gets even more angry, but he always ends up laughing or coming back with a witty retort. This daily interaction brightens our days.  This year, we bought two season passes to @CAPS4.Hood. At first, I was a poor skier and would constantly fall. When I fell, my uncle would snowboard down to me while laughing, which made me quite angry. On the way home, we'd laugh about my frequent falls. But as I improved and became better than him, I'd wait for him at the bottom of the slope. One time, he couldn't stay on his board and fell non - stop. It was my chance to get back at him for all the times he laughed at me. I laughed harder than ever on the ride home. Making fun of him as he struggled was a heart - warming experience, not because of the teasing but because it was his turn to be on the receiving end.  My uncle and I have such a great relationship because of his influence on me at a young age. His ability to make me laugh and know when to cheer me up has been one of the best things in my life. It has changed my life and personality for the better. These shared laughing experiences have transformed our ""uncle - nephew"" relationship into a friendship. My life is and will continue to be filled with laughter because of him."
383	21190	8	2	"In what I believe was the sixth grade, I went to @ORGANIZATION1. That year, I felt old enough to ride the ""big kid"" rides, which I'd never done before. I remember walking to the entrance of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 hotel with my mom, older sister @PERSON1, and @ORGANIZATION1's little sister @CAPS3. We went through the hotel as it was the quickest way into the park. There were two giant stain - glass - like windows leading to the hotel lobby. The doors were beautiful, depicting an outdoor scene with bears, fish, trees, rivers, and mountains.  Once inside the hotel, we were greeted by high ceilings, perhaps twenty feet tall. We followed the signs through the lobby until we reached the park entrance. In the middle of the park was a man - made mountain shaped like a grizzly bear, with one of the rides built around it. It was early in the morning, so the @LOCATION1 heat hadn't fully set in.  We started with the smaller rides, side attractions like ""It's Tough to Be a Bug @NUM1"", shopping in the park, and watching parades. My mom was determined to get back in time to see @LOCATION2 on stage, but we missed it. By noon, the sun was hot, and we were making our way to the pier. The song @ORGANIZATION3 by the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 played in the background. Old sunscreen advertisements were painted on the fence surrounding that end of the park. On the opposite side of the pier was a man - made ocean so blue from the dye that it looked like the water in a toilet with blue cleaning product. The air smelled of fried food and popcorn, making me @LOCATION3.  We continued walking until we reached the roller coaster @ORGANIZATION2. There was a fifteen - minute wait, which wasn't long. My older sister and I joined the line. I'd never been on a roller coaster this big before, so I was nervous but didn't want to back down. When we reached the front of the line, the ride operator asked how many of us there were. My sister held up two fingers, and he pointed to the ground next to him and said ""row eight"". We were ushered into the eighth car. I pulled down the safety bar, and the ride began.  The roller coaster cars rounded a corner and stopped. There were speakers on either side of my head that I hadn't noticed until the voice and background music started. The voice counted down from ten and then shouted ""blast off"", and the ride took off at high speed. My face was pushed back into a smile. The ride climbed a giant hill and then plummeted down. There were many twists, turns, and even upside - down parts. At the end, when it was time for the picture, I was crying from laughing so hard. My sister and I got off the ride and went to the booth to see the picture. Our faces were priceless. We rode the roller coaster five more times before going back to the hotel for dinner. Since that day, I've been addicted to roller coasters and have ridden many more."
384	21191	8	2	On @DATE2, it was around @NUM1 degrees in west @LOCATION1. My friends and I were bored and hot, with nothing to do but stay home and play video games. I came up with the idea of going outside, riding our bikes to the store to get ice cream and water, then going up Hamburger Hill and sitting in the shade. Everyone agreed. We all went home, took showers, met at the corner, and rode off to the store.  On our way to the hill, a group of middle - school kids jumped us and stole our food supplies. We've never understood why they picked on us. Maybe it was because we didn't approve of what they did, or perhaps it was because my friend @PERSON3 stole one of their girlfriends, but that's another story. After they beat us up, they got on their bikes and rode off as if they were proud of themselves for beating up @NUM2 - year - olds. Our day was ruined. I had a black eye, @PERSON3 threw up, @PERSON2 was limping, and @PERSON1 had a scratch on his head.  The next day, I called a meeting in our treehouse. I was tired of them constantly bullying us, stealing our food, and giving us wedgies. We needed to stand up against them. I devised a plan. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 would talk to all the kids who had been abused by them and recruit them for our revolt. We'd gather water balloons, eggs, and rotten food. One of the kids knew that the bullies left their houses and got on their bikes at @NUM3 pm. So, at @NUM4 at night, @PERSON3 and I would flatten a couple of their tires.  After days of planning, gathering supplies, and asking our parents for money, the plan was ready. Just as the kid said, the bullies came out at @NUM3. When they noticed their slashed tires, some of our kids jumped out of the bushes and threw food at them. @PERSON3 and I rode by on our bikes and threw water balloons. The bullies split up, and those with un - slashed bikes chased us. They almost caught up with us, but when I gave the signal, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 pulled a rope, and the bullies flew off their bikes.  However, we forgot about the other big kids in the neighborhood. When they saw what was happening, they joined in, and we were overpowered. They beat us up as if we'd stolen something. Fortunately, I'd told our parents, and they came and scolded the bullies and their parents. In the end, the bullies were grounded, and we could play in peace without fear.
385	21192	8	2	Have you ever laughed so hard that something embarrassing happened? It almost happened to me. I'm going to tell you about the funniest time I had with my best friend @CAPS1.  It was @CAPS1's birthday, and she was spending the night at her grandma's. She invited only me to come along, and I couldn't say no. @CAPS1's grandma was part of a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 club. It seems like old people always have some kind of club. The club members went on trips.  @CAPS1's grandma let us go into the store to buy drinks for the trip. I wanted @CAPS4. The bottle was really cool, with a water - bottle - like top. I got the red one because it's the best. After getting our drinks, @CAPS1's grandma told us to go to the car while she talked to the adults about the trip.  This is where the funny part begins. I got into the car first. I was thirsty, so I unscrewed the cap, removed the paper backing on the seal, and took a drink. Meanwhile, @CAPS1 got in and closed the door. As she did, her hair got caught in the door. She was laughing and yelling for me to help her, but I was laughing too hard to move. I had my drink between my legs, and the cap was open. I laughed so hard that I squeezed my legs together, and the juice shot straight into the front seat, specifically her grandma's seat. It was like a rocket, and it was incredibly funny.  @CAPS1, with her head still stuck in the door, asked what the noise was on the seat. I told her it was my juice, and we both started laughing even harder. Somehow, @CAPS1 managed to pull her head out, leaving about ten pieces of her hair in the door. She looked at the seat and said we had to tell her grandma. I was worried she'd be mad at me because the seats were white and I thought it would stain. But we told her, and she told us to get napkins from the bathroom. The whole way to the bathroom, we were laughing uncontrollably. We cleaned up the mess, and I didn't get in trouble.  I've never actually peed my pants from laughing, but I came close that day. Since then, @CAPS1 and I always laugh when we recall this story. I'm really glad we went on that @CAPS2 @CAPS3 club trip.
386	21193	8	2	For a year and two months, my life revolved around horses, school, and @CAPS1. We started as friends in @CAPS2 grade and became a couple in @LOCATION1 grade. That year, we broke up but still remained 'friends'. I clearly still cared for @CAPS1, but I didn't think he felt the same way. Turns out, I was wrong. On @DATE1 at @NUM1 pm, we started a new relationship. It was the perfect beginning of our 'perfect relationship'. From the start, we were inseparable and did everything together. I was completely, irrevocably in love with @CAPS1. We shared so many crazy memories and inside jokes that I could write a best - selling novel about them. I truly believed that @CAPS1 and I would be together forever.  I thought everything was going well until he dropped the bombshell: he liked someone else. At that moment, I was completely lost. I didn't want to face the reality. I couldn't keep exposing my heart if it was just going to be hurt. But I loved @CAPS1 and was willing to do anything to make our relationship work. I spent the night with him, and we talked until @NUM2. We decided to give it another try, though there was no guarantee it would work.  The next day, things seemed okay on the surface. I was still extremely annoyed that he liked another girl, but I was trying my best to make the most of what we had. We decided to take his dog, @CAPS3, for a walk. We held hands as we strolled, but it was eerily quiet. Why? He was texting @CAPS4. That was the last straw for me. I felt like I was in the way, so I knew I had to leave @CAPS1.  An hour later, I walked through the door, completely devastated. I cried until I couldn't cry anymore, and then I cried some more. At that time, I truly felt like the world was ending. My days became long and depressing, and I felt like giving up was the only option. Every time I saw @CAPS1, my heart shattered, and it was even worse when people kept asking what had happened. I couldn't tell them; I didn't want to relive that painful moment. I couldn't stop thinking about @CAPS1 and all the memories we'd shared. That year and two months was the best period of my life.  Almost every time I thought about @CAPS1, I would cry. I couldn't stand the thought of not having him. Constantly thinking about him turned me into a walking zombie. I couldn't eat, drink, and the stress made me vomit. But as I sat alone, lost in memories, a miracle happened: I laughed. I was shocked, but it made me realize that I needed to keep living. I don't regret any of the time I spent with @CAPS1. He changed my life and taught me so much about loving someone. From that small laugh, I knew things were going to get better. There was a spark of hope, and I would be happy again.
387	21194	8	2	The word “laughter” can mean a smile, something nice that has happened to someone, or even a thank - you. For many, it represents the action or sound of laughing. When people laugh, they often feel a sense of happiness inside. This feeling of well - being suggests that one should have moments of happiness in life, achieving a balance. For me, “laughter” means being happy and the feeling of doing something good. For example, a married couple needs laughter in their lives to enjoy each other's company.  It was @DATE1, @NUM1, @NUM2, early in the morning. I was extremely excited to leave because I was going to visit my grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins whom I hadn't seen for about eight years. That morning, I felt a mix of happiness and sadness. I was leaving for two and a half months and would miss my family and friends, but I was also eager to go.  At the airport, I was about to take my first flight on an airplane. As I made my way through the crowd of people looking for their seats, I found mine, buckled up, and looked around. My stomach was churning, like I was on a roller - coaster about to take off. When the plane started moving, I was a bit scared but also excited.  During the flight, I felt a sense of laughter in my soul. Memories of my childhood in @LOCATION2 brought a mix of laughter and tears, making me feel good in a way I'd never experienced. The thought of seeing my family and friends filled my heart with anticipation.  When we arrived at the @LOCATION1 airport, my emotions were in turmoil. We had two more flights to reach our destination. I was tired and sleepy, and my legs and arms ached, as if I were carrying heavy bags of potatoes. We decided to find a place to eat. We found a Pizza Hut. Realizing we only had an hour until our next flight, we headed to the gate. People were already boarding, so we rushed.  Three hours later, we landed in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, our destination. As we waited for our ride home, I felt a sense of laughter, like something that had been taken from me was returned. I started crying, yet I was also laughing.  That late afternoon, we reached my grandparents' house. Seeing them made me happy, and they were happy too. We decided to stay the @TIME1 there. Everyone was too busy talking and catching up to sleep. The next day, everyone was tired but still full of happiness and laughter.  We spent a month and a half with family members I hadn't seen in a while. Everyone had a great time catching up. We didn't get to do everything we wanted, but the time with my family and friends was the best part. To me, “laughter” is the best thing that can happen, making you feel good inside. It can also be the memories that make you laugh when you're alone and sad. While some say laughter is just the feeling when you laugh, it's the best feeling in the world when you're happy. Laughter has always been an important part of my life and still is.
388	21195	8	2	There are moments in life when emotions take over and drive us. I often turn to my gift of laughter during such times. My best friend, @PERSON1, with her big, tear - filled blue eyes, and I had just finished packing her things. After five years of friendship, it was time for her to leave. It pained me deeply, but we couldn't postpone this moment any longer. The labeled boxes were filled with our memories.  On @DATE1, my favorite time of the year, the sun felt warm on my skin. As we walked to look for @PERSON2, @PERSON1 and I talked about various things, almost making me forget she was leaving in a few hours. Suddenly, I noticed a shiny silver object on the ground. From where I stood, I couldn't read the engraving, but I saw the letter @CAPS1, which told me it was @PERSON2's red and blue collar. I picked it up, thinking he must be nearby.  Fate was on our side that day. As we looked up the road, we saw @PERSON2 in the back of an old @ORGANIZATION1 truck. We ran after the truck, screaming, “@CAPS2!” Finally, the truck stopped in front of the local store. The man who stepped out seemed annoyed. @PERSON1 said, “That's my dog,” and I nodded in agreement. The man looked at us in wonder and then at @LOCATION1. His face turned red with embarrassment when he realized the dog wasn't his. The whole situation was so funny that we couldn't help but laugh.  With @PERSON2 by our side, we walked home slowly, dreading what awaited us at @LOCATION2's house. That night, I stayed awake thinking about @PERSON1 and @LOCATION1. I was grateful to @PERSON2 for running off, as it gave us more time together. Maybe he knew we weren't ready to say goodbye and wanted us to have one last adventure and one last laugh. When we laughed together for the last time that day, I knew our friendship would last forever, no matter the distance.
389	21198	8	2	In @DATE1, my brother had a unique start to his birthday. We lived in a big brown house with loving parents. My brother and I loved our big backyard the most. @CAPS1 was downstairs making our school lunches. It was my brother's first day of school on his birthday, and he was overjoyed. @CAPS1 let him walk to school with me; it was just down the road. We went to @LOCATION1 school.  When we got to school, I could tell my brother was worried. He had been caught eating glue during arts and crafts before lunch. As I passed by the office, I saw him through the window. He turned and smiled, with wet glue all over his face.  My brother and I had a great relationship. We always made each other laugh. Laughter is an important part of any relationship. It allows people to share emotions positively and shows one's sense of humor.  When we got home, @CAPS1 was waiting for us on the porch. My brother went to clean up for his birthday, and @CAPS1 had him do the dishes while I vacuumed the living room. She always wanted the house clean, even if no one was coming over. She said the whole family was coming. We were excited, especially because we knew grandma was coming.  When everyone arrived, we were very happy. Grandma came a little after dad. @CAPS1 was eager to see my brother's reaction to his birthday cake. Grandma always brings gifts for us on our birthdays. When @CAPS1 brought in the cake, my brother was happier than I'd ever seen him.  After the cake and presents, we went to the backyard to play kickball. My brother wouldn't use his new soccer ball, so we used a basketball. @CAPS1 and grandma watched us play. We laughed every time I kicked the ball wrong or he missed a kick.  I had an idea and kicked the ball hard. Instead of going to his feet, it hit his head, and he did a backflip. @CAPS1 and grandma were in awe, and I was frozen. When he got up and laughed, everyone started laughing, and I couldn't stop.  When it was time for everyone to leave, @CAPS1 said goodbye, then grandma kissed my brother and me on the forehead. My brother and I sat on @CAPS1's lap, hugged her, and said, “I love you @CAPS1.” As @CAPS1 was tucking us in, my brother said, “@CAPS1, my head hurts.” I love my family, and even today, we look back on this and laugh.
390	21199	8	2	Laughter can be defined as showing mirth, joy, or scorn through a chuckle or an explosive vocal sound. People without laughter in their lives often experience depression or a sense of sadness, feeling like they can't find happiness.  When I found out my best friend had flipped her car, my world turned upside down. I was traumatized and in shock. A million questions rushed through my mind as I tried to find out if she was okay. All I knew was that she was being rushed to the hospital.  At home, I lay in bed, filled with guilt. I kept thinking about all the times we'd shared: the laughter, the fights, and the pranks. What bothered me most was that we'd had a fight shortly before the accident, over something stupid. I'd been irritated because she kept ditching our plans to be with her boyfriend. Looking back, I realized I was just jealous. I wished I could take it all back, thinking it might have prevented the accident.  The next morning, her mother called and said my friend was asking for me. I was overjoyed and got ready in minutes. I drove to the @LOCATION1 hospital in thirty - five minutes, usually a forty - five - minute drive.  I rushed into the hospital and found out she was in room @NUM1. I peeked through the crack in the door before gathering the courage to enter. When she saw me, she smiled. I pulled up a chair and sat next to her. We talked for about an hour, including about the wreck. She said she had a few broken ribs and a minor concussion and would be out that afternoon.  When she told me everything was fine, I laughed, a laugh of relief. Soon, we were both laughing, mostly out of excitement and the joy of being together. Laughter, for me, is the most meaningful thing. It's a sign of happiness, a way to share unforgettable moments with a loved one. Life can't be complete without laughter. We should make jokes, laugh, and give meaning to our lives. Instead of being @PERSON2, we should be @PERSON1. Try it and see how laughter can change your life.
391	21200	8	2	"Throughout my entire life, I've been someone who always seeks joy and finds humor in everything. My passion for happiness has never diminished, even when I had an accident a few years ago and fell through a metal roof. My mother is an only child. She has some step - siblings, but we rarely see them. When I think of my relatives, they never come to mind, and I can't even remember what they look like. This might make my childhood seem empty, especially since my father passed away when I was very young. However, there's no need for pity. Growing up in a low - income family with a single mother and two kids was tough, but I managed to get through it.  I've always wondered if everyone has a best friend they consider family. That's what my mother had in her closest friend, @PERSON1. They've been friends since before high school, long before I was born. @PERSON1 has always been there for us. She was even by my mother's side when I was born. I'm sure having babies as teenagers was quite unusual. Just two years after I was born, @PERSON1 had her own daughter, @PERSON2. They've become my aunt and cousin, and they've been like family ever since.  I spent my entire childhood in one house. Over the years, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 often came to stay with us. I used to share a room with @PERSON2. We fought like enemies but loved like sisters. My brother was born five years after me and three years after @PERSON2. He was always too young to play with us, so having other girls in the house was great. They were the family I never had, but it wasn't always smooth sailing.  @PERSON2 and I had many fierce arguments. I never thought our fights would lead to them leaving. One @DATE1 @TIME1, on a warm and dull day, I woke up to find them gone. A year passed, and we didn't hear from them. @PERSON1 didn't visit or send a letter. It was as if they vanished from the face of the earth. My heart was broken, but it healed over time.  One evening, the phone rang non - stop. To our surprise, it was @PERSON1 saying, ""We just moved in. You have to come see our new place."" It was like nothing had ever gone wrong between the two adults. When we went to visit them, @PERSON2 took me to a friend's house to climb the shed. I didn't refuse because I wanted to be friends again. But if I had known what was going to happen, I wouldn't have gone.  As we walked away, all you could hear was my sobbing. A young boy who looked about my age turned the corner and saw me in a mess. He laughed. ""It's not funny!"" I cried. His expression changed, and he asked, ""What happened?"" I was too ashamed to speak, so @PERSON2 said, ""@CAPS5 fell through a metal roof!"" We both thought he was a jerk but didn't say it. He offered to help, but I refused.  As @PERSON2 and I walked further, the pain in my body became more bearable. I looked at @PERSON2 and said, ""@CAPS6 was really cute."" I blushed with embarrassment. @PERSON2 blushed too and agreed with me. I complained, ""It's so unfair. I'm crying, dirty, limping, and a mess, and of course, I'd run into a cute guy looking like this!"" @PERSON2 laughed out loud. At that moment, something inside me made me laugh too. We spent the rest of the walk laughing about the incident and sharing similar stories.  Looking back, I'd like to think that our youth and naivety brought us back together, but that's not true. It was our laughter. Laughter can make a person feel better even in the scariest and tensest situations. It heals emotions, sparks thoughts, and brings people closer."
392	21202	8	2	Warm laughter can be regarded as both the best medicine and the best glue. When individuals laugh, particularly in each other's company, it induces a sense of relaxation and happiness. Laughter is an expression of amusement, which essentially means a temporary suspension of deep thought. In such moments, people become more open - minded, and a warm, shared feeling emerges in their hearts. Without this connection or the ability to joke around, people tend to over - analyze relationships.  Flirting involves making light of a situation, with the aim of putting people at ease so that they can open up. It can take various forms, such as joking, impressing, or complimenting, often leading to laughter or excessive giggling. Once this warm connection is established, a bond forms between people, just as it did in my relationship with my girlfriend.  I had recently gone through a painful experience with another girl, which made me emotionally guarded. I was also a rather nervous person. However, when my girlfriend started being kind and pleasant to me, I began to come out of my shell and laugh with her. Our first date was to see a comical yo - yo performer at her church. It was an excellent way to initiate our relationship, which has now lasted for two years, and it also provided a comfortable setting to meet her parents.  Sometimes, the key to building a connection or strengthening a bond is to be a bit self - deprecating. It's difficult to laugh with someone who is overly proud or analytical. Laughter serves as a crucial mental break from routine thinking. Being a bit of a dork can be beneficial in a healthy relationship. In my relationship, there is a good balance between supporting each other, offering constructive criticism, and having fun being silly. My girlfriend and I make efforts to make each other laugh, and this usually results in both of us being extremely happy.  Being a man is not about being stubborn or overly powerful; rather, it's about being open - hearted and compassionate. To be able to laugh with someone, one must first be able to laugh at themselves. Laughter is a social catalyst that can transform the atmosphere and spread rapidly.  The same principle applies to social gatherings. Can someone become the life of the party without being able to laugh at themselves? Usually, those who are the center of attention at a party go out of their way to be funny and ridiculous. Once the laughter starts, it spreads quickly. Comfort is the foundation of having a good time. Without it, people may act paranoid, avoid participation, and seem cold. The positive energy of laughter is an effective way to make people feel comfortable and relaxed.  Think of people as @CAPS1. Cold @CAPS1 is thick and difficult to spread. It has limited use until it is heated. However, heating it too quickly can make it lose its flavor. Gradually warming @CAPS1 makes it easy to spread and very useful. It can mix well with other things and stick to them. My relationship has been incredibly sweet, warm, and enduring, all thanks to a little bit of effort and a lot of laughter.
393	21203	8	2	The significance and benefits of @CAPS2 are truly vital in life. Laughter has the power to brighten one's mood and bring about a greater sense of happiness. When people laugh more frequently, their days seem happier, lighter, and pass more quickly. Young children are known to laugh more often, while it can be challenging to make adults laugh as they tend to be more serious.  There are numerous stories that highlight laughter as an essential element. Laughter can be associated with many positive aspects, such as gladness and happiness. I once read a story about a little girl named @CAPS3 who had a knack for making people happy. Through her efforts, people laughed more, and even the sick started to recover.  Laughter is influenced by various factors. For instance, being glad often leads to more laughter, happiness, and smiling. When you're feeling down and a stranger smiles at you, it can lift your spirits and improve your mood.  One morning, it was gray and rainy. The people in the household woke up irritable and grumpy. Everything seemed to go wrong. No one was smiling, and breakfast was a silent affair. It seemed like the day was going to be a miserable one.  @CAPS4 was also in a terrible mood that day. She didn't want to go to school at all. She was angry with the rain, as it prevented her from going out with her friends. She was mad at her maid for forgetting to fill her pitcher with warm water, and at her little sister for taking her blue hair ribbons. In fact, she was angry with everyone, without realizing that if she were happier, things might seem better.  Despite her reluctance, she had to go to school. At school, the teacher was as cheerful as ever, even on that rainy and gloomy day. Only a few students shared her positive mood. The schoolwork, especially mathematics, seemed never - ending for @CAPS4.  However, everything changed when the teacher announced story time. The story was about a little orphan girl who went to live with her mean relatives. But she remained happy and unaffected by their moods. Over time, the people around her, especially the sick and old, started to become happy too. When she had to leave the village, everyone was sad to see her go. She left behind the precious gift of happiness, which led to more laughter. Even after she was gone, passers - by could still hear the sounds of happiness and laughter, and they often felt better just by staying in that place for a while.  After the teacher finished the story, @CAPS4 thought about how she could cheer up her family. She realized that just because it was raining, it didn't mean everyone had to be gloomy. So, after school, she rushed home. In the @TIME1, when everyone was relaxing after a long day, laughter could be heard through the windows. It seemed that @CAPS4 had found a way to bring laughter into her home. The story she heard that day had a profound impact on her, and she remembered the importance of happiness and laughter throughout her life. This seemingly small factor has made @CAPS4's life much happier, and I hope it can have the same effect on you.
394	21204	8	2	"It was the first day of my sophomore year. I had just moved to @LOCATION1 during the @DATE1, so like any new student, I was nervous about starting at a new school. When I entered the school and took a look around, everything seemed normal until I noticed something unusual. In the middle of the cafeteria, among the sea of tables, there were about four tables, each with around @NUM1 people. What caught my attention wasn't just their presence but what they were doing. They were engaged in a @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 - @CAPS3 card duel right in the open, where everyone could see!  I was shocked. I used to play this game in elementary school when it was new, but I stopped because no one in my old school was interested anymore. And here I was, seeing at least @NUM2 high - school students playing it so openly. What surprised me the most was that they were in a public place where they could be judged by others.  I moved to a nearby table and started watching a kid named @PERSON1 (who later became one of my best friends) completely dominate his opponent. I quickly remembered most of the rules and went home that day thinking, ""I'm going to get back into this game!"" So, I bought a deck and continued to observe the players, with my deck sitting in front of me, waiting for a challenge.  A few days passed as I silently watched the duelists. Finally, a duelist named @CAPS5.J (another one of my now - good friends) challenged me. I accepted the challenge. However, he easily defeated me in what seemed like just five rounds. @PERSON1 then taught me how to play better, and we became great friends. He's a really funny guy, and I can't help but laugh when I'm around him. Through him, I've met many wonderful friends.  Even now, I often wonder what my high - school life would have been like if they hadn't been at my new school. Their presence not only re - introduced me to a game I loved but also brought a lot of joy and friendship into my life."
395	21205	8	2	"Some people might say that laughter isn't important in a relationship, but I strongly disagree. Laughter can instantly lighten the mood, even if it only lasts for a few seconds. My cousin and I laugh for various reasons, whether something is funny or we're just tired.  There are so many stories about the times my cousin and I have laughed together. One of the best ones happened at @ORGANIZATION1. We always have a great time there. Just the other day, we went to @ORGANIZATION1 with a friend. Our friend went to get some candy, and as soon as she left, my cousin and I started running away and hiding, which we like to call ""being ninjas."" We couldn't stop laughing the whole time. Our friend tried to call us and find us, but we didn't answer or show ourselves.  Then, we saw our friend walking in the other direction. We ran up behind her and scared her. This is just one of the many instances where laughter has played a big part in my life. Laughter has the power to create wonderful memories and strengthen relationships. It makes every moment with my cousin more enjoyable, and I hope everyone can experience the same kind of laughter - filled moments in their lives."
396	21206	8	2	"One morning, I woke up, stared out of my window, and listened to the birds chirping. I usually keep my window open at night for fresh air as I dislike breathing in the warm air of my own breath. After waking up, I went out and had some Rice Krispies with my two sisters, @PERSON2 and @PERSON3. As I was about to finish, I realized I was late for school. I was only in @NUM1 grade, so I quickly got dressed and told my sisters to hurry up and get ready. But, like most girls, they were busy putting on makeup and doing their hair. My sister @PERSON2 was in @NUM2 grade, and my other sister was in @NUM3 grade. Our schools were adjacent to each other. Finally, they got ready, and we headed off to school, looking forward to an exciting day with my teacher, @PERSON4hawk. She wasn't the kindest teacher, but I liked her because when we were cleaning our desks, she gave us shaving cream, and my friend @PERSON1 and I had a great time playing with it. We started the day with a book by ""@CAPS1 foul."" I can't recall the title, but I remember the gold - colored cover, and it was about ghouls and monsters. The way she read it made it seem as if we were right there in the story. Even though I didn't fully understand it, it was very intense. Next, she gave us a math worksheet. I was quite good at math, and she always gave me harder problems than the other kids. When I asked her why, she said I was different. I knew I was smarter than some kids, but not all, so I never knew if it was a compliment or an insult, and I didn't really care. After school, I was trying to find my sister to walk home with me. After looking for @NUM5 minutes, I saw her walking towards the cross - walk. I yelled her name, ""@CAPS2."" She saw me running towards her and her friends. Since she didn't want to be seen with her annoying little brother, she ran across the street. My dad was waiting in the car. My sister reached the car before me, and I was in a hurry to get there. I had to wait for the cross - guard lady to signal me. Finally, she noticed me. I walked quickly past her, hearing my dad yelling ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6."" As I was walking, I heard a car speeding down the street. I didn't realize it was heading straight for me. The car came around the corner, nearly hitting the cross - guard lady, and hit the crossing stick. Suddenly, I was hit, flying and rolling down the street. I was bruised and cut all over. My dad panicked, ran out of the car, screamed at the lady who hit me, and got her license plate number. As I lay on the ground, my dad came to me and pulled down my pants to check the damage. I was wearing my Scooby - Doo underwear, and everyone was staring at me. I was more embarrassed than hurt at that moment. I didn't feel the pain until the next day. I couldn't walk, so my dad put me in the car. Everyone was laughing at me because they saw my underwear. My dad rushed me home and then called the ambulance. The doctors said I would be able to walk again, but I'd have trouble with sports because I had a fractured hip. My sisters spoiled me with candy, and my dad gave me ice cream. Best of all, I couldn't feel the pain. The fireman said I could go to school the next day, and I did. My mean teacher saw me limping and told me to ""stop faking it."" I told my mom, and she got very angry. The lady who hit me pays for my doctor bills."
397	21207	8	2	"My knees were weak, and my hands trembled slightly. My rapid heartbeat quickened my breathing. I was eager to get this over with, yet I had no intention of starting a conversation, let alone approaching him. It had been a whole @DATE1 since I last saw my dad, and I wasn't sure if he'd be relaxed and laid - back or uptight and cranky. So, I closed my eyes, took deep breaths, and decided to leave it to fate. I knew that seeing my dad would naturally lead to conversation, but I was worried about his mood and how it might affect mine. If things went badly, we might not get along well for weeks. He'd often say things like, ""You think now that you're a teenager, you can do and act however you want?"" or ""I'm your father, I deserve more respect!"" The thing is, I never start these arguments. He initiates them when he's bored, I suppose. Then he makes me feel bad for his wrongdoings. When my mother, sister, and I arrived at the airport, I'll admit, I wanted to go home. My sister cracked a few jokes, and my mother showed her wit, but I could only manage a small giggle because I was so nervous. I didn't want my past three months of @DATE1 to be ruined by his return. However, when I thought about all I'd done, like the two weeks in @LOCATION1 and rafting, I realized I missed him and wanted him back. My dad is a nice, funny, and hard - working man, but it can be challenging to deal with him sometimes. My dad's flight landed. After waiting an hour, he came out of the airplane. We could see his eyes frantically searching for us. When he found us, he gave the warmest, friendliest smile I'd ever seen on his face. Tears welled up in his eyes as my sister ran towards him, and my mom followed quickly. I ran towards him too, and my sister and I competed to be the first to hug him. One hundred feet felt both close and far away. Panting, we reached him with heavy legs and full hearts. Thankfully, there was no awkward moment. Instead of awkwardness, there was laughter. All my troubles and worries vanished when he started laughing. My heart lifted, and my smile brightened. I knew my father couldn't have been away any longer. I love him. Laughter soothes the soul and brings joy to any situation. It's kind and has no regrets. The only mistake is not seizing the chance to laugh. Laughter is what keeps me close to my father. Our shared sense of humor is unforgettable. I trust him with my life, and since I was born, he's always found a way to make the best of every situation with laughter. His laugh can make anyone smile and is undoubtedly the most contagious thing you'll ever hear. As the saying goes, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" and it's true for me and my father."
398	21208	8	2	"The first day I met her, I knew she was the perfect dog for me. Her black - and - white fur was as soft as cotton, and her brown eyes resembled the bark of a tree. She had a unique personality that no other dog could match. I was immediately certain she was the one. Over the next few months, our friendship grew. I taught her to talk, smile, and stand on two legs to dance with me. A black lab named @PERSON1 became her best friend. The two of them would run around the property, barking and playing. Every night, they'd cuddle up and sleep together. When she'd lie on her side and relax, I'd call her an Oreo because her white middle belly and black sides made her look like a large, breathing Oreo. That's how her name came about. The seventh month passed quickly, and every day with her by my side was enjoyable. She gave me great comfort when I needed it, always smiling at me on rainy days or sleeping next to me when I wasn't feeling well. She was like my special medicine; her presence made me feel better. Her love had deeply touched all of us in the house, and she was truly one - of - a - kind. But as time went on, something started to change. Her food bowl would be almost full every time we fed her. She stopped running with @PERSON1, stopped talking, and stopped smiling. I knew something was wrong. We didn't realize she was sick until it was too late. The first sign was when she threw up blood. My boyfriend, his mother, and I started to worry. We wanted to find a vet to help her, but we didn't have the money. One morning, I couldn't find her anywhere on the property. I thought she'd just gone for a walk around the house. But when it was @NUM1 pm and there was still no sign of her, I panicked. I gave up looking for her and turned to @PERSON1. I looked into her eyes and said, ""@PERSON1, I know you can hear me."" She looked at me with big brown eyes and wagged her tail. I asked, ""@CAPS5 is @CAPS1, @PERSON1?"" I knew she understood me because she started sniffing around and then followed a scent to an old opal car. She wagged her tail, looked at me, and then looked under the car. There she was, looking sick. I pulled her back onto the property for my boyfriend's mother to check. We weren't sure if it was poisoning or something else, so we called an animal expert. He said it was most likely parvo since she hadn't had her parvo shot. That night, my boyfriend and I stayed up, giving her water and spinach juice to make her feel better, but all she wanted to do was sleep. So we left her alone and decided to check on her in the morning. In the morning, my boyfriend had to go to work, and I was left to take care of her. I sang songs to her as she lay on the porch, looking sad and in despair. I stroked her head and told her how much she meant to me and that I loved her. I tried to get her to eat, but she'd just puke it back up. After a day of crying next to her, I noticed she kept going to the pond behind the house and sitting in it. That made me check her butt. When I pulled up her tail, I saw a large, bloody hole with flies flying out of it. She was rotting from the inside out. I cried. It was time to decide whether to put her down. My boyfriend, his father, and I just watched her in pain. It was the right time. As soon as we got to the vet office, they took her inside and laid her on a table. I was told to hold her as they injected an overdose of anesthesia. In seconds, she was gone. Everyone in the room was silent, and I cried over her limp, no - longer - smiling body. We dug a hole and buried her under the tree where she used to play. I said, ""@CAPS1 my mama bear. @NUM2 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 you in heaven."
399	21209	8	2	"Fishing has been an important part of my life since I was born. When I was little, I used to go fishing with my dad and brother. My dad loved taking us lake - fishing, and I've fished in every lake around here. When I was five, I got a brand - new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole. It was shiny, with a great ball - bearing spinning reel and chrome on the handle. When the sun hit it just right, it would shine a beam of bright light on the ground. As I grew older, so did my fishing pole. The reel didn't turn as smoothly, and the chrome lost its shine. When I turned @MONEY1, my old pole was broken down and no longer suitable for my fishing needs. On my tenth birthday, my family and friends gave me some money. I told them I wanted to buy a new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole. After my birthday, I had one hundred and @MONEY1. I felt like the richest man in the world. That night, my dad told me that my cousin's wedding was on @DATE1 and that we might have time to do some fishing afterward. I went to the garage and packed my tackle box with pliers, hooks, spinners, and all the fishing gear I needed. After the wedding, my dad said, ""Let's go fishing."" We changed into our fishing clothes and set off. Then I remembered I needed a fishing pole, so I asked, ""Dad, we need to stop at @ORGANIZATION1 quickly."" Fortunately, there was an @ORGANIZATION1 on the way. We pulled into the parking lot, and I went inside. I ran to the sporting goods section and found the last @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole on the shelf. I got it down and examined it. It was the perfect pole for me, but the price was seventy @MONEY1. I bought it anyway and walked out of the store, feeling great with my new fishing pole. When we arrived at our fishing spot, I realized it was a large river, not a lake. My dad warned me to be careful around the river because I could get swept away if I fell in. The wind was harsh and cold. I took out my new pole and tackle box and started setting up for river fishing. I attached a large weight and a big hook. I thought I was ready for anything. I reached into my big red tackle box and pulled out a large worm, saying to my dad, ""I think the fish will love this."" I stared at the fast - flowing water and cast my baited line off - shore. There was a big splash, and my dad and I smiled with satisfaction. Next to me was a branch buried in the embankment. I gently set my pole down and watched as my dad caught a fish. On our way to the river, there was an outhouse. I needed to use the restroom, so I told my dad, "
400	21210	8	2	@DATE1 my birthday, my boyfriend @PERSON2 took me to @LOCATION1 to @ORGANIZATION2's. I had never been there it was exciting and a new food experience for me. My dad had promised me that he would take me because it was my @NUM1 birthday and he wasn't there for my @NUM2 birthday. But he forgot so my dads girlfriend called the restaurant and told the manager that it was my birthday and to give me anything that i wanted and just to charge it on her credit card. This is where mine and @PERSON2's adventure started..  The beging of our adventure. Driving on the old back roads of @CAPS1 in the old @ORGANIZATION1 on our way to @LOCATION1. Just @PERSON2 and I, the roads were damp with the mid-afternoon dew, the trees with their beautiful leaves of all different color's of red's, green's, and orange. Bouncing around from the dips in the old road. @NUM3 bumpin on the stereo, only singing the parts we know. When we got to @CAPS2 we got lost because we took the wrong exit and ended up in @LOCATION2 the other side of where we were supposed to be. Being lost in a way bigger city than @PERSON1 or @CAPS1 wasn't good, We had no clue where we were.  First place we go to was a strip mall that had a big party store. we go inside and theirs @CAPS4 decorations as far as the eye could see. Monster's, whitche's, and goblin's. We got side tracked by all the scary things I realized that I had to go to the bathroom. While I went to the bathroom @PERSON2 asked one of the store clerks where we could find this @CAPS5. The guy tells us hes never heard of a place like that. So we got back into the @ORGANIZATION1, there was a lady getting out of her car so we asked her. She said yeah its just down a couple of streets. As we drive down the highway we couldn't find it anywhere. Somehow we are lost all over again so we find another covenant store up this really big hill. we didn't think that the little @ORGANIZATION1 could make it up such a big hill. We made it to the top, went inside and had the clerk look up on his phone were we needed to go. As we waited all I could think about was how bad my feet were hurting in those shoes. We got the address and took off again for our search.   About twenty minutes later we still had no luck at finding this restaurant and to top it off we had a reservation so we couldn't be late. We find another covenant store and @PERSON2 ran in to ask. The clerk told us to get back on the highway I was like no no stay on this road. We followed the empty road and right around the corner there it was @CAPS5. We were happy to have found it finally and we weren't even late. All @PERSON2 and I could do was laugh because we had gotten so frustrated to find the stupid place that it was just so funny you couldn't help but not to laugh. It brought @PERSON2 and I just that much closer we had gotten through that by laughing instead of fighting. And that we our funny adventure story. 
401	21211	8	2	Laughter has been an integral part of my life since birth. Without it, I would be an extremely dull and irritable person. Although I've had numerous moments filled with laughter, one particular incident always comes to mind. Approximately a year ago, my mother and I traveled to @LOCATION1 to visit her family. It was our first visit in over twelve years due to immigration issues. After all those years, my mother and I obtained legal residency in the United States. Once we got the residency, we were free to visit her family without the need to return illegally. When we arrived at the airport in @LOCATION1, my mother was overcome with emotions and began to cry. For the first time in twelve years, she was going to see her parents, brothers, and sisters. After going through airport security and baggage claim, we made our way to the exit where my grandfather had agreed to pick us up. As we stepped outside the airport, a small red @ORGANIZATION1 approached us. When the car was about forty feet away, my mother dropped her luggage and ran towards it. I had no idea who the elderly driver was. When the car parked, an aged man stepped out and gave my mother an incredibly long and emotional hug. They hugged for at least fifteen minutes, crying on each other's shoulders. After they finished hugging, my mother called my name, and I walked towards them. When I stood face - to - face with my mother and the older man, she introduced him as my grandfather and then told him to meet his grandson. For the first time in a long while, I had a grandfather. We both stood in shock. He was amazed at how much I had grown and changed in those twelve years without seeing or contacting me. When I reached out to hug him, he held me tightly and said that this was the happiest day of his life. My grandfather and I loaded the luggage into his car to head home and meet the rest of my family. The fifty - minute drive home was a bit strange and uncomfortable as there wasn't much conversation in the car. We arrived at our destination in a small town outside @LOCATION1 called Texcoco. It was a clean town with many small stores and two - story middle - class houses. The streets were filled with cars, people walking, and cyclists, very different from what I was accustomed to in the United States. When we reached our house, about twenty family members and friends were waiting for us outside the gate. After we settled in and met all our relatives, we had a family dinner. One of my uncles was very funny, always acting like a clown and setting a jovial mood. As the days passed, I became more comfortable with the people around me and started having fun. About two weeks later, my uncle @CAPS1 invited me to one of his stand - up comedy shows. That day, I laughed more than ever before. His jokes were original and true. In conclusion, laughter is an essential part of life. Without it, I couldn't be happy.
402	21213	8	2	"It's my sophomore year, and some of my friends decided to try out for softball. After some thought, I joined them and immediately fell in love with the sport. I'm not very good at it, but as the saying goes, practice makes perfect. We all have a great time on the softball team. Everyone gets along well, and it's really fun to be part of a group that's always laughing. One particular incident stands out in my mind. We were out catching pop - flys, and it was my turn to catch the ball. I skipped out there, being my usual quirky self. They hit the ball, and as it came towards me, I ran for it, slipped, and landed right on my butt. Everyone, including me, burst into laughter because I ended up in the mud and got all dirty. About ten minutes later, as we stood around talking about how funny my fall was, I saw some mud on the ground. I wanted to roll in it but didn't want to just lie down and start rolling. So, I asked my friend @PERSON1 to push me into the mud. After she pushed me, I got up and laughed uncontrollably. My knees, butt, and legs were covered in mud. Since we're not allowed to curse, we came up with the phrase ""who shied on you"" to replace it. Now, whenever I see someone from the softball team in the hallways, we both start laughing and say ""who shied on you"" in the middle of whatever we're doing. This is my first year playing a sport in high school, and I'm really glad I did it. I'm having so much fun. When the season ends in a few months, I'll be really sad. The girls on the team have become like family to me in the last @NUM1 weeks. Most of us barely knew each other before, but now we're close. We love doing silly things like randomly singing in the locker room or telling the dumbest jokes. Our coach is amazing and makes us laugh every day. This season is going to be really interesting because we all love to laugh, make jokes, sing, and have a great time together. That's what makes a good softball team and a great season."
403	21214	8	2	Laughter has always played a significant role in my life. Most of my friendships are strong because I can make my friends laugh and cheer them up when they're down. When a person laughs, they forget about their troubles and focus on the source of their laughter, experiencing joy and happiness. When you laugh, your mind is solely occupied with what made you laugh. In many cases, laughter can quickly transform a person with low self - esteem into someone with high self - esteem. An example of this happened with one of my friends. He seemed very down and didn't want to talk about what was bothering him. For about a week, he isolated himself from others. Finally, he was ready to talk and hang out with some close friends, including me. We decided to go golfing, a new hobby of ours. That day, he told us that his mother had been cheating on his father for over a year and that she was hiding alcohol in various places and drinking excessively. By being around his friends, laughing, and having a good time, he started to focus on other things rather than the problems in his life. Even laughing at oneself can be an effective way to cope with difficulties. No matter how bad things seem, there's always a glimmer of hope; you just need to be patient. The moral of this story is that no matter how sad you feel, laughter can always alleviate the pain. Even laughing about a difficult situation can make you feel better.
404	21215	8	2	Laughter is an important part of everyone's life. It serves to express various emotions, bridge the gap between people, and break the ice. People often laugh at their own mistakes, showing others that they're not perfect. Some people can communicate through laughter and understand each other's feelings. For example, during a long car ride when I was bored and about to fall asleep, my friend and I started laughing in different ways and had an entire conversation just through laughter. Laughter can bring people together by highlighting shared interests. I'm sure I laugh more than most people. It's such a big part of my life that without it, my life would be dull and depressing. I laugh so much that sometimes my sides and stomach hurt. I'm also quite clumsy and make a lot of mistakes, so I get laughed at often. My family is very close - knit and full of humor. We make mistakes every day. For my great - grandma's @DATE1, we planned a surprise party. While planning, my grandma got suspicious and kept asking what we were doing. So, we told her we were going to get her a stripper for her @DATE1. We convinced my uncle Bobby to be the stripper and climb out of a box, which he did, and it scared my grandma. To this day, we still talk about and laugh at that incident. My aunt always acts in a ridiculous and funny way. She often dances to commercial music or sings opera. My great - grandma eats foods that make her pass gas, and sometimes she doesn't even realize it, which is really funny. She also likes to dance, and her dance moves are very different from the ones today. I believe that without laughter, my family wouldn't be as close as we are. It also helps me bond with my friends. Laughter can make you ask questions and get to know people in new ways. It makes you feel comfortable around others, allowing you to share things, act silly, and not worry about your appearance. It can also instantly change your mood from angry to happy. For instance, I was riding dirt bikes with my younger cousin. He wanted to go through a swamp with his bike. I warned him it wasn't a good idea as I knew he'd get stuck, but he tried anyway. As I expected, he got the bike stuck, and I had to help him get it out. After we finally got it out, he tried to go through again and got stuck once more. I was really angry with him, but when he fell head - first into the mud as I was about to yell at him, my mood instantly changed. Even now, I laugh about it, although I didn't find it funny at the time. However, laughter isn't always good. It can be bad when people laugh at others who are hurt and crying, at stupid and ignorant pranks, or at people making bad decisions like drinking. Laughing at others in these situations can influence them to continue making bad choices because they think it's okay since it's making others laugh. So, while laughter is healthy, it can also have negative aspects.
405	21217	8	2	My friends and I got into a heated discussion because one of them told others some personal things about us. This caused a lot of problems for us at school and around town. He also started lying to us. One of my other friends got so angry that he tackled the liar down and told him to stop lying. After he let the liar up and we all sat back down, the liar started to confess. He told us about some rumors he'd spread and other things he'd done. We were all really angry. After we calmed down a bit, we took turns talking to him. When it was my turn, he kept interrupting me. I got so mad that I reached down to grab something from the floor to threaten him with it, not to hurt him but to make him stop interrupting. I picked up something soft without looking and threatened to throw it at him. He started pointing and laughing, and I turned my head to see what was in my hand. Remember, the conversation was extremely tense. I didn't really want to know what it was, but when I looked, I fell over laughing. It was a stuffed fairy. I did throw it at him, but playfully. After we all stopped laughing, we sat back down. I believe that the laughter calmed us down enough to help us explain things and improve the situation for him and all of us. The moral of the story is that even when you're angry, there's always something that can make you smile and brighten your day.
406	21218	8	2	"I was deeply drawn to talk to her, yet every time I summoned the courage, anxiety welled up inside me. Then, she glanced at me briefly. That fleeting moment was enough for her to take in something about me, and to realize that I wasn't just aimlessly looking around the room but was fixated on her dark - brown eyes. Embarrassed, I quickly averted my gaze, scolding myself for being so obvious. However, on some level, I wanted her to notice me and look back. After our brief eye - contact, I no longer felt her gaze on me. I stole another glance her way, and this time, she was already looking at me. I was at a loss, as I'd never been in such a situation before; no girl had ever been the first to look at me like this. She gave a cute little smile and said she'd noticed my attention and saw no reason for me to hide it. She was interested in me. All I could do was try not to look foolish. I managed a small smile to let her know I'd seen her smile directed at me. There she was, @PERSON1, smiling at me, giving me a chance to show her what made me the right guy for her.  On @DATE1, we planned to go to the ice - rink in @LOCATION1, which was about @NUM1 minutes away. The drive seemed short because of the rowdy chatter and banter among our @NUM2 friends in the back of the car. We arrived and parked beside the rink. As we stepped out of my mom's minivan, the hustle and bustle of kids getting their rental skates and clumsily making their way to the thick glass doors leading to the oval arena filled our ears. The arena was filled with dry, frigid air and a large expanse of cut - up ice.  Our group of friends exchanged money for a pair of worn - out, probably never - cleaned ice skates. We reluctantly slipped on these uncomfortable bladed shoes and waddled towards the glass doors. One by one, we carefully stepped onto the ice, making sure not to make a fool of ourselves by sliding forward and doing the splits. Once we overcame that initial hurdle, we joined the flow of skaters moving counter - clockwise around the rink. Occasionally, we'd race each other for a lap, but mostly, we talked about @CAPS1 of @CAPS2: @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and other games that interested us. As usual, this conversation turned into a debate about ""over - powered classes"". One side complained about never being able to win against a particular class, while the other side claimed it was easy to ""destroy"" them with a simple trick.  I started to zone out of the argument and looked around the rink. I saw her again. Her hair, fluttering in the @DATE2's breeze like a blanket on a clothesline, caught my eye first. As she rounded the end of the rink, her beautiful face came into view. She wasn't struggling too much with skating, but every now and then, she'd slide a skate too far to one side, lose her balance, and quickly regain it. She looked around, checking if anyone had seen her little mishap, and I smiled. Amidst the bickering of my friends, with one sneering, ""@CAPS5 the sniper is @CAPS6 @LOCATION2, you don't know what you're talking about!"", I had no interest in getting involved. I sped up, weaved through the crowd, and made my way towards her. As I approached, I ran through some conversation starters in my head. I noticed her feet slide outwards, and I saw an opportunity. Just as she was about to fall, I sped up, placed my hand on her back, and tried to give her a little push up. But she was already falling, and she tumbled on top of me onto the hard ice. Once the commotion stopped, she quickly got up and apologized for her clumsiness. All she could see was my uncontrollable laughter, and she couldn't help but laugh along."
407	21219	8	2	"I have many friends, and we're always up to silly antics to have a great time and pass the hours. Laughter is a constant in our lives; there's not a single day when we're together without sharing a good laugh. My friends and I firmly believe that laughter is an essential part of life.  On a sweltering @DATE1, my friends @PERSON2, @LOCATION3, @PERSON1, @LOCATION1, and @PERSON3 came over to my house. We were bored and hot, so we needed to decide on something exciting to do. @LOCATION3 suggested, ""Why don't we go swimming, guys?"" We all agreed, but we couldn't decide where to go. The pool near my house was too crowded, and the lake was too far away, and we had no way to get there since my mother was at work and couldn't give us a ride.  Then, @CAPS6 had an idea: ""I know! Why don't we just have a water balloon fight right here at @CAPS2's house?"" We all enthusiastically replied, ""Let's do it!"" A short while later, the @CAPS4 went to the nearest store, @ORGANIZATION1, to buy water balloons and water guns. When they returned, they immediately started filling them up while the ladies changed into their bathing suits.  After that, we decided on the teams. The first team consisted of @PERSON2, @PERSON3, and @LOCATION1. The second team, which I thought was the best, was @LOCATION3, @PERSON1, and me. Both teams were ready, each armed with buckets full of water balloons and water guns. We were positioned on opposite sides of my mom's green suburban.  We were supposed to start throwing water balloons at the count of three, but the other team cheated and threw one early. However, they didn't realize that we had a hose on our side. @PERSON4 chased @PERSON1 across the yard, caught up with her, and soaked her with a water gun. In retaliation, @PERSON1 threw a large water balloon at @PERSON4, which exploded right on her face, and we all burst into laughter.  @PERSON2 and I then started throwing water balloons at each other. When we ran out of balloons, we switched to water guns, which also eventually ran out. @PERSON2 was out of resources, so I grabbed the hose, turned it to full power, and hosed him down after he slipped and fell. My team won the first @CAPS5.  It was time for the second @CAPS5. We filled up more water balloons, refilled our water guns, and took our positions. After counting ""One! Two! Three!"", the second round began. @LOCATION3 chased @PERSON3 around the suburban at least five times before catching up with her on the slippery grass. They both slipped and fell, and we pelted them with water balloons, making it difficult for them to get up. @PERSON3 managed to get up and joined her team, and they soaked us. We lost the second @CAPS5.  Now it was the final @CAPS5, the one that would decide the winner. We filled up double the water balloons and water guns, and we decided not to use the hose as we thought it was unfair. Both teams lined up on different sides of my front yard. My team was on the right, and the other team was on the left. We were supposed to throw at whoever was in front of us. I threw the first water balloon at @LOCATION1, followed by @LOCATION3 throwing at @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 at @LOCATION2. The rule was that whoever moved out of line lost. @PERSON1 was the first to lose when @PERSON3 threw a large water balloon that knocked her out of line. We moved closer. @LOCATION3 then water - gunned @CAPS6 down, and we took another step forward. @PERSON4 and I exchanged attacks, but when she ran out of water balloons and her water gun was empty, I defeated her. We took another step forward. Finally, @LOCATION3 and I easily soaked @PERSON3, and my team won! We cheered, went inside to dry off, and had some ice cream to celebrate our victory. That day, we proved that with good friends, a bit of imagination, and lots of laughter, anyone can have a wonderful time. I firmly believe that everyone should laugh regularly, as there's no place for sadness or anger in life."
408	21220	8	2	It all began on the day he arrived at the airport. I missed him so much. He hardly ever returned my phone calls, not like a @CAPS2 brother should. However, it was always a blessing to see him, especially during the holidays. It was amazing that he managed to find time during @DATE1 to come and visit us. It was fortunate because I no longer had to listen to his constant complaints about the cold and wet weather.  I was eager to go out and be with a really beautiful girl who lived around the corner from my house. But since my time with him was limited, I had to prioritize my @CAPS2 brother. Still, whenever I got the chance, I'd sneak away to see her. She was so beautiful and funny; she seemed perfect to me, like a dream. I often told my brother about her, but he always said that even if she was real, it was impossible for a girl to be that ideal.  On the first day he spent the night, everyone in the house was overjoyed. From the moment we picked him up at the airport to the drive home, we talked and made jokes about how much he'd changed and how tight his clothes were. We even stopped at Burger - Vile to get some burgers because he was always hungry and ate non - stop.  When we arrived home, the expressions on my little brother and sister's faces were priceless. Their mouths dropped open as if they'd just seen a miracle. As they ran towards him, he wasn't quite prepared. While still putting his bags down by the door, he was tackled by a @NUM1 - year - old girl and a @NUM2 - year - old boy. It was hilarious to see them so happy and excited. It was a surprise for them; we'd only told them we were going to get gas.  After that, we sat down and talked all night while watching movies we'd rented earlier as a family. But, as usual in our family, things didn't go as planned. When you're having fun and laughing, you don't want the moment to end, and you forget about everything as time passes.  However, as the day wore on and our energy levels dropped from being excited all day to see my @CAPS2 brother, share stories, tell jokes, and laugh, we got sleepy and needed rest. I had pleasant dreams that night, often a mix of food and the girl I liked.  The next morning, we had a great time, cracking jokes non - stop. I took my @CAPS2 brother to some of my parties, which worried my parents. Before we left, my mom told me to look after my brother, and I initially thought it was strange since I felt he should be looking out for me. But that's what made it funny.  Eventually, it was time for him to leave. I said goodbye to him at the airport, hoping that I'd see him again soon.
409	21221	8	2	Did you know that laughing can add years to your life? Laughter is truly a wonderful thing. Without it, the world would be dull and meaningless. You should laugh every day; it can help you get through tough times.  One day, @PERSON3, @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and I were hanging out at @ORGANIZATION4's house. @PERSON4 was being extremely funny, and we were all laughing uncontrollably at what he was saying. Suddenly, @PERSON2 called and invited us to @LOCATION1, but she said only @NUM1 of us could go. We debated who would go and decided that @PERSON4 would stay back. @PERSON1 gave him something to keep him occupied.  @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and I took the bus to @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. There was a strange person on the bus who made us laugh so hard, even though he wasn't trying to be funny. When we arrived at @ORGANIZATION1, we were all hungry, so we decided to get some food from @ORGANIZATION2. We each got a dollar burger, which we thought were overpriced. So, we saved the pickles from the burgers and stuck them on the windows when we left. We laughed so hard that we could barely run away.  When we reached @ORGANIZATION3's apartment, we knocked on the door, but no one answered. We knocked again, still with no response. Just as we were about to call her, she walked out of a different apartment, and we all burst into laughter because we'd been pounding on the wrong door.  Once inside, there was a party going on, and we were really happy. We had a few beers and had an amazing time, just laughing and enjoying ourselves.  The next morning, we woke up at @NUM2 a.m. because we had to catch the bus back to @LOCATION2 early. It was @DATE1, and the buses only ran for a short time. The bus driver made some strange faces, like he was in pain, and it made me laugh really hard.  When we got back to @LOCATION2, we called @PERSON4 to see what he was doing. He was just hanging out in town, so we went and joined him. Overall, it was a great weekend filled with laughter.
410	21222	8	2	Some people say that laughter is the best medicine, and I wholeheartedly agree. Laughter is beneficial for individuals, and it's especially important in relationships.
411	21223	8	2	"Have you ever had an experience where you laughed so hard that tears welled up in your eyes? And were you alone at that time? Usually, when you find something amusing, you're in the company of someone else. I firmly believe that laughter serves as a powerful bond between two individuals. It's a shared moment that you and the other person can recall vividly in the future, even if they're miles away.  I can clearly remember an incident as if it happened just a couple of weeks ago. I had just finished a conversation with @CAPS3's mom. Then I went into @CAPS3's room and unplugged @CAPS3's small black phone from the charger. When I turned it on, a blinking light indicated ""@NUM1 missed calls from @PERSON1."" I immediately called her back to apologize for missing her call. I heard someone pick up, but there was no response on the other end. "" @CAPS1, @PERSON1, are you there?"" I asked, hoping for an answer.  What I got was not what I expected. She started sobbing uncontrollably. Struggling to catch her breath, she barely managed to say, ""@CAPS2, @CAPS3's grandpa just passed away."" @CAPS3's heart sank, and @CAPS3's eyes welled up with tears. @CAPS3's throat tightened, making it difficult to breathe. @CAPS3's voice was shaky and hoarse as I said, ""I'm sorry, @PERSON1,"" and I too began to cry. Our shared grief didn't seem to improve the situation anytime soon.  She then explained that he had suffered a heart - attack and asked me how such a thing could happen to someone who didn't deserve it. I had no answer because I had never been in her position. Who was I to know what to say or do to comfort her? So, I thought deeply about what words could bring her some solace. My head started to ache, but finally, I found something sincere to tell her, something I would want to hear if my own grandpa passed away.  In a calm, gentle voice, I said, ""I don't have much experience in this, so I can't offer much advice. But right now, your family needs you as much as you need them. Think about the wonderful times you had with your grandpa @CAPS4, the laughter you shared together."" I heard a faint giggle beneath her sniffles. She started telling me a story about how her family took an annual weekend beach trip, a time for bonding that she would miss. When she shared that story, @CAPS3's heart warmed, and the corners of @CAPS3's mouth turned up slightly.  I was proud of myself for staying strong for my friend. Even though @PERSON1 will never see her grandpa @CAPS4 again, she will always carry his memories in her heart, and through laughter, he will always be with her."
412	21224	8	2	"Laughter is truly one of the most remarkable abilities of the human body. Just like the sound of crying, the sound of laughter is distinctively unique. There are numerous factors that can trigger laughter, and once it starts, it can be hard to stop. Laughter is typically sparked by something humorous, and it's often the cause that makes the act of laughing so enjoyable. Moreover, whether you start laughing or not usually depends on the people you're with, your location, and the specific situation you're in.  I remember one such instance when I was in @LOCATION2, baking a pie with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was a pleasant, warm evening. We had gathered all the necessary ingredients for the pie, but then my @CAPS1 pointed out that there was no sugar left. She told me to go to the cabinet and grab a jar of sugar. When I opened the cabinet, I saw two jars. Since they had no labels, I asked her which one was the sugar. ""I think it's the jar on the left,"" she replied. Without further ado, I grabbed the jar on the left.  Later, when everyone was sitting around chatting, my @CAPS1 and I went to get the pie to serve to the family. As we took the pie out and started slicing it, everyone looked at it in awe. After everyone was served, they took a bite. In an instant, they all started spitting it out as if it were the most unpalatable thing they had ever tasted. Suddenly, my @LOCATION1 commented that the pie was too salty - not the kind of feedback I was anticipating.  My @CAPS1 @CAPS2 then went to check the jar I had grabbed. She dipped her finger into the jar and tasted it. To our dismay, it was the salt jar. And out of nowhere, everyone started laughing uncontrollably, to the point of tears, at the absurdity of what had just happened. It was the most fun I'd had that evening, and no one could stop laughing.  This pie - related incident is definitely something I'll never forget, and it's highly unlikely to happen again. It turned out to be a classic example of a situation that can induce laughter. This shows that there are three main causes of laughter: being with the right people (in this case, my @CAPS1), being in a place where funny things can occur (my @LOCATION1's house), and experiencing an unexpected and hilarious event (the mix - up between salt and sugar).  Laughter is an amazing gift of the human body. It's one of those things in life that can never be destroyed. If someone claims they've never laughed, they're either lying or being a hypocrite. Laughing is beneficial for both your physical and mental health. It fills your lungs with extra oxygen, making it easier to breathe, and it's simply a lot of fun. So, if you realize you haven't had a good laugh in a while, take a moment to find something that will make you laugh."
413	21225	8	2	"Laughter is an extraordinary human expression. It is a visible manifestation of happiness and an inward feeling of joy. Laughter has a profound impact on our daily lives, often brightening our emotions in positive, cheerful ways. Scientifically, it has been proven that laughter is more contagious than a cough, sniffle, or sneeze. When shared, it binds people together, enhancing intimacy and happiness.  Around @TIME1, which is when my third - period class usually starts, I was supposed to be in my @CAPS1 class. However, due to my luck, I found myself in the computer lab, about to retake the state writing test. I wasn't thrilled about it, but I was confident that I could pass this time without making any excuses. My self - confidence was at an all - time high, and I was ready to face the test again.  As soon as I entered the computer lab, I quickly sat down. I took a deep breath and began to log into the computer. While waiting for the login process to complete, I sat there looking around the room and visualizing what I would write about for the test. Once the teacher approved my login, I entered all my personal information and was ready to start.  On the screen, several topics were listed. I chose the one that I felt most comfortable with and thought I could score well on. The topic was, ""We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, 'Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.' Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was an element or part.""  When I selected this topic, I was initially at a loss for what to write. I had so many childhood memories filled with laughter, and most of the stories I could recall were longer than @NUM1 words. As I sat there thinking, I was distracted by the annoying sounds of keyboards and mouse clicks in the room. It was evident that the other students understood their topics well, unlike me.  Minutes passed, and I still hadn't come up with a story. I was frustrated with myself because, after all, who doesn't have a story about laughter? Just as I was about to start writing, a younger student taking a state reading test suddenly shouted, ""@CAPS3!"" The way he said it, along with the expression on his face, was so hilarious that it nearly made me laugh out loud. It was one of those ""had to be there"" moments.  This incident gave me the inspiration I needed. I realized that this short, funny moment was a story I could share. It also made me realize that laughter truly has a significant impact on our lives, and such moments are meant to be shared. This experience not only made my day but also made the writing test less stressful. It clearly shows that laughter plays a crucial role in bringing people together and creating memorable experiences."
414	21227	8	2	"Laughter is an integral part of my life. When I laugh, I feel happy. So, whenever I'm sad or angry, a simple joke from someone can make me giggle and turn my mood around. I love making people laugh. Sometimes, when I try to tell jokes, I'm not very successful. But when I just be myself, people find me funny, and I guess I can be humorous without even trying.  I have amazing friends. Despite the occasional rough patches, I'm grateful to @CAPS1 for them every day. My friends and I are always looking for ways to have fun, and every activity we engage in turns out to be hilarious. Even the smallest things, like facial expressions, the way we pronounce words, or the way we eat, can make us burst into laughter. It's quite ridiculous, actually. When we try to tell others about our funny adventures, they just stare at us while we laugh uncontrollably. Maybe they don't find it funny because they weren't there.  This year, my family has an exchange student named @PERSON1 from @LOCATION2. She is shy and quiet, and I never thought she would be a source of laughter. Boy, was I wrong! She is incredibly funny. Sometimes, she is so oblivious that it's hard not to laugh at her.  I have a best friend named @PERSON2. We have so many wonderful memories together. She is amazing and funny. She's very short, and people often call her a midget. Her quick response, ""I am not a midget! I am @NUM1' @NUM2'', you have to be @NUM1' @NUM4'' to be a midget!"" is just adorable.  I recently moved back from living with my grandparents in @LOCATION1. While I was there, I learned over the phone that there was a foreign exchange student from @LOCATION2 living in my old bedroom. I flew back to @LOCATION3 with my family for @CAPS4. When I arrived, I met @PERSON1. She seemed quiet and sweet. It was late when we got home, so I went to sleep right away.  The next day, I woke up, called my grandma, and then invited @PERSON2 over. When she came, we met @PERSON1. @PERSON1 said she wanted to get my mom a birthday gift. I told her that my mom's birthday was the next day and suggested we go into town. The three of us went to @ORGANIZATION1 For @CAPS6. While looking for a gift, we ended up in the underwear aisle. @PERSON2 picked up a tiny pair of underwear and shouted, ""@CAPS7 @PERSON1, what about these?"" @PERSON1 looked at her with a funny expression and replied, ""@CAPS8, I don't think my thighs would fit through that!"" @PERSON2 and I fell to the floor, laughing so hard that our faces turned red.  Based on our first impression of @PERSON1 as a quiet person, this incident was extremely hilarious. We often tease @PERSON1 about it, and she teases us back about other funny things. I've grown to love @PERSON1, and I enjoy making fun of all the situations we encounter together."
415	21229	8	2	"As the warm days of @DATE1 transitioned into cold winter nights, the girls (@PERSON3, @PERSON5, @PERSON2, @CAPS1, and @PERSON4) and I were looking for ways to add some excitement to our lives. Little did we know the laughter that awaited us.  It was a crucial game in the @ORGANIZATION1 season, determining whether the team would make it to the playoffs for the @CAPS2. @CAPS1 is an avid @ORGANIZATION1 fan and was all dressed up in @CAPS3 attire. We watched the game, sipped on some apple juice, and indulged in @ORGANIZATION2 snacks.  As halftime approached, it was clear that the official halftime show wasn't going to be very exciting. I took out my camera from my @PERSON1 - look - alike bag and started recording. While I was trying to get everyone in the frame by walking in circles, @PERSON3 was having a great time on a red exercise ball, bouncing up and down about @NUM1 or three inches into the air. A brilliant idea popped into my head. I handed the camera to @PERSON4 and quietly moved towards @PERSON3. Just as @PERSON3 screamed, ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7!"", I kicked the exercise ball out from under her, and she landed flat on her back.  @PERSON3 was too busy laughing and catching her breath to scold me for my prank. I was on the floor, curled up in a ball, trying not to laugh so hard that I wet myself. Suddenly, I heard a loud bang. I looked up and saw the camera on the floor next to @PERSON4, @PERSON5, and @PERSON2, who were all laughing along.  @PERSON3 finally managed to get up. She came over and playfully smacked me on the head, saying, ""@"
416	21230	8	2	I've had the same two best friends for about three years. Laughter has been a significant part of our friendship, though we're not sure if it's just our own sense of humor or if others find us funny. My two best friends are @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2. I've known them since we were little, and we became friends around second grade, though we weren't really close until sixth grade. Now, I'm closer to @LOCATION2 than @LOCATION1. I remember when @LOCATION2 and I would throw eraser pieces across the room, nearly hitting our teacher. My first memory of @PERSON2 was in third grade when we goofed off in @LOCATION3. Since high school started, the three of us haven't hung out much, especially since we go to different schools. But when we do hang out, we always have a great time laughing. A few years ago, for my birthday, we went to @PERSON1 skate park. @PERSON2's grandma was taking us there. On the way, we asked to stop at @ORGANIZATION1. I brought a new @CAPS4 camera. At the @ORGANIZATION1 on @NUM1 street, while @PERSON2's grandma was ordering at the drive - thru, @PERSON2 rolled down his window and ordered a @ORGANIZATION2 and a large fry. His grandma got mad and told the person on the mic not to listen to him, but @PERSON2 kept going. When we pulled up to get the food, @PERSON2 got it through the window. I'm glad I recorded the whole thing. When we got to the park around three or four in the afternoon, we initially just looked around and didn't skate right away. Once we started, we skated for about four or five hours until it was dark. There are four stair sets there, ordered by size and difficulty to @PERSON3. We recorded many videos, some of us skating, some random and funny, and others we couldn't even understand. Later, when we were tired and bored, @PERSON2's grandma picked us up. We went to my house, watched @CAPS5, played video games, and listened to music. Around @NUM2 p.m., @PERSON2 went home, and @LOCATION2 stayed the @TIME1. While in my living room, @LOCATION2 was messing with the tripod for my camera. He unscrewed it, and it fell apart. We laughed at first, but I got mad as I'd just gotten it. It was a really fun day filled with laughter, dedication to skating, and strengthened our friendship. I felt closer to @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 that day.
417	21233	8	2	"When you're little, you're just that - little. You look up at everyone without a clue of what to do. Usually, this is when your parents step in. They feed you, love you, take care of you, and most importantly, teach you what you need to know. Growing up, I've learned that helping others, not just yourself, is important. One easy way for me to help others is through laughter. Laughter doesn't just affect those around you; it also affects you. If you ask anyone, they'll likely be able to recall a time when someone made a difference by making them laugh. I know for a fact that someone has made a difference in my life by making me giggle. I remember a day when I felt alone and forgotten, used and betrayed. My friends were like a second family, but like most kids, we fought. However, things always went back to normal by the end of the day. People often say, ""I never realized how easy I had it when I was little. I thought I had it bad then."" But it doesn't matter how the problems change; it still hurts to fight with friends, and there are days when you feel horribly alone without knowing why. That day was one of those days. I was in third grade, and my best friend was @PERSON1. I don't remember what we fought about, but I remember how it felt. I walked into the classroom near tears. @PERSON1 had been cruel before, but what she said that day really hurt me. I was always the first in the classroom. I sat in my seat and was lost in my own world of sorrow. Then my teacher asked me what was wrong. As a child, I hated it when people I didn't know well asked if I was okay as it embarrassed me. But this time was different and helpful. I told my teacher what had happened through my tears. After that, she tried to comfort me and made me laugh. Her response not only made me feel better but also made me realize that it wasn't such a big deal. I giggled for a while, and by the time everyone was in the class, I was happy. At the end of the day, @PERSON1 and I were best friends again. My teacher did me a favor. As a kid, you're vulnerable and don't see the world as harsh. I believe that small effort changed me. That one little joke made me realize that things will get better in the long run. Since then, laughter has been important to me. It helped me understand the impact you can have on others, even at a young age. I've learned from my teacher that sometimes, just trying to make someone laugh, smile, or be happy can make a difference. Laughter truly changes people, regardless of age."
418	21235	8	2	"One day, my sister invited me to her Christian school, @PERSON1. It started as a nice sunny day but turned less sunny. On the first day of my visit, I went to all her classes with her. The teachers and her friends seemed a bit strange. After the second period, in the @CAPS2.E class, the teacher told us to put on running shoes as we were going to run up a mountain. My sister had forgotten her running shoes, so the teacher sent us to get them. By the time we got back, the class was already a quarter - mile away from the school. We decided to take a shortcut, the off - road ""scenic route"". We ran down a very steep hill. My sister got halfway down and slid on her butt all the way. Then I ran down the hill as fast as I ever had. I hit the pavement at the bottom like a tumble - weed in a hurricane. My sister helped me up, and when we reached the class, they were shocked at how we looked. My sister looked like she'd played in the mud, and I looked like I'd been hit by a truck with my face covered in dirt. After that, we decided to get cleaned up and went to the showers. The showers at @PERSON1 are similar to those in @CAPS4.H.S but with shower curtains. In the shower I used, the curtain came off the metal hook. I used a plastic stepping stool on the wet floor, and it slipped. My pinky got caught on the hook, and I sliced open a main vein. I got light - headed and passed out. My sister and her friends took me to her room and put a band - aid on my finger while I was still unconscious. When I woke up, I was between a blanket and an uncomfortable bed. My sister told me not to scare her like that again. I told her I thought it was funny when we ran down the hill. I only had some scrapes, and my pinky incident made me pass out. It was quite an eventful day at my sister's school."
419	21236	8	2	Every @DATE1, my family, friends, and I pack up and head to @ORGANIZATION1. We take our @CAPS3 runner and boat and rent a large cabin by the water. We stay for about a week, and since it's around one hundred degrees, we spend most of the day swimming. @ORGANIZATION1 is about an hour from @CAPS1 over the pass, and there are many fun activities like @CAPS2, kayaking, aqua cycling, bike riding, and boating. This year was special as my brother got his boating permit. It's much more exciting when he takes us tubing compared to my parents, who go very slowly. He would put one of us on the @CAPS3 runner to @CAPS3 the flag when someone fell off the tube. One afternoon, when the water was rough and choppy, my brother took me and my friend @PERSON1 out. First, @PERSON1 was on the tube, and I was on the @CAPS3 runner with my brother. He drove us around in circles at about @NUM1 mph, and @PERSON1 flew off right away. After @PERSON1 got on the @CAPS3 runner, I hopped on the tube. We used hand signals: thumbs up to go faster, thumbs down to slow down, and waving our arms around to stop. I had my thumb up, waiting for my brother to speed up. He started going really fast, and I was flying around in circles. Every time I hit a @CAPS3, I got whip - flash. I put my thumb down to slow down, but he kept going faster. I waved my arms to stop, but @PERSON1 told my brother I wanted to go faster. Finally, I did two back flips into the water. Hitting the water was so fast that it felt like my skin would fall off; it was extremely painful. It took me about a minute to reach the surface and take a big gasp of air. I sat in the water waiting for my brother to pick me up. Then I realized I'd lost my bikini bottoms. I panicked and told my brother not to come over. I searched for them in the water but couldn't find them. My brother called my dad, and my parents brought me a pair of shorts. I had a great time at @ORGANIZATION1, and this is a story I'll tell for the rest of my life. I can't wait to go back next year, and I'll definitely bring super - tight shorts for tubing.
420	21237	8	2	"Have you ever thought about what you're thinking, who you're with, and what you're doing when you laugh? When you're three, you might laugh at someone saying, ""@CAPS1 - a - boo"" and making funny faces. At thirteen, you might laugh at someone who doesn't dress ""in"". At twenty - three, you laugh with drunk friends doing stupid things at a party. And at thirty - three, you might laugh watching your husband wrestle with your five - year - old. About three years ago, my brother and I finally established a good relationship. The @PERSON1 family situation has always been complicated. When we tell people how we're related, they're often confused and ask us to start over, so we avoid the topic. My brother @PERSON2 has lived in @LOCATION2 his whole life with his mother and step - @CAPS3. So, neither our dad nor I had a close relationship with him. We only saw him about twice a year. During those visits, @PERSON2 and my sister @PERSON3 would pick on me, hide from me, and laugh at me because I couldn't do what they could. I used to dread his visits as I'd end up crying and getting in trouble for things I didn't do. As we grew up, we realized we got along better when we were on the same side against our common ""enemy"", our dad. Our relationship has always revolved around laughter. We make jokes about each other every day, knowing it's just in good fun. Sometimes we laugh at others, and sometimes at ourselves. Now that my brother is in college, we miss each other, and laughter is the key to our relationship. When my brother started to like me, he taught me everything about video games. One summer @DATE1, when my dad was at work and @PERSON2 didn't have a car in @LOCATION1, we were bored at home. We decided to play all the video games at least once that day. But we only played @CAPS4 @NUM1. We first spent an hour figuring out how the game worked and arguing about it. Then we played to see who's team won. We made jokes about each other's players and gave them mean and weird names. We laughed throughout the game. To make it more interesting, we created our own characters and had a fantasy draft. @PERSON2, being a guy, came up with gross names and made the players look scary or funny, stacking their stats to an overall team average of @PERCENT1. I, being a girl, made my guys hot and muscular with funny names and stacked their stats more reasonably, with a team average of @PERCENT2. From the start of the game to the end, we laughed non - stop. Every time the announcer said one of our players' names, it was so absurd and funny. When both teams made every shot and then someone missed, we made countless comments and jokes. By the time my dad got home, he thought something was wrong as we were crying from laughing so hard that our tan carpet turned brown. Even at dinner, @PERSON2 would say something only I'd understand, and we'd burst out laughing, leaving my dad looking dumbfounded. Looking back, I wouldn't trade that day for anything. Now, @PERSON2 and I sometimes bring up that day when playing sports games or talking on the phone. Our relationship might not be normal, but that's how we show our love for each other. I don't even like video games usually, but I play with him because of our bond. Since then, we've become closer, stopped fighting, and stand up for each other. Truly, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."
421	21238	8	2	I firmly believe that laughter holds a crucial place in life, and it often offers solace to those in distress. One instance involved my cousin, who was having a particularly rough day. She was overwhelmed with stress and distress, unsure of how to cope. When she came over, visibly emotional, I reassured her that it was okay to cry. After she calmed down, I shared some perspectives on life. I mentioned the common saying that life is like a box of chocolates, where you should take things one at a time as some moments may be sweet while others less so. However, I also proposed that life is more akin to a jar of jalapeños; the actions we take now might have consequences later. This made her burst into laughter, and at that moment, I knew she would be alright. She just needed some time to regain her composure. Subsequently, she had a great day. We spent the evening watching movies and listening to music. This experience solidifies my belief in the power of laughter, and it's an added bonus that it helps burn calories too!
422	21240	8	2	"Laughter is a vital aspect of life. During the last two weeks of school, I received the most exciting news from my mom: I would be flying to @LOCATION1 by myself. I was thrilled as I hadn't seen my family in a long time. Despite having been on a plane a few times before, I was still terrified as I had never flown alone. This was going to be a completely novel experience. Amidst my excitement and fear, I constantly thought about seeing my family members and meeting those I had never encountered or heard of. School seemed to drag on, and I was extremely impatient. When the two weeks finally passed, I had my bags packed and was raring to go. My mom tried hard not to cry but couldn't help it. I went through the metal detectors, walked down a long hallway, and finally boarded the plane. Throughout the flight, I could only think about meeting my real dad. I landed in @LOCATION1 at @NUM1 pm that day, relieved as I was exhausted. My sister picked me up from the airport. Our relationship was not close, so it was a bit awkward. She started reminiscing about our childhood and the fun we had. Since I was in @LOCATION1, I was eager to see many of my family members. Word spread quickly, and most of them already knew I was in town. When my aunts saw me, they were shocked at how much I had grown. It was one of the happiest moments of my life. I met numerous people, including family friends and some of my mom's school friends. A few days later, I received a text from a sister I had never met. She was overjoyed to learn I was in town and said she and my dad wanted to spend time with me. We made plans, but I was extremely nervous as the last time I saw my dad was when I was very young, fifteen years ago. I had no idea what to do or say when I finally met them, so I decided to bring my sister and cousin to avoid awkwardness. We met at my grandma's house, but she wasn't there. When my dad arrived, I hardly recognized him or my other sister. We hugged each other. Once inside, we were all quiet, and all my dad could say was ""@CAPS2"" because of how much I had grown. He then started sharing funny stories about my childhood, which made us all laugh. It was a heart - warming moment, and I even shed a few tears. If it weren't for laughter, my relationship with my dad wouldn't have improved as it did."
423	21241	8	2	"One time, my friends Chad, Justin, and I decided to ding - dong ditch an old man. The reason was that we walked past his house every day, and he would turn on his sprinkler and an annoying alarm. Around nine or ten at night, we went to his house, banged on the door, and ran. It was really funny. After running, we went to our friend Taylor's house and sat in the garage, feeling proud of what we had done. About ten seconds later, we heard banging on the garage door. We got startled and ran into Taylor's room. Then, the funniest thing happened. The old man started screaming and banging on the door. He shouted, ""Come out boys! What are you afraid of?!"" We couldn't help but burst into laughter. He clearly knew we were in there, so he went to the front door and started banging on it, which woke up Taylor's mom. Eventually, we went out to talk to him. He said he had called the cops because he claimed this kind of thing happened all the time. We denied it was us, but of course, it was, and we couldn't stop laughing at his face. He looked really strange, like a combination of a turtle and an eighty - year - old person with a bad reputation. He had liver spots on his face and a terrible grey combover that didn't fool anyone. By the time the cops arrived, the old man was gone. We told the cop that the old man was senile and didn't know what he was talking about. So, we got away without any trouble. It was a really funny and awesome experience."
424	21244	8	2	"What precisely is laughter? Is it the reaction when something positive occurs, bringing joy to a person? According to @PERSON1's @CAPS1, laughter is a source of merriment, representing a light - hearted and fun spirit. Laughter is not only significant in relationships but also plays a major role in life as a whole. For example, a good friend of mine and I stopped speaking to each other due to a silly argument about an animal becoming extinct. It had been nearly two years since our last conversation. I thought our friendship was over until one day when we ran into each other at the store. We just looked at each other and started laughing. At that moment, we realized that the argument was pointless and not worth dwelling on. Without laughter, my friend and I would never have reconciled. When meeting new people, one of the first things we do to make them like us is to tell jokes or say something funny to elicit a laugh. This shows how laughter is intertwined with life, which consists of physical and mental experiences. In every friendship, laughter is the most common element shared among friends. There is no way around it. Another example of the importance of laughter in life is during a job - hunting or job - interview process. If the interviewer has no personality, we might either show our serious side or crack a few jokes. Even if it doesn't work, the interviewer will at least get an idea of our personality. Coping with life can be extremely stressful, both physically and mentally. A friend of mine graduated from college and was struggling to find a job in her field of study. She was also dealing with the illness of her grandma, who was in the hospital and on the verge of passing away. She was a complete mess, with no income and unable to find an apartment. One day, she received a call from her sister saying that their grandma couldn't hold on any longer. She rushed to the hospital to see her grandma for the last time. Her grandma took her hand and said, ""I know life can be tough, but you have to get through it and enjoy it. Life is too short to worry about tomorrow. Just smile and laugh when things go wrong."" At that moment, my friend realized that what her grandma said was true. Although she was devastated by her grandma's passing, she also felt that it was a lesson. Without this experience, she wouldn't have understood that she wasn't alone in facing difficult times. Learning to accept life as it comes is a difficult step. Some people learn from their own experiences, like my friend who learned through her job - hunting struggles and family issues. Others learn from meeting new people and having fun. In conclusion, laughter comes in various forms, and we, as humans, must embrace it. It is a positive force that makes us happy, relieves stress, and is essential in both relationships and life."
425	21245	8	2	"It appears that in everyone's life, they are constantly being tested in every possible way, and it seems like this cycle will never end. This can be extremely stressful and complex, but it is precisely what makes us human. Another characteristic that defines our humanity is laughter. No matter how dire the situation becomes, it can always be transformed by a simple knock - knock joke, a comic advertisement, or a single word from a best friend. I once accompanied my dad and a few of his high - school friends as they shared stories about the crazy things they did in high school. My dad and his friend @CAPS1 recounted the time they bought a @NUM1 @LOCATION1 tempest for @MONEY1. This turned out to be one of the most valuable life lessons and funniest stories in my life. This was my dad's second car, equipped with a @NUM2 and a @NUM3 speed, which made anything seem possible. It all started when my dad first drove it to school, but that didn't last long. An hour later, @CAPS1 and my dad left the school parking lot, doing a burnout on the speed bumps. This car was a burnout beast; it would back up, then the clutch would be engaged to shift to second gear, and the tires would smoke. One day, while my dad was sliding around gravel corners, one of the rear bias - ply tires blew out, causing the car to veer into a ditch and damage the side severely. Joe Enders pulled the car out, and after using half a gallon of dera glass, a hammer, and a can of paint, the car was ready to go again. Another time, my dad's friend borrowed the car to commute to work. My dad handed him the keys, saying, ""Keep it on @NUM3 wheels."" Two weeks later, on a weekend, the friend was out having fun, and the car slid off the road, rolled a few times, and buckled the roof. I never found out how he managed to get out, but he somehow did and returned the car to my dad. After that, the car had a ""roof transplant"" from a @CAPS2 that hit a tree. @NUM5 weeks later, it was back on the road. There's something about a rear - wheel - drive car and snow that makes us feel like kids again. Sliding around in the snow was the last adventure of this car. My dad and @CAPS1 were driving in the snow, having a great time, when the back end of the car swapped places with the front. They lost control and slid across the snowy landscape until they hit a lonely telephone pole. The car crashed into the pole, ending the fun. Finally, the car died, and my dad brought it back home. He decided not to fix it and instead parted it out. He sold the @NUM3 speed for @NUM7 @MONEY1, the engine for @NUM8, the rear end for @NUM9, and the trunk and hood for another @NUM9. He kept the seat, steering column, and radio, and the rest was sold as scrap. All in all, my dad had some of the greatest moments of his life with this car, spending no more than gas money and a few spare parts. God bless @LOCATION2, and I hope that someday I can create memories like that."
426	21246	8	2	I met my best friend, @PERSON1, in third grade. Best friends are those who enter your life and stay with you through thick and thin. We learn from and share experiences with our best friends. Distance doesn't matter; their friendship endures, whether you're thousands of miles apart or just a few houses away. The shared laughter between best friends is what bonds them for life. When two friends truly laugh together, a part of their lives becomes intertwined forever.  @PERSON1 and I have grown up side - by - side. We've been there for each other from learning to jump rope at school to dealing with broken bones, school - girl drama, crushes, boyfriends, heartbreaks, weddings, and funerals. We've helped each other through hard classes and the loss of family pets. We offered advice and brought hot chocolate, but this is just the start of our friendship. After solving problems, we learned to laugh at our mistakes and move on. Whether it's a slip - up in our words or a literal slip on the floor, we giggle, help each other up, and keep going.  @PERSON1 and I know that no matter what happens, we'll always have each other's backs. @PERSON1 can turn any situation into a joke. Just seeing her face or hearing her voice can make me smile. Most of the best moments in my life involve @PERSON1 in some way. We have memories of lying in the driveway watching the stars at night and cracking up while working backstage for the local drama club.  @PERSON1 can always make me laugh with her perfect imitations, no matter how bad my mood is. I often crack @PERSON1 up, usually unintentionally, by doing or saying something silly. We laugh at lines from our favorite movies and record the funniest moments. We laugh at everything, from driving around town listening to music to being followed by kiosk workers at the mall.  One of the funniest times was when we worked backstage at a local theater club production. We laughed about building sets and on - stage mistakes. We had to open and close curtains in the dark while wearing all black. I stubbed all my toes rolling the sets on and off stage, and my hair was visible even under a black ski hat. @PERSON1 always had trouble opening a curtain that got stuck halfway. We laughed at each other's mistakes and had a great time watching the audience, director, and actors. Every time an actor made a mistake, we'd watch the audience laugh and the director's horrified face. Now, just mentioning a word or line from that play makes us laugh and recall the whole weekend.  When we're together, a quick look or a whispered word can make us burst into laughter. We can make each other laugh without explanation because we've shared so many experiences that we can almost read each other's minds. A key expression or a twinkle in our eyes is enough to set us off. These are the best unspoken codes, understood only by us. The silent messages through our eyes can bring up unspoken subjects and make us laugh. This is why true best friends are bonded by laughter; it keeps them close through everything, and for every sad moment, there are two of laughter and happiness.
427	21247	8	2	It was the first day of ninth grade, a terrifying day as one has to decide how to be perceived for the next four years. I walked into my first class looking like an over - the - top hippie, over six feet tall and nearly two hundred and sixty pounds, a long - haired, freckled teenager. Being so big made it hard for bullies to treat me like a typical freshman.  I sat down next to a girl who seemed to think highly of herself. Despite this off - putting first impression, I tried to befriend her, but my attempt was met with confusion and disgust. As I turned to face the front, the teacher, @PERSON1, announced our first assignment: to create a presentation to show the class who we are.  I was thrilled at the prospect. I've always been a showman, loving the limelight. I enjoy acting, singing, and entertaining in general, but my greatest talent is humor. I've found that humor can captivate any audience. So, I designed a presentation to engage my class and show them who I really am. I wrote a speech explaining my talents and interests, filled with clever phrases, punchlines, and puns. The laughter was so loud that other teachers came to see what was going on.  I took a bow and sat down, looking at the happy faces of my new friends. I knew then that laughter would be the key to building my high - school life. I could make people forget their troubles and brighten their days with just a few words. I wasn't a star athlete or a top student, but I made friends easily. There's no better feeling than having friends, and as long as I have humor, I'll never be alone.
428	21248	8	2	"I was dozing off in a hot, stuffy room, as relaxed as I could be. @CAPS1 was lying next to me, and we were both thinking about what to do. Nothing came to mind. We decided it was too hot to go outside, and there was nothing good on TV. We thought we'd just lie in bed all day, wasting away in the heat.  Then @CAPS1 came up with the idea of playing video games. We turned up the music and blasted the stereo. We put in some @CAPS2 Of @CAPS3 and started ""killing people"" in the game. We were really into it, having a great time.  After a while, @CAPS1 said she was getting tired and that it was getting really warm. So, I tried to fix the AC while she just lay in bed. Time seemed to drag on, and we had nothing else to do.  @CAPS1 then told me a cheesy joke, and it made me laugh. We sat on her bed, telling each other jokes to pass the time. But after a while, the jokes got old, and we were back to just sitting on the bed, about to fall asleep because there was nothing else to do. The music was off, the window was open, and all we could hear were the cars on the street.  Suddenly, @CAPS1 let out a loud and stinky fart. I started laughing right away. Then, for some reason, I farted too. She started laughing so hard that her face turned red. We started farting back and forth. Remember, we were in the sixth grade at the time.  But the funniest thing was yet to come. It was @CAPS1's turn to fart. She got ready and let one out, but this was no ordinary fart. She stopped laughing immediately, looked at me with a sad face, and said, ""@CAPS10 I think I just pooped my pants!"" I laughed so hard that I started to cry. You could smell it, too. She walked to the bathroom, shouting, ""@CAPS10 I just pooped my freaking pants!!"
429	21249	8	2	"There's a clear distinction between right and wrong. Most of us learn from this difference, while some don't. We all have a choice: either face up to what we've done wrong or lie about it and get into more trouble.  I remember a time when I didn't think before acting. I was nine years old. @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1, and I were playing at the park. We were joking around on the old, rusted blue swing set, having a good time. There wasn't much to do at the park, just shoot hoops, run around, use the germ - ridden monkey bars, go down the wet slide, or play tag if we had the energy.  @ORGANIZATION1 spotted two rusted, broken - down cars that looked like they'd been there for ages. He said, ""We should go over there and throw rocks at those cars."" I nodded with a big grin. But @PERSON1 said, ""We shouldn't. Those cars belong to someone. How would you feel if someone wrecked your cars?"" I thought he had a point. I'd be really angry if that happened to my car.  We all looked at each other, unsure of what to do. Sixteen minutes passed, and still, we hadn't decided. Then, with my foolish thinking, I said, ""Come on, those cars don't belong to anyone. They don't even look like they can move. They've probably been there since the dinosaurs."" @PERSON1 walked off, mumbling about us being idiot kids who would get into trouble.  @ORGANIZATION1 and I looked at each other in shock. We finally started walking towards the cars. On the way, @ORGANIZATION1 tripped over a piece of wood.  When we reached the cars, I picked up a rock. I hesitated, asking myself if this was okay. But with the pressure and a guilty conscience, I threw the rock. One after another, we threw rocks, pipes, car parts, logs, and even beat the cars with a huge metal pipe.  After we were exhausted, we took a break and looked at what we'd done. The cars looked like they'd been hit by a tornado. @ORGANIZATION1 and I started laughing uncontrollably, almost to the point of wetting ourselves. We thought no one had seen us.  About four days later, @PERSON1 and I were at the park, and there was no sign of @ORGANIZATION1. As we were about to go home, a tall, blond, old lady with big feet walked up to us and asked where we lived. Without thinking, I told her. She said it would be great and thanked me.  When we got around the block, we saw her car in front of my house. @PERSON1 and I looked at each other, and I knew what he was thinking: I was in trouble. It turned out the lady was the owner of the cars. I didn't know what to say or do. I felt so stupid. I got grounded and punished hard.  From this experience, @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1, and I learned some important lessons: don't touch things that aren't yours, respect other people's property, and think before you act to avoid getting into trouble."
430	21250	8	2	My best friend and I share a lot of hilarious memories. We often find ourselves laughing, whether it's at something completely stupid or genuinely funny. We laugh at people who look odd or say silly things, and also at our own funny actions.  One memory that stands out is the time at @CAPS1 bell. After school one day, my best friend @PERSON1 and I decided to cross the street from our school and have lunch at @CAPS1 bell. We ordered our food and sat down to wait. A few minutes later, our food was ready. I took a bite of my five - layer burrito and said something to @LOCATION1. The burrito was really hot and burned my mouth, so I had to wait for it to cool.  As we sat there, talking about school and our lives, a man walked in. He was around @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old and had his back to us. After ordering his food, he turned around. At the same time, I thought my burrito was cool enough and took a bite. To my surprise, the man was wearing a clown mask and had a little dog with a tiara on its head. I burst out laughing so hard that my burrito came out of my mouth and splattered all over me, @LOCATION1, my hair, clothes, and the table. I was embarrassed but couldn't stop laughing. The man looked so scary, and we laughed non - stop for what seemed like an hour.  Eating the burrito took forever because we kept laughing. I got thirsty and went to order a small drink and get some @CAPS10. On my way back to the table, I wasn't looking and bumped into a man in line. Luckily, I didn't spill my drink.  Back at the table, I was talking to @PERSON1 about how bad my day was, saying it couldn't get worse. Then I took a drink and started choking. I spit everything out, and the @CAPS10 went everywhere, even coming out of my nose. I went to the bathroom to clean up, caught my breath, and told @PERSON1 I was ready to go home.  Looking back, that day was embarrassing, but it's also a great, hilarious memory that I'll cherish for the rest of my life. My best friend and I have many such funny memories, and we're still creating more every day.
431	21251	8	2	Laughter is a powerful force that offers numerous benefits, including fostering happiness, joy, and connections with others. It releases adrenaline and helps alleviate tension. Sharing laughter is especially meaningful when people are feeling down, as it can brighten any day and bring enjoyment.  In my life, laughter has played a significant role. Whether it's with family, friends, romantic partners, or even strangers, laughter has always been important to me. I love seeing people who smile often, as it indicates they likely laugh a lot and are happy individuals. You can often tell by the dimples in their cheeks and the crow's feet at the corners of their eyes, which can result from frequent laughter, smiling, or squinting in the sun.  One of the most important aspects of laughter in my life is in relationships. When there is laughter in a relationship, it tends to make it more enduring. This is because it allows you to be yourself and shows the other person that you're comfortable and engaged in their life. For example, when my partner is in a bad mood, I do my best to make them laugh and cheer them up. And when I'm grumpy, my boyfriend tries to lift my spirits or comforts me to understand what's wrong. Without laughter, a relationship is likely to lack happiness and may not succeed.  Laughter also plays a crucial part in my friendships. I'm initially shy, but once I get to know people, I'm very outgoing. My friends often say I'm weird, but I enjoy both laughing and making others laugh. When I'm feeling down around my friends, they always manage to make me laugh, no matter how upset I am. They're like a live comedy show, constantly finding ways to be funny, even if it means being obnoxious or doing embarrassing things. We should be open to trying new things and not be afraid of looking silly, as that's how we can experience the joy of laughter.  The saying “laughter is the shortest distance between two people” holds true. If you're always snooty or crabby, you'll struggle to make friends or maintain relationships. And without these connections, who will bring laughter and happiness into your life? Laughter is a universal benefit, and in my life, it has provided countless experiences of joy, whether it's through relationships with boyfriends, friends, or family. It's an emotion that can brighten any day and bring smiles to everyone's faces. So, let's share the laughter.
432	21253	8	2	Laughter is an incredible way to forge closer connections between people. It forms a bond that makes you feel more at ease and secure. Imagine a life without laughter; it would be a rather sad and dreary existence. Everyone has a distinct laugh—some are loud, others quiet, and there are those that are just plain weird or funny. Our laughter is a defining characteristic of who we are.  There are numerous effects associated with laughing. A hearty laugh can be so powerful that it causes your eyes to tear up. Sometimes, it becomes difficult to catch your breath, and your stomach might start to ache. When something is truly hilarious, I often find it challenging to take in another breath because I can't stop laughing. That's a common effect that I experience when I'm in the throes of laughter.  We all know that laughter is a natural response to something we find funny. It can be triggered by a movie, a joke, or even a simple mistake. My family is a constant source of laughter for me. During our parties, we're always cracking jokes and having a great time. One of the funniest jokes my cousins told was about my aunt's baby being so white that it looked like it came out of La Lechera.  Another memorable incident that had me in stitches was when I went to my cousin's house. We were watching a movie, and I had to use the restroom. When I came out, she jumped out from around the corner and scared me. I let out a scream so loud that my other cousin yelled from upstairs to be quiet. I couldn't stop laughing. I was scared, but it was so funny because it was completely unexpected.  I consider laughter to be a precious gift. It has the power to brighten our days and create unforgettable moments. I've had times when I've laughed so hard that I've almost wet my pants. In my opinion, people with the best personalities are those who can make others laugh. Laughter truly is a wonderful thing that enriches our lives.
433	21255	8	2	When I hear a child laugh, it instantly makes me think of my little sister. Whether we're outside playing Peter Pan or inside playing with dolls, her face lights up with pure happiness. It's not just my sister's laugh that brings me joy; any child's laughter is a beautiful sound. When you hear the laughter of your child, niece, nephew, or grandchild, you can truly sense their happiness.  As we grow older, our laughter changes. I remember when my sisters and brothers were younger, they would laugh at the simplest things. But now, they laugh at sick and disgusting jokes and when someone gets teased. However, I'm different. I still laugh at silly things, like the moments on America's Funniest Home Videos. Children, on the other hand, laugh at the smallest things, like a funny face or when an animal does something comical.  To me, a smile is like a silent laugh. I once heard the saying “A smile is worth a thousand words,” and I believe it applies to laughter as well. Even though a smile is silent, it holds the potential for laughter. When I was younger, I endured abuse, and good things rarely happened. But when something positive did occur, I'd have a big smile on my face. And if someone did something funny, I'd try hard not to laugh, but it would only last a few seconds before I'd burst into uncontrollable laughter and even start to cry.  One of the most memorable moments of my life happened when I was playing dolls with my sister Linda. My dad walked in and accidentally stepped on one of the dolls. Linda started to cry because the doll's arm had broken off. But then, my dad started hopping on one foot and holding the other, and he ended up falling on his butt. I laughed so hard that afternoon. Later that day, he took us to the store to buy a new doll each.  I firmly believe that a child's laughter is the most beautiful thing on earth. It has the power to heal the soul. If you start your day badly, coming home to the sound of your child laughing can instantly turn your day around. I sometimes wish I could be a child again and relive those carefree moments. Despite the difficult start I had in life, I've grown into a smart and intelligent young lady. Every laugh is unique, and although our laughter may change as we age, it remains a vital part of our lives. Laughter brings so much joy, whether it's through our relationships with family, friends, or loved ones. Let's cherish and share the gift of laughter.
434	21256	8	2	A boy once said, “What do you weigh?” The other person replied, “What?” The boy then said, “I just wanted to say something to break the ice.” Laughter truly is the greatest asset in any relationship, be it with family, friends, or in a romantic context. It creates a strong bond and adds a playful element to the relationship.  On [DATE1], I was on my way to pick up a long - lost friend to attend a Warped Tour concert. Our relationship had been strained due to an issue that occurred a few months ago. I thought taking her to the concert she'd been looking forward to all year would be a good idea. When we finally picked her up, there was a palpable tension in the air, with a lot of unspoken words between us. But I was eager to break the ice.  Before heading to the concert, my parents decided to get the car washed. That's when I came up with some ideas to make her laugh. The car inched into the car - wash machine as slowly as a turtle. I left the window slightly cracked, expecting just a little water to seep in. We were chatting about the concert, and I feigned complete unawareness that the window was open. In reality, much more water than I anticipated came pouring in. She looked at me and burst into uncontrollable laughter, unable to even speak about what was happening. When I asked her what was going on, she pointed out that my window was open. I turned to see water rushing down, which startled me so much that I jumped up and quickly closed the window. We both laughed like there was no tomorrow.  From that moment on, it was a perfect ice - breaker. All the tension melted away, and we had an amazing rest of the day. The saying “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people” is absolutely true. When laughter fills the air, no one can be truly sad or angry. It can turn a first meeting into a warm greeting, bring couples closer together, and infuse friends and family with joy and happiness. Laughter is indeed the key to a happy life.
435	21257	8	2	Laughter is an essential part of life. It can stem from a simple joke or an extraordinary event, creating moments that are shared and remembered within the family for generations. Laughter helps us through tough times, brightens someone's day, and can start a chain reaction of joy among people. Sometimes, our laughter might be associated with embarrassing moments, but often, those who laugh at us have likely had similar experiences in the past.  I vividly remember my fifteenth birthday when my grandma took the whole family to a Chinese restaurant. It was quiet as the adults discussed what to order from the family meals. I was sitting next to my sister, looking at the menu to see what drinks they had. My sister, however, had other things on her mind. Out of nowhere, she blurted out, “They have no fricken chicken.” Everyone at the table, including the waitresses and the waitress's son, erupted in laughter. It was a much - needed boost on a not - so - great day. My sister was clearly embarrassed, but she laughed at herself and said, “I thought I said it in my head.” I told her, “No, you didn't,” and she just shrugged it off.  To this day, whenever we go to a Chinese restaurant, my mom says, “They got your fricken chicken.” My sister responds with, “Will that ever die?” We all tell her, “No, it'll be passed down to your children, and they'll hear about their mother's fricken chicken day.” It was such a memorable incident that it still makes everyone laugh, even though it embarrasses my sister. Our parents even joke that it could be her wedding toast, something like “As long as you give her, her fricken chicken, you'll last forever.” It wasn't the nicest comment, but it was still hilarious.  This incident will likely be a part of our family's lore for years to come and hopefully be passed down through generations. Even if my sister doesn't want it to be remembered, in time, she might find herself sharing the story and laughing about it. We still tease her about this and other things she says without realizing.  Laughter is truly a gift. It's important to remember that laughter is healthy, as the saying goes. Even on the worst days, a little laughter can make a big difference. Whether you're the one making others laugh or the recipient of the laughter, it can turn a bad day around. So, think of something that makes you laugh and share it with your loved ones. Don't let embarrassing moments hold you back. Just like when we were kids and laughter could soothe our tears, as adults, we still need laughter to lift our spirits and make life more enjoyable. Let's keep the tradition of laughter alive in our families and lives.
436	21258	8	2	Laughter is an essential element in any long - lasting relationship. Without it, a relationship would be extremely dull. I'd like to share my personal experience. I recently started dating my boyfriend, @CAPS1. We first met at school, then he transferred and moved away. A few months ago, he added me on Facebook, and we began chatting again. At that time, he had a girlfriend, but after reconnecting with me, he realized she wasn't the right one for him. Breaking up with her was tough for him, but he did it, and I'm proud of him as she treated him poorly.  In the beginning of our relationship, we were both shy and didn't talk much. However, as we spent more time together, our communication improved. We aim to be a couple that can openly discuss anything in person, just as we do in texts. Every time I see him, I get nervous, and my heart skips a beat. When we walk on the street, I can't help but smile. And when we lie on the couch watching movies, I burst into laughter when he tickles me. We constantly laugh at each other, whether it's due to a mistake or something else.  I believe that laughter and our good rapport are what keep our relationship strong. Every time he leaves, I eagerly anticipate our next meeting. Laughter is crucial for most relationships because without it, a relationship would be uninteresting, and partners wouldn't want to spend time together. In my opinion, every moment with your significant other should be fully cherished.
437	21259	8	2	Everyone has siblings they grow up with and love unconditionally. However, some of us don't get to know our siblings until later in life. I'm one of those people, with a slight difference. I had what I call a @PERSON1, who is actually my biological father. Until I was seven, I thought @PERSON2 was my “real dad”. One evening, I heard my mother downstairs yelling on the phone about child support and someone signing over their rights to my dad. I had no idea she was talking about me, and the person on the other end of the line was my biological father. When I heard “your son deserves better than this”, I ran upstairs to my room and cried because I was confused about this new figure claiming to be my father.  My mom came to my room and told me the truth. It turned out that my biological father had rights to my last name. Unless he signed them over to my dad, my mom would take him to court for the thousands of dollars in child support he owed. During this conversation, I learned that I had other siblings in the world.  Over the next eight years, I spent countless hours searching for my siblings through old phone numbers and email addresses. It wasn't until my freshman year that I met @PERSON3 at school. He quickly became my good friend, and we hung out regularly. One day, when he was at my house playing video games, he asked about my last name. I thought it was a strange question but answered him. Suddenly, he smiled and asked if my biological father was @CAPS1. I was shocked. He then explained that he was the half - brother of my sister @CAPS2, whom I had been looking for.  Almost immediately, he called my sister and told her he'd found me. It turned out that she'd been searching for me too. He asked if she wanted to meet me, and I heard her excited scream on the phone. I was overjoyed but also nervous about our first meeting.  When we finally met, her mom picked me up and took me to their house. On the way, I was so nervous that I thought I might vomit. When we arrived, I saw my sister sitting on the couch, looking as nervous as I was. We spent four nerve - wracking hours playing @NUM1 questions to get to know each other. By the end, we were more comfortable, and she accepted me as her older brother. We discovered that we had the same annoying laugh, which made us laugh even harder. Her mom had to tell us to be quiet as we might wake the baby. Before I left, she gave me a hug.  Since then, @CAPS2 and I have connected deeply through laughter. Every time we see each other, we giggle and smirk. I go to her house every other weekend. My sister is one of the most precious people in my life, and our laughter and joy for each other will never fade.
438	21261	8	2	My best friend @PERSON1 and I often find ourselves in fits of uncontrollable laughter. We can't seem to stop, with our eyes watering and our stomachs hurting so much that we can hardly move. Looking back, much of what we talked about didn't make sense, yet we laughed hysterically.  One day at the bus stop, @PERSON1 said something funny, and we laughed until the bus arrived. Then I said something equally amusing, and we laughed throughout the bus ride to school. This happened almost daily. On a particular day, we couldn't stop laughing even when we reached the classroom.  Our @CAPS2 grade teacher had many pets in the classroom, including a tree frog named @CAPS1. That week, @PERSON1 and I were in charge of taking care of it. When we went to feed the frog, @PERSON1 grabbed it and made it “dance” in its cage. We thought it was the funniest thing ever. Our eyes watered, and we choked on our words as we took our seats for class.  We laughed during the teacher's instructions and while doing our classwork. Eventually, the teacher came over and told us to be quiet, but that didn't stop us. We tried hard to calm down and focus on our work, but we just couldn't. On this day, many students in the class were chatty, but no one laughed as hard as @LOCATION1 and I did. We were so loud that I was sure the people in the class below could hear us.  Our teacher stood in front of the class and yelled for quiet, but it only made @PERSON1 and me laugh more. I thought I would pee my pants from laughing so hard. We aren't the type of girls who giggle quietly. We laugh loudly with our eyes watering and our stomach muscles aching for the rest of the day.  To get the class to be quiet, the teacher made us put down our pencils, push in our chairs, stand behind them, take deep breaths, and repeat this five times before sitting back down to do our math problems silently. @PERSON1 and I took the deep breaths quickly and briefly, thinking it was hilarious. The whole class laughed, and the teacher threatened to keep us in during recess if we didn't behave.  Eventually, the class settled down, but @PERSON1 and I kept laughing until the school bell rang. On the bus ride home, we talked about how much fun we had that day, especially when we took the fast, short breaths. Even now, as sophomores in high school, we still have moments of uncontrollable laughter for no apparent reason.  I think it's just part of being best friends. Sometimes, we laugh all day long, just like in @CAPS2 grade. Over the years, we've learned to be quieter when laughing in class or during important times. I'm certain that @PERSON1 and I will always be best friends, sharing many more laughing moments, whether in class, on the bus, while driving, at college, or on the phone. Everyone should experience a hearty, uncontrollable laugh in their lifetime, just like we did in @CAPS2 grade.
439	21262	8	2	One @DATE1 after school, my girlfriend and I decided to go to my house. We missed the bus, so we started walking down the ramp from the high school. Soon, we got hungry and went to the @ORGANIZATION1. We ordered a @CAPS1 and some drinks. My girlfriend, @PERSON1, shook up my soda and handed it to me. Not knowing what she'd done, I asked if she'd shaken it. She said, “Here's mine, let's trade.” I agreed and opened the one she'd really shaken. I said, “That was a bit devious!”  When I stood up to chase her and pour soda on her, I tripped on some goat heads. While I was in pain, @PERSON1 laughed and said, “How stupid, who falls over a stump!” I got up, pulled out the thorns, and we continued walking home.  When we were more than halfway to my house, @PERSON1 hit me in the shin and ran. I chased her for about a block and a half, almost to my yard, when I slid on mud and fell into a puddle of water. @PERSON1's over - the - top laughter made me almost lose my temper. I jumped up to put her face in the puddle, but she ran inside my house and locked the door. I knew she'd locked it because I ran so fast to bust in, but when I turned the knob, it wouldn't open. The impact made me fly back and land on fresh poop. I quickly took off my shirt and threw it away, then went inside to shower.  @PERSON1 asked why I was showering, and I lied to her because I knew if I told her the truth, she'd laugh and make fun of me. After showering, I asked @PERSON1 if she wanted to shoot some glass bottles in the back. She said she was up for it.  I set up six bottles. @PERSON1 shot four out of six, which was pretty good for a girl. When I went to replace the bottles she'd shot, she shot me in the butt. I was angry and wanted to cry but held back. I swore and aimed my gun at her to get revenge. She ran upstairs, grabbed my @NUM1, and threatened to throw it out the window if I came closer. I told her she wouldn't because of how much it cost. In a moment of bad luck, I shot her in the leg, and she actually threw the @NUM1 out the window. It was okay, though, as I could get another one.  That @DATE1 with @PERSON1 was great, even though she laughed at me most of the time. I don't care because making her happy is important to me. I endured a lot of pain and lost a shirt that day, but it will be a great memory when we look back on it.
440	21263	8	2	Someone said, “I could just laugh to death.” I scanned the area and called out, “@CAPS37?” A voice replied, “Here, son.” I looked up the stairs leading to @CAPS2 avenue and saw an old man, probably homeless from his appearance. He wore worn - out shoes, dirty blue jeans, a ripped shirt under a shabby jacket. The old man said, “You seem a little lost.” @PERSON1 responded, “I'm really lost.” Just then, @PERSON1's pocket vibrated. He took out his cell phone, flipped it open, and read a message from Tommey saying he was going to be there soon. @PERSON1 replied that he was on @CAPS2 ave.  @PERSON1 then started climbing the steps, saying, “See you later, old man,” as he rushed to meet his friends. He saw his friends standing outside the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 bakery. @PERSON2 shouted, “Guys, here's @PERSON1!” @PERSON2 ran towards @PERSON1. @PERSON1 picked her up, spun her around once, and then put her down.  The group walked over to the others. @CAPS9 @CAPS10 said, “It took you so long, dude.” @PERSON1 replied, “The shortcut I took was way too short.” @CAPS13 said, “Don't mind him; he's in a bad mood.” @CAPS9 @CAPS10 just responded with “Okay”.  @PERSON2 asked, “Guys, can we go into the @CAPS18 @CAPS19's toy store?” @CAPS13 @CAPS22 replied, “That's fine.” The group walked along @CAPS19 @CAPS2 avenue, turned right onto @ORGANIZATION1 street, and then right again onto @CAPS25 avenue. The toy store was located between other boutiques.  @PERSON2 excitedly spun around and said, “We're here.” @CAPS9 @CAPS10 said, “Let's go in.” @PERSON2 said, “Old gremlin!” @CAPS13 told her to be quiet, and @CAPS9 @CAPS10 grumbled.  Once inside the store, it was as if someone had turned up the lights. The store was filled from top to bottom with all kinds of toys, ranging from small to huge. @PERSON2 exclaimed, “Look, there's a @CAPS43 bunny!” She also said, “I'll smother you in your sleep, twerp.” @PERSON1 asked, “Is it eating you?” @CAPS9 @CAPS10 grumbled.  Suddenly, the bunny hit @CAPS9 @CAPS10's face. He took a lion off the shelf and threw it at @LOCATION2. @CAPS13 said, “Don't be mean to her!” and threw a monster at @CAPS9 @CAPS10. It missed and hit @PERSON1, who then flung it back at @CAPS9 @CAPS10. @CAPS9 @CAPS10 challenged @PERSON1. There was a lot of chaos with toys flying around.  The store owner yelled, “You kids are in big trouble! Put all these toys back where they were.” @CAPS13 said, “I think we got a little carried away.” The owner said, “A
441	21264	8	2	I often find myself in awkward situations with the people I love, but that's just life, isn't it? When one is a child, they tend to be overly dramatic about every little thing. Those who love us, such as our parents, are trying to teach us something or guide us in the right direction. Perhaps this was just my experience.  I moved out of my dad's house in a rather unpleasant way. I wanted to live life on my own terms, which only pushed away the people I needed the most. I realized this a bit too late. But again, that's life.  Around @DATE1, I finally re - established a connection with my dad. It was an extremely difficult thing to do, considering my step - mom hates me, and that's unlikely to change. So, it's something I'll have to deal with.  My dad and I still had a very awkward relationship until a few months ago when we went on a fishing trip together. Standing there, casting our lines, we were silent. We both consider ourselves quite humorous, but even our jokes couldn't break the ice. Eventually, we started talking. He began to tell me about when I was a kid, visiting my mom for the first time and then coming back to my grandma's and calling her a... well, I won't say the word. My dad rarely curses around me. It was quite funny to hear these stories and the way he told them. It made us both laugh happily. This really brought us back together.
442	21265	8	2	Have you ever laughed so hard that you couldn't breathe or started crying? Well, I do that all the time. Laughter is a huge part of my life.  I remember one night when my family and I went out for dinner. My grandpa wanted to go to a Chinese restaurant in @LOCATION1. So, my mom, little brother, grandma, grandpa, my friend @CAPS1, and I all went to the Chinese @CAPS2.  That night was unforgettable because the whole table was laughing at @CAPS1 and me. After @CAPS1 and I ordered our food, the waiter brought our appetizers, and that's when the tears and laughter started. We spent ten minutes talking about a boy @CAPS1 liked. When she said his name, I laughed so hard that my crab puff flew towards her.  As @CAPS1 and I sat there laughing, I noticed that she couldn't open her mouth because she was laughing too hard and her cheeks hurt. She ended up drooling into the soy - sauce bowl, and when I saw that, I just couldn't tell her.  The night ended when @CAPS1 dumped her water all over the waiter's son. I had to apologize to the waiter and his son. His son said it was okay because it happened to him often.  Laughter is an important part of people's lives. It can make you happy, bring smiles to people's faces, and create memories.
443	21266	8	2	"This is my second time at @ORGANIZATION1, and I'm really looking forward to going on all the rides. The lines are incredibly long, but I'm with some family members I haven't seen in a while, so we chat and catch up.  My uncle, who's with us, likes to play tricks on the kids and embarrass me. He's given me wedgies, put his kids' diapers under my pillow, and done many other crazy things. I knew this trip wouldn't be different, so I tried to avoid his schemes.  It was going to be a warm day, so I wore basketball shorts and a T - shirt. We went with five kids under the age of @NUM1, so we knew we'd start with some smaller rides. After going on ""@CAPS1's a small @ORGANIZATION1"", we decided it was time for the bigger rides, but we needed lunch first.  We went to a burger shop. While waiting for our food, my uncle and I had a spit - ball war. We were shooting across the aisle from table to table, trying to avoid people walking by. I hit him twice on the cheek, and he said I won.  After we ate and went outside, he said, ""@CAPS2 see who can hold your little brother above their head for the longest"". Without thinking, I said, ""That's easy!"" and lifted my brother up. It was a big mistake. He walked over and pulled down my pants in the middle of the walkway. I stood there with my brother above my head and my pants at my ankles. People at the tables stared and laughed. I was so embarrassed. I couldn't believe I fell for his trick again. It all happened so fast, and all I could do was chuckle inside.  After that, we went to Space Mountain to get fast - passes. These allowed us to skip the line and go to the front, but they could only be used at certain times. We waited about twenty minutes, and it started raining. So, we put on our blue @ORGANIZATION2 ponchos, and the kids were playing tag. My brothers are energetic and never stop running. They kept hitting me in the back and running away. After the fifth time, I couldn't take it anymore, so I told them if they hit me again, I'd hit them back. Two minutes later, I got hit again. I turned around and hit a kid in a blue poncho on the back of the head. It was a random kid. I felt terrible as the kid looked at me blankly. I was so embarrassed that I ran and hid behind a tree while my uncle and parents apologized. Although my family was embarrassed for me, they were also laughing hysterically.  Overall, despite the embarrassing moments, it was still a day full of unexpected events at @ORGANIZATION1."
444	21268	8	2	Laughter is an integral part of my life. When I laugh, I feel a sense of happiness and a connection with others. It truly strengthens relationships.  I've been friends with @PERSON2 since elementary school. Whenever I was sad, I'd go to him. We'd talk about what was bothering me, and after a while, we'd end up laughing and being happy. Laughter brought us closer and helped us understand each other. Even when we were mad at each other, the good times we'd shared through laughter kept our friendship strong.  One @DATE1, @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I were at @ORGANIZATION1's house. We were listening to music and chatting. Then, out of nowhere, @PERSON2's little nephew started dancing and laughing. @PERSON1 got up and joined him, and then @PERSON2 did too. It was unexpected. They picked a song and made a dance for it. The whole time, we were having a great time. They looked really funny dancing.  After a while, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 got tired, but @PERSON2's nephew kept dancing, and we kept laughing. They danced to the song a few more times that @DATE1, and it was just as funny the last time as the first.  Laughter has connected me and my friends on many occasions, but this one stands out because it was so funny. I remember it as clearly as if it had happened last week.  Happiness in a relationship is key to its longevity. That's why I firmly believe that laughter is important and it really does strengthen any relationship. This story is proof of that.
445	21269	8	2	Middle school is a challenging environment. Students not only face a rapid increase in academic demands but also a maturing social environment. The intense competition for social dominance and the resulting inflated egos create a breeding ground for bullies. Without the ability to laugh things off, one's mental well - being in such an environment would be at risk.  During my first @NUM1 years in middle school, I struggled with the social discomfort caused by classmates higher in the social chain. This took a severe toll on my self - esteem and academics. The stress of my low social status made my grades drop, creating a vicious cycle of more stress. The situation seemed hopeless and depressing. I couldn't believe that in just over a decade of life, my outlook had become so bleak. I wondered how I'd make it through the rest of my school years.  Every day, I had to endure new insults from those higher in the social ladder, who were trying to boost their self - esteem. Sometimes, even my so - called friends joined in. Except for a few trusted friends, it seemed like the whole world was trying to advance themselves by insulting me.  This daily ridicule continued until I had an epiphany: Laughter is the key to social survival. Without it, I couldn't have survived those school years. After this realization, I was able to laugh at the insults and at myself. I took the negative remarks as critiques to improve myself. Through laughter, I was able to secure my social position, improve my intelligence, make new and better friends, and come to terms with others. I managed to avoid becoming like those who had bullied me in the past. It was a win - win situation.  Laughter is essential in any situation, whether it's a friendly conversation or dealing with the immaturity of adolescents. It taught me a valuable lesson, one that I hope everyone can learn. Without the power of laughter, I don't think anyone can lead a successful and enjoyable life.
446	21271	8	2	It is often said that laughter is the best medicine. I firmly believe this and will share a true story to illustrate how laughter can heal and its significance in life. It was around @DATE1. I was with my cousins @PERSON2, @PERSON4, @PERSON3, @PERSON1, and my grandpa. @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and I were playing games while grandpa watched. Suddenly, there was a loud smack followed by crying and screaming. It turned out that @PERSON1 “slipped” and hit 7 - year - old @PERSON3. Grandpa was furious upon seeing the red handprint on @PERSON3's back and started scolding @PERSON1. @PERSON1 left in a huff. Later, @PERSON1 returned. Grandpa and I sat at the table with him. I said something that made everyone laugh so hard that they forgot about the earlier incident. @PERSON1 then apologized to @PERSON3, and by the time grandma came home from work, we were all happy. This story shows that laughter is a powerful element in life. When you or someone is down or angry, laughter can be the remedy.
447	21272	8	2	I've heard that a smile can make a huge difference in a first meeting, a relationship, or even when passing people on the street. If someone is having a bad @CAPS2, a sincere smile, accompanied by some laughter, can turn things around. I love walking on a beautiful @CAPS2 and interacting with locals who smile, laugh, and wave, indicating they're enjoying the day as much as I am. Even when passing someone I don't know, a glance at their face can tell me if they're having a good or bad @CAPS2. I always give a smile, either to share the joy of the day or to offer encouragement. A good first impression is crucial for me as it can shape the course and longevity of a friendship. I prefer being around people who love to smile and laugh. I can't imagine getting along with a serious person because our personalities would clash. When I first met my friend @CAPS1 on a blind date set up by a mutual friend, I was nervous. It was a @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS2 double - date with our friend and my cousin. When the guys picked us up, I got in the car and saw @CAPS1's big smile, which made me even more nervous and made me stutter. As the date went on, I found him down - to - earth and always smiling and laughing. We became closer than I expected. Eventually, it was clear that he liked me and I liked him. One night, @CAPS1, @CAPS4, @PERSON1, and I were together. @CAPS4 and @PERSON1 went to the store in @CAPS1's car. When they returned, they were scared and said the car was in the ditch. I thought @CAPS1 would be angry, but instead, he smiled, walked towards the car, and said it was fine. Then he started laughing, and soon we were all laughing. That same night, @CAPS1 asked me the question I hoped to hear in a way that made me laugh, and I happily said yes. Laughter can make any situation better, whether it's the best or the worst.
448	21273	8	2	Many people believe that laughter helps you live longer, love longer, and reveals your true self. I wholeheartedly agree. Laughter has been a crucial part of my life, helping me through difficult times. You can laugh with friends, family, or even strangers. It can mend relationships and get you through anything. My relationship with my mother has had its ups and downs. We often don't get along, and my separation anxiety means we spend a lot of time together, which can lead to friction. One day, we had a fight because she wouldn't let me go somewhere. I was rude, and I expected her to be mad at me for a while. We didn't talk for a couple of hours and tried to avoid each other. A few days later, I went to her room to talk. I understood her anger and apologized, but there was still tension. I decided to give her space. The next day, we went out to do some errands like grocery shopping and visiting family. At first, we didn't talk much. But within an hour, we started joking and laughing. After our errands, we had lunch, and it was the most fun I'd ever had with my mom. We talked about everything and laughed non - stop. After that, our relationship improved significantly. We spent more time together and didn't want to be apart. I'm convinced that laughing and talking openly helped us. I love my mother more than anyone, and I was scared our relationship would never be the same after the fight. But laughter helped us work it out. I truly believe that laughter can heal anything, from a broken heart to a broken family.
449	21274	8	2	Laughter is important in numerous ways. It can resolve arguments with friends, improve health, and ease awkward situations. All relationships need a bit of laughter to lighten the mood. Without it, everything would be taken seriously all the time, leading to more feuds. For example, my best friend @PERSON1 and I had a big fight about someone spilling paint on her shorts. We were accusing each other, and the fight was escalating. In the middle of it, @PERSON1 made a face that made me laugh. She was initially unamused and questioned my laughter. I explained, and she went to the bathroom and made the same face in the mirror. To my surprise, she started laughing too. After a ten - minute laughing fit, I made a joke about the paint on the shorts, and we decided to splatter them for a unique look. Laughter saved us from a bigger argument. When people are angry or upset, they may feel physically unwell and stay angry for days, which can cause physical pain. I know that when I'm angry for a long time, I get a headache and become more irritable. Laughing is a way to let go and move on. It has a positive impact on both physical and mental health. Everyone needs to laugh to stay sane. Learning not to worry about small things is essential. My favorite saying is “let go laughing.” Letting go of problems while laughing is the best way to solve them. I've noticed that laughing more makes me feel better overall, gives me more energy, and lightens the mood when I'm with others. Everyone, including married couples, students, teachers, and friends, needs to laugh. It can bring people together. In conclusion, laughter can resolve feuds, lighten moods, and benefit both mental and physical health. Always remember to let go laughing.
450	21275	8	2	There's nothing more fun than going to a friend's house after church. It's like a comic relief after a heavy sermon. My friend is a bit crazy, which makes our time together even more fun. We have a great time doing all sorts of things like cleaning, playing with magnets, and watching Vampire @CAPS2. On a @DATE1, I left church at twelve and was at my friend's house by twelve o' five. When I opened the door, the snowzer pup barked. @CAPS4 yelled from another room to quiet the dog. The dog has a habit of eating rocks. @DATE2, @CAPS4 was a bit grouchy because there were many dishes to do, and she was worried her sister would be angry if she knew I was there and the dishes weren't done. I offered to help, and we got to work. @CAPS4 frantically searched the house for dishes and put them in the sink while I loaded the clean ones into the dishwasher. We heard a noise from her sister's room and got startled. Her sister seemed to be waking up, but a snort ended the noise, and we got back to work. After finishing, we slumped on the couch, tired and with pounding hearts. When her sister snorted again, we laughed hysterically, and her sister told us to quiet down. Another day, when we were really hungry, we went into the kitchen. We couldn't decide what to eat. Then, I saw a bag of chocolate mint chocolate chips, and @CAPS4 followed my gaze and smiled. We decided to make @CAPS9. Deciding who should flip the @CAPS9 was a difficult choice. We argued until I realized the pancake was about to burn, so I flipped it. Unfortunately, it broke into pieces. But eventually, we ate and were full. On another @DATE1, @CAPS4 showed me a cool show called Vampire @CAPS2. While watching, I misheard something and said a funny thing, which made us laugh all night. When my mom came to pick me up, we hugged and said goodbye. There's no better way to spend a @DATE1 @TIME1 than at a friend's house, filled with crazy moments like these.
451	21276	8	2	"@PERSON1, wake up! It's almost time for you to go to school!"" My mom yelled at the boy with fuzzy hair, half - opened eyes, and yawning. That boy was me. Today was the first day of my new middle school. Our family had moved to a new place, so I had to change schools.  I woke up, took a shower, and put on my school uniform with a mix of excitement and nervousness because I didn't know anyone at the new school. When I arrived, students of my age were either screaming out of sadness for the upcoming school days or in excitement at seeing their friends again. In contrast, I felt depressed and confused because of these hyper students and the new environment.  I shook my head and started to focus on finding my classroom. ""There it is!"" I found my classroom. When I stepped in, the students looked at me curiously as I was the new kid. I sat alone and waited for the teacher. While waiting, I put my head down and dozed off with a frown on my face.  Suddenly, the teacher opened the door and shouted, ""Sit down and be quiet!"" This teacher seemed to be the strictest one I'd ever seen. While the teacher was writing on the whiteboard, the students were talking about their first impression of the teacher. It was off - putting to yell at students on the first day.  For instance, I knew a kid who transferred from a private to a public school. We were in the same class and were partners. At first, he answered my questions nicely, and I thought we could be close friends. But it was wrong. He started talking loudly to me during the teacher's explanation, getting me in trouble. Other students disliked him for being a distraction in class, and he often asked useless questions loudly. He also wore a strange - smelling perfume that he thought was cool. His behavior led to a small fight. After arguing with friends, he stopped coming to school, and now we don't know where he is.  This shows that the first impression is crucial in relationships. When I heard other students say this, I decided to change. I put a smile on my face and thought positively. I tried to participate in class and make new friends. As a result, other students started to ask me questions like ""Why did you come to this school?"", ""What sports do you like?"", etc.  Laughter changed my appearance and helped me build good relationships. When I first entered the classroom with a worried face, the students just stared at me. But after I started smiling, they became more comfortable around me. Changing my depressed look was the starting point for me in the new school. I made many friends and eventually became a class leader. I was amazed that the ""new guy"" could achieve this. I'm proud of myself and glad I changed my attitude."
452	21277	8	2	You know how people say school is the most fun place during the day? I totally agree. When I'm at school, I laugh all day when I see my friend @PERSON1. The three of us - @PERSON1, @LOCATION1, and I - had a blast in the same classes. Even when we were in different classes, we'd laugh in the halls and classrooms, sometimes at each other or at strangers.  Last year, I loved going to school. But this year, it's not as much fun because @PERSON1 moved to the @CAPS1 - es, and I don't know where she lives. After she left, it was tough. Now it's just @LOCATION1 and me, and we don't have as much fun in class without her, though we still manage on most days.  I remember when @PERSON1 first came to school. She looked like the other girls in our class. But once we got to know her, we became best friends. The next day, she thought we wouldn't like her because she was new. But we hung out together since seventh grade.  What I love about @PERSON1 is that she can turn a bad day into a great one. But there were times when she was down, and @PERSON2 and I tried to cheer her up. Sometimes, she'd get mad at us for not being there when she needed us. I felt terrible, but we're friends, and friends should always be there for each other. The next day, she'd often forget what had happened when she was angry.  One time in class, there weren't many students. We were painting the bulletin board. The colors were white and brown, and we got paint all over the place and on each other. I painted her hand half - brown and half - white, and she got some on the drying paper. It didn't work out well, and we had to go to the next class. The next day in the same class, we did something similar. We got paint on the floor, sink, and each other. I drew a heart with her name in it on her.  In our next class, we laughed all day. We even got my sister @LOCATION1 to laugh, even though it wasn't that funny. Eating a lot of candy always makes us laugh.  These are the days I'll always remember. @PERSON1, @LOCATION1, and I always find something to laugh and talk about. @PERSON1 is the best. She's the glue that holds us together. I think when we're together, we laugh all the time. No matter what we do, we always have a good time.
453	21279	8	2	"On @DATE2 @CAPS1 @CAPS2, it was a warm day. @CAPS3 and I were on our way to a family reunion in @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2. Our car was packed with my mom, grandma, cousin, and the two of us girls. It got extremely hot inside. It was around the @NUM1 of @DATE1, in @DATE3. I thought we might die in that car! We had the air - conditioning on, but it didn't help much. I was sitting between my cousin @CAPS4 and @CAPS3.  Finally, we reached a rest stop and stumbled out of the car. @CAPS3 wanted a drink, so I followed. I'm sure we were getting strange looks from the people around us. I was wearing my @LOCATION1 @CAPS6's, and @CAPS3 was in @CAPS8 @CAPS9. It felt like it took @NUM2 minutes just to walk to the drinking fountain. It was really that hot.  While @CAPS3 was getting a drink, I opened a cliff bar. Then I heard her scream. I burst out laughing, even though I didn't know what had happened. @CAPS3 turned around, and my laughter turned into hysterical screaming. The mouthpiece of the fountain was pointed at her when she drank, so she got soaked. I said sarcastically, ""Well, you won't be hot for a while now, will you?"" We both laughed, and she chased me, trying to get me wet. Sometimes, all you can do is laugh together.  Later that day, when we reached the family reunion, there was a pool. She tried to push me in, but I pulled her in with me. Everyone was laughing. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard as I did on that @DATE2. Those were really good times. Looking back, I realize that even in uncomfortable situations, sharing laughter can make the moment unforgettable."
454	21280	8	2	Laughter is incredibly important in life. I personally couldn't live without it. It's an essential part of who I am. All relationships should involve laughter. What would a relationship be without it? Laughter is a beautiful thing. When I laugh, I enjoy life, and my worries disappear. I feel care - free. It's also beneficial for our physical and mental health.  Throughout my life, laughter has been a part of many relationships. But I want to share a special time with my dad. I've always been close to my dad; you could say I'm a daddy's little girl. Laughter has played a huge role in our relationship. It's always found its way into our interactions.  When I was little, if I needed a good laugh, my dad was there. Our shared laughter grew stronger over the years. I can't remember a moment with my dad without laughter. We used to watch @CAPS3 shows together. We'd laugh so hard that it was difficult to get through the show without missing something. We'd wake up the whole family, and sometimes we didn't even know why we were laughing.  I can still hear the sweet sound of our laughter. I miss those @CAPS1 @NUM1 nights. I knew I'd be laughing with my dad, and tears of joy would run down our faces. I looked forward to that sound. It was almost impossible to watch the whole show without laughing.  Since my dad moved to @LOCATION1, we haven't had those wonderful times of laughter that I miss so much. But I'll always cherish them in my heart. Those moments were the best of my relationship with my dad, from when I was a little girl to now, almost an adult.  I don't think my dad and I would be as close if we hadn't shared all that laughter. When I'm sad or miss my dad, I recall those laughter - filled times and hear his laugh in my head. I never realized how important laughter would be to me. I'm glad it's played such a significant part in my life.  Laughter is vital in relationships because it brings joy and happiness. It should always be a part of any relationship. It's good for our bodies. If you're sad or having a bad day, a good laugh can change your mood, just like it did for my dad and me. It also helps relationships last longer. I'm close to my dad, best friend, mom, boyfriend, sisters, etc., because of laughter. Without it, I couldn't handle being sad all the time. Everyone needs a little laughter in their life. My dad taught me how powerful and simple laughter can be. I'm grateful for that lesson. I can't imagine life without laughter.
455	21281	8	2	"They say laughter is the best medicine, and every relationship needs a dose of it now and then. My younger brother, @PERSON1, and I have a good relationship. Sometimes we argue, and other times we get along like best friends. When we were at the same school, I'd always try to say hi to him, but he'd usually ignore me.  Next year, @PERSON1 will be a freshman, and I'll be a junior, so we'll be in high school together. One night at dinner, our family was discussing what it would be like with both of us in high school. I mentioned that @PERSON1 never greets me, and I didn't like it.  Somehow, the conversation turned to how he'd be known as my brother because I'm so awesome. Then @PERSON1 blurted out, ""Yeah, I'm going to embarrass you because I'm so butt - ugly."" My parents and I looked at each other and started laughing uncontrollably.  When we calmed down a bit, we asked @PERSON1 why he said that. He said he thought it would be funny, and it really was! That night, it was my turn to pray at dinner. No matter how hard I tried to compose myself, I couldn't stop laughing. Every time I thought I was okay, I'd start laughing again.  My parents asked me what was wrong, and I said, ""I was going to ask @CAPS4 to make @PERSON1 more beautiful so he wouldn't embarrass me."" I laughed so hard that I was crying, and my vision was blurred. It took me even longer to control my laughter.  My parents calmed down before me, so my mom had to pray because I couldn't contain myself. During the prayer, I had to cover my mouth with my hand to keep from laughing. I held my hand so tightly that my teeth hurt.  That night, our whole family got a big dose of the ""laughter medicine."" It was enough to last us for a while. I can't wait for another moment like this when we can all laugh together again. Laughter really does make relationships stronger and moments more memorable."
456	21284	8	2	Laughter, a vital element in life, holds a special place in mine as it brings me happiness. I'll share a true story highlighting its significance. There were days when stress and unhappiness cast a shadow over me. My friend @CAPS1 would visit my home to lift my spirits through laughter. He had several ways to achieve this: tickling me, telling funny jokes or asking silly questions, and getting me to play video - games at which I was woefully bad. When he came over, we'd chat about random things. If he noticed me getting sad, he'd threaten to tickle me if I didn't cheer up. Since I didn't readily cheer up, he'd start tickling me. I'm ticklish all over, so I'd laugh uncontrollably. Even after he stopped, I'd keep laughing. He'd keep tickling me until I was truly happy. On another occasion, while we were watching a movie or TV and having popcorn, if he saw I wasn't happy, he'd try to make me laugh. He'd tell a funny joke or ask a strange question. For instance, he'd comment on the nice weather when it was actually bad, or make remarks about the movie's improbability. These little things always made me laugh and cheered me up. He also got me to play video - games to distract me. Once, on a rainy day at his place, he suggested playing games. First, he'd show off his skills in a game like Assassins @CAPS2. Then he'd encourage me to play. I was terrible at it, but it was fun. I wasn't used to the controls of an @CAPS3 @CAPS4, so I'd struggle. He'd tease me, and I'd laugh at my own ineptitude. In conclusion, @CAPS1's methods of tickling me, telling funny things, and getting me to play games made me laugh. This laughter brought me happiness. Laughter is a crucial part of my life and this story. Without it, I wouldn't be as happy, and since happiness is essential in life and relationships, its importance cannot be overstated.
457	21285	8	2	High school can be a challenging time for teenagers without a friend who can bring a smile during tough moments. I had such a friend, @PERSON1. She had a unique gift of making me laugh regardless of the situation. Unfortunately, our friendship ended around the end of our sophomore year, and it was a fault on both our parts. We didn't become enemies, but our parting wasn't amicable. As my junior year began on @DATE1, I couldn't even recall why we'd stopped being friends. Clearly, it was a silly thing to fight over, but hurtful words had been exchanged, making it difficult to reconcile. I was reluctant to be the first to apologize and let the situation linger. On the first day of junior year, I was worried as I didn't see any sign of @PERSON1. I feared she might have moved away without me getting a chance to say goodbye. After lunch, when I usually saw everyone, there was still no trace of her. In my last class of the day, seated in the front row, @PERSON1 walked in. I was relieved she hadn't moved, but seeing her serious face made me remember our estrangement. Knowing she was still around was good, but the unresolved conflict was painful. I didn't want to apologize first, fearing she'd blame me. As the semester passed, seeing her in class every day was difficult. I'd lost a great friend over something I couldn't remember. I noticed she'd made new friends and moved on. We saw each other more after school when we joined cheerleading, but we still didn't talk. At first, I resented her for ignoring me, but I also had to take responsibility for my actions. One night, feeling down, I thought of @PERSON1. I decided to email her because I knew I'd chicken out if I tried to talk to her face - to - face. I told her I was wrong about many things and how much I missed our friendship. The next day at lunch, @PERSON1 sat next to me. She mentioned an incident from the @NUM1 grade, and I burst into laughter. We talked about our summers and laughed more than we talked. I was glad to have my funny best friend back, and I realized that laughter could mend our broken bond.
458	21286	8	2	In life, laughter serves as the shortest bridge between two individuals. For a long time, I never believed I could find happiness. Every time I tried, it seemed like someone would take it away. I'd been dumped, cheated on, and lost best friends. I'd lie awake at night, hoping someone would understand me. Then I met @PERSON2. He was the kind of person you could confide in. He listened and cared as if my problems were his own. His ability to sense when something was wrong and try to fix it was what attracted me to him the most. He could make me happy even when I was at my lowest, despite not living close, barely knowing each other, and rarely meeting. I used to doubt that laughter could bring people closer, but he quickly proved me wrong. In my freshman year, I was focused on being popular, making friends, and getting a boyfriend. One day in math class, I saw @PERSON2, a tall boy with brown - blond hair. I was immediately smitten and made a fool of myself. I didn't think I'd have a chance with him until I got his number. We dated and then broke up. But this experience brought us closer, and we eventually became best friends, which made me happy. My boyfriend at the time wasn't a good one. It took me a while to realize this because I was drawn to his ability to make me feel important. When he cheated on me, I called @PERSON2, crying. Unlike most boys, he listened and understood. Our long conversation that night made us realize how much we had in common. We'd both been through similar situations and supported each other. One time after a dance, @PERSON2 called me, saying he'd cried when @PERSON1 left. I helped him. Later, when he suspected @PERSON1 of cheating, I was there for him. And when I quit the dance team, he woke up to listen to me. People told me not to get too attached, but I couldn't help it. He made me smile even when we weren't in the same room. The shared experiences made us laugh, and his ability to be himself without embarrassment made him great to be around. Sometimes, I look back at the beginning of the year when I was shy and unhappy. I wonder what would have happened if I hadn't met @PERSON2. I've changed a lot in a few months, and I'm sure laughter played a role. It brought us together from being strangers and continues to keep our friendship strong. Maybe it's true that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people.
459	21287	8	2	On @DATE1, the first day of my sophomore year, I was extremely nervous as my mother drove towards the unfamiliar building that would be my new @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION1. I pleaded with her, suggesting we could come back another time or not come at all. My mother laughed and kept looking for a parking spot. I slumped in my seat, feeling discouraged and lonely. Transferring to a new @ORGANIZATION2 was a nightmare for me because I had to leave the @ORGANIZATION2 I loved, where I had friends and which met my specific needs. I wished I could go home and escape this reality. My mom practically had to drag me from the minivan to the @ORGANIZATION2 doors as I wanted to run in the opposite direction. In the commons, there was a large crowd of students. My mom introduced me to @PERSON3, the person in charge, and then left. I felt sick and my heart was pounding as I saw no familiar faces. Being an introvert, I struggled in this new environment, and I didn't even want to make friends. I just wanted to go back to my old @ORGANIZATION2. As the day went on, my mood worsened. No one was friendly to me, and I wasn't trying either. During a field trip to the @CAPS9 campus, I met a girl who seemed as uncomfortable as I was. She had long, blond, straight hair, brown eyes, and a pierced nose. We walked together in silence, finding comfort in each other's presence. At the @CAPS9 campus, I mustered the courage to ask her where she was from. She said she was from @LOCATION1 and that her family had moved there last @DATE2, and she'd been homeschooled until the end of the year. We made small talk during the tour. I couldn't read her name tag and was too embarrassed to ask, but she eventually told me her name was @PERSON1 and that I could call her @PERSON2. After the tour, we were going to have a pizza party at the @ORGANIZATION2. As @PERSON2 and I sat in the corner eating, I gloomily commented that it would be the worst year ever. We looked at each other pitifully, but then, simultaneously, we smiled and started laughing hysterically. Laughter may not have instantly made this new @ORGANIZATION2 a fun and welcoming place, but it made it a little more bearable. Laughter truly is a powerful medicine that can turn strangers into friends.
460	21288	8	2	Laughter is often considered the shortest distance between two people. In my life, this concept was truly put to the test. I once felt that happiness was out of my reach. Every time I tried to be happy, it seemed like something would thwart my efforts. I'd been through break - ups, betrayals, and the loss of a best friend. I'd lie awake at night, longing for someone to understand me. Then I met @PERSON2. He was different. He was the kind of person who would listen intently when I shared my problems, as if they were his own. His ability to sense when I was down and his attempts to make me feel better were what drew me to him. Even though he didn't live close, and we didn't know each other well initially, he could make me smile better than anyone I'd known for years. I used to doubt the power of laughter to bring people closer, but he quickly changed my mind. In my freshman year, I was focused on fitting in, making friends, and finding a boyfriend. One day in math class, I saw @PERSON2, a tall boy with brown - blond hair. I was immediately attracted to him and acted rather foolishly. I didn't think I'd have a chance with him until I got his number. Our relationship was up and down; we dated and then broke up. However, this experience brought us closer, and we eventually became best friends, which brought me a lot of happiness. My boyfriend at that time wasn't a good partner. It took me a while to realize this because I was caught up in his ability to make me feel important. When he cheated on me, I was devastated and called @PERSON2. Unlike most boys, he listened to me with empathy. Our long conversation that night made us realize how similar our experiences were. We'd both been through difficult relationships and were there for each other. After a dance, @PERSON2 called me, saying he'd cried when @PERSON1 left. I supported him. Later, when he suspected @PERSON1 of cheating, I helped him through it. And when I quit the dance team, he woke up to listen to me. People warned me not to get too attached, but I couldn't help it. He had a way of making me smile even when we weren't together. The shared experiences and our ability to laugh about them made our friendship special. Looking back at the beginning of the year, when I was shy and unhappy, I often wonder what my life would be like if I hadn't met @PERSON2. I've changed a lot in a short time, and I believe laughter played a significant role. It brought us together from being strangers and has kept our friendship strong. It's clear to me that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people.
461	21289	8	2	"In school, I once gained a highly valuable lesson. It wasn't from a classroom or a book but in a hallway near the copy room. One might wonder what lesson could be learned in a hall. All I can say is it's one I won't forget soon. To fully understand my activities in the halls and the lesson learned, some background is needed. I was in my third - period leadership class. From an outsider's view, leadership isn't a typical class. Students moving around the school might seem improper, but we weren't doing anything wrong. Usually, we had to leave the classroom to complete tasks. Leadership was followed by my least - favorite class, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I detested this class. I'd been in @CAPS1 classes since kindergarten at @ORGANIZATION1. As a sophomore, this language had bothered me for ten years. It wasn't that I was bad at it; I just strongly disliked the class. The teacher was tough on me, perhaps because I was talkative. She had a strict posture and was a stickler for rules, the kind of person one could picture using a yardstick as a weapon. In that specific leadership class, the teacher took a long time explaining the day's tasks. He was known for being long - winded and could spend the entire @NUM1 - minute class discussing an assignment that would take only ten minutes. That day, we weren't doing a regular assignment. Another girl, @CAPS5, and I were working on a special project. We needed to retrieve something important from my car. After waiting for the teacher to finish, we asked and got permission to leave. We walked out of the classroom's double doors into the main hallway and headed towards the parking lot. Passing the office doors, @CAPS6 hall, and the library, as we neared the copy room, I saw @PERSON2. He was in my @CAPS1 Two class the previous year, so I said hi and asked if he was taking @CAPS1 @CAPS2 that year. He said no, and I blurted out, ""@CAPS10 thing, because @CAPS1 @CAPS2 sucks!"" Little did I know I'd regret those words soon. Seconds after my comment, @CAPS5 tugged at my sleeve, trying to get me out. I told her to calm down as it was rude to interrupt. After saying bye to @PERSON2, @CAPS5 rushed me out, bursting into laughter. I was shocked and asked what was so funny. Just then, @LOCATION1, my @CAPS1 teacher, poked her head out and said in her thick accent, ""@PERSON1, I hear you don't like my class!"" I turned as red as a tomato, standing there with a dumb look, wishing I could take back my words. I saw @CAPS5 gasping for air from laughter. @LOCATION1 stood there, trying to hide her laughter behind an angry face. I was just steps from my car and was speechless. The lesson I learned was to never insult an alligator until you've crossed the river, especially when the alligator teaches your next class."
462	21290	8	2	"Laughter is an integral part of @CAPS1. Without it, @CAPS1 would not be what it is today. Laughter is also the reason I'm in a relationship with my boyfriend. As someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Laughter can break the ice when people are mad, sad, or meeting someone new. It can also bring people closer. One day, while with my best friend @PERSON1, we met @PERSON2 and @PERSON3, friends of her cousin @CAPS2. @PERSON2 and I started talking and hanging out that night. I'm a shy person, but he made me laugh, breaking down the wall I'd put up due to shyness and discomfort. The more we laughed, the closer and more comfortable I felt around him. Eventually, we started dating and are still together, with a strong relationship thanks to laughter. Without it, we wouldn't be as close. Laughter gives a sense of security, making it okay to be oneself around strangers. It makes one feel warm and invited to have fun, creating a bonding experience. When used appropriately, like breaking the ice, it doesn't make people uncomfortable. Meeting new people can be awkward, but laughter can make them feel less shy. I'm usually shy until someone makes me laugh. Also, making people laugh when they're sad or mad can bring you closer, though it can sometimes push people away. When I was upset about my breakup with my ex - fiancé, my best friend @PERSON1 took me to the state fair. Laughing on the rides brought us closer and ended my anger. Laughter is undoubtedly a huge element of @CAPS1. While some may not see it that way, it is crucial to me. Without the security of laughing with @PERSON2, our relationship wouldn't be as strong. Without laughter, @PERSON1 and I wouldn't feel as close. As the saying goes, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS1 would be very different without it."
463	21291	8	2	One @TIME1, my friend @ORGANIZATION2 received a random call from three of his high - school friends. They hadn't talked much since high school. @ORGANIZATION2 was surprised and assumed they were in trouble. Instead, they said they wanted to go on a road trip and asked @ORGANIZATION2 to plan it as they didn't have computers and couldn't read maps. After some thought, @ORGANIZATION2 agreed and asked where they wanted to go. One friend said he wanted to see a professional baseball game and visit @ORGANIZATION1 land. A week and a half later, @ORGANIZATION2 called back with a ten - day trip plan. It started in @LOCATION1, drove to @LOCATION2's @ORGANIZATION1, and included watching games of five professional baseball teams in @LOCATION2, followed by a visit to Six Flags. The friends were surprised and said @ORGANIZATION2 was coming too. They needed his car as they couldn't drive or read maps. After considering, @ORGANIZATION2 agreed but set conditions, splitting tasks among his friends. One was to find hotels, another gas stations, and the third restaurants. The trip began, and it was much - needed and unexpectedly fun for @ORGANIZATION2. They watched four of the five baseball games and had a great time. @ORGANIZATION1 land exceeded expectations, and Six Flags made them feel like they were back in high school. However, one friend fell behind on finding hotels. Most of the nights were arranged at relatives' or friends' places, but the hotel bookings were last - minute. A few days before returning, they had one more event: the Giants baseball game, followed by staying with an old high - school buddy in @LOCATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 asked the friend in charge of accommodation, who said he hadn't called yet. When he did, they learned the friend was back in @LOCATION1. @ORGANIZATION2 thought the trip was too good to be true. On the @TIME1 of the game, things were rushed. @ORGANIZATION2 and his friends left early due to bad traffic in @LOCATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 forgot to use the restroom, and two hours into the trip, he really needed to go. His friends told him to keep going as the traffic was good. Then the traffic stopped. @ORGANIZATION2 was desperate and pulled off the highway. Miraculously, he reached the Giants stadium and saw a portable potty, but it was locked. He found another one, which was open, but by then, it was too late, and he embarrassed himself.
464	21292	8	2	"In my opinion, laughter is a powerful form of communication that can transform any situation. It can break awkward silences, evoke fond memories, or bring a sense of calm. I discovered this through various experiences during @DATE1, many of which involved connecting with people who spoke different languages or young children. Our family has hosted exchange students from @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, and @LOCATION4. Most of them had some knowledge of @CAPS1, but there were words that were hard to describe and translate. My favorite exchange student was @PERSON1 from @LOCATION3. She lived in the northern part of @LOCATION3, in the @LOCATION2 country, where they speak @CAPS2. Their culture is slightly different from the rest of @LOCATION3. @PERSON1 had a cheerful personality, empathy, and an amazing ability to make everyone laugh. Her talent made the summers I spent with her some of my happiest memories. She could turn any activity, like washing dishes, which I usually disliked, into a light - hearted experience. We'd laugh until tears streamed down our faces and we needed to use the bathroom. Once, @PERSON1, my best friend @PERSON2, and I spent a day in the park, performing skits and telling funny stories. We laughed until our bellies hurt. @PERSON1 would exclaim, ""@CAPS3 you have got to stop this or I will surely explode, I have to use the restroom every ten minutes!"" And then we'd start laughing again. When I visited @PERSON1 in @LOCATION3, we had similar moments of uncontrollable laughter. At the @LOCATION2 parliament building with our families, @PERSON1, my sister @PERSON3, and I couldn't stop being goofy. We laughed, made funny faces, and danced around, unable to contain our joy. I'm not sure if @PERSON1 gets along as well with my friends back home, but I feel a deeper connection with her. Laughter gives me a sense of security and allows me to be myself. I've heard that laughing before an exam can improve performance, that laughter - filled moments are more memorable, and that daily laughter can reduce stress and make one happier. For me, the best thing about laughter is that it makes me feel fantastic."
465	21293	8	2	"I firmly believe that laughter is the essence of @CAPS1. What kind of friendship would exist between two people who never laugh? I can't imagine having true friends without laughter. If there are people in the world who don't laugh, I feel sorry for them because, in my view, they're missing out on the joy of real friendship. I can't even fathom a life without laughter. My friends and I laugh constantly, especially @PERSON1 and I. When we're together, there's non - stop laughter. We laugh about almost everything and have countless inside jokes. For example, phrases like ""an upstairs @CAPS3 @CAPS4!"" or ""john, john, john, john"" might seem silly to others, but they always make us burst into laughter. If I think about a scenario where @PERSON1 and I never laugh, it would be the worst kind of @CAPS1. The thought is unbearable. Without laughter, we probably wouldn't be friends. I'm incredibly grateful for the laughter in my life. I don't know what I'd do without it. Laughter is what makes our friendship so special and enjoyable."
466	21294	8	2	When you think about a relationship, what comes to mind? Is laughter a significant factor in a relationship? Laughter refers to the sounds indicating merriment or derision. Many people who have had relationships, ranging from excellent to bad, know that when they laugh with their partners, they enjoy each other's company. Firstly, when a couple laughs together, they relish being in each other's presence, which makes them want to spend more time together. Laughter itself helps the couple build a better bond. They can form a deeper connection and understand each other better. For instance, when a couple is having a great time, they would like to keep sharing such wonderful moments. Another reason why laughter is an essential element in a relationship is that it strengthens the relationship. A couple with a strong connection can understand each other, leading to a more successful and fulfilling relationship. The next time you are in a relationship, consider how laughter can bring enjoyment, connection, more time together, and a stronger bond. So, when you laugh with your partner, think about the benefits you gain from this simple act.
467	21295	8	2	"It has been stated that ""Laughter is the spark of the soul,"" and I firmly concur. Laughter can work wonders for the soul, truly igniting a spark. Once this spark is kindled, it spreads like a wildfire. As it burns, it creates a chain - reaction throughout the body. First, an uncontrollable smile causes an ache in the cheeks. Then, there are the butterflies fluttering in the stomach. Next, a tingling sensation is felt in the toes, and finally, tears of joy stream from the eyes. If you've experienced these, that's the ""rampage"" I'm talking about; let the fire of laughter burn. Laughter is extraordinary; it can transform an awkward or embarrassing situation into a relaxed one. In my story about laughter, unfortunately, I was not the one laughing. Around three weeks ago, while my sister was at gymnastics, my mom, my best friend @CAPS1, and I went to visit my grandparents and check on the progress of our new barn. After some time at their house, it was time to pick up my sister, @CAPS2. My grandpa offered to go, but I said @CAPS1 and I could do it. Driving to town in my grandpa's @LOCATION1, it seemed like an ordinary day. After reaching the gymnastics center, we waited for @PERSON1. As we left, my sister was hungry and asked me to stop at @ORGANIZATION1. I ordered her food, paid at the window, and as I pulled forward, I heard a loud crunch. I realized I hadn't pulled out far enough and had hit the building. I've been driving since about seven and am usually a good driver, but everyone has their first crash. On the way back to my grandparents' house, I tried not to cry. When we got there, @CAPS1 and I cleaned the red paint off the truck. The dent wasn't too bad after that. I was terrified to tell my grandparents, but when I did, my grandpa just laughed, saying it was just a truck and could be fixed. Laughter brings people together and creates lasting bonds. Whether laughing at a happy moment or a not - so - good situation, let the power of laughter take over."
468	21296	8	2	School had just ended. It was the period before my senior year. We had been planning this camping trip for a few weeks and were so excited that it was all we could talk about. This would be our first camping trip without our parents, and we expected it to be the best four days of our lives. The thought of sand, the beach, friends, quads, and no parents was extremely appealing. We invited as many people as we could. @ORGANIZATION1 and I went shopping the day before. After shopping, we loaded the bikes into the toy hauler, including @ORGANIZATION1's boyfriend's bikes. We stayed up almost all night packing and choosing the perfect outfits. It was the middle of @DATE3, a beautiful sunny day. The next morning, we double - checked essentials like flags, helmets, and clothes, got gas, and headed to the coast. On the road, the music was loud, and the windows were down. The journey seemed long because of our excitement. When we arrived, there was a cute guy, @PERSON1, setting up a tent in our campsite. He was @CAPS1 ( @CAPS2's boyfriend)'s best friend. He came to help us unload, and I knew right away that I wanted to get to know him. After everyone arrived and we got settled, we went on a sand ride. It was warm enough to wear t - shirts. We didn't stay out long because people got hungry. Back at the camp, we made dinner and sat around the fire. As we talked, I noticed @PERSON1 looking at me and smiling. @ORGANIZATION1 told a funny story, and we all laughed. Later, @PERSON1 asked me for a walk. We went to the top of a dune, talked, and found we had a lot in common. Laughter really is a powerful force in bringing people together. That night at the dunes, I experienced firsthand how laughter and shared moments can build a connection.
469	21297	8	2	It all began at the playground. My friend @PERSON3, @PERSON2, and I were sitting there when we saw two girls from school, @PERSON1 and @CAPS1. At first, we didn't recognize them, but as they got closer, we did. They invited us on an adventure to the woods. We agreed as we had nothing better to do. Although it was only @NUM2 feet from the playground, it felt like @NUM1 miles because I was lazy at the time. When we reached the @CAPS2, we thought we could build a fort from the bushes and enjoy donuts from @ORGANIZATION1. However, we didn't know that there was something living there. As I sat by the creek, I saw a brownish figure in the woods. I grabbed @PERSON1, and we decided to find out what it was. As we walked, @PERSON1 pointed out something by a tree with vines. We approached cautiously and hid behind a fallen log. We heard a growling noise from a hollow in the tree. I wanted to check it out, but @PERSON1 thought it was too dangerous. When we went back to get the others, they had been looking for us for over @NUM3 minutes. We told them about the strange thing, and some were scared. After some discussion, we all decided to go back. @CAPS1 didn't want to go, so @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 stayed up the hill. As we watched the tree, I couldn't wait any longer and suggested we go closer. We heard the growling again and got a bit closer. Then, a huge mountain lion came out, and we ran up the hill as fast as we could. I couldn't help laughing when I saw @PERSON3. Back at @ORGANIZATION1, we were out of breath. We got donuts and soda and ate them all in @NUM6 minutes. This day will always be one of the craziest in my life.
470	21298	8	2	One stormy winter night, my girlfriend and I decided to go to dinner. When we arrived at the restaurant, it was almost full, so we quickly got a table. While waiting for our food, we talked about our friends and had a good time. However, I said something mean about one of her friends without realizing it. She got very upset and stormed out, leaving me alone. After paying for the food I didn't eat, I went home. The next morning, I started doing my chores like cleaning the house and mowing the yard. She came over and apologized for her outburst, and I apologized for my mean comment. I told her I'd call her after finishing my chores and take her out for lunch. After finishing the chores, taking a shower, and getting dressed, I called her and asked her to meet me at her preferred restaurant. About an hour later, she arrived and sat down. She asked if I'd be mean again, and I assured her I'd be nice and considerate. I then told her a funny memory, and she laughed and shared one of hers. This exchange of funny stories continued until we left. Until she broke up with me for my friend, laughter was the one thing that held our relationship together.
471	21299	8	2	"Laughter is often regarded as the remedy for happiness. Individuals who laugh frequently tend to lead better - overall lives. They maintain positive moods throughout the day and influence those around them with their upbeat attitude. Many strong friendships are built on frequent laughter. I'm fortunate to have friends who constantly make me and one another laugh. One time, late at night, we all laughed heartily at my house. I was a freshman in high school, which was my second year in public school as I was previously homeschooled by my parents. Earlier that year, I made friends with four others: @PERSON4, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3. None of us had visited each other's houses, so I invited them all over on that day. We weren't sure what to do at my place, but we knew our creativity would help us find entertainment. As they arrived one by one, we watched football on the @CAPS1 until everyone was there. Once @PERSON2, the last to arrive, came, we went outside. Since we're all football players, we decided to play backyard football. However, all of us except @PERSON4 were linemen. Linemen usually have ""hard hands"" and can't catch the ball well, which made our attempt at being wide - receivers quite comical. We didn't finish the game because it was so funny. Later that night, we gathered the junk around my property and, like boys our age, started a fight with it. This ""battle"" lasted most of the night, and people got hit in the funniest ways. After running around and getting tired, we decided to make a scary movie with my mom's video camera. When we sat down to come up with a plot, we kept changing it until we agreed to base it on ""@CAPS2 - field"", a movie about alien invasion, but we replaced the aliens with a psychopath chasing us. At first, the movie seemed to follow the script perfectly. But when the first serious scene came, we found we couldn't act at all. @PERSON4 was supposed to be unconscious on the ground with a gash, but he couldn't keep a straight face when we ""found"" him. With his goofy smile and @PERSON3's awkward line ""The window is open, @PERSON2 is gone"", we all burst out laughing. After calming down, we filmed the next scene where we wake @PERSON4 up. @PERSON4 said ""I'm hurt really bad! I think I need an ambulance"", and @PERSON1 replied ""@CAPS3 that's not gonna happen!"", which wasn't in the script and was extremely funny. We all laughed again. When I said ""@CAPS4 are you laughing"", we couldn't control our laughter. Later in the movie, @PERSON4 and @PERSON2 ran in front of the camera unexpectedly when they weren't supposed to. The way the short, fat one ran made us laugh again. After finishing the movie, we went back to the living room, spooked from being outside in the dark. My sister came home without us noticing. She stared through the locked door silently in a creepy way, scaring us so much that we jumped. After calming down, we laughed at how silly we were. In conclusion, the laughter that night strengthened our friendship. Every time we get together at my house, we watch that tape, remember the good times, and laugh until we cry. Laughter has helped me form a strong bond with my best friends, and my life is truly blessed because of it."
472	21300	8	2	"As the sun began to rise, bright blue waves of morning light streamed over the hilltops. The crisp, cold air roused the slumbering birds. Soon, the dusk transformed into a vibrant morning, with the birds singing in their melodious voices. Gentle breezes swept through the trees, making the leaves dance. The green grass undulated like an ocean, while the cracked gravestones stood still, like anchored ships at sea. Any onlooker in @MONTH1 would find this graveyard scene quite impressive. However, when one catches sight of the stoic young man, @PERSON1, standing before the silent tombstone, empathy and despair fill their hearts. @PERSON1 stood motionless in front of the tombstone. The gentle breeze picked up and turned into a harsh wind, drying his tear - stained face. Although windy weather was common in @PERSON2, @LOCATION1, an old memory unexpectedly interrupted his thoughts. For a brief moment, his mind went back sixteen years to when @CAPS5 was alive. As the wind calmed and he closed his eyes, he could almost hear her voice. ""@CAPS1, I would like you to meet someone,"" @CAPS5 called from upstairs on @DATE1. Six - year - old @PERSON1 ran excitedly up the creaky staircase. Out of breath, he reached the top and skipped to his parents' room. "" @CAPS2 @CAPS3?"" he asked as he turned the cold, brass doorknob. He cracked the door open and peeked inside. His blue eyes sparkled with curiosity. He saw the mid - wife gracefully moving to his mother's bedside to prop her up with another pillow. Then his attention shifted to his father, sitting on the edge of the bed, holding a bundle of pink blankets. ""Say hello to your new baby sister,"" his mother said. Still holding the doorknob, @PERSON1 pushed the door open with his left hand. The door creaked as he stepped onto the roan - colored carpet in his parents' bedroom. He carefully walked to the foot of the bed where his father sat and stood in front of him, eyes wide. "" @CAPS5 was born less than an hour ago,"" his father said. @PERSON1 looked at the pile of pink blankets. Nervously, he reached out his clammy hand and gently pinched the top layer to uncover his sister's face. All was quiet except for the wind outside. Slowly, he began to peel back the blanket. Before he could finish, the newborn let out a startling exhale. @PERSON1 jumped back and hit the bedroom door. His father was startled by his reaction but was careful not to wake the baby. @PERSON1 felt his heart pounding. Wide - eyed and out of breath, he looked at his mother, who was clearly amused. The corners of her mouth curled up, and a giggle escaped. Soon, both his parents were laughing uncontrollably, their bodies shaking rhythmically. @PERSON1 relaxed and smiled at his mother. "" @CAPS6 @CAPS5 scare you a little?"" @CAPS5 asked. His father added, ""I would think so!"" They laughed for five minutes while the mid - wife smiled and the baby slept in her father's arms. The reality of the present rushed back to @PERSON1, just like the wind through his brown hair. He missed his mother, wished she had won the fight against cancer, but she didn't. Now she was gone, and he would never see her at @LOCATION2 again. Although this memory brought sadness, it didn't push @PERSON1 into depression. Instead, he remembered the saying ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Suddenly, he realized how close he had been to his mother. He had eight years of memories with her, many filled with laughter. @PERSON1 tilted his head towards the sun as tears of joy streamed down his face. He understood that love isn't dependent on time. Even though he knew his mother for a short part of his life, the memories and laughter still surrounded him with her love. In my view, @PERSON1 is an outstanding individual. As his only full sister, he often shares his memories of our mother with me. I love and miss her, but I know I'll see her again. When that day comes, we'll be united in joy and laughter."
473	21301	8	2	"I was selling cookie dough for school, and I went to an elderly man's house. I explained the whole thing about raising money for my school, but he said he wasn't interested. Then we started chatting, and I made him laugh. Eventually, he said, ""You make me laugh. I like that. I'll buy some."" I think laughter played a crucial role in his decision to buy the cookie dough. Laughter can really have an impact on people's choices, and in this case, it helped me make a sale."
474	21302	8	2	We all recognize the benefits of laughter. I firmly believe that laughter is an essential part of life that everyone should experience. One of the most memorable times when I laughed and had a great time was when my family and I went to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION3. It all began on @DATE1. We were opening presents when my @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 told me and my siblings that they had one last surprise present for us. To find out what it was, we had to search for it, and they gave us a hint that it was in a place where we sleep. I immediately knew to look in our bedrooms. We raced upstairs and were delighted to find four packets about @ORGANIZATION1 on our nightstands. We were extremely excited. My little sister said it was the best @DATE1 present ever. We ran downstairs, hugged @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, and told them they were the best parents ever. The fact that we'd miss school made it even better. We learned that the trip was scheduled for @DATE2, so we had to wait four months. Those four months felt like an eternity. Finally, four months later, it was time to go. We had to wake up around @NUM1 a.m. because our plane was leaving at @TIME1. Before leaving home, I asked my @CAPS1 if I could bring my @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 to avoid boredom on the plane. She said I could, but only if I shared it with my little brother. As we left home, I felt butterflies in my stomach, probably because something fun and exciting was about to happen. When we reached the airport, it was @NUM2, so we had about an hour and fifty - five minutes until the plane's departure. I was glad I had my @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Since my six - year - old brother gets bored easily, I let him play my @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 until it was time to board. When it was boarding time, one of my sisters needed to use the restroom. My @CAPS1 took her, while my @CAPS2 stayed with us and boarded the plane. My other sister was unhappy that my @CAPS1 wasn't on the plane yet. So my @CAPS2 told me to keep my brother and sister in their seats while he went to find them. Five minutes later, they all returned just in time as the plane had finished refueling and was heading to the runway. One of my favorite moments on a plane is when it speeds down the runway. When we reached the necessary speed, we took off, and my stomach felt like it was in the open air. My little brother held my hand so tightly that his knuckles turned white. I told him to think of it as a really fast car going over a bump, and he started laughing. He said it was fun and wanted to do it again. I reminded him that we'd go on all the rides we wanted at @ORGANIZATION1. Three hours later, we arrived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3. After getting off the plane, we went to the baggage claim. My @CAPS2 checked when the next @CAPS11 @CAPS12 was coming. As he returned, the @CAPS12, which was blue with @CAPS11 characters, was approaching. The driver showed us many cool places. The @CAPS15 we stayed in was The @CAPS14 @CAPS15, which had a huge guitar - shaped pool. After settling in, we went to @LOCATION1. It was really fun as my sisters and I got autographs and pictures with the @CAPS11 characters. My favorite was @CAPS17 because he reminded me of myself. We spent about three hours in the park before getting hungry and going back to the @CAPS15. After dinner, we went swimming in the pool. We actually spent more time laughing and swimming at the pool than in @LOCATION1. This was the best time of my life, and I'm extremely grateful to my parents. I love them very much. Thank you.
475	21304	8	2	My best friend and I have been friends since third grade. We've shared countless laughs, memories, and tears, and to this day, our friendship is stronger than ever. One of the main reasons our friendship has lasted so long is our ability to make each other laugh. We turn boring moments into fun ones with our jokes. It all started in third grade. I was walking alone on the playground when she invited me to play. Having nothing else to do, I agreed. We played throughout recess, and it became a regular thing for us to spend that time together. The first time she invited me to her house, I was nervous. I was worried it would be awkward or that we wouldn't have a good time. After school, when we got to her house, we went to her room, played video games for a while, and then had a snack. We brought crackers to her room, sat on the floor, and started eating. Suddenly, we looked at each other and burst into uncontrollable laughter. We laughed so hard that tears came to our eyes. From that day on, we hung out as often as possible. A couple of years passed, and we declared ourselves best friends. By fifth grade, we were inseparable. Her dad was our teacher, so he knew how close we were. We rarely sat next to
476	21306	8	2	I'm head - over - heels for @CAPS11 little brother. Even though we're @NUM1 years apart in age, from the way we act, you'd think we were twins. Despite our closeness, as siblings, we do fight. Usually, our fights are petty and short - lived, but this one was different. I beat him at @CAPS1 tennis. It was a warm afternoon, and we'd just come back from school. We usually unwind by challenging each other at @CAPS1 before doing homework. “You cheated,” he said firmly. “I didn't!” I retorted. I could tell he was really upset, but I wasn't backing down. “Yes, you did. You always do! It's not fair.” “I didn't this time.” He was telling the truth; sometimes I cheat by distracting him, but this time I won fairly. “You're just mad because you lost. Be a man and accept it.” That made him throw down his controller and run upstairs crying. “Hey! What did you do to your brother?” his mom yelled. “I beat him at a game, and now he's mad.” I knew he'd run and tell his mom, hoping she'd scold me. “It's just a game. You can't win every time.” “It's not fair!” he said before slamming his door. I felt victorious at first, but then guilt set in, so I went to apologize. “Hey?” I knocked on his door. “Sorry for making you cry. It's just a game. You win some, you lose some. Don't be mad.” I gave my most sincere apology. “Go away. I don't want to talk to you.” I was shocked. I'd walked all the way up to say sorry, and he told me to go away. After a moment, all I could say was, “Oh well.” And I walked off. The rest of the day, we ignored each other. I couldn't believe he was so upset. It was one of the longest periods he'd chosen not to talk to me. I felt really bad and sad. So, I decided to try talking to him again. He was downstairs playing @CAPS1, and I was upstairs. As I came down the stairs, he heard me and turned down the volume. “Hey, listen. Are you really not going to talk to me over a game?” Then, suddenly, I slipped and slid down the stairs. “Haha!” he laughed at me. I landed at the bottom and started laughing too. That little laugh was all we needed to start talking again.
477	21307	8	2	Why do people have so much trouble laughing? Is laughter something that should be on our health - chart? These are questions we might ask ourselves. Have we ever thought about how much we and our family laugh together at the dinner table or in the family room? It doesn't matter what makes us laugh, whether it's a family member telling a joke, a funny show, or a commercial. As long as we laugh, it's good. In my opinion, laughter is an important part of life. If someone doesn't laugh, they might be very serious or think the world is boring. I can't imagine a person never laughing. People who stop laughing might have lost someone close or have no one to share jokes with. We need someone to share things with and who can tell us jokes when we're in a bad mood. I remember one day my mom told my little brother and me to be quiet at the dinner table. But then in health class at school, the teacher said we should share and have laughing moments at dinner. When I got home, I told my mom, and she agreed. We tried it, and it was a great experience. We've been telling jokes at the dinner table ever since. Laughter can give us energy, but if we laugh too much, our stomachs will hurt. There are many ways to laugh. For example, watching a comedy show like @PERSON1 always makes me laugh so hard that my mom thinks I'm crazy. Family @CAPS1 is also a great show when we're in a bad mood. We can also make people laugh by telling jokes like knock - knock jokes or “guess what I am” jokes. Tickling always works too. We can either have someone tickle us or have a “see who laughs first” contest. Laughter might not solve all our problems, but it makes us feel good and helps us forget bad things for a while. I've heard that if we laugh a lot, we might live longer. So, I think it really does help with our problems.
478	21308	8	2	During the @DATE1, I decided to join @ORGANIZATION2. I raised a market pig with the intention of selling it at the @LOCATION1. Raising a pig was time - consuming and arduous work. Without patience, good teachers, and a sense of fun, I wouldn't have been able to do it. That @DATE1, I had both great and not - so - great experiences. It was my first time being involved with @ORGANIZATION2 and raising a pig. I never expected so many awkward moments. One of the most awkward yet funny moments occurred when I was shoveling pig poop with my friend @ORGANIZATION1. This was also @ORGANIZATION1's first time with @ORGANIZATION2 and pig - raising. We were in a hurry to finish our work so we could go home and shower. I was in too much of a rush. My boots sank into the mud and poop, and I lost my balance. I tried to use the shovel to steady myself, but it was too late. I was covered from head to toe in pig poop and mud. @ORGANIZATION1 and I stared at each other for what seemed like two minutes but was actually about six seconds, and then we burst out laughing. After we composed ourselves, she helped me up, and we went to find our agriculture teacher @PERSON1. When @PERSON1 saw my once - blue pants now brown, he couldn't help but laugh. He took out his camera and took some embarrassing pictures that still make us smile. After all the joking and picture - taking, @PERSON1 gave me some old clothes to wear for the ride home. I had to roll down the window because the car smelled so bad. When I got home, I went straight to the shower. This is an experience I'll never forget. Without friends like @ORGANIZATION1 and a teacher like @PERSON1 to laugh with me, I might have seen this experience as negative. Laughter is indeed an important element of a positive and healthy lifestyle.
479	21309	8	2	I wholeheartedly agree with the saying that laughter is the best medicine. Any funny situation with laughter can instantly improve anyone's mood. Taking the time to laugh at something or ourselves is something everyone should do. Having a good time and laughing with friends and family is truly a blessing. My two best friends, @PERSON2@NUM1, and I are almost always laughing when we're together. We've laughed at ourselves and each other so many times that I've lost count. It's amazing to have such great friends to share laughter with. One time, we were at @ORGANIZATION1's house playing hide - and - seek in the backyard. It was my turn to be the seeker. After counting to @NUM2, I came out of the house. I found everyone except @PERSON2. As I searched, the others helped me. We could hear her laughter but couldn't find her. She taunted us, saying things like “Over here!” or “This way!” Finally, after getting frustrated and giving up, she revealed herself on the roof of the house. We all laughed so hard, wondering how she got up there in the first place. Another time, for my @NUM3 birthday party, we went to a pizza place and then to the arcade. We told ourselves not to play the claw machine, but @ORGANIZATION2 tried it once, and then we ended up spending all our money on it. We each won something and were screaming, cheering, and laughing like kindergartners. We also played the race - car game at least ten times. When we got bored, we started driving the race - car game with our feet instead of our hands. It was a really fun time. I could never tell all our funny stories; it would take ages. But I can say that laughter is a huge part of our daily lives. I'm very lucky to have such great friends that laughter is so common for us. Not many people are fortunate enough to have this kind of experience. A little laughter can have a big impact. So, the next time you see someone who could use a laugh, talk to them, be their friend, and make them smile. You'll see that it's rewarding.
480	21310	8	2	I firmly believe that laughter and joy are essential for bringing families and friends closer. Being in the company of those who can make us laugh is truly precious. Sometimes, just sitting around sharing old stories or playing board games can leave us with aching stomachs from laughing so hard. These days, many people are so caught up in their busy lives that they forget to take a moment to laugh. I feel sorry for them because they're missing out on the joy and connection they could have with others. Family vacations in my family are always chaotic but always turn into memorable experiences. Every winter, our family goes to @ORGANIZATION1 and stays in our cabin. A long weekend filled with delicious food, mountain trips, snowball fights, and family games is the perfect setting for laughter. Every year, we bring big family games like @LOCATION2, @CAPS1, and @LOCATION1. My family members and I are very competitive, and the noise level in the room where we play can get extremely high. The whole house is filled with laughter and funny arguments like “How can that be a picture of a sock!” or “That's not fair; you know the real definition!” I cherish these moments because they create memories that last a lifetime. Laughter is a part of happiness, and happiness should be a part of life. Spending time with those who make us laugh is time well - spent. Wiser people than me say that “life is short,” and I'm starting to realize how true that is. If life is short, we should spend it in the best way possible, surrounded by moments of laughter.
481	21312	8	2	My boyfriend and I planned to attend the @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 fair in @LOCATION1, OR. He asked my mom for permission, and surprisingly, she agreed. I was extremely excited as it would be our first @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 together. We joked about the possibility of falling off a ride, though we knew it was unlikely. The day before the fair, I prepared all my things. I was both excited and nervous since I had never been on such rides before, and I probably didn't fall asleep until @NUM4 in the @TIME1. On @DATE1, I didn't want to go to school, so my mom let me go to the fair instead. I woke up laughing, imagining all the fun we'd have. I got ready, and around @TIME3, my boyfriend @PERSON1, his brother, and his sister came to pick me and my friend up. We drove to the @CAPS9 station, parked, and paid for our bus fare. Once on the @CAPS9, we took pictures and made jokes, filling the bus with laughter. I'm sure the other passengers thought we were crazy. It took about @NUM6 minutes to reach the fair. When we got off the @CAPS9, we ran to the gates for tickets, but it wasn't @NUM7 yet, so we had to wait @NUM8 minutes. After the gates opened, we bought a card with tokens and got on a spider ride. At first, it didn't seem scary, but it moved so fast that I slid around. @PERSON1 and his brother laughed at me and my friend @ORGANIZATION2 as we yelled, but soon I started laughing too. After that ride, we didn't get on any for a while. Then we saw the @ORGANIZATION3 wheel and decided to try it. It was fun but moved a lot, reminding me of our earlier joke. I held the pole at first, but when @PERSON1 and the others laughed and made funny faces, I let go and joined in the laughter. After the ride, we went to a tent at the fair to eat. We bought big bean and cheese burritos, @ORGANIZATION1, churros, and an elephant ear. It was delicious, and we wanted more, but we didn't have enough money. So we bought another elephant ear, and I was the only one who finished it. My friends joked that I could eat an entire elephant, and we all laughed. After eating, we walked around the fair. There was a tent that spray - painted names on shirts or sweaters, but we didn't have enough money. We decided to focus on the rides and buy a sweater if we had money left. We passed a photo booth where you could get a picture dressed as a pilgrim, and it made us laugh. We got on the last four rides, and at about @TIME2, we had to leave. While waiting for the @CAPS9, we saw two security guys on horses, which seemed strange and made us laugh. We got on the @CAPS9, took some pictures, and went home.
482	21315	8	2	"Laughter is a significant manifestation of human emotions. Different emotions are associated with distinct physical expressions. Furrowed brows can indicate displeasure, anger, or confusion, while laughter predominantly represents happiness. Although emotions are subjective aspects of human nature, laughter serves as a means to translate the emotion of happiness into a physiological expression that humans can understand. Laughter is a crucial element in relationship - building for three main reasons. Firstly, unlike emotions such as jealousy, fury, or sorrow, happiness, which is closely linked to laughter, does not drive people apart. Jealousy, fury, and sorrow can cause discontentment to the point of physically and emotionally separating individuals, whereas happiness and the laughter it brings tend to bring people together. Secondly, laughter is a universal action. It provides humans with a point of equality, as the ability to laugh is a shared quality among all humans, even infants. Sharing a laugh can establish commonalities between people, whether it's a sense of humor, similar experiences, or a shared surprise. This shared laughter can initiate new relationships and also strengthen existing ones. When people share common experiences that make them laugh, it symbolizes a relationship in itself. Finally, laughter helps break down personal barriers. Building relationships requires trust, and laughter can create a sense of kinship and camaraderie. It can reduce suspicion and anxiety, allowing people to connect on a deeper emotional level. By sharing a laugh, humans can establish a sense of trust and reliability, bringing them closer together. In conclusion, laughter ""personifies"" the similarities among humans. It is remarkable that through the simple yet complex act of sharing a laugh, people can perceive qualities such as reliability and trustworthiness. Laughter enables humans to form emotional connections and take social interactions to an emotional level. It is truly the essence of human relationships worldwide, being both a universal language and the shortest distance between two people."
483	21318	8	2	Laughter plays a vital role in relationships. Some relationships without much laughter don't end well, while others do. I once had a relationship where we didn't laugh much, and it ended quickly. However, I've now found an amazing girl, and our relationship is filled with laughter. We can laugh at each other and try to make each other happy by making one another laugh. My friends and I also share a lot of laughter. We laugh at each other when we do silly things. Sometimes, we even encourage each other to do dumb things when we're bored or don't have girlfriends. When my friends, their girlfriends, my girlfriend, and I get together, someone might say something silly, and we'll start laughing hard, sometimes not even knowing why. Laughter is one of the best things in any relationship as it brings happiness into our lives. So, I encourage everyone to find ways to add more laughter to their lives. Thank you for reading.
484	21319	8	2	"The snow sparkled in the sunlight like sequins. @CAPS1 and I rushed to her bedroom window to have a better view. The ground was covered in a blanket of white. We quickly put on our air - restricting snowsuits. When @CAPS1 opened the wooden front door, the cold air stung my nose. Then we rushed out into what felt like a paradise for @NUM1 graders. In the past few months, both @CAPS1 and I had gone through tough times. I was still reeling from the recent death of my muscular brown horse, which was struck by a bolt of lightning and thunder. @CAPS1 had just learned that her parents were getting a divorce. As best friends, we had shed many tears that year, but all our troubles were forgotten when our legs hit the cold, wet snow. We panicked and raced to her garage to find sleds. As we ran through the house to the back door, @CAPS1's short, tan mom stopped us. She refused to let us go outside until we ate breakfast. We quickly ate a bowl of the delicious @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and gulped down a glass of juice. Then we flew out the back door with our sleds. There, a giant hill awaited us. It sloped downward at a perfect @NUM2 - degree angle with only a few turns. The wood piles and thorny blackberry bushes along the sledding course seemed to taunt us. As I looked down the snow - covered path, I heard @CAPS1 yell, ""@CAPS5!"" I saw her speeding down the slope. I grabbed my red racer sled and chased after her. I approached my first turn, which hooked left like the start of a figure - eight. I smoothly glided around the corner and caught a glimpse of the woodpile on my right. Looking up, I saw the old pond at the bottom of the hill. The sun shone through the trees around it, creating a beautiful sight like moonlight on ice. Confidently, I approached my second turn. I spun around it sharply. I saw @CAPS1's bright blue sled reaching the finish line. Then I saw her neighbor's bay horse, and all my happiness faded. Lost in thoughts about @LOCATION1, I lost focus. My shoulders hit the snow as if it were concrete. My legs got tangled, and I felt my head pounding. The sled left me, and I tumbled down the hill like an avalanche. Eventually, a blackberry bush stopped me, and its thorns stabbed my neck. I carefully removed the thorns and walked to the bottom of the hill. By the time I reached the bottom, @CAPS1 was laughing so hard she could barely breathe. Her head was in the snow, and her abs were bouncing with laughter. She looked up at me, and her bright green eyes and pink cheeks showed how silly I looked. Then a giant snot bubble burst out of her nostril, and we both cracked up. I buried my head in the snow. When we finally calmed down, we looked at each other. Our mascara was smeared, and we looked like clowns or raccoons. Our laughter started again but soon died down. We stood up, spotted my red sled by the frozen pond, and decided to go get it. On that day, as I came crashing down the hill and @CAPS1 had her snot - bubble moment, we forgot all our troubles. It was the first time in months that we felt at ease. Laughter is the strongest bond between us. On snow days now, we laugh to remember that cold @DATE2 day, but on that @DATE1 day, we laughed to forget."
485	21321	8	2	My friends and I have an unbreakable relationship, and laughter is a key part of it. Without laughter, we might end up at odds with each other. One particular event that started out seriously but ended up being hilarious is worth sharing. The story begins at @TIME1 when I arrived at school for a five - hour bus ride to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for a wrestling tournament the next day. I slept for @TIME1 hours before being woken up by my coach yelling at someone for spilling soda on the bus. Since we were almost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I turned on my @CAPS5 and listened to music for the rest of the journey. When we reached our @CAPS13, we were told to work off some weight before dinner. After working out, I was with my best friends, @CAPS6 and @CAPS7, all with big appetites. We passed many fast - food restaurants but wanted a @ORGANIZATION1 instead. We had heard there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS8 place in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, so we set off to find it. We walked about two miles along a highway and took some alleys thinking they were shortcuts. I thought we should go back and search around the @CAPS13, but we kept going. Soon, we found ourselves in an unknown part of town. People stared at us, and we tried to make jokes to lighten the mood as we realized we were lost. Stupidly, we had left our cell phones at the @CAPS13, so we had no way to call for help. We started walking back the way we thought we came, but everything looked unfamiliar. We were scared but tried not to panic. Guessing it was about nine - thirty and knowing we had to be back by ten, we panicked even more, imagining our coach's anger and the punishment. We ran frantically down streets and alleys. After about ten minutes, we regrouped and continued walking. Our fear was now obvious on our faces. We came across a digital billboard that showed the time and temperature. We only had ten minutes to get back to the @CAPS13. We started running again, praying to make it on time. We found ourselves at the side of a big @CAPS13. Since we didn't know the name of our @CAPS13, we asked the lady at the front counter. She said we were at the @CAPS13 @NUM1, but she was new and didn't know where our place was. As we thanked her and walked out, we were shocked to see our coach, red - faced and pointing at his watch. We were only @TIME1 minutes late. After being yelled at for twenty minutes, we were sent to our room. As I was about to go to bed, I looked out the window and saw the @ORGANIZATION1 we had been searching for. My friends and I burst into hysterical laughter. We had gotten lost looking for it, and it was right there. We hardly slept that night because of the ironic laughter and the memory of the event. Even now, it still makes me laugh.
486	21322	8	2	On a day around @DATE2 in @DATE1, I went quad - riding with two friends. They were teaching me to do a wheelie on a quad. I quickly learned that I needed to shift all my weight to the back and floor the gas to pop the front end up, and I was doing fairly well. As we were about to head back to the house, one friend thought it'd be cool to take a picture of someone on the front while the driver did a wheelie. So, one of us sat on the front, one on the back, and one drove. The driver pulled back and floored the quad (the extra weight on the back made slamming the back unnecessary). The front end popped up, the person on the back jumped off to take a picture, and the driver was supposed to brake. I was the one on the front. The driver either pulled back too hard or floored it for too long. The front end stayed up for about five seconds, then the quad started leaning back. My friend jumped off and tried to hold it so I could jump, but I panicked and froze. The whole @NUM1 - lb quad came down on me, slamming me into the ground. It made my shins hit my face, hyper - extended my back so much that I was lucky not to break it. It felt like my legs sprung the quad off, but it was actually my friend. I lay there laughing in pain for @NUM2 minutes. After screaming and yelling in agony, I got up and they drove me back to the house. At the house, they gave me an ice pack and told me to sit on the couch. I couldn't bend my back, so I had to turn and fall onto it. The pain in my back got unbearable, so I lay on the floor and it felt better, so I slept there until morning. The next day, I woke up in severe pain. It took me two minutes to get up. I called my parents, and my dad picked me up. I told my parents the story, and my mom took me to the doctor. The doctor said I just had to wait for my back to heal, and then I went home.
487	21323	8	2	Most people acknowledge that laughter is crucial for both physical and social well - being. In a socially tense setting, it's difficult to meet expectations, but introducing laughter can transform the environment and enable us to achieve our goals. I entered the conference room for the first time after @PERSON1 left. @PERSON1 was the adviser for @ORGANIZATION1, also known as @ORGANIZATION2. She empowered students from schools in @LOCATION1 to have a say in @ORGANIZATION1's matters, making her a hero to many high - schoolers. When her tenure ended, she found a replacement, @PERSON2. I'm open to change, but the other members weren't. The room felt less homely when I sat down, and I felt uneasy. I knew nothing about @PERSON2, except that she wasn't @PERSON1 and didn't make the @ORGANIZATION2 members happy. @PERSON2 entered the room with a warm demeanor. She stood at the front and smiled, but the other members sank deeper into their chairs as if protesting. I thought she had little chance, but I sat up straight and listened. She spoke cheerfully and giggled after each sentence. Her posture exuded confidence, but her giggle made me nervous. We needed to see @PERSON2 as a friend to achieve our goals. I started a name - game to lighten the mood. It helped @PERSON2 remember our names and made her more relaxed. As the meeting got more serious, I proposed ending it for the week and just chatting and laughing. Everyone smiled, and the stress in the room gradually dissipated until the whole room was filled with laughter. It was as if @PERSON1 had never left. At the end of the meeting, @PERSON2 told me she was nervous before because she wasn't sure how things would go. She was grateful for my efforts to brighten the members' spirits. This led to the acceptance of the change and the effectiveness of @ORGANIZATION2. By the next meeting, the members were eager to learn more about @PERSON2 and could focus on the tasks at hand. Laughter allowed the @ORGANIZATION2 members to accept what they couldn't control and contributed to our success. It's the key to social success. That one - time laughter made the members more welcoming of @PERSON2 and forged a long - lasting friendship between her and the members. My relationship with @PERSON2 wouldn't be as strong if I hadn't laughed at her first @ORGANIZATION2 meeting.
488	21324	8	2	"In a mother - daughter relationship, laughter is essential. It helps build a strong connection with someone so close. Laughter in general is important as it shows how we express ourselves and reveals our character. During the @DATE1 of my eighth - grade year, when I was @NUM1 or @NUM2, my family and family friends went on a camping trip. The day before leaving, my mother, brother, and I went to set up camp. When we reached the campground, we quickly started organizing. It was fun, but it got dark fast, so we worked faster until everything was set up. On our way out, we realized we forgot something in the truck. My mom stopped and asked if I wanted to drive. I was excited and jumped to the driver's seat. My mom gave me instructions like buckling the seat belt, adjusting the steering wheel, mirrors, and the seat. The vehicle was a stick - shift, and I was extremely nervous as I didn't know how to shift. I'd watched my mom and step - dad shift and made humming noises, but that didn't help. I had to start the truck. I put the clutch in and made sure it was in neutral. I started it, feeling cool like an average @NUM1 - year - old. The moving part was the worst. I stalled the truck about @NUM4 times before it moved at a constant speed. My mom said, ""The fifteenth time is a charm,"" but it wasn't funny. I gave a nervous laugh. I started the truck again and moved slowly. As we neared the campground, I took a left at the sign. My mom told me to park near the tent. In my inexperience, I hit the gas instead of the brake, and the speed went from @NUM4 to @NUM9 mph in seconds. My brother was yelling in the back, and my mom grabbed the steering wheel as we were heading towards the river. Instead, we hit a picnic table, then another, and landed on a third, about @NUM10 feet off the ground. We got out of the truck and stared at the mess for @NUM11 minutes before bursting into laughter. We saw the family across the river laughing at us. My mom invited them over for a fire later."
489	21325	8	2	On a cool @DATE1 night, not too cold like the muggy @DATE2 nights, I walked up the path to my friend's house. The air felt nice on my skin. I knew the stars were in the sky, but I didn't notice them. I knew my two best friends were inside, and there was a chance they were angry with me. When I left school that day, I had a gut feeling that something was off. As I walked home, my stomach churned, and when I looked back, they were staring at me with unreadable expressions. My heart thumped nervously, but I pretended everything was fine, telling myself I might be overreacting. I knocked on the white - painted wooden door and stared at the maroon side - paneling. @LOCATION1 answered the door, and I heard @PERSON1 laughing inside. I felt a hollow feeling, knowing I'd missed something. I was filled with a mix of emotions and couldn't think clearly. I gently pushed open @LOCATION1's bedroom door. The turquoise walls and radio music greeted me. @PERSON1 was laughing and dancing but stopped when she saw me. The moment seemed to stretch. I put up my guard, ready to defend my innocence. Then, @PERSON1 hugged me, catching me off - guard but making me feel right because I knew I'd done nothing wrong. @PERSON1 then explained the gut feeling I had on my way home from school. I was being accused of not contributing to a reading project. This accusation appalled me and made me angry. I walked out into the cool night. My friends followed me, calling my name. @PERSON1 ran after me. I screamed and started running, determined to walk home in the dark. @PERSON1 caught up and tried to pull me back, but I resisted. I sat on the curb, and my friends picked me up and carried me towards the house. I tried to hold onto my anger but started laughing. All the tension left me. I looked up at the stars that I'd missed before, and the lingering laughter in the air made me feel that everything would be okay.
490	21327	8	2	In @NUM1 grade, near the end of the school year, I recalled my brother's fire - alarm prank from his middle - school days. He told me he'd done it many times and got away with it. Since it was my last year in middle school, I decided to try it. @NUM2 days before school ended, I took a lighter to the girls' bathroom. I saw a fire alarm on the ceiling, stood on the sink, turned on the lighter, and waved it around the alarm. It went off. I'd told my friend what I was going to do. We all went outside. My friend and I were laughing so hard that people stared at us. We told our close friends, and they laughed too, and even some lower - grade kids heard about it. In the last period, in computer class, the vice - principal came and took me to her office. She asked if I'd set off the fire alarm, and I said no twice. Finally, she asked if I'd noticed people in the stalls, and I said no. She then told me that two people were in there and one had told on me. I got in big trouble. I was put on probation, had to go to the fire department to apologize for wasting their time on school fires, did community service throughout @DATE1, and almost couldn't participate in the @DATE2 promotion. I regret this childish and stupid act, but it remains one of my @NUM3 top - favorite and funniest school memories. It's a true story.
491	21329	8	2	"My story about laughter is a true one about myself. It's about my visit to the doctor. I've always loved playing sports and always will. I've been playing football for around @NUM1 years, and I've never been injured, except during one practice in @NUM2 grade. Our football team conducts a hitting drill called ""truck and trailer"" once a week. In this drill, there are @NUM3 people: two on offense and two on defense. The offensive players try to score, while the defensive ones aim to stop them. I ended up being the ball - carrier, and to make matters worse, the worst player on the team was blocking for me. This kid was useless on the field, only good for sitting on the bench. The two biggest and best hitters were on defense, and I knew it would be bad. All I could do was run fast, so I did. My coach, who is also my dad, hiked the ball, and I took off. Soon, they caught up with me, one going high and the other low, and knocked me off my feet. I hit the ground and stayed down. I heard my teammates screaming and thought it was because I'd been ""cracked,"" but I was wrong. When I sat up, my knee hurt, and it looked like rubber. My leg was bent the wrong way. I'd only seen such a break on TV and YouTube. My dad immediately called @NUM4. The ambulance arrived at the field @NUM5 minutes later. They came onto the field and put me on a stretcher. Our team wasn't the only one using the field; about @NUM5 other teams were practicing at the same time. All eyes were on me, especially my leg. The other teams didn't know what had happened, but they saw a big ice pack on my private area. All my friends thought I'd hurt my man - parts. It was both embarrassing and funny. Even after they found out it was my leg, they still made fun of me, and I had horrible nicknames for a long time. It wasn't fun for me, but my friends thought it was hilarious. Laughter can sometimes come from unexpected and embarrassing situations, but it also shows the light - hearted side of life."
492	21330	8	2	"Being part of a team doesn't always mean that all members are the best of friends. In fact, more often than not, team members may not get along well. This was the case for the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @LOCATION4) @CAPS3 that I am a part of. However, everything changed after our trip to @LOCATION1 for @ORGANIZATION2. It was late at night when twelve members of the @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS3 shuffled into the @LOCATION2 to check - in. Everyone was in their own groups of friends, chatting and anxiously awaiting the start of our eight - day trip. There was a lack of harmony among different groups within the team, although some individuals got along well with everyone while still having their close - knit groups. Emotions were running high that night, with tension from conflicts, nervousness, and excitement all present. When our plane landed in @LOCATION1, everyone was exhausted. Once again, we split into our groups and made our way through the @LOCATION1. As we walked through the @LOCATION2 to the luggage claim, I wondered, ""Why is it that we are a team, but we separate into different groups, and yet everyone notices but nothing changes?"" Pondering this thought, we headed to the rental vehicles, loaded our belongings, and began our day. After a long day of flying and touring downtown @LOCATION1, we finally reached the hotel. As we checked in, everyone quickly separated into their groups to check into their rooms. Later that evening, a few of us close friends went outside to the campfires at the hotel. While sitting there, chatting and laughing, there was a moment of silence. I then asked them about what I'd been thinking at the @LOCATION2, but I received blank stares and a change of subject. The next morning, we had breakfast and set off for the day's touring. The first stop was the @ORGANIZATION1, where our @CAPS3 participated in a team - building activity. At first, it was difficult for everyone, but gradually, we started having fun, laughing, and working together. After the activity, people began to mingle outside their usual groups. Later that day, we had a second team - building activity, and the tension between team members decreased even more. The following day, we had two more such activities. With each activity, we connected more, and there was more laughter. By the time we headed to the @LOCATION2 to fly back to @LOCATION3, there was no more conflict, and everyone was getting along. This trip showed that team - building activities can break down barriers and bring team members closer together."
493	21331	8	2	"I wholeheartedly agree with the saying that ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" In any relationship, whether it's a friendship or something else, sharing laughter is essential. It helps the relationship last and makes both parties happy. Without laughter, building a connection becomes more challenging. I have a best friend named @CAPS1. We became best friends when we discovered that we had the same birthday, which we considered as a sign that we were like twin sisters. Laughter has always been a part of our friendship, and it has strengthened our bond over time. It is clear that laughter plays a crucial role in maintaining and enhancing relationships."
494	21332	8	2	Do you remember those times when you laughed so hard that you couldn't breathe or when you started crying because of laughter? Whenever I start laughing, I'm usually with my best friend, @PERSON1. We even laugh when things aren't really funny. We giggle at everything: memories, the future, or just looking at each other. Since we first met in seventh grade, and now that I'm a freshman, we've never stopped laughing together. She was in my sixth - period class, and we sat next to each other. After a few minutes of talking, we both knew that a great friendship was in the making. And from that moment on, we became best friends. I couldn't ask for a better friend. She's the best. We spent almost all our free time together, and even when we were busy, we still found ways to be together. We camped in my backyard, rode bikes around town, swam with her family, and she went to @LOCATION1 with mine. Our families also did things together. No matter what we did, we always laughed. Growing up can be tough, and @PERSON1 and I were no exception. After a bad day, we'd call each other and talk for hours about the smallest things. We once talked for three hours about what we were going to wear the next day, only hanging up when one of us was told to get off the phone. Even on our worst days, we always managed to laugh. Now, @PERSON1 and I don't go to the same school, but that doesn't stop us from laughing. If you've ever had a friend as close as @PERSON1 is to me, you know how wonderful it is to have that kind of connection. The feeling of never - ending laughter is truly amazing. Laughter has been the foundation of our friendship, and I don't think I could have grown up without her.
495	21333	8	2	"It's truly remarkable how a simple laugh can transform a scene, a mood, or a person's facial expression. It can even make someone burst into laughter out of the blue, simply because it's outrageous or the laugh itself sounds funny. I've experienced all aspects of what I call the ""contagious circle of laughs."" In the past, I've been cheered up by laughing and hearing others laugh. I've also cheered others up by making them laugh, even at their own unfunny jokes. It feels great to laugh, and after a long bout of giggling, I feel refreshed, having expended all that energy just to make a sound. My friends consider me the clown of our group. They think I'm hilarious, even though I don't see myself that way. But for some reason, making them laugh makes me laugh too. I once came up with a joke to cheer up my friend @LOCATION2. It made everyone fall on the floor laughing. The joke is about walking through a store and observing how mothers of different nationalities treat their babies differently. At the end, it describes an African - American mother yelling at her baby, but I can't use the cuss word here. Anyway, my friends still ask me to tell that joke, and they laugh just as hard as the first time. There's always someone in your life whose laugh you're completely obsessed with, simply because you love the way it sounds. I fell in love with my boyfriend's laugh, and that's why he seemed so cute to me. The first time we met, he was teasing his cousin @CAPS1 in a park in @LOCATION1. I was with my friend @PERSON1 in the trailer park where her dad lived. His laugh was so funny that I wanted to scream. Most people who know him hate his laugh and think it's obnoxious, and he even hates it himself. But I was addicted to it. A laugh not only reveals a person's sound but also their personality and character. Laughter is incredibly important in life. It shows so much about a person and helps many people. I love laughing, and the world would be a dull and unhappy place without it. No one wants that, not even Evil @CAPS5, who has his own evil laugh that reflects his character."
496	21334	8	2	My father is an extremely unkind man. He rarely smiles, except when he has a beer or is with friends. On @DATE1, we were at my grandparents' house for a family barbecue when we received a call from my @CAPS3 cousin @PERSON1. She informed us that my @CAPS1 was included in my great - aunt's will. A few days prior, we had gotten news that great - aunt @PERSON2 had passed away. My grandpa assumed he would be in the will, but he wasn't. Two weeks later, my @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and I went to @LOCATION2 for my great - aunt's funeral. Upon reaching @LOCATION2, we drove to the upper peninsula. It transpired that we were going to an island on lake @LOCATION3 called @LOCATION1 island. When we arrived at my @CAPS3 cousin @PERSON1's house, she went through the will with us. My @CAPS1 inherited @NUM1 acres, @NUM2 acres of forest, @NUM3 acres of meadow, and @NUM3 acres with a two - bedroom house, a barn, and a smoke shed.
497	21336	8	2	"When I turned fifteen, I was extremely eager to get my permit. I didn't bother studying, thinking to myself that it couldn't be that difficult. The first time I took the test, I went with my best friend @PERSON1. @PERSON1 had already taken the test once and failed, so she was retaking it. We arrived at the @ORGANIZATION1 at @NUM1 a.m. sharp. I sat there anxiously waiting for my turn. When they called my number, the woman at the @ORGANIZATION1 was very kind. She said, ""All I need is your birth certificate, your social security card, and proof of enrollment."" I handed her the envelope containing all these documents. She approved me to take the test, and I sat at computer number six. I wasn't nervous at all, confident that I would pass. However, when the test started, there were numerous questions about things I didn't know, such as motorcycles, left - turns, and rules regarding animals on the road. I finished the test with @PERCENT1, but I needed @PERCENT2 to pass. I was really disappointed about failing. @PERSON1, on the other hand, passed her test. I was happy for her and congratulated her, but I also felt a bit jealous. My @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 told me, ""It's okay. You'll definitely get it next time!"" But they were wrong. I was supposed to be one of the first in my group of friends to get a permit. I had no idea that all my other friends would get theirs before me. It seemed like every week, one of my friends would pass the test and leave me behind. I was extremely discouraged and sad, feeling like a failure. But I was determined to get my permit no matter how many attempts it took. I went back on @DATE1 to retake the test, but I failed again. In total, I failed five more times. One morning, after another failure, I was very sad because I had to wait another month to take it again. That's when my @CAPS2 started laughing hysterically. I was very confused. She told me, ""Sometimes you just have to relax and accept that you can't always get things right on the first try. Life is about persevering and having fun. If you can't laugh at your mistakes, what's the point?"" I realized she was right, and I stopped being so hard on myself. I laughed hysterically on the way home. I didn't mind failing because I knew I would pass if I just relaxed and studied. The next month, I went back to take the test. I followed all the steps at the @ORGANIZATION1 again. When they called my number, I gave the woman my information and sat down at the computer. This time, I got @PERCENT3! I was ecstatic to have passed. I was mostly surprised that my @CAPS2's advice had worked. On @DATE1, I was driving home from the store with my @CAPS2. Since it was my first day driving, I wasn't very good. She was yelling at me to slow down and hit the brakes as I pulled into the driveway. I accidentally hit the gas instead of the brake and ran into the garage door. Surprisingly, she started laughing, and that made me laugh too. Instead of scolding me, we laughed about the mistake. I think that made a huge difference because if she had yelled at me, I would have been too discouraged to drive again. Now, I've had my permit for four months. I'm a better driver, and I've learned to relax more, laugh more, and not take simple things in life for granted. I also think it has brought me closer to my @CAPS2. So, I guess it's true that ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."
498	21338	8	2	"Approximately @NUM1 years ago, my best friend @LOCATION1 and I were having a sleepover at her house. We were in her mom's room playing with a large exercise ball. We were jumping on it, standing, flipping - trying every possible thing we could think of without falling off. @LOCATION1 attempted a flip onto the ball and said, "" @CAPS1 @CAPS2, watch this cool thing I just did!"" But when she tried to repeat it, she messed up, and the giant ball went flying out from under her. We started laughing uncontrollably. It was so funny that she almost wet her pants. Then, her older sister @PERSON1 came in, and that's when everything started. @PERSON1 was always much bigger than us. When she said she wanted to play a game with us, we decided to join in. She told us to get on the bed and go under the blankets. As soon as we did, the light went out, and the door slammed shut. We weren't sure if she was still in the room, so we remained silent. After a while, the door barely creaked open, and a little light shone through the crack. She was back, this time with supplies. There was silence for about @NUM2 minutes until @LOCATION1 started screaming. When I looked over, @LOCATION1 was being dragged out of the bed by her feet. While I tried to pull her back up, I felt someone grabbing my feet. I ended up where @LOCATION1 was. We kept trying to hide and get back on the bed, but our plan didn't work well, so we eventually gave up. Suddenly, my feet were tied together, followed by my hands and mouth. @PERSON1 kept throwing us around the room and hitting us. She thought it was the funniest thing in the world, especially when we tried to get back on the bed with our hands and feet tied. After an hour of struggling, @LOCATION1 and I had an idea. We thought if we hid in the bathroom, she couldn't reach us, and we could untie each other's bandannas and ropes. But @PERSON1 beat us to it. She threw us into the dark corner of the bathroom. It was silent. I said, ""@LOCATION1, what's that noise?"" She replied, ""@CAPS4, the bath!"" We tried to get out, but as soon as we did, @PERSON1 picked us up and threw us in the bathtub. She laughed the whole time while we were screaming for each other and for help. When we got out of the bathtub, she threw us back on the bed and finally untied our bandannas and ropes. After she turned the light back on, we saw red marks all over our wrists and ankles. @LOCATION1 said, ""@CAPS5! You're crazy. We told you to stop, and you didn't!"" Right after she screamed that, @LOCATION1's @CAPS7 walked in and asked, ""@CAPS8, what's all the yelling about, girls?"" Then, we told the whole story. In the end, @ORGANIZATION1 got in trouble, and we were okay. @LOCATION1 and I learned a valuable lesson: never ""play a game"" with your older sister when she has bandannas and ropes."
499	21339	8	2	On one @DATE1 during @DATE1 break, a @CAPS3, my @CAPS5, and I went fishing on a boat in @LOCATION1. We had been waiting all week to catch some @DATE1 @CAPS4 salmon. On that @DATE3 at @TIME1, we prepared the boat to leave. Since our boat was large, we loaded it with sleeping bags, coolers of food, all the fishing gear we needed for salmon, and a camp stove to cook on the boat. There was also another guy named @PERSON2, whom we call big @PERSON2. He's a very funny man who provided a lot of laughter on the boat. When we arrived at the fishing area, we stopped at a bait shop to buy prawns and spinner blades, which are used to catch salmon. As soon as we reached the boat ramp to launch the boat, my @CAPS5 realized he forgot to get hooks at the shop. We pulled the boat out of the water (fortunately, it was still on the trailer), secured all the stuff in the boat again, and went back to the shop. When we got to the bait shop, the lady we had talked to earlier said we had forgotten to take the hooks we had bought. Somehow, we really did forget. We thanked her and headed back to the river. Finally, we got the boat in the water and went up - river to our fishing spot. It's a popular place with a line of boats called a hog line, and we always managed to get in the middle where the best fishing is. On some days, usually @DATE2, there would be about @NUM1 boats on each side of us, and it got quite chaotic and sometimes funny because some of the people there didn't know how to operate a boat. When we arrived, we prepared our fishing poles and put them in the water. My pole went down, and I hooked a nice, bright @CAPS4. I fought the fish for about fifteen minutes, and my @CAPS5 netted it. It was a keeper fish. After that, my @CAPS5 said it was a small fish. Around dark, we reeled in our poles and put them away neatly in the boat. When it got dark, it was time for bed. The river was quiet with no one else around, so we didn't have to worry about other boats rocking ours while we slept. The next morning, it was cold and windy. Luckily, we had brought a top to protect us from wind - burn because the last time we went, we got wind - burnt so badly that it hurt for about a week. Suddenly, my buddy's pole went down, and he was excited about hooking a fish. After about ten minutes, he realized he had hooked a log that was floating by. My @CAPS5 and I knew it but didn't say anything because it was funny to see him so excited. Then, my @CAPS5's pole went down, and he hooked a fish. I threw out the anchor, and we floated down to net the fish. We now had two fish in the boat, but my buddy was the only one who hadn't caught a fish yet, so we all hoped he would. After a long day on the boat, it was time to head home and get ready for the start of the week. At about two o'clock, my pole tip went down. I handed the pole to my buddy, and he started fighting the fish. He had trouble reeling it in because the drag was tight, but I fixed it. He finally got the fish in the boat. It was his first salmon ever, and he was very happy. Fifteen minutes later, we left to go home. The fishing trip was fun. We caught some fish, had some funny moments, and most importantly, I helped my buddy catch his first salmon.
500	21340	8	2	"Laughter has been a crucial part of my life. My family and I are always laughing, whether it's at a movie or a joke, even if the jokes are about us. The same goes for me and my friends. We laugh at almost everything. I firmly believe that laughter is one of the most important aspects of my life; without it, life would be nearly meaningless. I remember one @DATE2 when my friends and I decided to go camping at a lake for a week. We packed our tents, sleeping bags, and other camping essentials. When we arrived at the lake, it wasn't crowded, so we easily found a camping spot. After unpacking and setting up our tents, we decided to go swimming. One of my friends shouted, ""I'll race you down to the lake!"" He took about five steps, stepped into a small hole that perfectly fit his foot, and fell flat on his face. Everyone started laughing uncontrollably, and it seemed like we couldn't stop. Even the friend who had fallen was laughing when he got up. We spent the rest of the @DATE1 swimming and teasing him about his fall. The best part was that he joked around too. That night, we stayed up eating junk food, hot dogs, and s'mores until we were about to burst. Then, one by one, we all fell asleep. Over the next few days, we did similar things: swam in the lake, went on hikes in the woods, fished a little, and made fun of each other, laughing almost the whole time. On the @DATE1 that we were there, we decided to wake up early and take one last hike to the top of the nearest mountain. The climb to the top went smoothly, and no one got hurt. The only notable thing that happened on the way up was that one of my friends dropped his water bottle and had to chase it halfway down the mountain. We found it funny, but what happened next was even funnier. Before starting our descent, we all"
501	21342	8	2	"At @TIME1, my alarm went off. While it was an ordinary @DATE1 for my friends, it was a significant day for me. I got up, had breakfast, brushed my teeth, packed the last few things into my suitcase, and headed to the airport. It was my first time flying across the ocean, and it was the last day I'd spend with my family in @LOCATION3 for a whole year. The next time I woke up, I'd be in a completely different place, country, and with a new family, somewhere I'd never been before. It would be a fresh start, and my life would never be the same again. I was going to be an exchange student at a high school in @LOCATION1. After changing planes @NUM1 times and traveling for @NUM2 hours, I finally arrived at the airport in @LOCATION2. My host parents were waiting for me, holding a big sign with my name on it. I was overjoyed and excited to have finally arrived, but I was also extremely tired. We then set off for ""home"". My new home was a small green house on a ranch in the high desert of @LOCATION4, @NUM3 minutes outside of town and without public transportation. Due to the high temperatures and dry air, I was exhausted during the first few weeks. It took me about a month to adjust. Before school started, I visited my new high school and met the principal. I also got my schedule and signed up for the soccer team, which had its first meeting on @DATE2. It was great to see the kids who would be in my school and classes. Finally, my first day of high school was approaching. I was excited, but I couldn't hide my nervousness. After a one - hour bus ride to school, I got off and walked into the building. It felt like there were a thousand people in the hallway staring at me, so I quickened my pace. I hoped my first day would start well. When I reached my locker, I pulled out the piece of paper with the combination and tried to open it. Even though I tried @NUM1 times, it wouldn't open. I whispered to myself, ""First, spin it @NUM1 times to the right, go to the first number, then go left and pass the second number once..."" The bell had already rung, and thankfully, a friend from the soccer team stopped by and asked if I needed help. We both burst out laughing, and I was so grateful she helped me. Otherwise, I would have been late for class on my first day. I needed her help a few more times until I finally figured out how to open the locker three days later. Being open - minded, friendly, and having a smile are three crucial aspects of life. Additionally, learning to laugh at my mistakes is also very important. Coming to a new culture, land, and meeting new people has given me a wealth of life experiences. In particular, I've learned to laugh at mistakes and situations instead of getting frustrated. Getting frustrated would have made my time here more difficult and less enjoyable. Laughing makes it easier for me to learn from my mistakes and move forward. My mom once told me to be brave enough to make mistakes, and I don't regret any of the mistakes I've made."
502	21343	8	2	"It was just after @DATE1. He laughed, and it was the first time I'd heard his laugh that day. @PERSON2 and I had just patched up our on - again, off - again relationship. He'd picked me up from my house so we could hang out at his place. He'd seemed upset since he picked me up, which was very unlike him. He was usually the one with a smile or a laugh and a funny story to tell, but not today. He was quiet. We'd been together for about two hours, and he'd barely said a word to me. All I'd gotten was one of those half - hearted smiles that clearly meant ""I'm not in the mood, so stop."" We were watching Despicable Me for about the third time when the yelling started. He was standing against the wall next to his bed when his dad suddenly started shouting. His voice was followed by a softer, higher - pitched voice yelling back. It was @PERSON2's step - mom. They were arguing about cheating, drinking, or staying out late. I couldn't really hear clearly, and I was more focused on @PERSON2 to see his reaction. He stood there for a couple of minutes, just staring straight ahead. He looked like he was about to cry. Then he slumped to the ground, pulled his knees up, crossed his arms over them, and rested his head on his arms. For a second, I thought he was crying. My tough guy, who never took anyone's nonsense, looked utterly hurt and helpless. He looked more helpless than I felt. I didn't know if he'd want to be left alone or if he'd want a hug, so I just sat on his bed, leaning against the wall, looking at him, hoping he'd do something to help me decide how to comfort him. In the living room, his parents were still screaming at each other when another voice joined in. It was his step - mom's friend, @PERSON1. She was trying to stop the fight, but @PERSON2's dad, @PERSON3, was not someone to be interrupted. When he was mad, you had to stay out of his way. @PERSON1 made a mistake. Suddenly, there was a crash. @PERSON2 jumped, and there were sounds of cupboards being slammed and glass breaking. The only thing I could make out was @PERSON2's step - mom saying, ""That was your grandma's. Your mom is gonna be pissed!"" @PERSON2 got up, walked to his door, and locked it. He stood there for a moment with his forehead against the door, then turned and walked over to me. He laid me down and cuddled with me. There was more shouting about food, cars, and getting someone's stuff out of the house. I heard food being thrown, a door slamming, and tires screeching. Finally, it was over. @PERSON3 was leaving too; you could tell from the sound of a big diesel truck driving off. Now we were alone. @PERSON2 finally looked at me. I could tell he was sad and still on the verge of tears. I realized then that the family fighting all week, which was leading to a divorce, was what had been bothering him all day. It wasn't his first experience with divorce either; this was his dad's third wife walking out. I said, ""Honey, that's hell and really scary. Promise we'll never fight like that?"" He smiled and said, ""I promise."" I kissed him on the nose and tried to get up, but he pulled me back down and kissed my nose. I said, ""Babe, I really gotta pee."" That made him laugh, and it was so good to hear his laugh again after such a long and tense day."
503	21344	8	2	"Dog @CAPS1 Of @DATE1 - @CAPS2, my dog and best friend, always made me laugh with her droopy ears and pointy little nose. She brought me happiness every moment we were together, whether she was barking at the squirrels in the backyard or keeping me warm at night. All the crazy things she did put a smile on my face and filled my heart with laughter and joy. Every @DATE1 when we went camping with the @PERSON1 family, we always brought her along. We even brought her her own sleeping bag and camping chair. After a long day of swimming and walking around the lake, she'd hop into her chair and fall asleep by the warm fire. When we walked with the other family's dog, @PERSON2, she'd carry her own leash in her mouth as if I were holding it. Each of her unique actions compared to an average dog made us laugh. We called her ""@CAPS4."" She also loved to ""log."" She'd pull giant logs or sticks in the water and chew on them until there was nothing left. All the grandparents adored her. Grandpa had special cookies just for her because she was picky about cookies. One time, on his birthday, she went to his house wearing a party hat and jumped on his lap to give him a birthday kiss. He laughed so hard that tears came to his eyes. The other grandma always begged to ""dog - sit"" her whenever we went somewhere. She loved @CAPS2 so much that when @CAPS2 was at her place, she got the couch instead of a kennel or a dog bed. She'd take @CAPS2 into town to buy her a cheeseburger and go to the park. I taught her tricks like the @LOCATION1, where she bounced on her hind legs in circles, and I also taught her to ""speak."" When I asked, ""Who's on top of a house?"" she'd answer ""@CAPS10. (@CAPS11)."" When I asked, ""Who was the greatest @CAPS12 player ever?"" she'd reply ""@CAPS10 (@CAPS14 @CAPS15)."" And when I asked, ""How does sandpaper feel?"" she'd say ""@CAPS10."" These responses always made everyone laugh, and we'd spend hours playing and doing tricks in the backyard. We took her on what we called ""@CAPS3 @CAPS1"" trips to the river for swimming and fishing and to the coast to play on the beach. She loved going everywhere with us. She was also the only dog at the park that knew how to slide, which amazed everyone. She brought laughter and smiles to so many people. She was my best friend and the smartest dog I've ever known. Whether we were going to the park, camping, swimming, or just being lazy, she always made me laugh. Although she's gone now, her memory will always stay with me, and she will never be forgotten."
504	21345	8	2	"Laughter holds a significant place in human life. Among the many things that bring happiness, nothing compares to the joy of a good laugh. Each year, my family gets together on Thanksgiving, and it's one of my favorite times. When my uncle shows up, he has a unique ability to make everyone laugh until they're in tears. He understands human nature and knows that a simple smile and a hearty laugh can transform a bad day into a wonderful one. Family is a precious gift, and when we're all together, the time is already sweet. Add laughter and smiles to the mix, and you have a truly great time. My uncle has an endless supply of jokes and corny lines. What makes them so funny is not just the content but the perfect timing. I aspire to learn from him and use his people - skills to help others have a better day. By sharing a laugh and putting a smile on someone's face, not only do we make them feel good, but we also feel better knowing we've made a positive impact. This simple act can have a domino effect, as the person we've helped may pass on the kindness and make someone else's day better. Most friendships and relationships begin with laughter. Sometimes, all it takes is the confidence to break the ice with a joke to start a long - lasting friendship. When I met my best friend, who is like a brother to me, it all began with a joke that brought smiles and an unforgettable laugh to both of us. From that day on, we've been inseparable. Laughter is essential for keeping our spirits high, regardless of the circumstances. Even in the military, where soldiers face a hostile environment, they still find time to sit together, share a drink, and have a good laugh. It's in our nature to enjoy life, so we should not avoid social interaction or the opportunity to laugh. On a bad day, the best thing to do is to be with friends. Those who truly care about us will find ways to make us laugh, which can turn our day around. Just thinking about a funny moment with a friend can bring a smile or a laugh, and sometimes both. Laughter can transform negativity into positivity. At a party, we don't sit in the corner but get up and have a great time with friends, ending up sharing a laugh. I firmly believe that laughter is not only the key to life but also the key to understanding a person. It reveals their true self because no one can hide the desire to laugh at something funny. Laughter comes from the heart and soul, and it has the power to lift our spirits and bring people closer together. As the saying goes, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" So, let's embrace laughter and spread joy every day."
505	21346	8	2	A while ago, when I was about @NUM1 years old, I moved to @LOCATION1. After @NUM2 weeks, my parents started going to church. At church, I saw a kid about my age. He had a deck of Yu - Gi - Oh cards in his hand. I really wanted to ask him if he wanted to play Yu - Gi - Oh, but I was too nervous. After church ended, my parents and I went home, and the day passed. The next morning, I got ready for my first day at school in @LOCATION1. It was a bit tough going to a new school without any friends. But when I got there, I was surprised to see the same kid from church. After the teacher told me to sit down, roll call started. When it was the other kid's turn, I learned his name was @PERSON1. Class went by quickly as we were busy with schoolwork. At lunchtime, many students in my class were nice to me and asked if I wanted to be their friend. I was happy, but @PERSON1 didn't ask. I thought he might be mad at me. After school, before I got on the bus to go home, I saw @PERSON1 again. I ran up to him and asked if he liked playing Yu - Gi - Oh. He
506	21347	8	2	"On @DATE1, it was a beautiful day with happy faces everywhere, a perfect day to be at the fair. I was sitting on a bench next to @PERSON1, a guy I really liked, though I doubted he liked me. I'd caught him staring at me a few times and thought I had something on my face, maybe a piece of food since we'd just eaten a couple of minutes before. I looked at him and asked ""@CAPS1?"" He replied ""@CAPS2"" with a huge smile. I demanded, ""@CAPS3 tell me @CAPS1 @CAPS14 funny,"" and threw a smile back at him. He paused and then @PERSON1 asked, ""@CAPS5 can i ask @CAPS13 out?"" I felt my face flush, my body heat up, and my leg start to move uncontrollably. I thought, ""@CAPS6 can't know I have strong feelings for him."" I tried to convince myself he was joking.  @CAPS6 asked, ""@CAPS8 @PERSON2? are @CAPS13 okay?"" as he put his hand on my lap. I said, ""@CAPS9 I'm fine, its just.."" and paused for a long time. He said, ""@CAPS10 @CAPS13 say @CAPS3 I @CAPS17 understand"" as his head slowly faced the ground. I was at a loss for words. Nervously, I laughed and said, ""@CAPS11 don't mess with me like that, I know your joking @PERSON1."" @PERSON1 looked at me with a confused face. His smile turned serious and the glow in his eyes vanished. I felt words stuck in my throat. I finally said, ""@CAPS13 can ask me out any time and my answer @CAPS17 always be @CAPS9"" and felt relieved. He asked, ""@CAPS14 does that make @CAPS13 my girlfriend @PERSON2?"" I replied with a grin, ""I don't know @PERSON1..@CAPS13 have not asked me out yet."" We looked at each other and burst out laughing. I didn't fully understand why we were laughing, and neither probably did he, but it didn't stop us. I got a stomach cramp from laughing so hard and had to stop.  @PERSON1 took my hand and we walked towards the roller coaster. In my head, I imagined him proposing to be my girlfriend in a romantic movie - like scene, but I realized I was in reality. We went on the roller coaster and a few other rides, and I felt like throwing up. Standing in the ticket line, I felt an overwhelming joy, as if I were the happiest person in the world. Nothing bothered me that day. The sun hid behind the clouds and the day darkened. I wished the day hadn't ended so soon because I'd had so much fun. It felt like time had flown by.  It was time to go home. People leaving the fair looked exhausted and couldn't even smile. @PERSON1 and I walked towards the car. He seemed worried. I asked, ""@CAPS15 wrong @PERSON1."" He said, ""I haven't officially asked @CAPS13 out."" I replied, ""@CAPS16 ask me I'm ready."" He stopped me and asked, ""@CAPS17 @CAPS13 be my girlfriend @PERSON2..Again?"" I stuttered, ""uhhhh..I mean @CAPS9 of course @CAPS7 be your girlfriend."" He started to giggle, and I joined in, even though I wasn't sure what was so funny. We got in the car and drove home. The quiet on the way was somehow worth it."
507	21348	8	2	"In our lives, there are special people we'd never want to hurt, whether they're close friends, significant others, or family members. These important people help us through tough times, lift us up when we're down, and stand by us. Friends are among the most crucial people in our lives. They're the ones we can talk to and who understand us. We share everything with them, from clothes to food. They make our days brighter with their presence.  High school is full of drama. I'm fortunate to have a great group of friends. We're very close, spending a lot of time together both at school and outside of it. They're always there for me when I need them most.  Recently, @PERSON1 and I have been trying to work on our relationship. However, he's been lying to me and cheating on me. All my friends who know about the situation tell me the same thing: ""he is going to hurt you"" and ""he's not worth your tears."" I have class with him every other day, and I can't choose when to see him. Some days are better than others.  After lunch, the bell rang. I wasn't eager to go to the band room. The band room is large, has an unpleasant smell like old cheese, and the sound bounces around like in a trampoline, hitting you in the face. I really don't like that class. I walked in casually, put my books on my chair, and went to my cubby. I grabbed my instrument, set it on my chair, and then talked to some friends. It had been an ordinary school day until then.  When I entered the band room, I felt that @DATE1 was different. @PERSON1 walked in with a big smile, but I couldn't help looking away and frowning. I had mixed emotions about him. He does things that make me love him, and other things that drive me crazy. He sits behind me in band, and we often talk without getting in trouble, except on @DATE1 when we were supposedly talking too much. I didn't think we were talking too much because on that day, I wanted nothing to do with him. We were both upset with each other.  Twenty - five minutes passed, and all I could think about was him and what I'd heard he was doing. It's a terrible feeling when you know something's wrong. I confronted him about what people were saying. His response was ""don't believe what you hear, believe what you see."" I was confused, and tears started streaming down my face. I asked my teacher if I could go out in the hall, and she agreed. I sat there crying. One of my friends came out and sat with me. She comforted me, and we talked. I told her everything. She hugged me and made jokes about him, which made me laugh. I even made some remarks that made her laugh. After a few jokes and hugs, the tears stopped, and I was smiling.  Neither of us wanted to go back to class, but we had no choice. Although we weren't extremely close before, that talk made our friendship stronger. In difficult times, we should rely on our friends for the truth and advice because they're usually right. Laughter is more than just an emotion. It gives us strength when we're weak, builds us up when we're down, and brings people closer. It helps create memories that we'll cherish forever. We all need to take time to laugh and relax."
508	21350	8	2	"In my opinion, laughter is the only always - positive expression. My dad says laughter is the reason for his six - pack as it works your muscles. Humor is very important in a relationship. If someone doesn't have a sense of humor, they're almost inhumane.  In my family, I'm always in a laughing mood. Laughter is positive, and happiness follows in life. When I have a problem, I think of something funny, and a laugh always makes me feel better.  My dad and I don't always get along, but when we laugh, everything else fades away, and it sets a great mood. If I don't laugh around him, he'll ask, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS5 got a sore sense of humor?"" If someone doesn't laugh at something funny with me, they seem like an outsider. Laughter is positive, and positive energy is good.  I laugh a lot, often out loud. Without laughter, I wouldn't have the relationships I have today. Some people say laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and I completely agree. Without laughter, I'd be more negative, get disciplined more, and be more distant from my dad.  As I grow older, I laugh less. My dad notices the change, and we've grown further apart, which is normal for teenagers. My dad is very funny, and I wouldn't trade the world for the humorous relationship we've had.  Laughter is everywhere. I see people laughing on their cell phones while walking down the street. There's a phrase, ""@CAPS3 all the way to the bank."" I'd laugh too if I were rich. But being rich isn't everything. If a person isn't happy and laughing in life, money means nothing. I could be poor and laughing and still be happy. If someone isn't happy, all their possessions and hard work are meaningless.  Laughter brings people together, and there's no doubt about it. I've met many people just by laughing. You'll be surprised what you can achieve by smiling or finding something funny and laughing.  I have a very humorous dad, and I wouldn't change that. I believe everything happens for a reason, and everyone deserves to have a good laugh and be happy. Since not everyone is happy, we should go out of our way to make someone laugh. We never know what a laugh can bring until we try. Laughter is a powerful element in relationships and can reveal a lot about a person's personality."
509	21351	8	2	Have you ever seen the phrase @CAPS1, @CAPS2, Laughter? Have you ever wondered what it means? I think it can have different meanings for different people. Some take it negatively, while others take it positively. I believe those @NUM1 words are the key to a perfect life. A perfect life isn't about having the best car, the most expensive clothes, or the best looks.  Let me tell you why laughter is crucial in any relationship. I'm @NUM2 years old now. I met the person who always makes me laugh when I was @NUM3. He's a tall, brown - skinned male. He's @NUM4 years old now but was @NUM2 when we met. We met at school. He always made me laugh. Once, I was very upset because of home issues, and being with him helped me forget my troubles. He's an honest person and can turn any situation, even embarrassing ones, into a joke. He made me stop feeling embarrassed about things that happened to either of us. I love that I can be myself with him. He was like the uphill on a rocky roller - coaster.  @NUM1 years have passed. I'm now married to that best friend, and we have two beautiful twin daughters. I enjoy my life to the fullest because he makes me happy. Instead of arguing, we laugh, and life is better that way. His sense of humor not only makes me laugh but also makes him a great person, and others feel good around him.  Laughter is not only important in a male - female relationship but also in a female - female relationship. I have a best friend who's not only honest and kind but also funny. We can laugh at the simplest things, and most people @MONTH1 think we're crazy, but it's just the sound of a happy life.  I believe a life without laughter is like a straight, boring, and long road, while a life with laughter is like a curvy road full of surprises. My mother and I have a strong relationship. We do many things together, but what I enjoy most are the laughs we share. Sometimes, a situation that seems bad at the moment becomes funny when we look back on it later. It's always better to laugh with someone dear to you.  I love laughing at memories with anyone because those memories will stay with us, and eventually, we'll laugh at them. So, when something embarrassing happens, look back on it a year later, and you'll probably laugh or at least smile.
510	21352	8	2	When I was @NUM1 years old, I lived on a farm outside of @LOCATION1 OR. I spent most of my time playing with my brothers, @PERSON1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. We did everything together, from catching frogs to eating bugs.  We'd just moved to a new house, and my dad had a lot of work to make it a safe and fun place. His first task was to build a pull @CAPS3, a building on top of the garage. He started by pouring cement on the freshly bulldozed land. He made square holes in the cement to insert poles to support the @CAPS3. Then he began constructing the main building on top of the garage. I was extremely excited to watch my dad build the @CAPS3 with his bare hands.  Once the inside was safe, I was allowed in. I was amazed by its beauty and perfect construction. But there was still more to do. My dad and my oldest brother @PERSON2 were putting shingles on to keep the rain and other elements out.  The next day, I woke up to their excited hooting and hollering. They'd just finished the pull @CAPS3. I jumped out of bed like a cat shot by an air - soft gun and ran downstairs to meet them. When they came in, they were soaked in sweat, looking as if they'd fallen in a pond.  Right away, my brothers and I rushed to the brand - new @CAPS2 @CAPS3. When we entered, we felt a strange sensation on our feet, like something cold and wet. Then we realized we'd run on the freshly painted floor. We looked at each other and tried to figure out how to get back with the least mess. We walked backwards in our previous footprints.  When we reached the stairs, we
511	21354	8	2	I woke up at @NUM1 due to a call from my cousin. He said he wanted to hang out and introduce me to a cousin I'd never met. After hanging up, I rushed into the shower and got ready as quickly as possible. When they arrived at my house, I dashed to the door and opened it rapidly, expecting some reaction from my new cousin. However, the reaction I got was unexpected. As soon as I opened the door, he started laughing at me for a couple of minutes. I got a bit angry as I didn't know what he was laughing at. Then I looked down and realized I was not wearing pants. I hurried back to my room, put on some shorts, and returned to the living room. They were still on the couch, laughing at my foolish mistake. I sat down on the opposite couch and asked what they were laughing about, claiming I did it on purpose as a joke. They didn't believe me, and I don't blame them because it was a silly thing to say in that situation. After they stopped laughing, my cousin asked if that was the only such thing I'd done. I replied no, and he started sharing stories of his own dumb actions. For half the day, our only topic was recounting embarrassing, dumb stories about ourselves. It turned out that this silly mistake made it easy for us to get along. Since that day, we've had a good relationship. In the end, I'm glad it happened because it brought us closer, and now we can laugh at each other's stupid actions. That's my story where laughter played a role in my relationship with my cousin.
512	21355	8	2	It was @NUM1 pm at night. I was watching @CAPS1.V when my dad said he was going to the store. I wanted to go with him, but my mom said no because he'd be back soon as he was only getting a few things. My dad said it was okay, so I went with him. On the way, we saw a man on his bike. He seemed to have little control and looked like he was about to crash into a pole. We passed by him and looked back; the man was on the ground. It was funny, and my dad and I laughed, but then we stopped and helped him. At the store, my dad and I went separate ways. I went to the candy area, and he went the other way. After looking at the candies, I went to find my dad. I couldn't find him in the store, so I went outside. The car wasn't there. I thought he'd gone to another store, but he wasn't there either. I went back to the store one more time, but he was gone. So I started walking home. While walking, a car pulled over and offered me a ride. I declined, and they insisted, but I said I lived in the next block. They left, and I kept walking. Suddenly, I heard a noise behind me. I turned back and saw a tall, black shadow. I got scared, thinking I'd be robbed. I walked faster and then started running. When I looked back, the shadow was far behind. A car passed me, and it was my dad. I tried calling him, but he couldn't hear me. He was getting away, so I threw a rock at the car. He stopped immediately, and I ran to it. My dad saw me and said he'd forgotten he'd taken me with him. At the end, we both laughed. We didn't tell my mom because she'd be mad at my dad.
513	21356	8	2	"Laughter has always been highly regarded. It's impossible to imagine life without it. For me, laughter is one of the best things in the world. I want to share a story where laughter played a significant role. It all began on @DATE1 in @DATE2. At that time, I was living in @LOCATION2 and trying to get a scholarship to go to @LOCATION2 as an exchange student for one @DATE1. To achieve this, I had to pass numerous tests, write countless essays, and complete all the paperwork. One of the requirements was to talk to a group of other participants and two @CAPS1 for about an hour so that the selection committee could assess our communication skills. Imagine speaking a foreign language with people you've never met, especially when only one person from the group will go to @LOCATION1. Everyone would try to be the best and hardly let others speak. I still hoped for the best. I remember that day vividly, as if it were yesterday. It was @DATE3 @TIME1 when I entered the large, white building of @ORGANIZATION1 where the competition was held. In the class, two @CAPS1 introduced us. When I saw the other three people, I realized I had reason to worry. We had nothing in common. One girl was all in black, with big black shoes like my grandfather's old army ones, a long black skirt, black ties, a large dark T - shirt, and very dark short straight hair. She looked like part of the darkest night. Another girl was a typical ""barbie girl,"" tall, thin, with long blond hair and all - pink clothes. She was so full of herself, saying she was the best. There was also a boy who was a rap enthusiast, with his entire look from shoes to attitude showing his love for rap. I was dressed in new green pants, a grey top, a black cardigan, a nice grey purse, and black flats. The first ten minutes were awkward. We didn't know what to talk about. The two @CAPS1 gave us a random word, ""jungadzhumba,"" and told us to think about it and perform. The girl in black thought it was stupid. Then, the boy told a joke about it, and it was really funny. We started laughing, and the laughter broke the ice. We talked for over an hour, and it seemed to pass quickly. We talked about everything in the world, in the room, in the restaurant, and on the subway home. That day was important to me because I realized that laughter is the key to everything. Now my favorite phrase is: ""If you don't know what to do, just laugh!"" Laughter will help."
514	21357	8	2	"In my opinion, laughter is an amazing emotion. It makes people feel good, wonderful, happy, secure, and loved. It brings out the best in people. People laugh to show humor and love. I'm a rather depressed person, and my therapist always told me, ""If you don't want wrinkles, smile and laugh it out."" I believe that laughing reveals a person's true self. When people are mad or sad, they don't want to be grumpy all day. They'd want their friends or family to make them laugh so they can get over their troubles and be happy. In life, love and laughter are the most important things. There's no love without laughter and no laughter without love. We need both to get through our days, especially those who've been through a lot, like me. I have family problems and I'm a sophomore, but I still stand tall with a bright smile. I know that if I laugh it out, everything will be fine. It makes me feel safe and needed. I've been through so much that others look up to me. When that happens, I know what to do: make them laugh. There's nothing more beautiful than a person laughing. People often wonder how I can be so strong after all the horrible things I've experienced since middle school. I tell them, ""Laugh it out. It makes you feel better in the end."" You may feel silly after laughing, but you also feel great. You can laugh and move on because that's life. Nothing is perfect; things will go wrong, people come and go. There will be tears and laughter. When it's over, let it go. Laugh and be happy about the memories. Memories last forever, so cherish every moment, laugh, and live life as it is because it's too short to waste time being sad. Laughter is the beauty of a person's voice. Some laughs are high - pitched, some are low; some are loud, some are quiet and giggly. I have a loud laugh. I'm tiny, but my laugh surprises people. Depending on my mood, my laugh changes. Some may find it annoying, but I'm not afraid to laugh. Don't be afraid either. Laugh out loud, and everything will be okay. It takes a lot to make me stop laughing. My teacher in fourth grade once said, ""If you laugh a lot, you'll live a longer life."" I still believe in that quote. Laughter has made me who I am today and has made me a better, stronger person. Laughter is a common sight everywhere, whether in the hall, the mall, or the park. I'm glad people can connect through laughter."
515	21358	8	2	"Laughter, like music and tears, is a universal language that can cross any language barriers to convey a message without words. This was evident when my mom's best friend @PERSON3 came to visit from @LOCATION2. I was eight years old at the time. I'd lived in @LOCATION1 all my life, and hearing other languages was not a common occurrence. When my mom announced that her college roommate @PERSON3 and her family were coming for a few days, I felt nervous about talking to them. However, my mom was encouraging, saying, ""It'll be a learning experience! You'll learn some @CAPS6, and they'll learn some @CAPS7."" It was a cold, stormy @ORGANIZATION2 day when they arrived. As they pulled their blue minivan into our driveway, I felt shy. I only had faint memories of @PERSON3's visit years ago, and I'd never met the rest of her family. But my worry was soon replaced by @PERSON3's warm voice: ""@CAPS11! You've gotten so tall!"" I was hugged by her, and I smelled the familiar scents of chocolate, detergent, and something spicy, as if she'd been cooking. After she greeted my younger sister, I was left standing awkwardly next to her three children. I didn't know what to say as there was a complete language barrier. @PERSON3 was bilingual but didn't speak @CAPS7 around her children. The awkwardness was briefly broken when the adults intervened. @PERSON3 introduced us. Her oldest, @PERSON1, was twelve, tall with dark hair. @CAPS14, who was nine and close to my age, had a quick smile and a mischievous look. The youngest, @PERSON2, was petite for her four - year - old age. I smiled and nodded as each was introduced. As they chattered in @CAPS6, I was amazed at their ability to speak another language. My mom soon led us into the house. She started making dinner, and @PERSON3 joined her in the kitchen. For a while, we kids stayed close to our parents. Then, it became clear that seven people were too many in one kitchen. My mom suggested we show them our rooms and meet our cat @CAPS20. As we reached the living room, @PERSON2 squealed and ran to @CAPS20, who was napping. I was worried she'd startle him, but the cat just got up and yawned. Then, to our surprise, @CAPS20 jumped up and put his hind legs on @PERSON2's chest. She fell into a sitting position, and instead of crying, she burst into a contagious laugh. We all joined in. In that moment, I realized that we didn't need to learn each other's languages; the shared laughter broke the ice and the language barrier. I still remember that visit fondly because it was the first time I realized how similar different cultures can be. Despite the initial difficulty in relating, we became friends, all thanks to a cat, a four - year - old, and the common language of laughter."
516	21360	8	2	One day, my brother and I went to the mall to buy a hat. My brother asked me if he should get a particular hat, and I advised him against it, so he put it back. Subsequently, we went to different stores. While I was about to make a purchase, a store - employee from the previous shop approached me with two police officers. He accused me of stealing a hat, claiming they had it on tape. I firmly denied the accusation. Then he asked about my brother, and I told him where my brother was. One of the cops accompanied him to find my brother, while the other stayed with me during my purchase. I was extremely upset about the false accusation. The cops asked me personal questions, and I requested to talk to my dad. My dad was also angry upon hearing about the baseless accusation. As we were walking back to watch the incident footage, my brother returned with the other cop, saying the video showed him putting the hat back. I was still annoyed that the store - employee had only watched parts of the video. The employee apologized to my dad and me, but I was still mad as I didn't want onlookers to think I was a troublemaker. Looking back, my brother and I laugh about this experience. There's no reason to be angry since we knew we were innocent. Laughter helps us forget the unpleasantness and makes the experience more bearable. Instead of complaining to the manager, I choose to laugh it off.
517	21361	8	2	On a beautiful day, I woke up. The sky was clear and the sun was shining, which was unusual for a day in @DATE1. I got out of bed as usual, had breakfast, went to the bathroom, and brushed my teeth. I left home feeling a bit tired but good. As I walked to the bus - stop, I greeted people passing by. When I reached the bus - stop, there was no one there. I thought the bus might have already come and picked up the kids. I waited for almost fifteen minutes and started to worry. If I missed the bus, I couldn't go to @ORGANIZATION1 as my parents worked until @TIME1 and there was no one to drive me. So, I walked to the next stop, but it was also empty. I was certain the bus had come early and left me behind. When I got home, I checked the @ORGANIZATION1 calendar on the wall, and there was nothing special noted for @DATE3. I wondered how I could have missed the bus as I never do. I considered possible reasons like bad weather or a bus accident, but they didn't seem likely. The more I thought, the more confused I got. Frustrated, I put down my backpack and looked for my daily planner to find @ORGANIZATION1's phone number. I called the school. A woman answered, and when I asked if something was wrong because I didn't see the bus, she was silent at first. When I asked if she was still there, she started laughing. After a long laugh, she said today wasn't @DATE3 but @DATE2. I was shocked. I had wasted so much time trying to figure out what went wrong. Finally, I put down the phone and started laughing at my own mistake.
518	21364	8	2	"Laughter is an integral part of my life. I love to laugh in various situations, and I've heard that the more you laugh, the longer you live. I'm going to share a story about laughter because it holds great significance for me. I laugh the most when I'm with my family and friends. They are always cracking jokes, and there's never been a family gathering or hang - out without laughter. One unforgettable moment was when my sister and I were getting to know our new step - mom, @CAPS1. We were playing a football - scoring game. @CAPS1 wasn't doing well and came up with a plan. When I threw the ball and called out ""@NUM1 points!"", @CAPS1 turned around and pulled down her pants to moon us. We all fell to the ground laughing until our stomachs ached and our eyes watered. This moment brought us closer. I believe laughter strengthens relationships. My boyfriend and I are very close because we laugh a lot. Laughter is a truly universal emotion. The internet, especially YouTube, has made it possible to spread laughter far and wide. I once posted a funny video of my friends and me playing @CAPS5 on YouTube. It was shared among many, and everyone laughed. However, laughter isn't always positive; it can turn into mockery. But I prefer to focus on the good times when I laughed with loved ones. Laughter is part of my daily life, and I hope others can also enjoy it."
519	21365	8	2	"People say ""laughter can cure anything"", and I wholeheartedly believe it. Throughout my sixteen years, many people have made me laugh. There's one particular moment when my best friend @PERSON2's humor really helped me. It was @DATE1, and I was heartbroken because the guy I loved since seventh grade, @PERSON3, didn't want to date me again to avoid ruining our friendship. I tried hard to win him back but nothing worked. I texted @PERSON2 and told her about my situation. @PERSON2 told me I could have any guy in the world and that I must be ""really @CAPS3 sick"" for fixating on @PERSON3. Her words dried my tears and made me smile. At @DATE2, school was out, and I was still trying to win @PERSON3 back. I even asked @PERSON2 to ask @PERSON3 if he still had feelings for me, but he didn't give an answer. When I asked for more advice, @PERSON2 said @PERSON3 was just one guy and there were plenty others for me. Her words made me think, and although she was being serious, I couldn't help but giggle. I still liked @PERSON3 a lot. When I got a text saying @PERSON3 might move to @LOCATION1, I cried. I told @PERSON2 about my plan to ask @PERSON3 to hike @CAPS4 Pisqah with me before he moved and confess my feelings. @PERSON2's comment about me being a ""spitball of @CAPS3 and romance"" made me laugh hysterically. Thankfully, @PERSON3 didn't move. We aren't back together, but our friendship has grown. I'm grateful to @PERSON2 for her humor that helped me through tough times."
520	21366	8	2	"I slowly got up, covered in paint that was dripping from my face, hair, and clothes. I tried to hop on the few clear spots on the floor, but there weren't many. All I could think about was whether I'd make it to high school. I carefully opened the door and called out to my mom, ""Hey mom?"" I was afraid to answer when she responded as I knew I'd messed up really badly. I softly said, ""I've had a paint withdraw from the paint pan."" She was confused and walked up the stairs to see what happened. I closed my eyes in fear. Instead of scolding me, she started laughing uncontrollably. I was extremely confused seeing my mom almost peeing her pants from laughing. Then I realized how ridiculous I must look, covered in paint from head to toe. I started to giggle too. Minutes later, we composed ourselves, and mom went to get paper towels. She came back with paper towels and plastic garbage bags. She said it was good she put the plastic covering down before I started painting. I agreed that it would have been worse if the paint had spilled on the carpet. I gathered the plastic covering, and the garbage - can was very full. After that, my mom asked what caused the paint to spill. I told her I slipped on the ladder while going to paint the edges near the ceiling, omitting the fact that I tripped on my shoelace. My mom laughed again, turning red in the face. I was amazed at her reaction. Eventually, we finished cleaning up. This incident made me realize that my mom will understand and forgive me for my mistakes, no matter how big they are."
521	21367	8	2	"Visiting the school's office was a common occurrence for me during my elementary - school years. Even at that young age, I had developed the habit of feigning illness to go home. This trick had worked a few times, but adults eventually caught on to my act. As a child, I was quite the actor, but my skills seemed to be waning. By then, all the school staff knew me well, making it increasingly difficult for me to find excuses to leave.  I recall being in fourth grade when I ended up in the office, not by choice. In my innocence, I had no idea what was about to happen. My cousin, @PERSON2, and I were in the same classes. When we were kids, we looked so alike that teachers often confused us, thinking we were twins.  One day, my cousin was having trouble with some math problems. Our math teacher, @PERSON1, decided to stay after school for a few minutes to help her. Since we took the same bus, I decided to wait for her so we could go home together. Those few minutes turned into a long time, and by the time @PERSON2 was done, we had missed the bus.  That's when we went to the office. There was that plump, elderly lady who knew me very well. I'll always remember her sitting in a chair in front of the computer, filling out papers. This time, she knew it wasn't one of my ""I - want - to - go - home"" schemes.  ""We missed the bus,"" we told her. She asked why, and we both explained. Meanwhile, she called @PERSON1 to verify our story. When @PERSON1 arrived, the office lady repeated what we had said, but she got our explanations mixed up, making it seem like I was lying.  @PERSON1 believed I was not telling the truth. I tried to explain that the lady was mistaken, and even my cousin tried to defend me, but the office lady was certain of what she thought I'd said. As a child, I felt so ashamed, even though I knew I was telling the truth. Mrs. @PERSON1 gave me a demerit, but deep down, I knew I was honest, and that's what mattered.  As a kid, such situations seem like the end of the world. I was angry because I couldn't do anything about it. But now, looking back, it makes me smile. Back then, I wrongly thought the teacher was mean, but now I realize it was just a big misunderstanding.  Around @NUM1 years have passed, and this memory still lingers. Whenever I hang out with my cousin @PERSON2, we often talk about these funny childhood moments, which always make us laugh. Sharing these memories brings us closer, not only as family but also as friends. There's nothing better than enjoying long - lasting laughter with the people we love."
522	21369	8	2	I firmly believe that laughter is the key to a happy life. Being happy is an essential part of existence because it just feels so good. If I were in an unhappy relationship, I'd find it completely unbearable. In a happy relationship, laughter is inevitable.  Whenever I meet someone new, I always smile and tell jokes. I do this because when people laugh at my jokes, they can tell that I'm a happy person. Whether it's an adult, a friend, or someone I'm interested in dating, everyone appreciates laughter.  Let me tell you about my girlfriend. The first time I saw her, she was sitting at a desk in my history class, crying. I asked if she was okay, and she told me her story. After that, I shared my feelings and then told her a joke, which made her laugh. After she stopped laughing, she asked for my phone number, and that night, we started dating. When I asked her what she liked about me, she said it was the way I made her laugh.  I love making my family and friends laugh. When they smile, it makes me smile too. I use laughter as a way to boost people's self - esteem, including my own. If the whole world could learn to laugh and be happy, it would be a much better place. I'd rather laugh and be happy than be angry or sad about something.  When I was growing up, I was often alone, so I had to learn how to keep myself happy. I'd think about funny things I'd seen or said in the past and create stories out of them, and it worked. As I got older, I started doing stand - up comedy. It was amazing to see all those people laughing. After the show, seeing everyone leave with big smiles on their faces was a night I'll never forget.  If I had to choose an activity for fun, I'd definitely be a comedian. Thank you for reading this, and I hope you have a great day.
523	21370	8	2	My smile serves as a mask, concealing all the past tragedies, future misfortunes, and present mistakes—all forms of loss. Life is like a puzzle that I simply can't solve. I'm lost, and the more I engage with life, the more I feel like I'm losing myself.  I often isolate myself from the world, sleep in a bed of tissues soaked with my tears, and stare at my own face in the mirror, a face that I loathe so deeply. Laughter or even just a simple smile can have far - reaching consequences. It sends the wrong message to those who can't tell whether my mask is genuine or just a well - put - on act. Is this really the message I want to convey?  Before long, my laughter fades, my smile droops, and my lips start to quiver. It feels as if my heart is both bleeding and being squeezed at the same time. My eyes become moist, start to sting, and turn red, as if they're infected.  Please don't ask me if I'm okay, offer to do anything for me, or hug me. These actions will only push me to break down, which is something I simply can't allow. At this moment, all I need is peace, and of course, my loyal companion, tissues.  In conclusion, my mask of a smile is a desperate attempt to hide my inner turmoil. I long for the peace and solitude that will allow me to heal without the well - intentioned but ultimately overwhelming gestures of others.
524	21373	8	2	"In ninth grade, I was required to give a persuasive speech about a book, similar to a TV or radio advertisement. I'm really bad at giving speeches. Before a speech, my hands get sweaty and cold, I have ""hot flashes,"" and sometimes I feel nauseous. During the speech, my eyes dart around the room, and my breathing becomes rapid and shallow, almost in rhythm with my glances. At the end of a speech, I start shaking and feel like hiding, not speaking or laughing.  Thankfully, @CAPS4 speech was different. My @CAPS1 class had all girls except for one boy. I'm not being sexist, but having mostly female classmates did help. Girls have a way of showing acceptance, or at least creating an appearance of it, which made me feel more relaxed.  When it was my turn to stand in front of the class, almost everyone had a slight, eager smile and was ready to listen. Everyone was making eye contact with me. Compared to the usual classroom situation during speech - giving time, when people are doodling or whispering to each other, this class was completely focused on me.  On that day, @CAPS5, it seemed like everyone was eager to hear me, regardless of what I said or how professional it sounded. I felt so confident, as if I could change their lives. I even thought I could spout propaganda, and they'd accept it (isn't that what advertising is, highlighting the good and hiding the bad about a product or idea?). The group looked so innocent.  Just because of that sense of acceptance and those smiles, I was ready to give my speech. I used puppets for my speech, with a cardboard box around them to act as a TV. This also made me feel better because the audience only saw the puppets and heard the voices of the ""actors.""  After the first few lines of my speech, the class laughed. They weren't expecting this from me, a shy, quiet girl who rarely has the courage to raise her hand in class and who wears big coats as a barrier from the world. Usually, when I give a speech, people laugh in a negative way, the kind that makes the teacher hush them and makes me cut my speech short.  But this time, their laughter encouraged me to continue. At the end of my speech, everyone clapped. Normally, people clap out of obligation, but this clap was different. It was a clap for my success, saying that my speech had a clear purpose and made them want to keep listening. It wasn't a pity clap.  I smiled because I knew I had succeeded. I'd managed to get a group of people to focus on what I had to say, and they'd understood it. Maybe they'd even want to read the book. This was one of the first speeches where I met all the requirements. The length was just right, not too long to bore the audience or too short to forget the purpose. I enunciated clearly, which was an improvement and also why they laughed. They could hear my witty jokes. And my puppets' performance also had a proper introduction, body, and conclusion.  Laughter can be cruel and disrespectful, but this experience shows how it can have a positive impact. The audience's laughter was cheerful, happy, and encouraging. It was a turning point for me in my public - speaking journey."
525	21374	8	2	"In @LOCATION1, there was a young boy named @ORGANIZATION1. He didn't have much ambition in life and was often taunted and teased by his schoolmates. They laughed at him because he was much smaller than them. Although he wasn't the fastest, strongest, or coolest, he was the smartest. He knew how to manipulate words to make himself feel superior, but in reality, he was very lonely. He had never experienced true laughter or the touch of a lover.  He had his eye on a girl named @PERSON1 for months. She was the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen. He followed her around town and rode his bike past her almost every day when she was with her friend @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION1 hated @CAPS1 because @CAPS1 got to be with @PERSON1 every day, holding her and talking to her. He envied @CAPS1 for about four months.  Then, @ORGANIZATION1 messaged @PERSON1 on a website called ""myyeabook,"" a place to meet new people. He sent her a friend request and asked for her phone number, hoping she'd find him attractive. @PERSON1 accepted his request and messaged him, saying, ""@CAPS4 I see you're from the town next to mine, we should hang out sometime. It would be cool.""  @ORGANIZATION1 was overjoyed. He got a haircut and bought new clothes to look more attractive. @PERSON1 went to the park with her friend @PERSON2 and waited for @ORGANIZATION1. They played on the swings and the spinning wheel.  @ORGANIZATION1 rode his bike and parked it a hundred yards away. He walked over, said ""@CAPS4"" to @PERSON2, and then approached @PERSON1. He told her she was beautiful and had an amazing smile. @PERSON1 blushed and invited him to swing with her. @PERSON2 left, knowing @PERSON1 would be okay.  @ORGANIZATION1 felt very comfortable around @PERSON1. He told her jokes and shared his life story. @PERSON1 felt the same way. She laughed at his jokes and told him about herself. In that short meeting, they connected on a deep level. @ORGANIZATION1 discovered that @PERSON1 was smart and loved the outdoors, just like him.  After a month of chatting and hanging out, @ORGANIZATION1 texted @PERSON1, asking, ""@CAPS6 you down to be my partner in life?"" @PERSON1 was shocked and excited. She replied, ""@CAPS6 you down to be mine?"" @ORGANIZATION1 responded with ""I love you.""  On the night of @DATE1, @NUM1 @DATE2, @PERSON1 was the happiest girl in the world. The two went everywhere together and did everything as a couple. Everyone could see they were perfect for each other. After four months, @PERSON1 finally told @ORGANIZATION1 that she loved him. @ORGANIZATION1 was so happy that he bought her a ring, and she happily accepted it.  They moved in together and started a family. This story shows that a little laughter can go a long way, whether in a job, a family, or in finding the right person. @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1's love began in that park, where they laughed at the smallest things. All it takes is a bit of laughter to start a lifetime of true love."
526	21375	8	2	Moving to a new school is never an easy task, especially for a fourth - grader. Throughout @DATE2, I had been dreading the day of returning to a new school, and finally, it arrived. As I reluctantly boarded the bus, my @CAPS1 offered words of reassurance. Scanning the seats, I realized that I either had to make new friends or spend my fourth - grade year as a loner.  The bus ride was silent; neither did I talk to anyone, nor did others initiate a conversation with me. The school day commenced like any other. First, the teacher assigned seats in pairs. I was seated next to a boy named @PERSON1. Initially, I thought my school life would remain solitary. I was unsure about my seating partner's issue as we exchanged no words.  The rest of the day passed by quickly, and before I knew it, school was over. I had successfully endured my first day. The bus ride home was similar to the ride to school. When I got off at my house, my mother was there to inquire about my day. After I recounted the events, she advised me to be myself, assuring me that I would eventually make friends.  On @DATE1, I woke up with a new - found sense of motivation. I got ready and waited at the bus stop. After waiting for nearly half an hour, I went to my mom. After phoning the school, we learned that my bus had been in a minor accident, so my mom had to drive me to school.  As we were pulling out of the driveway, I noticed @PERSON1, my seating partner, waiting at his bus stop, unaware of what had happened. My mom screeched to a halt, rolled down the window, and offered him a ride. He seemed hesitant at first but eventually accepted. The car ride was spent in silence, with only the radio playing.  When we reached school, @PERSON1 and I started walking to class. For some reason, I felt like running down the sidewalk to our classroom. Sprinting while @PERSON1 watched, I almost made it to class when a teacher suddenly opened the door. I ran head - first into the door at full speed and fell backward onto the sidewalk. After rubbing the large bump on my head, I turned around to see @PERSON1 laughing uncontrollably. At first, I got a bit angry, but then I realized it must have been funny to onlookers. I got up from the cement, walked over to @PERSON1, and we laughed about the incident before heading to class.  That day, we talked throughout the class and even got into trouble a couple of times. Since then, @PERSON1 has been a good friend of mine. It's been eight years since we met, and our friendship shows no sign of ending. In my opinion, laughter is an essential part of daily life and an excellent way to make friends.
527	21377	8	2	When I was young, my friends and I used to play at @CAPS1 @CAPS2. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was a @CAPS2 situated in the middle of an orchard. It had a slide, a diving board, and two rope swings. All @DATE1 long, we would gather there, sitting, playing, swimming, and laughing. We would hold our @CAPS4 day party and celebrate the @CAPS5 of @DATE2 at the @CAPS2.  There is one particular day that I remember vividly, as if it were yesterday. The last day of school had just ended, and my friends and I rushed onto the bus. When the bus stopped at the @CAPS2, we all started running and stripping down to our swim trunks. I was the first one to jump in, and immediately, I felt the water as cold as a river. It was like a thousand little stings, with the coldness pricking me repeatedly. I got out as quickly as I got in, and my friends compared me to a bouncy ball. When they saw my blue lips, they laughed so hard that some of them fell into the freezing water themselves.  After that, we walked to @CAPS1's house and asked him to turn on the generator. After about an hour, the lake was warm enough for swimming. After swimming around for a while, we decided to use the rope swing. Soon, we started doing backflips. When we stopped, our backs and chests were as red as the apples in the orchard, and our throats hurt from all the laughter. We were also sore from hitting the water repeatedly and hungry, so we fired up the grill to make burgers. But the first and second batches turned out like mounds of coal, so we decided to order pizza.  We passed the time playing air - soft. By the time the pizza arrived, there were thousands of air - soft @CAPS7's floating in the lake. As we ate, we sat on the small dock, stuck our legs in the water, and collected any @CAPS7's that came near. After eating, we started playing hide - and - seek in the orchard. After ten or so rounds, we were all scraped up from running through the trees. Of course, we poured soda on our cuts. To this day, I still wonder why we did that because it really hurt.  Once we stopped being silly, we laughed at ourselves and then at each other. Later, we played swimming baseball, with the corners of the docks as bases and the pitcher on the floating platform. We used floating balls and swam from base to base. Eventually, the sun started to set, and we made a fire by the side of the @CAPS2 and roasted marshmallows. When our @CAPS9 came to pick us up, we were in the middle of a belly - flop contest. Before leaving, we promised never to forget that day and that our friendship would last forever, with laughter as the bond that held us together. That night, I stayed up thinking about all the fun and laughter we had that day. It was undoubtedly the start of one of the best and most memorable summers of my life.
528	21379	8	2	It was @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 of @DATE1. The sun was shining brightly, and the birds were chirping merrily. It was an ideal day to be outside and engage in something special to enjoy the pleasant weather. There was a parade in @LOCATION1, and I was part of it. I relished being the center of attention, and what better way to achieve that than by participating in a parade?  I was with my best friend @PERSON2 and her family. Their float was for @ORGANIZATION1, which was the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 they owned at that time. There were about twenty children on the float, and only @PERSON2, @PERSON2's mom, and the manager of the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 were there to watch over them. The children were dressed in animal costumes. The older kids were distributing candy, while the toddlers stayed on the float.  @PERSON2 and I laughed throughout the parade. I almost forgot that hundreds of people were watching us. We were carrying two twin babies, though I can't recall their names. We took turns holding them, but mostly, I held the boy while she held the girl. The babies were well - behaved; they only cried when we laughed too hard or shouted too loudly at the crowd.  We passed many people we knew, including my cousins, aunts, and uncles. I could only wave at them because the parade was moving rather quickly. After a while, @PERSON2 and I started to feel tired from holding the babies and walking. So, we stood at the front of the float and leaned against the wooden rail. The rail was only nailed in, so it wasn't very sturdy, but we thought it would be okay.  As the parade continued, we got even more tired and hot from the sun. We felt so exhausted that we could have fallen asleep right there in front of everyone. Due to our exhaustion, we leaned more and more against the rail. Although we were still laughing and having a good time, we became increasingly relaxed, and all our weight ended up pushing against the rail.  Suddenly, the rail broke, and we fell. There were many people watching, and we were still holding the babies. At that moment, I was holding the girl, and @PERSON2 was holding the boy, who had just fallen asleep. The babies were fine, but the boy started to cry, not because he was hurt but because he was shocked. It was the most embarrassing moment of our lives. The crowd laughed at us, and our faces turned bright red.  @PERSON2's mom came over to check if we were okay. She handed the babies to the manager of the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 and helped us up. Then, we all burst into laughter. It was both the most embarrassing and the funniest moment. Our butts were sore, so we walked funny for the rest of the parade. Once, @PERSON2 tried to lean against the rail again before realizing it was gone.  At the end of the parade, @PERSON2's family was waiting for us. Uncle Mark's kids, @PERSON1 and @PERSON3, came up and laughed at us. Papa @PERSON4 asked if we were okay. When he asked, @PERSON2 and I looked at each other and laughed again. Papa looked puzzled at first but then joined in our laughter. He was glad that we could laugh off the embarrassment.  After that, we went home. That @ORGANIZATION1 was a great one for us. We talked about what had happened and realized that if we hadn't laughed at ourselves, we might have ended up crying from embarrassment. We learned that when something bad happens, it's best to look on the bright side, make a joke out of it, or just laugh at yourself. @PERSON2 and I have made fools of ourselves many times since then, and laughing at ourselves has made our friendship even stronger. In every relationship, whether it's intimate, familial, or a simple friendship, laughter is essential. Otherwise, the difficult times in life will bring you down. Laughter keeps you bold and strong. If you don't laugh at embarrassing moments, they can haunt you forever and have a long - term impact. Without laughter, a relationship can't truly exist. That's why laughter is extremely important in everyone's life.
529	21380	8	2	When I was fourteen, my family and I started riding four - wheelers in the sand, thanks to my parents' friends. The first time I went, I had a @NUM1 @ORGANIZATION2 four - wheeler. It was so small compared to everyone else's big four - wheelers and dirt bikes that I couldn't stop laughing. It was fun to ride, and every time my brother rode it up a hill, he would really push it to the limit, which made the whole family laugh.  After that ride, we sold my four - wheeler and got a @NUM2 @ORGANIZATION1. I was really excited for my first time at the dunes with my new four - wheeler. When we got there, we unloaded everything, put on our riding gear, helmets, and goggles.  After thirty minutes of riding, my brother was jumping his four - wheeler when some people showed up and started video - taping him. This made him show off even more. He kept jumping further and further in front of those people. My family couldn't stop smiling and laughing as he out - jumped everyone there.  When he finished jumping, the guys who were video - taping came up and said he was really good and that we should follow them to another jump. My brother, trying to be cool, whipped his bike around and crashed it. It was so funny that my dad and I laughed until our eyes watered. Luckily, only we saw his little crash. We went to check if he was okay, and he said he was, so we continued on.  My brother and I followed those guys, and our parents were out of sight. I turned my head to see if they were behind us, and when I looked ahead, a cloud of sand hit my face. I turned the handlebars and hit a grass mound. The bike flew up in the air, rolled down a small hill, and landed on my leg. My brother didn't know what happened to me, so I was stuck there until my parents came.  For some reason, I couldn't stop laughing. The wreck was actually kind of fun and funny because I couldn't get the four - wheeler off my leg. After about ten minutes, I heard my dad. He came to save me, and I told him what happened. He couldn't stop laughing at me and said he would get my brother back.  On the way back to the truck, my dad roosted my brother with sand so badly that his goggles fell off. My parents and I laughed so hard that we had to pull over. After that, my brother never roosted me again.  It's been a year since we started riding. My brother still likes to show off. One time, when my mom's friends came, he was trying to be cool and ride fast coming out of the dunes. He slid on the concrete and crashed in front of us and about seven other people. It was really funny, and everyone laughed except my mom. He had road rash on his arm. I guess that's what he gets for showing off. But every time he crashes when showing off, it still makes for a good laugh. I think that's why we have so much fun riding together.
530	21382	8	2	Do you have a friend with whom you can't help but laugh? I do, and his name is @PERSON1. We spend countless hours joking, smiling, and having a great time together. In any relationship or friendship, laughter is a crucial quality. In the following paragraphs, I'll explain why laughter is so
531	21383	8	2	"In life, various elements are said to unite people. It could range from shared favorite foods, similar fashion tastes, or even a mutual dislike of certain individuals. However, nothing can forge as strong a bond between two people as a hearty laugh. A good laugh has the power to brighten the mood, bring out a radiant smile, and sometimes, even draw tears of joy. It makes difficult days more bearable and wonderful days truly exceptional. In my view, the world would be a dull place without the occasional bout of genuine laughter. By 'good laugh', I don't mean the fleeting kind that offers a momentary sense of happiness. I'm referring to the kind that brings tears to your eyes and makes your stomach ache from the intensity. The kind of laugh that leaves a lasting impression.  I've experienced numerous such moments, but one that I hold dear occurred during a school day. A couple of weeks ago, I was having a fairly pleasant day. True, the weather was a bit dampening as it was [season], but I was managing well. I attended my regular classes, received the usual amount of homework, and then it was time for [study hall period]. At my school, this period is essentially a study hall. I sit at a round - table with a few friends, and we discuss almost everything. Every day, I sit next to [Friend's name]. [Friend's name] and I sometimes engage in conversations with the others, but more often than not, we retreat into our own world of inside jokes, witty remarks, and people - watching.  During that particular [study hall period], I can't quite recall the exact topic of our conversation, but we simply couldn't stop laughing. Most of it were gentle giggles, while some were full - blown, red - faced fits of laughter. After the latest wave of chuckling subsided, [Friend's name] started speaking. Amidst the lingering giggles, she blurted out, ""[Phrase] it you guys! You're making my eyes hurt!"" I was utterly puzzled. I stared at her and stammered, ""...what?"". I was certain she had made a mistake and meant to say ""stomach"" instead of ""eyes"". But when she retorted with ""Don't your eyes hurt when you laugh really hard?!"", I lost all control. I was laughing so hard that I couldn't catch my breath, and I felt like I was about to lose bladder control.  The funny part is that [Friend's name] has [a certain characteristic]. So, the idea of her eyes hurting from laughing is simply hilarious. After [Friend's name] and I regained our composure, we asked other [classmates] in the room if their eyes hurt when they laugh, and to our amusement, they said they did! This only intensified our laughter. This incident instantly became another cherished inside joke. This inside joke is, by far, one of the funniest ones we have, and its very nature of being funny makes it even more so. Every time she laughs, I ask, ""Do your eyes hurt?"", and we burst into another fit of laughter. The mere thought of this joke brings a smile to my face, which is precisely why laughter is such an integral part of our world. It brings happiness, joy, and love. In fact, it brings just about every positive emotion. Although I'm not a doctor yet, I'm certain when I say that everyone should have their daily dose of laughter. Laughter can heal almost anything."
532	21384	8	2	On [date], my friend [Friend's name] was going to come home with me. Throughout the day at school, we discussed our plans for the week. Our ideas included going to a movie, hanging out at my house, doing our nails while sharing stories, or going on an adventure around my neighborhood. At lunch that day, we decided to try all these activities as we had several days to spend together.  After lunch, we attended our next two classes, which seemed to drag on. Finally, the school bell rang, and [Friend's name] and I rushed to our lockers to gather our things and head home. We went outside the front doors of the school and waited on the front steps for my mom. After waiting for twenty minutes, we suddenly remembered that my mom had told us we would have to walk home after school because she had to work late. [Friend's name] and I looked at each other and burst into laughter, realizing we had completely forgotten about walking home.  Once we stopped laughing, we started our walk home. We took out my iPod and turned up the volume so we could listen to music and dance along. When we finally reached home, we dropped our stuff and had something to drink. On our way to my mom's work, we stopped at the local gas station to buy something to eat. After leaving the gas station, we continued our journey.  On the way to the bank where my mom works, we witnessed a dog chasing a squirrel. The dog was running so fast that the fur on its face was pushed back, looking as if it was about to come off. The squirrel quickly climbed up a nearby tree, but the dog, not realizing it couldn't climb, ran head - first into the tree. [Friend's name] and I couldn't help but laugh as the dog stumbled around for a few minutes before sitting down and barking at the tree. We left the scene and continued to the bank.  We arrived at the bank twenty minutes later and talked to my mom. She gave us money to buy coffee and told us to go back home. On our way home, we stopped at [Organization's name] to get coffee. While walking back to my house from [Organization's name], we watched the people in their cars and laughed at those singing at the traffic lights.  When we got back to my house, we decided to watch a movie. We watched [Movie name] and ate popcorn. Every time the little yellow characters appeared in the movie, we laughed because we both found them cute. After the movie, my parents came home, and we had pizza and [dessert] for dinner. After dinner, we played the Wii and then fell asleep.  The next [day], when we woke up, my dad made us pancakes and eggs for breakfast. After breakfast, we got ready to go, and my mom took us to the mall. At the mall, my mom told [Friend's name] and me to meet her at the food court around two. We explored the stores. On our way to one of the stores, we saw a guy with a mohawk and a green beard. We looked at each other and laughed because his beard resembled a [a certain thing] tree tipped over. At [time], we went back to the food court to meet my mom. She bought us [a drink] and suggested that if we left then, we could go see a movie. We decided to stay for one more hour and then headed home. On the way home, we danced and sang in the backseat.  When we got home, we played the Wii until my dad arrived. After my dad got home, we had dinner and played the Wii again. This time, we got my parents to join us. Whenever it was my mom's turn, we laughed at the way she set up to bowl. After we finished playing, [Friend's name] and I went to my room and talked about the guys we liked. We laughed at some of our choices. After a while, we fell asleep. This day was filled with fun and laughter, creating memories that we'll cherish.
533	21385	8	2	"Over the years, the memories I've shared with my friends are deeply marked by emotions. Usually, these memories are filled with an abundance of laughter and happiness as we simply enjoy being teenagers and living life to the fullest. However, there are also times when these memories are tinged with sadness. These could be the day - to - day frustrations, the crucial playoff games we've lost by a narrow margin, or the loss of important people in our lives. I believe these extreme emotions are more vividly remembered because they are accompanied by auditory cues like laughing and crying, and our brains recognize them as more significant than an ordinary day.  As children, we are highly impressionable. So, any event that makes us extremely happy or unusually sad will have a lasting impact on us and be engraved in our memories. It's a well - known fact that teenagers aren't always the most logical thinkers. Some people believe it's genetically programmed that during our teenage years, we'll make a few foolish decisions and might get into minor trouble. I can speak for my generation when I say that our actions aren't always well - thought - out, and sometimes, we can't even explain the strange things we do.  For instance, my friend [Friend's name] has an almost obsessive need to keep her car clean. She washes it multiple times a month and is convinced that driving slower helps keep the dirt and debris from her long gravel driveway away from the candy - apple red paint on her [Car brand]. This wouldn't be a problem, but every day after school, I, along with our friends [Friend 1's name] and [Friend 2's name], go to her house to kill time before practice. We're always eager to get away from school as we're tired, hungry, and just want to relax at her place. But [Friend's name] never gives in to our pleas and drives at a snail's pace.  One day, [Friend 2's name] got fed up and said she could run faster than [Friend's name] was driving. [Friend's name] took up the challenge, stopped the car, and [Friend 2's name] got out and started jogging alongside the car. Soon, she was well ahead of us, dancing and skipping towards our destination. However, she changed her mind and since the car was moving slowly, she climbed on the hood, and we continued our slow journey.  When we were about two hundred feet from [Location's name]'s house, just one small bend away, [Friend's name] realized that if her grandparents, who lived next door, saw us, she'd be in trouble. Without informing the rest of us, she suddenly stopped the car in the middle of the driveway. [Friend 2's name] slid off the hood. Since we were only going about eight miles an hour, the momentum made her trot forward a bit. She slid on the gravel road, landed on her rear, skidded across the ground, and then stopped.  Those of us in the car were in shock, our mouths wide open, and we stared at her for a few seconds as she sat there. Then, she stood up, turned to face us, and burst into hysterical laughter. We all let out a collective sigh and joined in the laughter. We stayed in that spot for about five minutes, laughing until we were out of breath. We continued to laugh about this incident throughout the day and shared it with our other friends.  We knew it was a stupid thing to do, and [Friend 2's name] could have gotten hurt. But since she was okay, we all bonded over this moment. Laughter has the remarkable ability to connect people. It takes effort to make someone laugh, to trigger that emotional response in them that tells their brain, ""Yes, I'm having fun."" While crying is a sign of extreme sadness, laughter is a sign of joy, elation, and happiness. It shows that you're enjoying what you're doing and want others around you to share in that feeling. I truly cherish the memories filled with laughter, and every time I think about them, I can't help but laugh again. Laughter is one of the simplest yet most precious joys in life. You don't need to spend money or travel anywhere; it's timeless, simple, and full of fun."
534	21386	8	2	"During [date] of the sixth grade, [Person's] parents decided to get a divorce. I received the phone call while I was at [Friend's] house. [Person's] [parent] said through the phone, ""[Message]"". I asked, ""[Question]"". [Person's] [parent] then told me, ""[Statement]"". I could feel the tears welling up in my eyes. I had no idea what was happening; I was only [age] and had a vague understanding of what divorce meant. Without saying a word, I hung up the phone and ran into [Friend's] room.  I knew that the divorce would change my life, but I didn't realize to what extent. I stayed at [Friend's] house for the next two weeks. There was no way I was going home. I didn't want to see [Person's] [parent] or [Person's] father. At night, I dreamt about what [Person's] sisters were going through, the horror they were enduring while I was away. I wondered what [Person's] father was doing, where [Person's] [parent] was, and whether [Person's] sisters were okay. Even though I knew I should have gone home at some point during those two weeks, I just couldn't bring myself to do it.  During my stay at [Friend's] house, I felt safe and secure, but I never felt happy. It was an emotion I desperately longed for, but every time I tried to smile, laugh, or be myself, I couldn't. I knew something had changed in me when I hung up on [Person's] father. I had never hung up on anyone before. I knew it was wrong, but I was so upset that I did it anyway.  When [Person's] [parent] came to pick me up after my two - week stay at [Friend's], she looked at me with concern in her eyes. I had never seen this emotion in [Person's] [parent] before. She was usually so calm and in control. I could tell she was worried about me. I also knew that [Friend's] [adult in the house] had called my [parent] several times during my stay. I assume she told my [parent] about my behavior, but what could I do? [Person's] parents were splitting up! [Person's] whole life was falling apart, and"
535	21387	8	2	"@CAPS10 you laughed today? Many believe that laughing is beneficial in our everyday lives. @CAPS10 you heard the saying ""laughter is the best medicine."" @CAPS1 comes from the idea that having a positive mood will make you feel better. Close to the idea of @CAPS2. Laughing has been said to relieve stress and makes you seem more approachable to someone you @MONTH1 not know yet. The quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" is accurate in my opinion. I relate @CAPS1 to the way my friends and I act and the way I act towards strangers. When meeting someone new making a joke or laughing kind of breaks the ice, and can make the conversation more lighthearted and easy. When I was younger my best friends name was @PERSON1, and we hung out nearly everyday after school. We shared everything we had the same favorite color same hair we even had the same friends. We were girls that everyone though were sister because we hung out so much. We were the kind of friends who could take one look at each other and start laughing thinking about a past memory we had. Like the time we went into the wrong movie or the time we went out to lunch together. I remember going to lunch like @CAPS1 was just the other day though @CAPS1 was easily years ago. One day we went to our daily kindergarten class together just like always except today @PERSON1 was going to get to come home with me and my @CAPS3. My @CAPS3 knew she was going to need to take the car into the shop that day and told us we could tag along and if we were good we would go out to lunch. All day we were on our best behavior because we wanted to go to lunch and then hang out for the rest of the day. @CAPS1 was around lunch time and my @CAPS3 thought, well the car will be a while so I'll take the girls to lunch and then we will pick @CAPS1 up on the way home. So we dropped the car off and headed to @ORGANIZATION1's (a local @CAPS6 restaurant) for a @CAPS7 lunch.  When we got to the restaurant they took our drink orders and I decided @CAPS1 would be a good idea to get a big blackberry slushy type drink. When @CAPS1 came to our table I was really excited and I started to drink @CAPS1 really fast. maybe a little too fast. When all of the sudden ""whoosh"" @CAPS1 had spilled all over my face and clothes, @CAPS1 was everywhere, in my hair, on my face, in my eyes. I was so embarrassed. I was so surprised at how hast the the ice fell on my face that I started crying right in front of my best friend. She was trying so hard not to laugh, she had the biggest smile on her face. When I looked over my @CAPS3 was laughing too I was humiliated. I was so worried my friend and my @CAPS3 would make fun of me being so clumsy, but they both said that @CAPS1 has happened to them too.  After I got cleaned up I realized how silly I had been. I was so embarrassed at the time and at them laughing at me. But when I thought about @CAPS1 I would @CAPS10 laughed too. The whole car ride home we giggled about my little drink disaster and we could hardly look at each other without saying something about my spill, or we would both think about @CAPS1 and start cracking up again.   Even though at first I though she would make fun of me and laugh at me for making such a silly accident, we ended up laughing together and @CAPS1 made us closer as friends. Our memories from when we were little girls last in our minds and we remember they silly and creative things we used to do and the little things that would be fun to us. We were and always will be great friends. We are still best friends and every once in a while one of us will bring something up that makes us think of that day when we were little girls and we will bust out laughing again.  I do believe laughter is the best medicine. Although of course laughter will never conquer or cure diseases or fight off cancers I think @CAPS1 makes you stronger to take the treatment if you are happy and @CAPS10 a positive outlook, if you @CAPS10 something to look forward too, something you don't want to miss. Laughter can make a sick person forget about their illness, @CAPS1 can make them carefree and living in the moment. I think laughter is so much more powerful than we realize. So consider this question instead: @CAPS10 you made someone laugh today?"
536	21388	8	2	Rewrite for the first item On @DATE1, my family and I embarked on a trip to @LOCATION2. My father, who had recently emerged from a coma, was deeply depressed. The doctor advised my mother to plan family activities during the @DATE1 break. I was twelve then and noticed how my father struggled to come to terms with losing both his arms. He attempted to conceal his distress, which only heightened our concerns about his well - being.  My mother, my sister @CAPS2, and I decided to go on this trip to distract my father and hopefully lift him out of his depression. On the day of the trip, we left the apartments at around @NUM1 am. My mother, being punctual, had us packed and ready the night before. Since we lived in the upper apartments, my mother and I assisted my father downstairs as he had difficulty maintaining balance.  My father seemed unenthusiastic about the trip, but I excited my sisters, and they chatted with him in the car. After a few hours, my sisters and then my father fell asleep. My mother started to get drowsy, so I stayed awake and engaged her in random conversations. She began sharing stories of her childhood, like the times her cousins played pranks on each other, which made us laugh so hard we tried not to wake the others.  My father, sisters, and I woke up, and they started feeling carsick. So, my mother exited towards @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. As we searched for a gas station, we heard loud music and discovered a carnival in the city center. My sister @CAPS2 (@NUM2 - years - old) and @PERSON1 (eight - years - old) complained. I convinced my mother, but my father was initially angry. However, after my sister @CAPS4 (@NUM3 - years - old) ranted, he agreed.  My mother parked at a nearby park, and my sisters rushed to the carnival. My mother chased after them while I locked the car from the inside. At the carnival, we saw stands with jewelry, clothing, and other items. There were gypsies dancing on stage and a comedian who made everyone laugh. We bought three @CAPS5 parasols and got one free.  As the @DATE1 heat intensified, we headed back to the car. My mother realized she had left the keys inside. She argued with me, and I regretted the trip. My father decided to find a wire hanger at the carnival with my sister @PERSON1. The rest of us walked to the park. @CAPS4 pouted, and my mother blamed me, while I pretended not to hear.  When my father returned with the hanger, I tried to open the car but couldn't. An old couple on a motorcycle stopped to help us open the door. We thanked them and got in the car. Exhausted, we decided to go home. Despite the key incident, we enjoyed the trip. My mother and sisters joked around, and for the first time since leaving the hospital, my father laughed.
537	21389	8	2	Rewrite for the second item It is widely acknowledged that laughter is an integral and beneficial aspect of life. Scientific research has consistently shown that engaging in laughter can have positive effects on both physical and mental health. Laughter releases endorphins, which are natural mood - lifters, and can also reduce stress levels.   When people laugh, it creates a sense of connection and shared experience. It can break down barriers and foster a more positive and inclusive environment. Laughter is not only a form of entertainment but also a powerful tool for building and maintaining relationships. It allows individuals to express their joy and share moments of happiness with others.   In conclusion, laughter is indeed a valuable and essential part of a well - rounded life. It enriches our social interactions, improves our well - being, and makes life more enjoyable. We should actively seek out opportunities to laugh and share laughter with those around us.
538	21390	8	2	"Rewrite for the third item I firmly believe that laughter plays a crucial role in relationships, and I'll explain why. When I first arrived at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I was eager to be myself and make friends. One day in class, @CAPS4 entered the room, approached me, and started talking. Her words made me laugh, and she said she liked my laugh. Then, she began imitating my laugh to make me laugh more.   It was a wonderful feeling because I knew she wasn't mocking me but genuinely enjoying the moment. She found my two unique laughs amusing, and that day, @CAPS5, was the best of my life. I was being myself, and I could tell she was laughing with me, not at me.   Now, every time she hears me laugh, she joins in and tries to make me laugh more so that we can all have a great time. For me, it's fascinating that most people don't pay attention to how others laugh, but @CAPS4 noticed and appreciated mine.   Unlike those who make hurtful remarks when they ""make fun"" of someone, @CAPS4 just wanted to make me laugh. She thought my laugh was unique and cute, not in a derogatory way. Every time she tries to make me laugh, it makes me feel good.   When you're new at @CAPS3, making others laugh is a great way to build relationships, especially when it's not at your expense. @CAPS5 made me feel like people were starting to accept me as a person, not just ""the new kid.""   Laughter also reveals your personality and shows your true self. That's what people, including me, want others to see. The substitute teacher that day got angry at us for laughing, but we couldn't help it because it was so funny. I laughed so hard that I even peed my pants a little. @CAPS4 made fish faces and monkey sounds, and her efforts to make me laugh were non - stop.   Later, @CAPS7 and @PERSON1 came in. I poked at something in @PERSON1's pocket, and we all laughed when we found out it was his wallet. We laughed so much that when we all stopped at the same time, we started laughing again.   In conclusion, laughter is excellent for relationships. It shows your sense of humor and reveals your true self. I'll never forget that class period because @CAPS4 taught me that when people laugh with you, they're acknowledging your uniqueness and having a good time with you."
539	21391	8	2	"Rewrite for the fourth item I had been eagerly anticipating @DATE1, my birthday, for an entire year. Turning @NUM1, I couldn't wait to open presents and eat cake. All my friends were coming over, and I was sure it would be a great day. First, I had to wait for my mom to come home from work.   I planned to go swimming, then on a hike, and finally have a party with games, presents, and cake. However, I wasn't happy that my mom automatically invited my sisters. I hoped she wouldn't do that next year.  My mom left for work at @TIME1. After my sister and I had breakfast, we went swimming in the pool beside the patio in our front yard. My sister often threw me in the pool, either when she was mad or just because she was bigger. That day, her friend @PERSON2, who had moved away over @DATE2 and was visiting, joined in. They grabbed my arms and legs, swung me, and threw me in. I got so mad that I threw a fit and cried. My sister @PERSON1 then put me in a diaper, a high - chair, and forced me to eat baby food, which made me cry even more as I hated it.  By @TIME1, I didn't want to go on a hike and just wanted my mom home. Finally, she came back with pizza, which was perfect as all my friends were coming. But then, my mom told me to take a nap. At @NUM1, I didn't think I needed one, so I knew something was up. I decided to take a nap and actually fell asleep. While I was asleep, my mom cleaned, decorated, and gathered my friends.   When I woke up and walked into the living room, everyone screamed ""surprise!"" I was truly shocked. After a long and fun party, we cleaned up, put the garbage away, and stored the cake in the oven to keep the flies away.  The next day, my mom went back to work, and I swam and played with my new swim - suit and floaty toys. My sister @PERSON3 and I tried to get hot water into the pool. We had trouble connecting the house to the bathroom faucet, so we used the bathtub in my mom's room and ran the hose out the back door. We managed to achieve our goal.  Later, I heard a lot of commotion and found the house smoky. I went to the kitchen, and my sister told me to get my sisters and meet her at the road. I saw fire trucks arriving, and my mom came racing over, worried about everyone's safety.   I later found out that she had burned my birthday cake while preheating the oven for pizza. I was initially upset, but now I can look back and laugh. My sister still has the burnt spoon and the lock (from the gate that the firefighters cut). The lesson I learned is to always check the oven before preheating."
540	21392	8	2	"Rewrite for the fifth item It is often said that laughter can bring people together, and my experience with my best friend @PERSON1 is a perfect example. We are complete opposites, yet we became best friends over a simple joke in the locker room.  It was @DATE1 @TIME1, and it was not a good day for either of us. I woke up late, missed something, walked all the way to school, and dropped my lunch in the hallway three times. Then, I walked straight into @PERSON1. She said, ""@CAPS2 where your going"" in a catty voice and gave me a pointed glare. Being shy, I just lowered my head and kept walking. @PERSON1 was one of the prettiest girls in school and hung out with the popular clique, while I usually spent time alone.  Her day had been as bad as mine. Her @CAPS3 had broken up with her for her best friend, and she had spent the night in the hospital with her brother who was in a car accident. To make matters worse, our next class was @CAPS4.E.!  When I entered the locker room, I realized I had forgotten my gym clothes. @PERSON1, who had just entered behind me, also sighed, indicating she had forgotten hers too. We had to use clothes from the bucket where lost or unwanted items were kept. There were sometimes cool sweatshirts and neat tee - shirts, but we couldn't be sure if they were clean. That day, it seemed there were only guy clothes.  We both started digging through the bucket. We found only oversized sweatpants and extra - large shirts. We picked out the ones we thought were the best and changed. As soon as our eyes met, we burst into laughter. We looked like little kids playing in their dads' clothes. Her pants would have dropped to her ankles if she let go, and my shirt hung past my knees. We laughed until our sides ached and tears ran down our faces.  When the @ORGANIZATION1 teacher banged on the door, we walked out of the locker room. The whole gym stared at us, but we didn't care because we had found confidence and friendship in each other.  Since that day, @PERSON1 and I have been inseparable. We've had our share of fights, but every time I think about that day in the locker room, I can't help but laugh. Laughter truly brought us together and formed a strong bond of friendship."
541	21393	8	2	"On New Year's Eve, the experience was like flying past trees on a @CAPS1 @NUM1 four - wheeler, trying to keep up with those in front. At around @NUM2 o'clock pm, we left our house. We headed to a friend's place as we had asked them earlier if they wanted to join. We left in a hurry to minimize our time on the road. Upon arrival, we hung out briefly and then asked if they still wanted to go. They got ready, and at about @NUM2:45, around @TIME1 of us set off towards Gillhooly. We reached the mountain top at about @NUM4 o'clock pm and hung out until @NUM5 o'clock. ""Hanging out"" meant hitting mud holes and having some fun. By @NUM4:55 pm, we were all muddy, so we set up about @TIME1 or @NUM7 fireworks and shot them off around @TIME1. Around @NUM8 in the @TIME2, we started to head home, but one friend got stuck in snow off the road. It took us about half an hour to dig him out before finally going back. We arrived home at @NUM9 in the @TIME2. Hungry, we all got something to eat, watched a little @CAPS2, and then went to bed for the night."
542	21394	8	2	I firmly believe that laughter is a healthy and enjoyable way to interact with others. The more one laughs, the more fun they have in the company of others. Once, my friend @PERSON1 and I were at my house, and we couldn't stop laughing. Every little thing seemed hilarious to us. Laughing together makes our time more enjoyable compared to fighting. I love laughing so much that all my friends call me obnoxious. I feel that laughing with someone strengthens the relationship and is a healthier alternative. For instance, I always want to hang out with @PERSON1 because we laugh and have a great time. In a group of friends, if there's constant disagreement or fighting, it's not fun. In a romantic relationship, laughing with your partner makes you want to be around them more. Fighting has the opposite effect. I've recently identified my good and bad friends. Laughing is a crucial quality in a person. The girls I fight with usually have no personality, are negative, and always seem angry. My good friends and I always laugh and have a good time. The only time I fought with a good friend was when negative people said untrue and hurtful things. I've realized that the more you laugh, the more fun you'll have, and the more people will want to be around you. I've also noticed the difference between my mom and dad. My mom is a sweetheart who always laughs, and I have a great time with her. My dad, on the other hand, never laughs. I can't remember the last time I heard him laugh. He's such a downer that no one wants to be around him, which might be why my parents are divorced. In life, we should have fun, do what we're supposed to do, and laugh. Laughter is an important part of any relationship, whether it's with friends, family, or in a romantic context. It's definitely a valuable quality.
543	21397	8	2	When I was in third grade, my parents decided to move to the place where my @CAPS1 was born and where my @CAPS2 lived. As a determined third - grader, I was angry and refused to move, even sitting on the floor to make my point. However, I had no choice. I was very unhappy about leaving my friends and my @CAPS3's side of the family, whom I'd known since I was little. My friends were my world in elementary school, and I wasn't ready to say goodbye. It was extremely hard, even though we visited later. We moved three hours away from my hometown, a significant move for a ten - year - old who had rarely been elsewhere. Starting as a new student is never easy, especially for someone as shy and quiet as I was. I remember my first day vividly. I went to school with my @CAPS4, and my new teacher, who was in the office, took me to the class and showed me around. I was frightened and upset about this huge change. When class started, the teacher made me stand in front of the class to introduce myself. I'm not a good public speaker, and it's hard to believe I actually did it. Even today, I'm not good at it, and I'm less shy than I was then. It was terrifying, especially when the class was silent after I finished speaking. Then I slowly walked to my seat and didn't talk until lunch. At lunch, a little girl with freckles and glasses, like me, sat with me. Once she broke through my shyness, we had a great time laughing and playing. For the first time that day, I thought moving might be okay. We became good friends, along with the other girls she hung out with. We sat together in class, talked on the phone, had sleepovers, and spent recess together every day. She was my first best friend after the move, and I'm glad it was her. I'm very thankful to her for getting to know me when I was shy. The laughter we shared that day brought us close. Without her, I'm not sure how the rest of that day or week would have gone. Laughter is important in relationships as it brings people closer and makes new experiences less scary. It helped me fit in at my new school.
544	21398	8	2	"Live to Laugh"" - You've probably seen signs that say, ""Live, Love, Laugh."" People often put them in their homes as a reminder of how to live life. I believe that laughter is one of the most essential elements for living life to the fullest. Laughter keeps the soul young, the heart happy, and the spirit joyful. Without it, one might feel an emptiness inside that's hard to fill. Laughter has been a huge part of my life and has created some of the best memories. If laughter weren't a part of me, my life would be like an empty house, boring and pointless. One of my favorite and funniest memories happened about two years ago at my grandparents' house in @CAPS7. My family and I spent the weekend there. I loved it because there was so much to do - go - carts, golf carts, large acreage, and a huge swimming pool. The weather was nice and warm, so I had no complaints. One beautiful evening, my brother, his friend @PERSON1, and I took the golf carts out. My brother was in his own cart, zooming by, and I was in one with @PERSON1. @ORGANIZATION1 must have seen something in the road, told me to stop, and then hopped out. As he walked to the front of the cart, I gently pressed the gas to scare him. He jumped on the hood like a frightened cat. I then slammed on the brakes, and @PERSON1 launched off but tried to get back on. We sort of developed a game where I'd move a bit and then brake suddenly. I was laughing so hard I was practically crying. Then, unexpectedly, when I stopped quickly, @PERSON1 tripped. I didn't notice because I was driving recklessly, but soon the cart was on top of him. All I heard was a @CAPS8 @CAPS9 and a loud shrill. He was face - down with the cart on his back, and I was shocked and didn't know what to do. My brother was rolling on the ground, laughing like a hyena. @PERSON1 was yelling, ""@CAPS10't move @CAPS11!"" I knew my brother's idea of lifting the cart wouldn't work, so I carefully shifted into reverse and pressed the gas, backing off his body. Luckily, he was okay. Looking back, I can laugh and joke about that day, and I'm thankful nothing seriously bad happened. That day, we also had a great time swimming, driving the carts, and enjoying the wind. From this experience, I learned to make smart decisions and be prepared for consequences, and most importantly, to enjoy life and laugh."
545	21399	8	2	How does one define laughter? Without laughter, there would be no smiles, no affection, no emotion, no reaction, and everyone around would seem blank. Laughter is a powerful force. It can bring people together or drive them apart. It can be a means of self - expression or a way to build barriers. Laughter can convey many things; it can show various emotions or hide them. For example, there are people who laugh when they cry, are angry, or sad. But why do they laugh at these times? They're not laughing because they're genuinely happy. They're laughing to hide the pain inside, as no one can completely expose their true feelings. Being too vulnerable can lead to getting hurt. Laughter is important in all kinds of relationships, whether it's a friendship, marriage, or engagement. Understanding how your partner is feeling through laughter can make a big difference. A single laugh or giggle can change the situation. Laughter is indeed the shortest distance between two people.
546	21403	8	2	On a specific day in middle school, the entire music department embarked on a long - awaited field trip. All eighth - grade students in band, choir, jazz band, or jazz choir were eligible, provided they paid all their funds. The destination was a large concert in LOCATION2, and they were also going to stay at a hotel and visit a CAPS4 CAPS5. My friends PERSON3, PERSON2, and PERSON4 were extremely excited as this was going to be the longest road trip they'd ever taken. They left at 5 a.m., with over a hundred kids packed into two buses, one for boys and one for girls. Due to more girls than boys, the boys' bus was split. I was seated next to CAPS6, a nice girl but difficult to start a conversation with. CAPS17 seemed upset and wanted to be back in LOCATION1. The ride was boring until PERSON3 had an accident - she snorted a pretzel up her nose. Everyone except CAPS6 laughed. After three hours on the cramped bus, the girls needed to use the restroom. The bus driver, CAPS8, said they were almost at a pit - stop. The choir girls started singing about going to the bathroom, filling the bus with laughter. When they finally stopped, the girls danced out of the restroom. After the pit - stop, they bid farewell to the boys and continued. Four hours later, they stopped at a gas station for lunch. The boys were satisfied with the progress, but they started annoying the girls, who ignored them for the rest of the trip. Upon reaching the hotel, the boys got the top floor and the girls the lower floor near the pool. At dinner time, the music director, PERSON1, allowed them to buy food from nearby stores. PERSON4 and I went to ORGANIZATION1, while PERSON3 and PERSON2 got drinks from ORGANIZATION3. They met back in their room and ate until they were full. PERSON3 danced into the bathroom with a broom as her partner, filling the room with laughter. Two hours before the concert, thirty dollars was missing. They searched the room but found nothing. They suspected a girl who had no money the day before but now did. PERSON1 then told them to get ready for the concert. On the way to the stage, I dropped my music, and PERSON2 picked it up, telling me I'd do great. I took my seat in the front of the band and played my flute solo. My stage fright vanished, and I played well. After the concert, they ran to the buses and then went to the CAPS4 CAPS5. PERSON1 paid for everyone. When the CAPS19 shock dropped, we screamed and laughed. At the end of the ride, we all laughed as if we had come CAPS2. I didn't want to leave, but I knew I had to. We took a group picture to remember the trip. Laughter had truly made this trip unforgettable.
547	21404	8	2	Laughter is an amazing thing that everyone should learn to embrace. I, for one, absolutely love laughing. It's fascinating how each person has a unique laugh - some are loud and boisterous, while others are soft, almost like a gentle giggle. I first met my boyfriend about three years ago, and we've been dating for a year and three months. We were introduced by my neighbor LOCATION1 when I was mowing the yard. It was an embarrassing moment as it was 80 degrees outside, I was hot and sweaty, had no makeup on, and smelled of fresh - cut grass. But when I looked at him and saw him blush a little, I couldn't help but laugh. From that moment, I knew our relationship was going to be special. Our relationship has only grown stronger over time, and a big part of it is our ability to make each other laugh. While trust, honesty, communication, and listening are also crucial, I firmly believe that humor and the ability to laugh together are key to a healthy and long - lasting relationship. I could be having the worst day ever, but as soon as I talk to my boyfriend on the phone, my day turns around. He always says something funny within the first few minutes, and I can't stop laughing. In a relationship, laughter is essential. Without it, a relationship can become dull and boring. You can't be serious all the time; it's too stressful. Laughter helps relieve stress and prevents a relationship from turning into a series of arguments. I know my views on laughter in a relationship might not be shared by everyone, but I hope that after reading this, you'll consider the importance of laughter. It can bring so much joy and help keep a relationship happy, fun, and full of life. Laughter truly is bliss.
548	21405	8	2	I feel that people today don't laugh enough. It's well - known that laughing is one of the healthiest things we can do. I've heard that the more you laugh, the longer you live. If that's true, I should have a very long life because I love to laugh and believe it's extremely healthy. I have a sick friend, and when I'm with her, I can make her laugh uncontrollably. It seems to ease her pain, and I'd do anything to cheer her up as often as possible. Just yesterday, we were together, and I don't remember what we were talking about, but it was so funny that I laughed so hard I threw up. Even as I was recovering from that, we were still laughing. Those are the moments I look back on with a smile. I'm amazed by the power of laughter. Once, while sitting at a bus stop, I started giggling for no reason, and the people next to me began laughing too. That made me laugh even harder, and soon, everyone around was laughing. When you're with friends or anyone, and you can laugh together, it means you're having a great time and enjoying each other's company. I don't see the point of being friends with someone who can't at least make you smile a little. The other day, my friend and I were in the car. It was dark and quiet, and we were just chatting. Suddenly, my mom popped up and shouted “CAPS1!”. We screamed our lungs out. After catching our breath, we looked at each other and laughed hysterically at how silly it was. Laughter truly brings people together, whether they're strangers or best friends. When you laugh with someone, you usually share the same sense of humor, which means you have something in common. Laughter is a wonderful force that can brighten any moment.
549	21407	8	2	Whenever I think of laughter, I'm reminded of my childhood. When I was about ten, my parents bought my siblings and me a puppy. This wasn't an ordinary puppy; it was the runt of the litter and had a mental disorder. We spent hours playing with it in the backyard every day after school. A few days later, we named the puppy CAPS5 because it would literally tip over while walking. One day, I took CAPS5 to the top of the hill in our backyard. As we played and ran around, every time CAPS5 ran down the hill, its little legs would get tangled, and it would nose - dive and tumble down until it reached the bottom. My sister and I would laugh uncontrollably because it was so cute. As children, we lived in the moment and fully enjoyed life. I believe we should still do that as adults. We need laughter and joy in our lives. We should focus on the positive aspects and not let the negative ones bring us down. The laughter of childhood should stay with us throughout our lives. We've been blessed with so much, and we often don't give enough credit for it. We should laugh in the moment, appreciate the small things in life, embrace the world around us, and love others as we've been loved. After all, we never know when our time on this earth will end.
550	21408	8	2	In life, everyone has good days and bad days. When a bad day comes, it's hard for a person to be happy or laugh. Sometimes, one has to look beyond the obvious to see the whole picture and find happiness in the people around them. Laughter can make the time we spend more enjoyable. We need to consider whether a person is full of laughter and excitement. The people who influence us can either lift our spirits or bring us down. The more we understand a person's feelings, the more laughter we can discover deep within their being. In conclusion, laughter is an important part of life. It can turn a bad day around and make our time with others more fulfilling. We should strive to find the laughter in every situation and be with people who can bring out the best in us and make us laugh.
551	21409	8	2	"Growing up with both my parents and my paternal grandparents was an absolute blessing. As a child, I spent a great deal of time at my grandparents' house. Every [@DATE1], we got out of [@CAPS1] an hour early. Throughout my elementary - school years, my grandpa would patiently wait for me outside school. He'd pick me up, and then we'd head to either [@ORGANIZATION1] or [@CAPS2]'s for lunch. I always preferred [@ORGANIZATION1] because they had a play structure.  As I grew, I developed a deep bond with my grandma and grandpa. My parents never had to worry about finding babysitters since my grandparents were always there to take care of me. This bond only grew stronger over time. I'd often do my homework with my grandma, and after finishing, I'd join my grandpa for yard - work or tinkering in the garage. A large part of my knowledge today was imparted by my grandparents. I was truly fortunate to have them in my life as a child.  Doing yard work with my [@CAPS6] (what I called my grandpa as a child) was actually quite enjoyable. I loved it. He taught me how to use the riding lawn mower at a very young age. By the time I was [@NUM1] years old, I could start the mower, mow the lawn, empty the grass catcher, and put the mower back in the garage without any assistance.  One sunny [@DATE2] day, after I finished mowing the lawn, my grandpa was sitting on the patio, sipping [@NUM2], as he always did. I grabbed one for myself and went to join him because that's where he'd watch me mow and where we'd hang out. As we sat there chatting, he asked me if I'd hooked the hose back up to the faucet. Of course, I hadn't because I wanted to sit with my [@CAPS6]. So we walked over to the faucet. For some reason, he told me to take the nozzle end to some flowers. There I was, a [@NUM1] - year - old kid, standing behind my [@CAPS6], with him bending over in front of me. I did what any other mischievous child would do. I held the nozzle up, aimed at his rear end, and pulled the trigger. After soaking his bum for about [@NUM4] seconds, I dropped the nozzle and ran as fast as I could to my grandma. When I reached her, she was puzzled as to why I was so scared. All I could say was, ""[@CAPS6] is gonna kill me!""  Just then, [@CAPS6] walked up to the front door where grandma and I were standing. He had an angry expression on his face. I thought I was in for a severe spanking. But then, all of a sudden, he broke into a huge smile, and both he and my grandma started laughing. He wasn't mad; he thought it was hilarious. Naturally, I started laughing too. [@CAPS6] went inside to change his wet pants and underwear, and then the five of us went out on the patio to relax, talk, and enjoy some [@NUM2].  After a couple of hours, my grandma went inside to make dinner. [@CAPS6] and I stayed on the patio, shooting pine cones out of the tree with a [@CAPS7] gun, competing to see who could shoot more before dinner. Grandma called us in, and that night was one of the best dinners I ever had with my grandparents. We just ate, laughed, and had a wonderful time.  My grandpa passed away about a year ago. Life hasn't been the same since. But every morning when I get into the truck he left me and start the engine, the sound brings back so many memories of him and me. Even the sound of the blinker evokes those precious moments. I know he looks down on me and remembers all the good times we shared. I truly miss those wonderful days."
552	21410	8	2	"When people think of football, the quarterback comes to mind. For basketball, it's the point guard. In soccer, it's the goalie. And when it comes to softball, the pitcher is the first position that people associate with the sport. In all these sports, one position is automatically seen as a leadership role. In softball, the game starts and often ends with the pitcher. The pitcher is involved in every play. Sometimes, the [@NUM1] - inch softball comes flying back at you in an instant after you pitch it underhand, and then you have to quickly throw it overhand to one of the four bases.  To play a major position on a team and be a successful leader, you need to be encouraging, helpful, and most importantly, able to stay calm and find humor in difficult situations. I've been pitching fast - pitch softball for ten years, and I often receive the compliment, ""You have the best pitcher's mentality I've ever seen.""  It's extremely stressful to be in a high - stakes game with the entire outcome resting on your shoulders. With three people on base, one bad pitch can result in a home run. One pitch can completely change the game! There are times when a pitch doesn't go as planned, and your teammates look at you with disappointment. As the leader, you can't show defeat. I've seen many pitchers give up and look defeated. When you're a leader, your teammates look to you for guidance. If you seem hopeless, they'll assume the game is over and start making mistakes.  By smiling and encouraging your teammates, you show them that you haven't given up, and neither should they. This approach is always better in the long run. Players tend to follow the lead of the most authoritative person on the field.  I play for a team where most players are in their second or third year. We're not a top - tier team, but we practice hard and never give up, regardless of the score. In our league, four out of the seven other teams are in the top ten in the state. One team, [@LOCATION1], was first in the state last year and played against us in our first game. By the third inning, we were losing [@NUM2]. Even though I knew we couldn't catch up, my goal was to prevent them from scoring again.  Between innings, I talked to every player on my team, using cheesy jokes and inside jokes to relieve the tension. It worked, and we played better. In stressful situations, it's important to find a way to laugh and see the bright side."
553	21411	8	2	"Laughter is essential in our lives. But why do we need it, and why is it so important? We need laughter to have a great time with our friends and family. Without it, life would be dull and colorless, and we'd feel empty inside, constantly grumpy. Laughter also plays a crucial role in relationships. Whether it's with a friend or a romantic partner, sharing laughter makes the time spent together more enjoyable.  I used to live in [@LOCATION3] until my parents decided to move to [@PERSON2]. When they told me I'd be going to [@LOCATION1], I knew a few people from there: [@NUM1] and [@PERSON1]. I only really talked to [@PERSON1] before. On my first day at [@LOCATION1], [@PERSON1] introduced his friends to me. He made up all kinds of jokes and involved me in them so that I could get to know his friends better and potentially become friends with them.  Laughter can lead to friendships and romantic relationships. I started dating in middle [@LOCATION1]. I dated three guys, and my third boyfriend was the best. He was sweet and would do anything to make me laugh. We dated for [@NUM2] years, but there was too much drama, so I broke up with him. It was difficult because I really liked him, but we still talked and made fun of each other. He remained nice to me even after the breakup.  After a year of not dating, he asked me to be his girlfriend again. I thought about it a lot because I didn't want to go through the same drama. Even when we weren't dating, he always found ways to make me laugh or smile. He'd support me when I was down. That's what I liked about him - he was sweet and nice. If only he didn't believe everything his friends told him, we'd still be together, laughing at everything.  We should always laugh and not let a relationship get us down. Smile and find the humor in life. Another way to have fun in relationships and with friends is to plan activities like going to the movies or the fair. When you're with them, make sure to make them laugh. But don't tell boring jokes. For example, my little sister told a joke: ""Guy on the [@NUM3]: 'Can I speak to your dad?' The little boy whispered, '@CAPS2 is busy!' 'What about your mom?' said the man on the phone. The kid said, '@CAPS4 is busy too!' The man asked, 'What are you all doing?' And the boy said, 'We're looking for me!' We didn't understand it at first, but it shows that jokes should be more engaging. Laughter brings joy to those who love and care for us, and when we smile, it makes them happy. Always make relationships fun by sharing laughter."
554	21412	8	2	"Have you ever found something so funny that you felt like you were going to pee your pants? Or laughed so hard that your stomach ached? Well, this happened to me during my [@NUM1]th - grade [@DATE1]. My brother [@PERSON3], my friend [@PERSON1], and I were walking through the park, just trying to have a good time. My brother was telling [@LOCATION1] a really funny joke he'd heard at school. I don't remember the joke, but I remember how funny it was. I nearly peed my pants, and it was so embarrassing, yet somehow still funny.  I told them that if they didn't stop telling jokes, I might pee my pants. But, like any brother would do, my brother kept going. He thought it was hilarious, but I found it mean and painful because I had a full bladder. My friend [@PERSON1], being kind - hearted, suggested we find a bathroom. So, off we went to look for one. My brother said, ""I think there's a bathroom up this hill. Let's check if it's open so [@PERSON2] can go.""  Little did we know that it was [@DATE2], and the bathrooms were closed for cleaning. When we reached the top of the hill, I ran to the bathroom. I'd never felt such urgency before. It was incredibly painful. But when I got there, the doors were locked. I was furious and devastated. [@PERSON3] and [@ORGANIZATION1] thought it was funny because I really had to pee and the bathroom was closed. They laughed uncontrollably.  I got tired of their laughter and decided to find another bathroom on my own. Unfortunately, the nearest one was a mile away. I was so angry that I wanted to cry, but I knew that wouldn't help. I told myself, ""I need to run."" So I ran back up the hill, across the bridge, and towards the nearest store.  Finally, I found a store. I was so relieved. I walked in and asked the clerk if I could use the restroom. They showed me the way. I walked in with my head held high, feeling like I'd accomplished something just by not peeing my pants.  When [@PERSON1] and [@PERSON3] caught up with me, they were laughing. I asked what was so funny, and they pointed at my pants. I looked down and saw water all over them. I must have gotten water on myself while washing my hands. It was so embarrassing. But to this day, when I think about that moment, I can't help but laugh because it was both embarrassing and hilarious."
555	21413	8	2	Laughter is the one characteristic that a person can truly perfect. It has the power to bring people together and form strong friendships. This is what my personal experience has taught me about laughter.  My family of four often goes camping during the [@DATE1], and family friends usually join us. A couple of summers ago, on a camping trip with my family and many friends, I experienced the life - changing power of true, rich laughter. Whether it was through sharing funny stories around the campfire, playing practical jokes on each other, or playing card games like hearts, I began to understand the significance of these moments.  My best friend and I were expecting three boys to join us for the week. When they were supposed to arrive, we started planning a secret prank. Before they could go boating on the lake, they had to set up their tent. They managed to turn a [@NUM1] - minute task into a two - hour ordeal. Once they finally finished and went swimming in the lake, my friend and I took their tent. First, we pulled out the stakes to collapse it, and then we turned it inside out. We thought it was a great way to welcome them with a sense of humor.  However, the boys didn't find it as funny. By [@TIME1] fall, they had a plan of their own. At around four in the [@TIME2], my friend and I were woken up by a very loud noise in our non - sound - proof tent. It sounded like the ducks were in a war. Later, we found out that the boys had placed sandwiches in a circle around our tent to attract the ducks.  After that prank, it was game on. We decided to zip - tie the boys' tent zippers together
556	21414	8	2	"Can you envision a life devoid of laughter? It would be overly serious, and relationships would become extremely dull. That beloved comedy? It wouldn't be funny anymore. America's [CAPS1] [CAPS2] [CAPS3], how could one not laugh! Laughter serves as a positive means of expressing emotions. What are relationships founded upon? Honesty, trust, understanding, and humor. Would you truly want to be around someone who is boring? I certainly wouldn't. I firmly believe that strong friendships and relationships require laughter to maintain their allure. Many of my relationships have originated from a joke, a bout of laughter, or my own clumsiness. I recall being in a class where I knew no one, an incredibly awkward situation. I sat at the back of the class with another person named [PERSON1]. Initially, it was quiet, with no one saying a word. So, I decided to tell an extremely cheesy joke. As soon as I finished, there was a moment of silence, and we just stared at each other. Seconds later, we erupted into uncontrollable laughter, the kind where you can't catch your breath, and your tear ducts are so overwhelmed that tears stream down your cheeks. At that moment, a sudden bond, a spark of friendship, emerged between us. From that point on, we were inseparable. For the remainder of the school year, we were partners on every project, multitasking our way through them. Half the time, we would create funny scenarios and laugh until we cried. The other half, we would draw inspiration from each other to complete fantastic projects. I am an all - around ""laughter enthusiast!"" I can find humor in the smallest things, a quality I cherish greatly. Who would have thought a silly joke could have such a profound impact? Laughter cannot be the sole element in a well - developed relationship; you also need trust, honesty, and various other qualities to maintain a healthy relationship. My point is, how can you sustain a friendship with someone you can't laugh with or be yourself around? It is human nature to laugh; one can't always be serious. I don't think I could go a single day without laughing. Laughter can be the cure for a frown. In conclusion, laugh!"
557	21415	8	2	For my family, laughter holds great significance as it indicates that my parents aren't fighting on that particular day. I was around nine years old during the week of [DATE1]. My parents had been arguing all day, and it seemed like the conflict would never end. Usually, [DATE1] was something I eagerly anticipated throughout the year, but this time, I just wanted it to be over. I detested seeing my parents fight because it always terrified my little brother. My little sister was too young to understand what was happening, but whenever they started arguing around her, she would start screaming and yelling. When my parents fought, I tried to keep my brother and sister occupied, but it didn't distract me. I still heard every word they said, and the arguing seemed interminable. My sister was about one year old, and when my parents fought, she often came into my room because it was the farthest from the source of the yelling. We would watch [CAPS1] and play games until the arguing stopped. Once, it lasted so long that she fell asleep in my room, and I ended up carrying her to her bed that night. There were numerous times when I wished my parents would stop fighting and realize that it not only upset them but also all of us. Well, the day before [DATE1] eve, my mom was at work, and my dad also had to go to work. Since my mom's workplace doesn't allow children, my dad took us with him. I could tell he had been up late as he had dark circles under his eyes and had forgotten to shave that [TIME1]. Since we were all on school break, my entire day was spent ensuring my little sister didn't get into trouble or get hurt. I had a great time at my dad's work because I loved playing with my little sister. My sister still walked unsteadily, so when we played tag, it made me laugh because she could never run fast enough, and just watching her try was hilarious. She also loved it because walking gave her more freedom, but it also got her into more mischief. On days when my dad didn't have much work, he would have me help him teach my brother how to ride a two - wheeler. It was really fun watching my brother try new things and enjoy himself. It made us all laugh that day because he was so excited and happy about being able to do something he couldn't do before. When [DATE1] eve arrived, my parents agreed to stop fighting for the next few days so that we could be happy on [DATE1] [TIME1]. However, that night, after they thought we had all gone to bed, they had a huge argument. I stayed up late watching a bunch of my favorite [CAPS2] movies. I had just turned off the [CAPS1] when I heard them yelling. I didn't get much sleep that night because of all the noise. Luckily, my brother and sister were already asleep, so I didn't have to worry about them. The next [TIME1], I didn't know what to expect from my parents. Everything was normal on [DATE1] [TIME1]. There were gifts under the tree and things in our stockings. My brother came in and woke me up, saying everyone was in the living room waiting for me. I got out of bed, put on my robe and slippers, and went to the living room. What I saw was unexpected. My brother was sorting the presents so that everyone had their own pile. My dad was laughing at my sister, who was trying to pick up a present as tall as her. My mom was in the kitchen making everyone's favorite breakfast, chocolate chip pancakes, bacon, and sausage. Everyone seemed much happier than they had been in the past few days. As we ate breakfast and opened presents, I realized this was the first [TIME1] in a while that my parents hadn't fought. It made me really happy to see them getting along. We all laughed and had a wonderful time that [DATE1] [TIME1]. The rest of the day was also great. Even though my parents are now separated, laughter remains an important part of my family. It's much better now because we have more moments of laughter and happiness rather than being upset and having to listen to them fight. Now that we are happier and laugh more, being at home is a lot more pleasant. In conclusion, I truly believe that laughter plays a significant role in any family.
558	21416	8	2	Many individuals hold the view that laughter is a crucial aspect of any relationship. There are numerous instances when even the slightest laugh can break the tension or relieve stress occasionally. It is often stated that laughter is the best and cheapest medicine. Laughter is readily available and common. In my case, laughter comes naturally to my sister and me for no specific reason. It not only salvaged but also strengthened our relationship to what it is today. When we were younger, my older sister and I did not get along well at all. She would constantly tease me and then laugh about it, while I would laugh at things that she found unfunny. This led to frequent conflicts and arguments between us. As a result, we disliked each other and, in a way, wanted nothing to do with one another. As my sister and I grew older and wiser, we started to become more similar. We still made fun of, teased, and played childish pranks on each other, but instead of getting angry, we would simply laugh it off. As we continued to make each other laugh, we found that we got along much better. Soon after, we began spending more time together for the sheer enjoyment of it, not because our parents told us to. Before we knew it, my sister and I had become best friends. It is rare to hear about siblings being best friends. I am fortunate to say that my older sister is my best friend. Personally, I believe that laughter has played a significant role in the relationship between my sister and me. Now, we rely on each other because we know that no matter what, we can always make each other laugh and cheer each other up. We hang out when we need to escape or when we have something to get off our chests. We know we can count on each other because we know we can always find humor in the situation in the end. In conclusion, laughter has truly been the cornerstone of our wonderful sibling relationship.
559	21418	8	2	"Laughter is a rather interesting emotion. One typically expects to feel it when happy or in a humorous situation. However, this isn't always the case. Some people laugh when they're embarrassed or uncomfortable, others when they're enraged or upset, and there are those who laugh when they're grieving or sad. People don't anticipate laughing when they're depressed, but it's a strange yet true phenomenon. I learned this from personal experience, which led to one of the most tragic events in my short life. I was around nine years old, an age when one is hyper and energetic almost all the time. I had just returned home from school and entered through the front door. My mom was waiting for me inside. ""Get ready,"" she said. ""We're going to visit your grandparents for a few hours."" I was upset. I was not only tired and hungry but also had to drive almost an hour to see my grandparents. So, I did what any nine - year - old would do: I cried, whined, and pleaded with her not to go. Of course, she didn't listen. She tuned me out, waited until I ran out of breath, and then picked me up and put me in the car. Taking a nap is wonderful, and that's exactly what I did on the way. I was exhausted, so I thought it was okay to have a little ""me"" time. When we arrived at my grandparents' house, I had just woken up and didn't feel like moving. I had to force myself to get up and say hello. It was a bit depressing yet fascinating to see my grandparents as it was like getting a glimpse of the future, as I could envision what I would look like when I'm old. They had delicious candy, though. We actually stayed there for quite a few hours. My mom called my dad several times, asking if we could go home, but we never left. She just talked with my grandparents while I watched TV. Finally, my dad called to say we could go home. We said goodbye and rushed out before it got too dark. By the time we got home, it was pitch - black outside. We still hadn't eaten, and I was starving. I jumped out of the car and walked to the gate separating the front and back yards. I shook the gate, expecting to see three excited dogs running up and jumping on the gate, but only two appeared. ""Where's [CAPS5]?"" I wondered. I thought he was probably eating or sleeping, so I decided to go inside and eat. When I opened the door, both my parents were standing in the entryway. I could tell they were trying to hold back tears. Then it hit me like a ton of bricks. ""[CAPS5] passed away,"" my mom said. I was stunned. I couldn't believe it. My best friend in the world was gone. I cried for hours, maybe even more. I didn't know what to do. Then, something strange happened. I started to laugh. I'm not sure why. Maybe I wanted to cheer myself up, or perhaps I realized he was in a better place. To this day, there's still an empty space in my heart where my best friend used to be. I still ponder why I laughed that day and why we laugh in general. Whether we're happy, angry, or sad, we laugh to get through both good and bad situations. Despite the tragedy, I can't help but feel a bit of relief. My best friend was in pain and could barely walk, so we had to euthanize him. I knew it was the right thing to do, and I think laughing that night actually helped me more than I expected. In conclusion, laughter can be a strange and unexpected response in difficult times, but it can also provide some comfort."
560	21419	8	2	The power of laughter is truly astonishing. A single laugh has the ability to either bring two people closer together or, if misused, drive them apart.

561	21421	8	2	"Green isn't my favorite color. Laughter is an enjoyable aspect of life that different people may or may not appreciate. Humor is infectious; the sound of roaring laughter is more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze. When people share laughter, it bonds them, enhancing happiness and intimacy. It was challenging for me to select one particular laughter - filled memory because every moment of joyous ""ha - ha - ha"" is precious. It was the @DATE1, a highly anticipated time of the year for many. I planned to host a pool party with friends, but the pool was extremely dirty after a year of various weather conditions, so I had to clean it. I didn't think it was a big deal as it was the only way to get my parents' permission for the party. I'm an average teenage girl who texts a lot, probably more than @NUM1 times a day. After spending about an hour cleaning the pool, I texted my boyfriend, intending to say ""my pool is no longer green anymore,"" but instead, I sent ""my poop is no longer green anymore."" When he replied with "".......?"", I was horrified. I checked my message history and realized my blunder. I decided to pretend it never happened. Later, the pool party started. Everyone arrived, looking at me oddly. I was excited, dancing to my favorite song by my favorite singer @NUM2. Everyone had presents, which puzzled me as it wasn't anyone's birthday, just a casual pool party. I asked my best friend, and she said that my boyfriend had texted them, saying I had green poop and wasn't feeling well, so they went to @CAPS6 to buy me @CAPS7 - @CAPS8, and @CAPS9 @CAPS10. I was both petrified and laughing uncontrollably. I told the guests what really happened, and we all laughed. After the party, as dawn approached, we had a bonfire and bonded. I saw my boyfriend, and we just laughed without mentioning the incident. Even after the friends left, the fun continued. My boyfriend took me for a burger at our local place, known for the best hamburgers in town. A mother with a baby boy came by. I held the baby, making funny faces, not knowing it had just eaten. Green vomit got all over me, but I wasn't mad or embarrassed; I just laughed so hard that I felt my abs working and tears streaming. I'll always cherish this memory, and my friends still call me ""@CAPS11""."
562	21422	8	2	"Laughter is of great significance in life for multiple reasons. It allows you to understand others through their sense of humor, express emotions, and strengthen relationships. Memories filled with laughter are often the most vivid and cherished. I firmly believe the quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" holds true for most. I have numerous laughter - filled memories with my friends, family, and loved ones. When I was six and my brother was nine, we were typical siblings who didn't always get along. We were both outgoing and always needed to be occupied. When we did get along, we had so much fun, often rolling around laughing and forgetting our disagreements. We played various games like hide - and - seek inside and outside the house, tag, board games, and our favorite, tickle monster. Sometimes our friends joined, but it was mainly a family activity. We often asked our dad to play, and he usually agreed as he loved seeing us laugh and create memories. One of my favorite game - playing times was when we started with hide - and - seek at home. My brother and I would cram into small spaces like under the sink, beds, or in closets. Dad, being bigger, would hide in the shower or behind doors. He was easy to find, but it was still fun, and we laughed every time we located him. Once, when it was his turn to hide, my brother and I went to my room to count. Impatient as we were, we didn't count to the number he specified. We ran downstairs, found him behind the bathroom door. Instead of coming out, he chased us around the house. We were caught off - guard, laughing and running, struggling to breathe. Eventually, he caught us, and our hide - and - seek turned into an amazing game of tickle monster. Laughter has always been a vital part of my life. It helps me connect with others and brings me immense happiness. I'll always treasure these memories with my family."
563	21424	8	2	"Laughter is an expression of happiness, self - expression, and sharing feelings. It can be shared with anyone, whether a stranger or an old acquaintance. Last year, my close friend @LOCATION1 and I spent a lot of time together. We could find humor in the smallest things and easily share our laughter. One day in class, while reading, I turned around to see @LOCATION1 sleeping with drool coming out of her mouth. I tried not to laugh but started giggling. When I poked her awake, her hair was stuck to her face. It was so funny that I couldn't contain myself. I showed her in the mirror, and she started laughing too. The teacher asked if we had a problem, and we just giggled and said no. The next day, on our way to the commons after returning from @ORGANIZATION1, we heard a girl with purple - faded dyed hair and protruding teeth say, ""is that all you do is talk crap about your sister?"" @LOCATION1 and I were shocked and started laughing after we were out of earshot. We called her ""girl with purple hair"" and laughed about it for the rest of the year. A few weeks later, we saw @LOCATION1's former boyfriend with a group of girls. One girl was hanging all over him. She had greasy, short hair and wore clothes that were too small, exposing half of her upper body. @LOCATION1 said he had downgraded, and we laughed at the girl's behavior. The next day in class, I made a comment about someone being stupid. Another student tried to get me in trouble, but the teacher favored me, and the other student got in trouble instead. The vice - principal called me to the office. I explained the situation, and he said I wasn't in trouble as the other student was trying to start an issue. We laughed at the failed attempt. Laughter is essential in life. It helps us express our emotions and feel good. I'm grateful to have @LOCATION1 and others who share laughter with me, helping me through various situations."
564	21425	8	2	Many people claim that those who laugh more live longer. When I was ten, I decided to learn how to ride a bike. My brother said I didn't need training wheels. Seeing other kids ride their bikes gave me the courage to try, despite my fear. It was a perfect day to learn. As I walked downstairs all prepared, I felt nervous. Outside, my brother was waiting with a helmet and the bike. He explained the basic rules. I got on the bike, feeling confident. But as I gave the first pedal, I fell hard. All I wanted was to run home and cry on my mom's lap. I looked up at my brother, and instead of crying, I laughed. I knew crying wouldn't ease the pain or teach me to ride. I got back on the bike and pedaled, laughing all the way. My brother said laughter is the best medicine. I believe that laughter helped me achieve my goal of learning to ride a bike. In my life, laughing, smiling, and having fun are important. We shouldn't take life too seriously all the time.
565	21426	8	2	When I was adopted, I had many uncertainties. I wondered what my new @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 were like, what the home would be like, and if they would like me. I was told I'd have two new sisters, @PERSON2 and @CAPS3. Sitting in the passenger seat of the black @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS4, my heart raced as we got closer to my new home. As we approached the driveway, I saw a well - laid - out, one - story blue house. A tall, well - built man, @CAPS5, who seemed to have just come from work, opened the door. He was very welcoming and introduced himself. A white pit bull named @CAPS6 greeted me. To the right was @CAPS3, a little taller than me. I was a year older, so having a little sister seemed fun. At first, I didn't notice her observing me, but when I did, she gave me a big smile, showing her beautiful teeth. When I met @PERSON1 (@CAPS1), I immediately felt accepted. She was also a bit taller and very pretty. They told me I'd meet @PERSON2, my older sister, the following @DATE1 as she was at college in @LOCATION1 at @ORGANIZATION1. We stood in the kitchen, chatting to get to know each other. I was talkative, though feeling anxious. I asked about the rules, and they said they'd never had to ground any of the girls; I just needed to respect everyone. @CAPS2 then gave me a tour of the house. My room was being used as a storage room, so I had to stay with @CAPS3 for a few weeks. The rain prevented @CAPS2 from moving the things outside, so he built a desk for the computer in the bay window. Eventually, the office was converted into my room, and the bay window area became an office for @CAPS2's business. As the weeks passed, I became more comfortable. Dinner was my favorite part of the day as @CAPS1 was a great cook. She took me to counseling sessions to ease my transition into the family. I'd never felt so loved before. It was easier to talk to @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, but harder to connect with @CAPS3. I was always worried about saying the wrong thing. She was often busy with friends or homework. It was at a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS18 @CAPS19 fundraiser that things changed. @CAPS3 invited her friend @PERSON3, and I paid for their ice cream. When @ORGANIZATION2's @ORGANIZATION1 friends left @CAPS3, I saw the hurt in her eyes. I told her a funny story, and she responded with one of her own. We talked and laughed, enjoying each other's company. I later learned from the counselor that laughter can bring people together in unexpected ways. Now, @CAPS3 and I are very close, even playing pranks on each other. I truly love my little sister @CAPS3.
566	21427	8	2	Laughter holds a remarkable ability to uplift us in various life situations, be it when we're angry, sad, nervous, or mourning. It can stem from reminiscing about good times with old friends or finding humor in seemingly distressing scenarios. Throughout my life, when faced with upsetting events, the people close to me often helped me see the brighter side by making me laugh.  A specific incident occurred when I was around nine years old. In school, kids sometimes say thoughtless and hurtful things. One day, while I was working on an art project in class with three other kids, a boy started boasting about his toughness and muscular build. Then, he turned to me and said, “You're not in shape; you're fat.” This comment crushed me, and I tried hard to act as if it didn't bother me, but I couldn't stop those hurtful words from echoing in my head. I began to tear up, and by the time the school day ended, I was eager to get home to people who wouldn't say such mean things.  As I got off the bus, my emotions were on the verge of overflowing. When my mom opened the door, I burst into tears. She asked what had happened, and through my sobs, I recounted the whole terrible scene. She felt sorry for me and asked for the boy's name. I told her it was [PERSON1]. To my surprise, she started laughing and said, “That chubby kid with the buck teeth? Oh, honey, don't let that bother you. He isn't in shape at all.” I started to laugh too, realizing that he did have buck teeth. The tears stopped, and I suddenly saw the whole situation in a different light. He was being thoughtless and bragging about himself, and his statement wasn't even true. I wasn't fat.  Laughter helped me realize that the situation wasn't as bad as I thought. I was still a bit embarrassed, but I got over it. It also distracted me from what [PERSON1] had said. Even though he was thoughtless, I wouldn't have said anything mean about his flaws. Laughing about his buck teeth made me feel better and showed me that I was making a big deal out of a small thing. Laughter truly is a powerful tool that can turn a negative situation around.
567	21428	8	2	To laugh, one must be happy. I used to be happy until I made some mistakes. These mistakes disappointed me more than anything else I could think of. Now, because of my actions, I'm in a place I don't want to be.  My life was perfect before. I had my brothers, my parents, and the love of my life. Looking back, I realize that nothing is worth being separated from them. What hurts the most is missing out on all the laughs. I could be at home or at school right now, but instead, I'm here, away from my loved ones.  I try to put on a smile, even though I know I'm supposed to be happy. My life was one of the best anyone could ask for, but I ruined it because of my actions. I cherished every moment I spent with my beautiful girl, and now I have to wait to share a laugh with her.  I get only forty - five minutes to an hour and a half each day to talk to her and my family. It's incredibly painful because the phone connection is so bad that it's hard to hear them. Knowing that my actions have affected my family, especially my brothers, is heart - wrenching. My little brother [CAPS1] cries on the phone because he can't see me, and just writing about it makes me want to break down. I almost did in front of the other kids here.  My family is my top priority. When I get out, I'll make sure to get back on track for them. I want to have all those laughs that I'm missing now. At [DATE1], I never thought I'd end up here, but when I get home, I'll make my brothers and parents smile. And when I see my girl, I'll give her the biggest kiss of her life, making her cry and laugh.
568	21429	8	2	The [CAPS1] - inspirational, [CAPS2] [CAPS3] of [CAPS4] leads me to ponder the concept of laughter. What exactly is laughter? Some might say, “Well, that's obvious. Laughter is a sound emitted from a person when they think something is funny!” That's a reasonable response, but I believe laughter has a much deeper meaning. I'll explain this through a somewhat humorous and less - than - inspirational story about my experience as a [CAPS9] - [CAPS10] - [CAPS11] basketball player.  This year, as a high - school sophomore, I decided to try out for the basketball team. I was motivated by a desire to be more involved in the school and to exercise during the rainy winter months when the basketball season took place. Having only played basketball in middle school to avoid the “sit - outs” zone, my performance in the early practices was abysmal. It was like a high - school dropout trying to calculate the orbits of planets without a calculator.  That year, the coaches informed us that seven unlucky players would be cut from the team. By sheer determination, I improved enough in the first few weeks to be considered “better than dirt” by the coaches, barely keeping my spot on the team.  As the season went on, I realized that my role wouldn't be making baskets or stealing balls. My ability to imagine myself playing basketball far exceeded my actual skills on the court. I soon found myself on the sidelines, sitting on the bench while my teammates played.  Our team had a hard time competing against other teams. As each game passed, I could see the fighting spirit leaving my teammates' eyes. Their morale was dropping, and my limited ball - playing abilities couldn't change that.  There was one particular game, a home game in our lower gym. We were down by about [NUM1] points against a team we had previously struggled against. The players were extremely frustrated. One of our star players, [PERSON2], was so angry that the coaches pulled him out for a break. He was raging and swearing, and he plopped down on the bench like an enraged walrus. His mom came down from the stands to give him water, which only embarrassed him more.  Sitting next to [PERSON2], I could feel his anger. He was ranting about [NUM2], the opposing team's point guard. I noticed that while [NUM2] was a good player with fast legs and swift hands, his high - pitched voice was more suited for singing [ORGANIZATION1] songs than calling out plays. I told [PERSON2] this, and after a moment of looking at me with a mix of anguish and annoyance, he burst out laughing. He clapped me on the back and said, “[PERSON1], you always know how to make us laugh.”  That's when I realized that my banter and sarcasm could keep my teammates in good spirits. I could use laughter to diffuse tense situations and help my teammates stay positive.  We lost most of our games that season, but I made it my duty to keep the team's morale up. As the weeks passed, I felt more like an integral part of the team. Making my teammates laugh helped them clear their minds of anger and frustration and play to the best of their abilities.  Some players had quick hands or a great shot, but my strength was making people laugh. I gave my friends the ability to see the light in difficult situations. I didn't get an athletic award, but I found satisfaction in making people smile and watching their anger and despair disappear. Laughter pushed my teammates past their negative emotions and helped them perform better. So, is laughter just a noise when something is funny, or is it something more? It's definitely something more.
569	21431	8	2	Laughter is an important part of life, and different laughs can convey various meanings. For example, you can often tell if someone is being sarcastic or sympathetic just by the way they laugh. I'm going to share the time my friend fell into a [NUM1] pond.  In early [DATE1], my friend came to visit me for a week. On the third morning, it had snowed seven inches overnight. I was used to the snow, but my friend, who was from [LOCATION1], had never seen it before. As she listed all the things she wanted to do that day, she let out the most anxious laugh I'd ever heard. I could tell she was eager to go outside right away, even though I'd told her it would be colder than she expected.  We bundled up in layers of clothes, including socks, pants, shirts, and jackets, and headed out. As we walked down the snowy hill, she spotted the [NUM1] pond on the lower part of my property and ran towards it. She asked if we could go swimming, and I laughed sarcastically and said, “No way!”  She then walked towards a large log that crossed the water and decided to cross it. She threatened to push me in if I didn't go with her, so I stepped back. She just looked down and kept walking. When she stepped onto the ice - covered log, she got a bit cocky and started jumping around to show me it was “fun.” I laughed at her funny movements and whispered, “You're going to fall.”  Suddenly, she slipped, and the ice cracked, making a sound like glass shattering on a cement floor. It was like watching in slow motion as she reached out for the log before falling into the freezing water. I quickly ran over and slowly pulled her out of the pond.  After I got her out, we both burst out laughing, even though her teeth were chattering and her clothes were soaked. I knew she would cherish this moment as it was her first snow experience.  As we walked back to the house, she giggled and said, “I should have listened to you, huh?” I nodded and suggested we take off her wet clothes and put them in the dryer. We changed into pajamas and spent the day sipping hot chocolate and coffee, sharing laughter and smiles. This day will always be special to me because it gave me so many stories to tell.
570	21432	8	2	Laughter can form a strong bond between people and turn an uncomfortable situation into a pleasant one. A great example of this is when I first met my mother's boyfriend. My father died when I was thirteen, and since then, I had stubbornly resented every man my mother tried to introduce into our lives. This changed when my two sisters and I had dinner with [ORGANIZATION1].  One [DATE1] [TIME1], my mother announced that she had invited her new boyfriend over to meet her children. My sisters and I had to clean the house from top to bottom, while my mother cooked a huge pan of lasagna. When the house was clean and the dinner was ready, I dressed for what I thought would be a terrible occasion. My overly particular mother made me change clothes at least thirty times before she thought I looked presentable enough to meet the man I was starting to despise.  At exactly six thirty in the [TIME2], [PERSON1]'s blue [ORGANIZATION2] pulled into our driveway. I gave my mother a cold look as I opened the door for him, and thus, a dreaded dinner began.  When I saw [PERSON1], my hatred started to soften a bit, but it was still there. He was tall and tan, a few years older than my mother, judging by his wrinkled skin and the silver in his hair and mustache. He had a friendly and likable appearance.  My mother, now excited, and my sullen sisters and I sat down to eat with this cheerful stranger. My younger sister was the first to warm up to him. They both loved snakes, lizards, and other things I find creepy. Their common interest brought them together quickly. My older sister also liked him after a lively conversation about football. They discovered they were both [CAPS1] fans and formed a bond over their team.  After winning over my sisters, [PERSON1] tried to charm me. He talked about movies, music, sports, animals, and even politics, but nothing could melt my icy attitude. I was determined to hate him from the start, and no amount of his charisma could change my mind. Eventually, he gave up on me and focused on entertaining those who already liked him.  During dessert, he started a stand - up comedy routine in the form of a story about his recent flight to [LOCATION1]. He talked about the ridiculous security checks, the overly cheerful flight attendants who probably hated their jobs, and the corny safety videos. I started laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes, even though I remembered my vow to hate him. I tried to regain my cold demeanor, but his sense of humor was too strong. He gave me a triumphant smile and a wink, and I knew he had won.  By the end of the night, we were good friends. Later, [PERSON1] and I found that we had similar tastes in movies and music, but our common interests were just an added bonus. It was laughter that brought us together.  [PERSON1] and my mother are still together, and since he came into our lives, laughter has become a constant presence. Laughter truly has the power to break down barriers and create lasting relationships.
571	21433	8	2	On a warm [DATE1] [CAPS1], I went out with some friends to the [CAPS3]. Our plan was to stroll around, check out the cool stores, have lunch, and then head to the park by the river near the [CAPS3]. We all met at the bus - stop by the movies. [PERSON3], [PERSON4], [PERSON2], [CAPS5] and I were present. First, we visited [CAPS6] [CAPS7]. Inside, I found a small, grey dress covered in skulls that I adored. However, it cost [MONEY1], which I didn't have, so we left. Next, we went to [NUM1] [CAPS10]. [PERSON3] and I made a black teddy [PERSON1] with a studded leather jacket, gave it an awesome top - hat, and named it [CAPS11] [PERSON1]. We thought it was funny as it was a bit scary rather than the typical cute teddy. We paid [MONEY2] for it and continued our adventure. When it was lunchtime, we got Chinese food from [ORGANIZATION1], left the [CAPS3], and went towards the park. Before reaching the park, we stopped under the bridge. There were rock towers everywhere, so we built our own. It almost reached my height before toppling over, nearly hitting [PERSON4]. We followed a path to a small beach by the river. We decided to eat lunch there. After lunch, [CAPS5] started a pine - cone war by hitting me on the head. Soon, everyone was involved. [PERSON4], with better aim, was hitting everyone. We teamed up on him. As he backed away, he tripped and fell into the shallow water. We all laughed heartily. [Jesica] recorded the whole thing, and when we showed it to [PERSON4], he also laughed. After that, we went to the park. We all ran for the slide. [PERSON3] wanted to go first. I suggested we all go down the big, swirly slide together. We tried it, with [PERSON3] first, followed by me, [PERSON2], [PERSON4], and [CAPS5]. We ended up in a pile at the bottom, laughing hysterically. When it was time to go home, we gathered our things and headed to the bus stop. In the end, it was an even better [CAPS1] than we expected. Laughter and joy are essential in life. Without laughter, it's hard to express extreme happiness or find humor in things. The ability to laugh makes a person enjoyable to be around. Do you laugh often enough?
572	21434	8	2	One time, I went [CAPS1] - wheeling with [PERSON3], [PERSON5], [PERSON1], and [PERSON4]. Here's who was in which trucks: [PERSON2] and I were in my [CAPS2] [NUM1], [PERSON1] and [PERSON4] were in his tracker [NUM1], and [PERSON3] and [PERSON5] were in his [NUM3] - wheel - drive jeep [CAPS3]. As we started descending the mountain, [PERSON3] let [PERSON5] drive. [PERSON5] has poor eyesight as she wears glasses, and it's hard for her to see at night. I was following them. When we reached the pavement, [PERSON5] drove quite fast on that narrow, curving road, as it was her first time on it. At a sharp corner, the jeep got on two wheels and flipped right in front of me. I had to slam on the brakes to avoid hitting them. I turned off my truck and rushed to help [PERSON5] out. When I turned back to help [PERSON3], he was already on top of the truck. He looked at [PERSON5] and said, “Look at what you did to my truck. I've tried many times to roll it and never could. Damn you!” We all started laughing. I got a chain from my truck and pulled the jeep back over. Then it was quiet, and [PERSON4] farted, making us laugh again. [PERSON3] found a hole in his radiator. I had to pull his heavy truck back to his house in [CAPS1] - wheel drive, which limits the speed to under thirty to avoid breakage. It was a long drive. When we reached his house, his dad came out. He was very angry as the truck was a graduation present. But he calmed down when he realized no one was hurt. We went inside, had dinner, and went to bed. The moral is to be careful as unexpected things can happen.
573	21436	8	2	We all know the benefits of laughter. Many believe it's an important part of relationships. Can one be happy without laughing? I've never gone a day without laughing and am well - aware of its benefits. Laughter is truly amazing. It can bring people together, mend relationships, and brighten someone's day. In ninth grade, my best friend and I had an argument because I didn't invite him to our basketball team for an annual tournament. After talking and him cracking jokes, everything was fixed. Laughter can relieve tension and make things less serious. It also helps in making friends. Around the world, simple laughter can unite people. Even with enemies, it might show you something likable in them. Laughter is great for health, a proven fact. When stressed about a test or other things, laughter is a good stress - reliever. You can find something funny on the internet, hang out with friends, or do other things that make you laugh. A famous [CAPS1] [CAPS2] [CAPS3] uses laughter to calm his pre - show nerves. If you're feeling down or stressed, a good laugh can help. It can bond you with friends and improve a bad day. Laughter has been beneficial for me, and it helps you too, whether you realize it or not. Your laughter can also benefit others. Next time you're down, have fun with friends or do something enjoyable to have a good laugh.
574	21437	8	2	Laughter is crucial when meeting others. Even a faint smile can transform a person's image. Some people practice laughter to present a better self. I believe laughter reflects one's personality. You can show discomfort through nervous chuckles or sarcasm by laughing emotionlessly like a robot. Laughter can convey a lot. Friendships often form when people have commonalities and agree. Laughter is the best way to show agreement. As an [CAPS1], I struggled to express emotions through laughter. Many [CAPS2] people don't know that [CAPS1] can't smile as well as white people due to less - developed facial muscles. So, others think [CAPS4] are always angry and humorless, leading to misunderstandings about my laughter. When I laugh, it looks unnatural. When I first came here in the middle of the semester, I couldn't speak [CAPS5] well and had no friends. In [LOCATION1], I made friends by making them laugh, but here, I didn't know how. I had to listen to others' conversations to understand their sense of humor. When I made my first friend, I still had trouble laughing. I didn't understand what they were talking about and didn't know when to laugh. It was depressing living without a sense of humor. I stopped laughing as I thought laughing alone was stupid. I studied the country's culture and watched more TV. Eventually, I understood the slang and could laugh with others. I was happy to make others laugh and made many friends. Although I still don't understand everything they laugh about, I laugh with them, which makes me feel included. A research on laughter and life shows that laughing more leads to a longer life. Even fake laughter can be healthy. There are groups of people who laugh together for health. At first, it seemed strange, but it shows people's efforts for well - being. Fake laughter can make everyone happy and cover mistakes. There are many ways to laugh in the world. A small or fake laugh can create a better society and a better life.
575	21438	8	2	Some people love laughing, while others don't. I'm one of those who love it and laugh when my [CAPS1] tell good jokes. I think laughter is important as it makes you feel good and that everything is okay. You usually laugh the most with your [CAPS1], who support you when you're down and try to make you laugh. My best friend [PERSON3] and I always laugh, especially when we have a class together. We have fun in class, pay attention, but our laughter can distract others. Our sophomore - year teacher, [PERSON1], said we were very giggly, which was a good thing. She had never seen anyone laugh so much in her class. For example, when studying vocabulary, the word “countenance” made us laugh because it reminded us of the TV show [CAPS1]. Every time that word came up, we laughed so hard our stomachs hurt. Even now as juniors, we still laugh at the memory. [PERSON3] and I find ways to make boring things fun. Some teachers appreciate our fun in class, while others don't. In [CAPS2] [CAPS3] last year, our teacher [PERSON2] was angry because we were laughing. We were paying attention but laughed while working. He made a sitting chart, but it didn't stop us from talking and laughing with others. When he thought we weren't paying attention, he asked us questions, and we answered correctly. We still managed to get each other's attention and laugh. Every day at lunch with my [CAPS1] at school, we're always laughing. People who don't know me well think I'm crazy, but I'm just being myself and optimistic. [PERSON3] and I say “[CAPS4] sad panda's today” when we see a friend looking sad. Our synchronized laughter makes our [CAPS1] laugh more. Laughter is important as it feels good and relieves stress. As health teachers say, it takes more muscles to frown than to smile.
576	21440	8	2	"Laughter is often regarded as a universal ""cure."" Throughout life, people tend to underestimate its power. For me, laughter and joy have always been effective means to better understand others. I utilize laughter to build a connection with others, allowing us to share thoughts and feelings on a deeper level.  Laughter plays a crucial role in life. It helps individuals find those with similar interests, fosters good relationships among compatible people, and contributes to the creation of stories that can be recounted later. In life, there will always be someone or a group of people who can enjoy similar things. I have participated in numerous social groups, and in most of them, laughter is a common bond. Without this shared interest, the presence of laughter in life would be diminished.  Laughter is beneficial in daily life. People discover common interests through it and establish new relationships, which can be manifested among coworkers, authorities, friends, and family. As someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Relationships are built on laughter and the enjoyment of being with others, and they are formed at a social level with friendly individuals. Without these relationships, people would miss out on many good times in life. These relationships also serve as a platform for sharing life stories.  In my life, I have experienced both good and bad times. The bad times include the deaths of my great - grandparents on both sides of the family and the early death of a friend who was riding an all - terrain vehicle. However, the good times have been truly remarkable. Most of my conversations with friends have been unforgettable, and laughter is the key element in these conversations.  When I first started my relationship with @PERSON1, all I wanted was to enjoy the time we spent together. On the first day we hung out, we couldn't stop laughing. Everything either of us did or said was hilarious. Our common love for laughter brought us closer. At basketball games, we tried to spend as much time as possible together, getting to know each other better through shared laughter.  In conclusion, laughter helps people find those with common interests, build good relationships, and create life stories. It can be used on a personal level to get closer to others and is an essential element in daily life and relationships."
577	21441	8	2	"An argument is defined as ""A discussion in which disagreement is expressed."" In many cases, a metaphorical ""gap"" forms between the two conflicting parties. Without a way to bridge this gap, the two groups or individuals will continue arguing until one concedes and accepts the other's point of view. Laughter can serve as this bridge.  One day, after an initially pleasant time with one of my oldest friends, I returned home and slammed the door shut before going straight to my room. I couldn't remember what the argument was about, but I was determined never to speak to him again. However, being young, such thoughts rarely lasted. We saw each other every school day, but during the fight, he was like a non - existent person to me.  In elementary school, there were many group activities. When paired with my friend with whom I was on bad terms, things became extremely difficult. Whether it was building something, writing together, or solving math problems as a group, communication and teamwork were essential, and our fight affected the group negatively. We would discuss the task with other group members who were not involved in the fight, and they would act as intermediaries between us. It was a chaotic and inefficient situation.  Outside the classroom, the fighting continued. At recess, we refused to be on the same team or even on the same side of the field. After about a week, I realized this had to stop. I tried to talk to him calmly at recess, but it ended in a shouting match, and I lost.  When I got home, my mother noticed something was wrong and asked me about it. After some resistance, I told her. She lectured me about being mature and calmly talking out our differences, but I had already tried that. I tuned her out, imagining his mother giving him the same speech. All I got from the lecture was the need to try again.  The next day at recess, I went looking for him with the intention of resolving the issue. When I found him and tried to talk, it again turned into a shouting match. Nearby friends gathered, and we kept yelling. Suddenly, my friend started laughing. I was shocked and tried to figure out what could have caused this. Then I realized I had accidentally made a joke during the yelling. This realization made me laugh, and soon everyone around us was laughing.  After the laughter subsided, we sat down and talked things out rationally. We questioned why we had been fighting over something so trivial. After about five minutes of discussion, we agreed to remain friends and to talk things out before shouting in the future. When the recess ended, I walked back to class feeling happy and relieved.  It's clear that laughing during an argument doesn't solve problems on its own. However, it can bridge the gap between two parties and provide a common ground for problem - solving."
578	21442	8	2	Whenever I meet someone new, there's always a small barrier to overcome before we can truly get to know each other. My nervous laugh, which is almost like a giggle, is a part of me. Others notice it right away when they first meet me. Sometimes, it helps them get to know me faster, but at other times, it seems to be an obstacle.  People usually comment on my laugh when they meet me. Some are slightly taken aback by it, while others open up and joke around easily. They always tell me about how odd it is, how often I do it, and what it sounds like, as if I've never been informed before. But I don't mind. I don't even hear myself laughing, and I don't think it's a bad thing.  When people seem thrown off by my laugh, I get more awkward and try to control it, which often leads to me laughing even more. If it makes them laugh and they don't make fun of me, I just let it flow, and it becomes easy to get to know that person.  I never truly realized how strange my laugh was until one weekend at the beach. I was on a beach retreat with my youth group, and one of the activities was a video scavenger hunt. We went around town taking videos of various things, including playing rock - paper - scissors with a stranger. When we watched the videos later, I saw and heard how weird my voice, laugh, and mannerisms were with strangers. People had mentioned it to me before, but seeing it for myself was a revelation.  Another instance was when I was working at @LOCATION1 on @DATE1. During ice - breaker games, everyone on my team seemed a bit off - put by me. I was confused until someone straightforwardly told me about my laugh. However, by the end of the first week, I was the one who knew everyone on the team the best.  Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. This distance can either be quickly bridged or made greater, depending on how people react to it. When both people join in the laughter, the distance disappears. But if one person doesn't participate or doesn't like the other's laugh, the distance increases significantly, making it hard to build a connection.  In conclusion, laughter can either bring people closer or push them apart. We should all be able to laugh together and share in each other's joy, as it has the power to break down barriers and build relationships.
579	21443	8	2	"Every time I walk down the hall at school and see a couple, they are either laughing together or engaged in other activities that might not fit my idea of a ""test"" relationship. I'm certain that the couples voted the cutest at our school are the ones who laugh with each other. Laughter not only helps form couples, which can lead to families and the next generation but also creates friendships in schools, families, and other activities. That's why I personally believe that laughing is the most powerful action a person can take.  All my friends and I have laughed together. One particular friend and I have grown closer since we met. When I was young, I was very eager to go to church. Being shy, church was a place where I could socialize without much hesitation. One day, I saw a girl sitting in the back corner, looking scared, just as I might have been in a different situation. My parents always encouraged me to be more social and said I should go out of my way to meet new people. So, for the first time in my life, I said ""hi"" to her. She told me her name, but then I reverted to my shy self and walked away, too scared to talk to her or anyone else again.  This all happened when I was in third grade. As time passed, things changed. About @NUM1 years later, a new church opened with a class for children of all ages. I became one of the regulars in that classroom. One day, I was the only one from my age group who showed up on time. I saw a girl being forced by her dad to enter the class. It took me a while to recognize her, but then I realized it was the same girl who was scared in church before. She clearly recognized me too. I made a hand gesture inviting her in, and then she smiled and started laughing a little. That's when I knew I had met someone special.  Now, every time I see her, she smiles. I know she will be a long - term friend. Laughter can't be put into a simple definition, but it can be engraved in our memories for a lifetime. I know this because even after so many days, I still cherish those memories.  In conclusion, laughter is a great way to tell if someone is a true friend, a potential partner, or someone to be forgotten. It has the power to bring people together and create lasting bonds."
580	21444	8	2	I was hanging out with my friends at the park. We were chatting about life and school, and it was really fun. Then we started playing games and running around. We laughed so hard that we knew we'd have to go to the bathroom when we got home.  After getting tired, we lay on the grass and watched the clouds. We pointed out all the clouds that were in funny shapes, like people's faces. It was so amusing that we started making funny voices to go with the clouds as they drifted by. We had a blast just lying there, laughing and watching the clouds.  When we got home, we drank some water and went to the bathroom. Then we played the Wii and laughed some more. It was a really enjoyable time.  Laughter is like medicine. It makes all the bad things seem better and helps you feel good when you're down. You just need to find something that makes you happy, and that can make you laugh. Life wouldn't be the same without laughter. It's what keeps the world going.  Do you like to laugh? Does it make you feel better when you're down and don't know what to do? There are ways to make yourself feel better and to have a more fulfilling life, and laughter can put a smile on your face and on the faces of others. It's really nice to make other people feel good.  In conclusion, laughter is an essential part of life. It can turn a bad day around, bring people closer, and spread happiness. We should all look for reasons to laugh and share that joy with others.
581	21446	8	2	Once upon a time, when I was in @NUM1 grade, an incident occurred that left a lasting impression on me. One day, a friend and I were laughing uncontrollably when a kid slipped on the wet floor and started crying. The janitor had been mopping the floor, and the boy, not paying attention, had fallen right on it and gotten soaked. It turned out that the janitor was a rather mean - spirited person. He was angry at the boy for stealing from the school janitor's closet, and the boy was also mad at the janitor for his meanness. When our teacher caught us laughing, she informed us that the boy was not mentally stable. Immediately, I felt remorse and apologized to the boy. I explained that my laughter was just a spontaneous reaction and that I meant no harm. To my surprise, the boy was able to laugh at himself, and we became friends after that. This small event in my life has had a profound positive impact on me. I've learned not to be so quick to laugh at others' misfortunes. After all, no one is perfect, and everyone is unique in their own way. The world is full of differences, and there will always be conflicts, but we should strive to be more empathetic.
582	21447	8	2	One rainy @DATE1 @TIME1, I woke up to my dad asking me to make him breakfast. As I cooked hash - browns, eggs, and toast, I thought about our rocky father - daughter relationship and how little time we spent together. I came up with the idea of going to the movies with him. When I presented this idea to him after bringing his breakfast, he said he'd think about it and told me to start my chores. After finishing my chores, I got on Facebook and chatted with my cousin @CAPS1. I was excited to share that I might finally spend more time with my dad at the movies. As 5 p.m. rolled around, I went to ask my dad when we'd leave. He said around 8 p.m., but I had a sinking feeling that we wouldn't go. When I left his room and walked downstairs, I couldn't hold back my tears. I curled up in my @CAPS2 - boy chair in the living room, waiting for 8 p.m. When it arrived, I was extremely disappointed. My dad said we'd go the next day, but he'd bring a friend. His friend was going to see his daughter (my friend since age three) at a gymnastics meet, which I didn't mind. However, I was unhappy about someone else joining us at the movies because I wanted quality time with my dad. Feeling dejected, I went downstairs and cried in my chair. I thought it might be my fault. So, I reached out to my cousin, who has a strong relationship with me filled with laughter. At first, his attempts to reassure me didn't work. Then, he started doing and saying silly things to make me laugh. He even joked about eating my kitty if I didn't smile. I started giggling, and he kept it up until I was laughing so hard that I was struggling to breathe. My cousin has always been able to turn my frown upside down, and I can do the same for him. He's not just my cousin but also my best friend, and his presence gives me the love I need from my family. I'll always cherish our bond and the memories we share, and this incident has made me realize the importance of such relationships.
583	21448	8	2	One day, my brother showed a YouTube video to our family, and it became a source of great laughter. The video was a guy sharing a childhood memory. His dad had sent him to the store to buy bread for dinner and told him to stay out of trouble. To avoid a group of boys who looked like trouble down the block, the dad advised him to cross the street. The boy followed his dad's instructions, but when he passed the boys, they stopped him. One of the boys shouted, and a bunch of their friends came running out of a barbershop across the street and surrounded him. He managed to break free and ran as fast as he could. He claimed that he ran so fast that he passed a @ORGANIZATION1; he went from being behind it to running in front of it on his way home. When he got home and told his dad what had happened, the dad only asked if he'd gotten the bread. The guy was upset that his dad was more concerned about the bread than his well - being. The way the guy recounted this story was hilarious. Even though my brother had shown me the video the night before, we both found it just as funny the second time, and so did the rest of my family. We couldn't help but burst out laughing at various points. Laughter is a wonderful way to bring families together, and this video was a perfect example of that.
584	21449	8	2	One day, my friend Spencer and I woke up late. His two - year - old brother came into the room, screaming “bro bro” at the top of his lungs. Spencer calmed him down, and we started watching TV. We discussed our plans for the day and decided to play games first and go swimming later. Spencer's mom asked when we'd go swimming and reminded us to take his little brother. So, we went early so the little one could swim while we sat around and listened to music. I used my brand - new phone to listen to music because it allowed me to text and easily answer calls. I was really enjoying having this new phone. After dropping off his little brother, we went back to the pool and sat in the hot tub. I placed my phone on my shirt and covered it with a towel. When Spencer took the towel to use, he jerked it out, and my phone flew up, hit the ground, and slid all the way to the hot tub. I panicked when I saw it. I quickly took it out, removed the back, and dried the battery with the towel, hoping it would still work. But it kept dialing 0 and 9, so I took the battery out again. When we got back to his mom's place, I plugged in the charger without the battery. Spencer kept apologizing, and I told him it was okay. The next morning, his mom asked why we didn't use a pot of rice to dry the phone. We started laughing because we'd panicked so much over the phone. In the end, I forgot about the stress and just kept laughing. The phone ended up working, and it became one of the funniest stories in my life, showing how small mishaps can turn into great memories.
585	21450	8	2	@DATE1 was an unforgettable night! My friends and I were going to a @CAPS1 party at our dance coach's workplace. We had to dress up as elves and play with kids. The party was fun, but the real excitement started after it ended. After changing back into our regular clothes, we began taking pictures. We took all kinds of pictures - funny, cute, and weird ones. Not wanting to go home yet, we decided to visit some places to take more pictures and have more fun. Our first stop was a school playground, but since it was late and we weren't allowed inside, we headed to Discovery Park. I was driving, and a friend in the passenger seat was taking pictures that turned out really funny. When we reached the park, my friend asked if she could drive around the parking lot. I agreed, and we switched seats. She was a decent driver, but there were some scary moments when I thought we might crash. She drove around and then stopped at a stop - sign near a main road. She decided it was time to switch back, but I saw a car coming and yelled that we'd get in trouble. She didn't listen and got out of the car. I had to get out too, and we started yelling at each other. Our friends in the back seat were also yelling, not because they were mad but because we didn't want to get caught. We were having a great time. When I got back in the driver's seat, we were all yelling for her to get in the car. She was laughing so hard that she said she'd wet her pants. At first, we thought she was joking, but she was serious. It was a good thing she had extra pants with her. I had to back up the car so she could change behind a big metal object. While she was changing, we thought it would be funny to take a picture of her. I got the camera, but the picture didn't come out because it was too dark. We teased her, saying “keep it in”. Even two months later, we still tease her about it. Whenever someone says they might pee their pants from laughing, we look at @PERSON1 and say “@PERSON1 knows what that's like”. This night was full of laughter and fun, and it's a memory that will always make me smile.
586	21451	8	2	Laughter, in my view, is an integral part of life and I neither can nor desire to avoid it. Laughter itself is a source of great enjoyment. It has the remarkable ability to transform tense situations into relaxed and pleasant ones. There is no more perfect feeling than being engulfed in uncontrollable laughter. It is the most effective means of bringing people together, forging memories, and establishing bonds. In my family and among friends, numerous situations present the potential for, and often result in, laughter. Growing up with a brother, fun - loving neighbors, and cousins has provided me with many memorable moments of laughter. One such recent incident occurred when my brother, PERSON1, had a school assignment. His history teacher tasked him with writing a diary entry as if he were a mountain man in the DATE1's. I didn't initially intend to help him, but I'm extremely glad I did. It seemed unlikely that this task would be so much fun, which just goes to show how unexpectedly laughter can emerge. I entered PERSON1's room, and after he told me about his work, I leaned over his shoulder and offered some ideas. As we made progress, we added a subtle humorous comment to the entry. Reading our creation set off an explosion of laughter. The sound poured out of PERSON1's room like lava from a volcano, and our parents probably thought we were crazy. Another reader might not have found it funny, but to us, it was hilarious. Since we were in a good mood and the teacher encouraged creativity, we added more humorous and witty sentences. I was doubled over, struggling to speak through my fits of laughter, and PERSON1 was in a similar state. Doing the homework together was far more fun than if he had worked alone. We finished quickly and had an amazing feeling. PERSON1 ended up getting full marks on the entry. This is just one of countless examples where laughter enriches the moment. This particular instance made the work not a chore but a very happy event. Perhaps more laughter in the workplace could lead to better productivity. All in all, in my opinion, laughter makes life the greatest experience.
587	21452	8	2	I firmly believe that laughter is a crucial component of any relationship. Whether it's with friends, family, or a girlfriend, laughter always plays an important role. My best relationship is with my best friend PERSON1, and it's filled with laughter. We always have a great time together. For example, last DATE1, she, some friends, and I went to Snow Peak. I tore the ligaments in my knee when I jumped PERSON2's quad. We laughed about my foolishness and getting hurt, and also about CAPS1's big ears, which made him look like CAPS2 the elephant. I think what makes our friendship so strong is how much we make each other laugh. The first time we met, she was dating one of my friends. The first thing I did was make her laugh, and since then, we've been great friends. She later asked me to work at the Harvest Fest with her, and I did. I made her laugh the whole time. Now, I'm her dork, and she's my best friend. At the Harvest Fest, the funniest thing I did was doing a wheelie on the tractor down the whole track while wearing a cowboy hat and having a huge dip of LOCATION1 in my lip. The moral of this story is that the more you make people laugh, the stronger and closer your relationships will be, whether it's with friends, family, or a significant other.
588	21453	8	2	On the DATE1, PERSON2, LOCATION1, and I were walking under the cover of trees. We decided to stop by the lake at our usual meeting place, which offered a perfect view, to have a chat. LOCATION1, who is six - foot - DATE1, has long raven - black hair that barely touches his chin, deep blue eyes, and is extremely good - looking. He plopped down in the wet green grass. PERSON2, who is six feet tall, has short brown hair and dark ocher - colored eyes. He chose to stand about DATE1 paces in front of us. To an outsider, he seemed to be simply enjoying the view of the crystal - clear water. But we, who knew him well, knew he was thinking about his brother, PERSON1, who was in the hospital. PERSON1 was in the wrong place at the wrong time, got in the middle of a fight between homeless people (one of whom was drunk), and was stabbed with a rusty switch - blade. PERSON2 felt it was his fault, and he was so depressed that he wouldn't smile at our antics or even eat. His state made LOCATION1 and me feel terrible, and we couldn't cheer him up. PERSON2 was usually the most lively among us, and we tried everything possible to make him feel better or at least get him to smile again. We attempted for days. We even dressed up as Teletubbies, went to his house, dragged him off the couch, and took him downtown. But not once did his mouth even twitch upwards. We did some of the most outrageous and embarrassing things we could think of over days of brainstorming, yet we got no response from him except for his yawns. Finally, about DATE1, we got him to giggle, which turned into full - on, body - shaking laughter. You won't believe it, but it was cheesy, idiotic CAPS6 - CAPS6 jokes that finally got to him. Although LOCATION1 and I felt like idiots, we couldn't help but laugh with him. After that day, he was almost back to his normal self. Our lives went on, and PERSON1 got out of the hospital fine.
589	21454	8	2	"Life can be complicated; nothing is ever black and white. This is a glimpse of my childhood. I think it's best to start at the beginning. When I was about NUM1 years old, I had my first memory. My dad, PERSON3, my brothers, and I were at a pond in LOCATION1. We raced CAPS1 boats that my dad had built. We went there every other DATE1 after school, from the time I got out until it was pitch - black outside. One particular time, my brother thought I needed a swim. My brothers and I got along but weren't close. They loved pulling pranks on me as I was the youngest. I was standing next to my dad and brothers, surrounded by small ferns. My brother PERSON2 jumped out of a bush behind me, making me jump. Meanwhile, my brother PERSON1 was on his hands and knees, waiting for me to jump so he could make me trip. I did trip, and there was a drop - off at the edge of the pond that no one noticed. I tumbled down the hill. My elbow hit my stomach, my head hit a rock, and then a CAPS2! I was soaked, looking like a gooey green monster. At first, no one laughed, but later we did. That night, no one talked much. The sun was setting, and I was sitting on the tailgate of a truck, wrapped in blankets, while my dad, brothers, and PERSON3 stood in the setting sun. I'll never forget that luminous sight. As the years passed, things got worse between my brothers and me. It wasn't easy to forgive and forget. My brother PERSON2, who is five years older than me, has CAPS3 and serious relationship problems. When I was about NUM2 years old, he decided to take out his problems on me. I loved my brothers and didn't know his ulterior motive. The whole family except my dad was watching CAPS4.V. in the living room. PERSON2 went to his room, put Spider - Man in his mini CAPS5 player, and climbed into his bed (a titanium bed with a desk below and the top bunk almost touching the ceiling). He then went to the kitchen to fill his water bottle and asked if anyone wanted to watch Spider - Man. Since my mother was watching the news, I accepted his offer. We climbed into the top bunk and watched the movie. I was cold, so he offered me a blanket I'd given him last CAPS6. It was thick, fuzzy, warm, and had a huge tiger on it. He slept in boxers, which was a bit weird, but I said nothing. As we lay there, he put his hand in my pants. I pushed him away and continued watching the movie. He tried several more times, but I refused. Then he pinned me down with his leg. I didn't scream. He started wiggling his finger in my pants, which stung. I told him to stop, but he didn't. Then he grabbed a pencil and stuck it in my vagina. Just then, my dad walked in and said it was bedtime. My brother threw himself back, and I rushed out of his room. That night was the first time my dad didn't read me a bedtime story. A few months later, my brother PERSON1 started acting strange. He was always jittery around me. One day, he bought a lot of my favorite candy, CAPS7 ""CAPS8 ORGANIZATION1's."" They looked like an ORGANIZATION1, white and crunchy on the outside and filled with chocolate inside. He bribed me, saying he'd give me a box if I let him touch me in three places. I didn't know it was wrong and just wanted the candy, so I agreed. This went on for about a year, and he never did anything too invasive. After all these things, I didn't know what to do. Once I realized it was wrong, I cried, but that didn't help. Then I tried laughing, and it worked. Realizing that laughter is key to forgetting helped me move on."
590	21456	8	2	"Have you ever felt laughter? That feeling of uncontrollable joy building up inside you, the feeling that can only be described as laughter. It's a wonderful feeling that can make you scream and yell. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the beauty of life."" It helps us through tough times and always puts a smile on our face when we're down. It makes good times even better and ensures they're never forgotten. Laughter is something everyone needs as it helps us connect with others and makes us one with them. This is my story, the story of how laughter led me to meet the love of my life. How the connection of joy between us will last forever, and how the memory of his smile will stay with me forever. On DATE1, I met him. It was a beautiful day with miles of snow on the ground, and I was with my amazing friends. Boredom quickly set in, so we decided to have some fun. We put on our snow clothes and headed for the door. When we stepped outside, everyone but me stopped. I kept going into the cold air. I slowly realized they'd stopped and tried to stop, but I ended up lying on the icy ground, holding my sore butt. I was so embarrassed and shocked that I just lay there with my eyes closed. As I lay there, I heard footsteps. I thought it was my friends coming to help. But when I opened my eyes, it was a handsome man I'd seen a few times in high school. He leaned down and asked, ""Are you okay?"" I shyly replied, ""Yes..."" He smiled and reached out to help me up. When our skin touched, I got butterflies in my stomach. I looked at him and could tell he was feeling the same. When I stood up, we both smiled and started laughing. To this day, I don't know why we laughed. I had a million questions in my mind, but the first one out of my mouth was, ""What's your name?"" He replied with a smile, ""CAPS6, and you?"" ""My name is CAPS8,"" I said. I thanked him and asked if he'd like some hot chocolate or coffee. He replied cutely, ""I'd rather take you to get a burger. Will you come?"" I happily said yes. He took my hand and walked me towards my friends. They smiled and went into the house. He decided not to follow. We laughed as we ran to his car. I'd heard a lot about CAPS6 from my friends, who always talked about how cute and muscular he was. I couldn't believe he wanted to take me out to lunch. We sat awkwardly in the car on the way to a small diner called ORGANIZATION1. When we arrived, he jumped out and opened my door. I thought he was such a gentleman. At the table, he ordered for both of us and asked me lots of questions. He kept me smiling the whole time. I don't think any boy had ever done that before. After we ate and he drove me home, he told me joke after joke, and we laughed. When we reached my house, he asked, ""Can I kiss you?"" I didn't answer but leaned in and kissed him. After that, we looked into each other's eyes and laughed again. I still don't know why we laughed, but at that moment, I fell in love. I realized that laughter would be the connection between us forever. The laughter is a remembrance of him. MONTH1, he passed away, but the memory of our laughter will always stay with me."
591	21457	8	2	"Laughter, like all the great aspects of life, sustains me. Without it, I feel depleted. I'll share the three things that make me laugh the most. First is @CAPS1's mom from @LOCATION1. She taught me that laughter is the key to almost everything. She showed me it's okay to stumble, to laugh at my own silliness and mistakes, and then get back up. No matter the teenage ""drama"" in @CAPS1's life, @CAPS1's mom can always make me laugh. The most important lesson I've learned is to laugh even when I'm emotionally broken, when I feel the world is against me and I don't want to be myself anymore. For instance, when @TIME1 on @DATE1, I had a fight with @CAPS1's best friend, I stayed in @CAPS1's house for about a week and a half and didn't want to talk to anyone. @CAPS1's mom tried to get me to call her, but I didn't. Then one day, @CAPS1's mom sat on @CAPS1's bed and said, ""@CAPS2, it's not about what happens to you, but what you do with it. Look at me, I laugh whether I'm upset, sad, or happy. That's what I want you to do. Don't shrug off your teenage ""drama,"" laugh it off and call her."" Second are @CAPS1's friends, especially those with @CAPS5. When I'm with them, nothing else matters. It's like I speak a unique language that only @CAPS1's friends with @CAPS5 can understand. They're full of randomness and energy. They've taught me that having @CAPS5 is both a gift and a curse. When @PERSON1 and I hang out, we always liven up the place. We can't help being goofy and laughing non - stop. Sometimes, people our age misunderstand us and think we're laughing at them, but we're not. Third is myself. I'm a real comedian. When I try to be funny, it doesn't work well, but when I don't try, I make people laugh until they cry. Throughout @CAPS1's life, I've been told, ""@CAPS2, you're amazing. You can make life seem wonderful no matter what mood someone is in."" It's different when I make myself laugh. Once, when I was sitting on the floor in @CAPS1's room, thinking about the past and feeling down, I started recalling good times. In just five minutes, I was laughing so hard that my stomach hurt. As I said, laughter is @CAPS1's greatest asset. It can truly open one's eyes. I'll keep living a laughing life and pass this on when the time is right."
592	21458	8	2	"In any relationship, physical contact, verbal communication, and other forms of outward expression are crucial. Specifically, laughter is also essential in any interaction. Laughter conveys messages like ""what you're saying is funny"" or ""I'm enjoying this"" without uttering a single word. Think about someone close to you, like a best friend or a family member. You can often tell their emotions, such as anger, sadness, or frustration, just by looking at their facial expressions or into their eyes. When they laugh, their eyes sparkle, their face lights up, and it's obvious they're happy. Now, consider hanging out with friends. Being with friends is always enjoyable, which is why we spend time with them. When we're with friends, we laugh a great deal. We share funny stories, inside jokes, and fond memories that make us laugh. Whether it's a long car ride, a sleepover, a party, or a church event, we cherish these moments. Notice how laughter is contagious. When one person laughs, the whole group usually follows. It's always a highlight of any gathering. Some people claim that each laugh adds a few seconds to your life. I'm not sure about that, but I firmly believe that laughter is healthy. When I laugh, I feel much better. After spending time with my three closest friends, I feel great, and any worries from that day or week seem to fade away. When a friend is down, our first instinct is often to make them laugh because laughter is closely linked to happiness. It's difficult for someone to stay sad when they're laughing. That's why I believe laughter is the best medicine. It's almost impossible not to feel better when laughing. Laughter is vital in human relationships as it shows that you're enjoying someone's company, just like smiling at the right moments or making appropriate facial expressions during a conversation. If someone tells a funny story or a joke, laughing indicates that you understand the humor. So, if you enjoy being with someone, laugh a lot to show your appreciation. People love making others laugh, and in any situation, laughter is just as important as the saying goes for smiling - everyone laughs in the same language. Laughter is generally a positive sign, indicating that things are going well."
593	21459	8	2	"Laughter can serve various purposes. You might laugh because something is funny, to be rude, or simply because you find joy in what others are doing. However, we should be cautious as laughing at others can hurt them more than we realize and may even impact their lives as they grow older. I experienced such a situation when I was young. I've loved singing since I can remember, but there was a time when I couldn't bear to sing in front of a crowd or even my family. It was a dark @TIME1 on @DATE1. My father, a long - haul truck driver, and I were on one of our many trips around the @LOCATION2. This time, we went to @LOCATION1, a place full of amazing things to do and see. There were the @ORGANIZATION1 and all the monuments. My dad told me to try to get past security at the @ORGANIZATION1, and I just laughed and declined, telling him he could give it a go. Another place we visited was @LOCATION3. Despite the hot and muggy weather, it was still a lot of fun. I remember my dad saying we had extra time and taking us to the zoo. It was so cool to see all the amazing animals like lions, crocodiles, monkeys, gorillas, and penguins. It was one of the best trips my dad ever took me on. One of the funniest memories was when we were driving through the desert. There was a paper floating in the air, and I asked my dad what it was. He said it was a falling star, and I was like, ""In the middle of the day?"" It took me a couple of years to figure out what it really was, but now when I look back, I can't help but laugh. These trips with my dad were full of fun and laughter, and they're some of my most cherished memories."
594	21460	8	2	I'm going to share a story from my childhood. My father was a long - haul truck driver, and we used to go on long trips together. We traveled to many places around the @LOCATION2, and every trip was full of fun and laughter. The trip to @LOCATION1 was my favorite. There were so many things to do and see. The @ORGANIZATION1 was really cool, and all the monuments were amazing. My dad dared me to try to get past security at the @ORGANIZATION1, but I declined and laughed at him, suggesting he could do it instead. @LOCATION3 was another place we visited. Even though it was extremely hot and muggy, it was still an enjoyable experience. I remember my dad announcing that we had extra time and taking us to the zoo. Seeing the lions, crocodiles, monkeys, gorillas, and penguins was truly unforgettable. It was one of the best trips I've ever had with my dad. One of the funniest moments happened when we were driving through the desert. I saw a paper floating in the air and asked my dad what it was. He told me it was a falling star, and I was really confused because it was daytime. It took me a few years to realize what it actually was, and now, whenever I think about that day, I burst out laughing. These trips with my dad were not only about the places we visited but also about the shared laughter and the special bond we had.
595	21462	8	2	I'll tell you about an event that started with laughter and fun but turned serious. On a @TIME1 of @DATE1, my brother @ORGANIZATION1 called me and invited me to my mom's house. I hadn't been there in a while, so I agreed and said I'd be there in an hour. On the way, I stopped at a gas station to fill up. Fifteen minutes later, I arrived at my mom's place. My brother was outside waiting for me. He helped me with my bag and opened the truck door. Once inside, I went to the kitchen, hugged my @CAPS1, and asked how she was. She said she was alright and asked what was new with me. I replied that I was just hanging out and trying to stay out of trouble. I also asked if there was anything I could do around the house, and she listed a few tasks. After that, I went to my room to change into work clothes and then headed outside, grabbing my brother on the way as he was going to help me. While we were in the garage, my brother mentioned that I hadn't been there in a while and said there would be a party that night. I said okay. After finishing the garage work, my dad told us the fence needed fixing, so we moved the tractor and repaired it. By @NUM1 at night, people were already arriving. When we got back to the house, my @CAPS1 came out and told us to join the party. There were @NUM2 people in the house that night, drinking and having a great time. In the living room, the girls were making food for the guys while the guys were playing drinking games like beer pong, shots, and beer bong. There was always someone trying to break the drinking record in the house, which was @NUM3 shots and @NUM4 beers in one night. To this day, I still hold that record. A friend of my @CAPS1 challenged me to a shot - drinking contest. I accepted, and after @NUM5 shots, my opponent passed out on the table. Hours later, only my brother, a friend, and I were awake. We were outside, and my brother was peeing on his dad's car. Suddenly, he started puking, and the look on his face while he was smiling and throwing up made me laugh so hard that I fell over. My friend @PERSON1 and I took him downstairs to his bed and then went back upstairs to sleep. Just as we were about to enter, my brother opened the door, said he loved us and good night. Less than thirty seconds later, we heard a loud noise as he fell down the stairs. The next @TIME1, I woke up feeling unwell. I told my @CAPS1, and she made me food, but I still didn't feel better, so I went home to sleep. When I opened my door, my @CAPS1 was there. She asked if I'd been drinking, and I said yes and that I didn't feel good. She said she'd take me to the doctor if it didn't improve. A month later, after not eating or drinking properly, I went to the doctor. They told me I'd damaged my liver so badly that it was like that of a @NUM6 - year - old. I cried and promised my @CAPS1 that I'd never drink like that again. I realized that while having fun and laughing is great, there are consequences. The doctor said that if I drank again, I could die. So, I made the best decision of my life and haven't had any alcohol for a year and @NUM7 days. Also, under - age drinking is no longer allowed at my mom's house.
596	21463	8	2	"I once heard a true story about an ordinary businessman. He wasn't at a high - level position in his company. However, he always greeted everyone in the company with a big laugh. One day, the company's boss came and asked everyone, ""Who works the hardest?"" No one answered. Then the boss said, ""Or recommend someone for a promotion."" Everyone recommended that businessman because of his hearty greetings. Eventually, he reached the highest level in the company, second only to the boss. Laughter can make people happier. When I'm with friends, laughter makes our relationship more friendly. It's also beneficial for health. Laughing a lot can extend one's lifespan and is good for the mind. That businessman wasn't an outstanding worker in terms of work performance, but his laughter made everyone around him happy, which is why he achieved a high position in the company. I firmly believe that laughter is excellent for everything, and I laugh a great deal myself. I hope to bring happiness to others."
597	21465	8	2	"Are you the kind of person who laughs a lot or a little? If you're the type who can find humor in anything, then I'm sure we'd get along well. Laughter is a crucial part of my life. I contribute to it in three ways: I often crack jokes about various things, I do funny acts like making funny faces, and I even laugh at my own clumsiness. Whether you talk to me briefly or for a long time, I'm confident I can make you laugh. Laughter is amazing. In any situation, be it awkward, embarrassing, or just when you're at a loss, you can always choose to laugh. Since I was a young girl, I've been extremely clumsy. My mom would always say, ""You're worse than a bull in a china shop."" She was so right. Whether it was me dropping things, breaking glass, or falling, her words held true. All she could do when I did something clumsy was laugh because she knew she had a clumsy daughter. For example, in elementary school, we had monthly award assemblies to recognize well - behaved students. I hoped my name would be called. When it finally was, I was excited and nervous. After getting my award and going down the stairs, I missed a step and fell on my behind in front of over two - hundred kids and thirty parents. What would you do in such a situation? I just laughed, got up, and went back to my seat. Laughter has shaped who I am. If it weren't for my childhood clumsiness, I don't know where I'd be. It has brought me closer to my family and friends. They know to make me laugh when I'm gloomy. My friends and I joke around a lot. Laughter has taught me that instead of being embarrassed, it's better to turn awkward situations into something funny. Learning to laugh from a young age has made me a better person. People know me as a happy and funny girl who loves to laugh, and I'm proud of that. Laughter is not just an element in my life; it plays a huge role."
598	21467	8	2	In my first year of high school, I was feeling very confident. I had great teachers and all the classes I wanted. My first day was going perfectly. I woke up on time, had a good breakfast, and didn't miss the school bus. After a few wonderful classes, it was lunchtime. As the bell rang, I rushed to the cafeteria to get a good spot in line. A friend called my name, so I turned to wave. When I turned back, I crashed into [LOCATION1]. We hit each other hard, and I flew backward, dropping everything I was carrying. I tried to apologize, but she just glared at me and walked away. I decided to forget about it. After lunch, I had [CAPS2] class. I was really excited because the boy of my dreams, [PERSON1], was in it. On my way to class, I stopped by the ladies' room to check my appearance and then headed to class. When I walked in, I saw [PERSON1]'s beautiful blond hair and blue eyes. Then I noticed [LOCATION1] flirting with him. From that moment on, it was a competition between us. As the year went on, we constantly tried to outdo each other. We raced to class to sit behind [PERSON1]. If I got a new haircut, she'd get highlights. When I got a phone, she bought the latest one with a music player. One day, I was excited to show [PERSON1] a new game, but [LOCATION1] was already showing him the same one. However, I always had an edge over [LOCATION1] when it came to books. [PERSON1] and I loved books and would talk about them for hours, which made [LOCATION1] jealous. Our childish rivalry lasted for three or four months. One day at lunch, [LOCATION1] suddenly spat soda at my face. That was the last straw. I grabbed my milk carton and dumped it on her head. The cafeteria went silent for a minute. We glared at each other until someone broke the silence with a laugh. Soon, everyone, including us, was laughing. We realized how stupid we'd been. We apologized to each other, cleaned up, and eventually became good friends. To this day, we still laugh about our [NUM1] grade rivalry.
599	21468	8	2	I have so many great memories with [LOCATION2] from when we were best friends. We were around [NUM1] years old, from [NUM2] to [NUM3] grade. As we got older, we still had numerous wonderful times together. Whenever we hung out, we laughed about almost everything and didn't let trivial things bother us. She was always there when I needed someone to talk to. Our lives were quite similar, so she understood me well. Although we had our fights, we always resolved them. We always had each other's backs. Laughter was an important part of our relationship. In [NUM2] grade, we tried to hang out as often as possible. But since we were young, our parents didn't allow us to do much. When we did manage to hang out, we'd come up with random games and go to different places for fun. As we grew older, our parents trusted us more, and we could do more things. Then I moved to [LOCATION1] for love. The good thing was that she still came over often. We'd pick her up on [DATE1], and on [DATE2], my mom would drive her to school as she worked there. Every night she was at my place, we'd stay up. I kept little hot chocolate packages in my room. After my parents went to bed, we'd sneak out to get hot water for hot chocolate. Sometimes we'd make coffee to stay up longer. It was difficult because my room was across from my parents' and I had beads on my door. We had to be quiet to avoid getting caught. Sometimes when she came over, she'd bring makeup, and we'd dress each other up. One night, we even did each other's makeup blindfolded. These shared experiences filled with laughter have made our friendship special.
600	21470	8	2	Everyone experiences laughter, and it can turn a bad situation into a funny one. It's like magic, requiring no wand, just a unique sense of humor, a bit of common sense, and some illogical thinking. Although these seem contradictory, that's what makes us [CAPS4]. Laughter isn't just a response to the illogical; it's also a very useful tool. You can use it to get out of or into trouble, start or end a friendship, get or lose a job, win or lose a game. But I'm here to talk about making friends through laughter. I'm not the nicest guy, but I'm good at making people [CAPS4]. Most of my jokes are about depressing things, and I think people laugh because they don't know how else to react. That's probably why the concepts of sadists and masochists were invented. Once upon a time, there was a kid named [PERSON1]. I didn't know him well at first and didn't really want to, but he hung out with me, Grant, and [PERSON3]. He wore cool Iron Maiden T - shirts and listened to music I liked. One day, we saw an empty plastic barrel at school. At [NUM1] years old, it seemed fun, so we decided to stand on it. The next day, [PERSON1] was handing out invitations to his birthday party. I was excited and went. When I got to his house, I was shocked to see that his kitchen was very similar to mine. We both had a random assortment of dishes due to financial reasons. When the other guys arrived, we talked about random things like [CAPS3] videos and good movies. [PERSON1] and I agreed that new movies often lacked character development. Eventually, we started a fire and moved our conversations outside. When the fire went out, everyone went inside except me and [PERSON2]. We went into [PERSON1]'s garage, found [NUM2] and brake fluid, and sprayed it on the fire. The flames got so close that my face got a bit sunburned. Then we added more wood to the fire, and everyone came back outside. We spent the rest of the night talking about girls and cracking jokes. I wish we had a [CAPS4 - CAPS5 - CAPS6]. That night, I made some lifelong friends.
601	21471	8	2	Laughter is truly one of life's greatest gifts. It serves as a powerful tool to help us navigate through the challenges of each day, each year, and ultimately, our entire lives. For me, a typical day can be fraught with setbacks. I might forget about an important assignment that significantly impacts my grade, or I could simply have a tough day. However, all it takes to transform these negative experiences into distant memories is a long, hearty laugh. And if that laugh is shared with someone else, it becomes even more precious.  When I moved to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, I actively sought out like - minded kids who loved to laugh and bring joy to others. The initial days were difficult. I met numerous new people, but most interactions felt rather mundane. Some just wanted to know my name, while others aimed to get to know me better, which was fine.  There was one particular person I noticed in multiple classes. One day, when our @CAPS2 teacher asked us to partner up for an assignment to write a creation myth or explain how something came to be, I quickly scanned the room to find a partner before everyone else paired up. I approached a boy from a few of my other classes. I hadn't really paid much attention to him or even heard him speak. He agreed to be my partner, and we introduced ourselves. His name was @PERSON1, but his voice was so soft that I had to read his name from his paper to be sure.  We worked on the paper together, but it felt more like we were working independently. I started by sharing some ideas, and @PERSON1 would respond with something that made him laugh, but I could never catch what he said. We continued this way for a couple of days, barely having more than a few exchanges.  Meanwhile, I was still eager to make at least one good friend. I hoped that through this friend, I could meet their friends and eventually build my own social circle. In the meantime, I had lunch with my sister @PERSON2. Contrary to what one might expect, it was actually quite pleasant, and our bond grew stronger. This arrangement worked well for both of us until she made a few friends.  One day, while we were having lunch, one of her new friends invited her to sit with them. I desperately hoped she would decline or suggest another time, but she didn't. Suddenly, I found myself sitting alone in the lunchroom, feeling the judgmental gazes of others. I quickly finished my lunch and left the room. Although I appeared calm on the outside, I was panicking inside as I paced the hallways, looking for someone to hang out with.  Then, I saw @PERSON1 from three of my classes. I casually walked up to him and started a conversation. For some reason, I felt completely at ease, as if we were already old friends. At first, we talked about classes and how this school differed from my previous one. Then, our conversation shifted to movies, especially the recent comedies. We couldn't stop laughing, especially in auto - mechanics class. We spent all our shop time trying to recall and act out the funny lines from the movies.  We also discovered that we watched many of the same TV shows. We could make each other laugh with just about anything. I noticed a special quality in @PERSON1 that made him incredibly funny. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but every time he spoke, I would burst into uncontrollable laughter.  We started as laughing buddies and soon became great friends. Through our shared laughter, we got to know each other better and realized how much we had in common. It's been a few months, and our friendship has only grown stronger. I've made friends before by making them laugh or laughing at their jokes, but this friendship is different. @PERSON1 is the greatest friend I've ever had.  Now, I'm faced with the difficult situation of moving. However, I'm confident that our bond, forged through some of the most memorable laughs of my life, will endure, and we'll remain friends for a long time.
602	21472	8	2	"I've lived in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 almost my entire life. I attended pre - @CAPS5 all the way through @NUM1 grade. It was about halfway through @DATE1 when my mom dropped the bombshell. ""Honey, we're moving,"" she said. I was stunned, not knowing what to think. I protested, saying, ""No, we can't move. I'm going into @CAPS4 @CAPS5. I don't want to go to a place where I don't know anyone.""  My mom tried to reassure me, saying, ""Don't worry, you'll make friends."" I asked, ""Where are we moving anyway?"" She replied softly, ""Lebanon."" I thought to myself that it wasn't too far from where we were. My mom encouraged me, saying that once we got there and settled in, it wouldn't be so bad. But I was still hesitant, saying, ""I still don't know anybody there."" She reminded me that my cousin @PERSON2 went to school there and was a junior. He could drive me to @CAPS5 and introduce me to people.  I was a bit excited but also reluctant to leave @CAPS8. We began packing our things. It took us about a week to move everything from the old house to the new one. After packing, we started cleaning. We cleaned from the upstairs to the downstairs, and it took us about two days at most. In total, it took us about a week and two days to pack, move, and clean.  We said our goodbyes to our friends and family and set off on our journey. I told my brothers that it wasn't like we'd never see them again. When we finally arrived at the new house, I was eager to see what it was like. My mom opened the door and said, ""Go check it out."" The boys exclaimed that it was amazing, and my mom said, ""I told you you'd love it.""  We went upstairs to pick our rooms. Since there were only four bedrooms, the two younger boys had to share. After that, we started unpacking. I was so exhausted that after unpacking my room, I took a nap on my bed. When I woke up, I realized I hadn't finished unpacking, so I completed the task.  @CAPS5 was starting in about a week. I was both excited and nervous to see what it would be like. Finally, the big day arrived. My mom woke me up, saying, ""Honey, it's time for @CAPS5."" I got out of bed, brushed my teeth, hair, did my makeup, and got dressed. Then I heard, ""@CAPS9"" ""@CAPS9"" ""@PERSON2 is here, time to go."" I rushed downstairs, grabbed my backpack, and got in the car.  @PERSON2 greeted me, and I said I was a bit nervous but also excited. He said he'd introduce me to his girlfriend, who was also a freshman. We pulled into the @CAPS5, and I was amazed at the number of kids. @PERSON2 showed me around to my classes. He introduced me to my first - period teacher, @PERSON1, who taught @CAPS12 arts.  I walked into the class, feeling everyone's eyes on me. My stomach was in knots. The teacher welcomed me and showed me where to sit and introduced me to the class. The day seemed to drag on. I still had six more classes to go. Most of the teachers made me introduce myself in front of the class, which was terrifying.  Finally, I got on the bus, eager to get home. When I walked through the door, my mom bombarded me with questions about my day and if I'd made friends. I told her to calm down and said my day was okay and asked if I could take a shower. After the shower, I went to lie on my bed, ready to sleep. But my brothers came in to tell me about their day. I thought it was about time to go to bed. Then I heard, ""@CAPS14"" ""@CAPS15"" ""time to get up, @LOCATION1."" I groaned, thinking, ""Oh no, not again!"
603	21473	8	2	"Whenever we gather on my dad's side of the family, we sit around, laugh heartily, and talk loudly. I often describe our family as a big, fun - loving unit. We all gather around my grandma's small kitchen table, and the air is filled with multiple conversations, loud voices, and infectious laughter. It truly feels like a home away from home.  This was the case when some of us got together for my late birthday party in @LOCATION1 @DATE2. On @DATE1, my grandma, uncle, aunt, dad, two cousins, and I were sitting around the kitchen table, enjoying cake and chatting. We were discussing a problem I was facing when my dad decided to play - act as if we were in a court. My aunt told @PERSON2 to get a wig for the ""judge,"" which was my uncle. @PERSON2 returned with a blond wig and placed it on my dad's head. He looked incredibly funny. Aunt @PERSON3 was adjusting the front of the wig, and I grabbed my dad's phone and started taking numerous pictures of him in the wig. I sent one to my mom with the caption, ""@CAPS2 mom, dad is pretty."" We were all laughing uncontrollably.  Then, my grandma decided to try on the wig. She kept complaining that it was itchy and tickling her. After taking it off, she began to tell us a story. She first set the scene by introducing the teacher, whose name was funny but I can't remember. Uncle @CAPS3 started doing an impression of what he thought the teacher would be like, and it resembled the old bank owner on @PERSON1. We all burst into laughter again.  When my grandma finally reached the main part of the story, she told us that the teacher was angry with her because she had written his name down for talking in class, and he also had a crush on her. So, he took a compass and poked her in the rump. For some reason, my dad and uncle found this so hilarious that they made her repeat it in a rhyming way. She couldn't say ""rump"" without laughing, and we all laughed so hard that we were on the verge of tears. Grandma was laughing so hard that she would fall back into her chair, and I was worried she might laugh herself into a fit.  It's evident that my dad's side of the family loves to laugh and have a good time. We may be a bit of a ""crazy"" family, but that's what makes us special. I firmly believe that laughter is an essential part of any relationship. It brings people closer together and creates memories that last a lifetime. One of my favorite things is to laugh, and I know that no matter what, when my dad and his younger brother get together, there's bound to be a lot of laughter."
604	21475	8	2	"Do you recall the first day of @NUM1 grade? Everyone stands there, a mix of awkwardness and excitement, waiting for the seating arrangement. I remember those middle - school jitters well. I attended @CAPS1 for my middle - school years, and my teacher was @PERSON3. She was a strict teacher, especially when it came to seating. If you disliked someone, she'd probably seat you next to them, thinking you'd become friends.  I was standing in the corner with my best friend @CAPS2, hoping against hope that we'd be seated together. But when the seating arrangements were announced, we were separated. I was placed next to @PERSON4, a girl I'd never seen before, along with @PERSON5, @PERSON1, and @PERSON2. I was friends with everyone except @PERSON4, who looked intimidating.  As @PERSON6 talked about the importance of middle school and preparing for high school, we all sat there, seemingly daydreaming. There was still that awkward first - day atmosphere, and no one really interacted much. @PERSON4 looked like she'd be hostile if anyone spoke to her, so I kept quiet.  Then, in the middle of her ""first - day lecture,"" @PERSON6 cracked a joke. It was a great ice - breaker. We all started laughing, and after a while, the tension in the room seemed to dissipate. @PERSON4 and I started chatting about how the joke was funny precisely because it was so silly.  From that moment on, we kept talking, and I realized she was a really cool person. We became partners for every project and were inseparable. After @NUM2 days, she became my best friend, all thanks to that shared laughter.  I firmly believe that the reason @PERSON4 and I became friends was laughter. I probably wouldn't have spoken to her otherwise. I'm incredibly glad that I did because now I have an amazing best friend. Middle school can be scary, especially on the first day, and that's why I think laughter is such a crucial part of building relationships. It's a powerful force that can break down barriers and bring people together."
605	21476	8	2	"One time when I was sick, I told my mom that I needed to get some ice tea. I got up and headed to the freezer. Suddenly, my throat started to itch, and I felt the urge to cough. Without thinking, I coughed right into the ice bucket. My mom, who was standing next to me, exclaimed, ""@CAPS1 god! Son, what was that?"" And then, we both started laughing.  It was ironic because the germs from my cough would be preserved in the ice box. It was a funny situation where I was, in a way, ""keeping my germs alive,"" and later, my mom used that ice. This simple incident shows how a funny and unexpected moment can bring laughter, even in"
606	21477	8	2	It was a cold @DATE1 at @TIME1 when I, along with my friends @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @PERSON1, @CAPS5, and @CAPS6, decided to go to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We got a ride to @LOCATION1 and back with @CAPS4's dad. On the way, we listened to some A @CAPS8 @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 @CAPS11, which I'd highly recommend to any @CAPS12 fans. Once we arrived, I told a joke, and we all laughed so hard that it felt like an over - the - top moment. The @CAPS13.
607	21478	8	2	"I've always yearned to go back and relive my @CAPS7 childhood. It was a time of pure bliss, a period when I lived without purpose or plans. Watching my @CAPS7 little cousins or brother, I see unbridled joy, hearty laughter, and endearing silliness. Their innocent faces show no understanding of the world around them.  As I witness them outgrowing their quirks, my mind drifts back to @DATE1. A young girl, not yet in school, runs in her grandmother's yard on a @DATE4 mid - day. She swings her pig tails and hides her hands in her size @NUM1 trousers, one eye closed, the other half - open, as she watches her older sister search for a hiding place.  ""@CAPS1, nine, eight, seven..."" her sister, @PERSON1, shouts from behind an oak tree. I giggle to myself and start counting at @CAPS8. ""@CAPS8, four.. three.. two.."" I slow down, ""ONE!"" Then, like a rocket, I dash off the porch with my arms out, making engine noises and pretending to be a pilot. ""@CAPS9 on lock! Mayday, mayday! CRASH!"" I tackle my sister to the ground, and I recall our mother's amused face as we roll around in the grass, laughing.  I close my eyes and reopen them to find myself in @DATE2. A few days after the tragic event of @NUM2, everyone gathers at grandma's. The kids are in one room, the adults in another. I'm playing in the ball pit with @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION1 when we spot a small hole in the wall. ""@CAPS6, look through,"" @PERSON2 demands. I take a breath and comply. ""@CAPS11!"" I yell. The hole reveals the serious - faced adults in the next room.  I let the little ones look, but they're less interested. I push through to look again. All three of us peer through the tiny hole, giggling and chatting. We don't realize our uncle has been watching for at least @CAPS8 minutes. He signals the other adults, and one by one, they disappear. ""@CAPS12 did they all go?"" we panic.  Behind us, there's soft laughter. We turn around to see everyone smiling, laughing, and taking pictures. We stand there, blushing, and start pointing fingers. After that, it's a typical family day.  Looking back, I still wish I could relive my @CAPS7 childhood. It was a time of pure happiness, free from the need to impress. When I reflect on it, I just sit back and laugh at the memories."
608	21479	8	2	Laughter is incredibly beneficial. When having a bad day, a friend can make you laugh to feel better. Even in tragic situations like losing a loved one, people try to make you laugh, assuring you they're in a better place. I've experienced this and often felt uplifted after someone made me laugh, which also shows that I have caring people around me.  Yesterday, I was frustrated with math homework and started crying. My boyfriend told silly jokes, but what really made me happy was when he said he could come over on @DATE1. I smiled and laughed with joy.  About @NUM1 years ago, at @CAPS1 with my family, my brother took me on @CAPS2 @CAPS3 (I'm not sure if that was the ride). I was terrified and wet, so I ignored him for the day. He apologized and took me to a face - painter. After getting my face painted (I think it was a fish), I looked in the mirror and laughed for ten minutes, accepting his apology. When we got home, I sprayed him with a hose as payback.  In @NUM4 grade, my best friend @CAPS4 was moving. I cried for days. Then he called, and we talked for @NUM5 hours. Our conversation made me laugh and wish he hadn't moved. We talked about his dog @CAPS5, who was @NUM6 months old. She chased her tail, tripped, and fell, which was really funny.  These memories of laughter have helped me through tough times, and they'll always bring a smile to my face.
609	21480	8	2	I believe laughter is a wonderful part of life. When I was @NUM1 years old, I had a dog named @CAPS1. We loved doing things together, like going to the beach, parks, and, of course, eating. He was a cute dog with four puppies named @CAPS5 - @CAPS6, Popcorn, Big Tail, and Mountain. I gave them odd names based on their looks, smells, or habits. We named @CAPS1 because he always smelled like @CAPS1.  I was angry when he had puppies and a mate. I wanted him to be mine alone. But then I realized he just wanted his own life and family. The puppies had strange smells, like @CAPS1, @CAPS5 chops, or popcorn. My favorite was @CAPS5 @CAPS6 because he smelled like @CAPS5. Popcorn was also a good dog, but @CAPS5 @CAPS6 was a biter. Puppies love to bite and chew, and if left alone, they'll eat everything.  Once, when we went on a trip, the puppies ate a lot of clothes and destroyed things. I also had @CAPS11, but they were bad pets as they ate everything and smelled terrible. The puppies loved to nibble on toes and hair, and their small teeth really hurt. They had stinky breath too.  One of my favorite stories is about @CAPS1 not liking to swim. It was strange since dogs usually aren't as averse to water as cats. I taught him to swim. When he doggy - paddled, he put his head underwater, which made me wonder if he could breathe. Eventually, I got him over this habit.  When I moved between states, I had to leave him, which was heart - breaking. But life goes on. Laughter helps me deal with sadness, and I often think of @CAPS1. I also had other animals like @CAPS10, @CAPS11, @CAPS12, and cats. I prefer cats, but @CAPS1 will always hold a special place. One cat, @CAPS14, was all black with white feet. When angry, he'd jump around. Another cat, @CAPS15, was very fast.  Animals have brought laughter and happiness to my life. Laughter is important in relationships too. However, it can also be an insult if used to laugh at others. Laughter should be cherished as it can bring joy in difficult times.
610	21481	8	2	Have you ever had a moment you'll remember and laugh about forever? I have, and I think everyone should have such moments of laughter.  On @DATE1, my boyfriend @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 called me at four in the morning, saying he was starving. He picked me up at five, and we went to @ORGANIZATION1 for breakfast. After finishing early, he wanted to go for a drive. Since he's from @LOCATION1, he had no idea where to go in @LOCATION2.  We were in his @DATE2 Poniac, not a great vehicle for this area as you need a four - wheel - drive. We started on pavement but then he wanted to explore gravel roads. When we decided to go home and he tried to turn around, he turned the wrong way into a field.  At first, it seemed okay, but when he tried to back up, the car got stuck. I laughed and reminded him I'd told him to go right. He insisted it wasn't stuck and just needed more effort. What he didn't know was that the fields were wet due to recent warm days.  I got out of the car. He tried for ten minutes, but the tires sank deeper. He got out covered in mud and said he should have listened. Then he had another idea. He told me to put the car in reverse and lightly press the gas while he pushed. I pressed a bit harder, and he ended up covered in mud from head to toe.  He pulled me out of the car and smeared mud on my face. We both fell into the mud. When we tried to open the car doors, we realized it was locked because I'd left it in reverse. We had no extra key, and the car was still running with our phones inside.  We waited almost an hour and a half for help. It took 43 minutes to unlock the doors and 30 minutes to get the car unstuck. When I got home, I told my family, and we still laugh about it today.
611	21482	8	2	I'm planning to write my paper on the significance of laughter. I firmly believe it has the power to heal people. For instance, when someone is feeling down, a hearty laugh can lift their spirits. I admit I crack jokes here and there because I love to laugh. It not only makes me happy but also brings joy to those around me. Currently, I'm in foster care and can't leave, and laughter has become an essential part of my life. Even when I'm feeling low, hearing others having a good time can cheer me up. I miss the sound of my parents' laughter. My mother was an extraordinary woman with a contagious laugh that always made me grin and burst out laughing. I remember one time when she took her medicine and it made her a bit hyper. She even wanted to box with me! I had boxing gloves, while she just used her fists. She knew how to fight, but that experience was a bit scary. Now, let's talk about my father. He was an outstanding man and a great father. He worked hard to support my brother and me. When we were kids, he would wear funny masks and do silly things to make us laugh. Sometimes, he'd put on a scary mask to scare us and then have a good laugh himself. He also used to go roller - blading with us and try to trip us, but he couldn't always keep up. When we went too fast, his legs would wobble, and he'd fall, which always made me and my friends laugh. After my parents passed away, our family got separated, and it's really tough. But for me, laughter is like a connection to them. I could easily be my father's twin if you think about it. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people, and it's an important part of any relationship.
612	21483	8	2	"My grandfather often said, ""Life is like a kaleidoscope. You keep turning it, and it seems to be changing, but in reality, it just repeats itself."" I've always wondered if this statement holds true for life. If it does, why would we want life to follow the same pattern when it doesn't go as we've planned? When I was twelve, my two little sisters and I were separated by three thousand miles. I was sent to [LOCATION2], while they stayed in [LOCATION1], where I was born. At first, the pain of that distance was unbearable, like having essential organs removed from my body. However, as time passed, the agony gradually lessened. Sometimes, it seems cruel that I don't think about them as often as I used to. Maybe it's true what they say, ""Out of sight, out of mind."" It's sad to think about how close my sisters and I were before the separation. We were very close in age, with only [NUM1] years between the youngest and me. I remember those humid [DATE1] days when we'd play outside. My mother would generously apply sunscreen to our skin, and we'd look as white as ghosts. Those were happy times. I can still picture us sitting on the shag carpet in my room, playing with dolls until the sunlight faded into darkness. I wish I could relive that moment, even for a second, to feel that happy and content again. Even though a lot of time has passed since we were separated, there are still days when I feel like my world is falling apart because they're so far away. When I call them, the initial conversation is always awkward, like meeting strangers for the first time. I can feel the wound in my heart reopen, and it hurts as if I'm going through the separation all over again. I often ask myself why I bother calling if it's so painful. But then, I hear their laughter. It's like the most beautiful music to my ears. Their laughter instantly makes me happy. With each giggle, my smile grows because I know I've made them feel whole again, and for a moment, they forget how far apart we are. Their laughter makes the three - thousand - mile distance disappear. In those moments of laughter, I know we're sisters again, not strangers. My grandfather was right. No matter how life changes, the sound of my little sisters' laughter will always bring me pure bliss."
613	21484	8	2	"I leaned my back against the cool steel of the lockers, trying to calm my nerves. Our team captain, [PERSON1], said, ""This game is the result of all our hard work - every grueling practice, every tedious drill, and every game film we've studied in detail. It's all for tonight. If we lose, all our efforts will be in vain."" Her pre - game speech was straightforward and unfiltered. As I looked around the locker room, it was obvious that all my teammates were anxious. Emilie was chewing her nails vigorously, while [LOCATION1] showed her unease by constantly tapping her foot. After [PERSON1] finished speaking, we broke the huddle and entered the gymnasium. The stands were filled with familiar faces from our small town. There was also a group of people in non - school colors in a small section of the stands. This harsh reminder made me focus on warm - ups. The twenty - minute warm - up period seemed to pass in no time. The announcer started stating our starting lineup, but the crowd's roar drowned out the speaker system. It seemed like everyone from our town of five thousand was at the game. The bleachers were packed, and the bench vibrated from the crowd's stomping and clapping, threatening to collapse with each shake. The starting five from each team walked to the center of the court for the tip - off. We lost the tip - off and were quickly under pressure. From the first possession, we were chasing our opponents. The first two quarters ended in a tie. Discouraged, we regrouped in the locker room at halftime. We entered the locker room just before our coach. I took the opportunity to look at my teammates' expressions. All I saw was disappointment and fear on their faces. I braced myself for the coach's outburst, expecting him to throw keys at the wall or smash the clipboard, as he had done before. To my surprise, he entered the locker room calmly, as if our poor first - half performance didn't bother him. Instead of yelling or criticizing, he rubbed his eyes, with his face down and shoulders hunched. His belly started to shake, followed by his shoulders. I first thought he was crying, but then I heard him laughing. He said, ""Look at yourselves! You're all more hesitant than when I asked [PERSON2] out to my first dance!"" His speech, though using an unrelated metaphor, made us laugh. It eased our nerves, and we became the confident team we should have been from the start. The whistle blew to start the second half. We played with great assertiveness and confidence. If you compared our first and second - half performances, it would seem like two different teams. We took the lead early in the second half and held on to win the game. This victory advanced us one round deeper into the state tournament. As I walked back to the locker room, I looked around the gym at the crowd, scoreboard, opponents, referees, and news reporters. I realized how easy it is to get distracted by things that shouldn't affect us. We sometimes need reminders like our coach's calming laugh to stay focused. Without that laugh, our team might not have united and defeated our opponents."
614	21485	8	2	"In my freshman year, during the [SPORT] season, I had been [SPORT]ing for about eight years. I made the varsity team at a [NUM1] school in [LOCATION1] in my first year of high school. As the only freshman on the varsity squad, everyone knew me as ""The short kid on the varsity [SPORT] squad."" When I was in eighth grade, I won the junior state championship and wrestled through the brackets without having a full - length match. I pinned all my opponents in the first round; no one could beat me. I knew high - school wrestling would be tougher than grade - school wrestling, and I was right. My coach, [PERSON1], was the funniest person I've ever met. He was my [SUBJECT] teacher since the [NUM2] grade and has been my role model. He made hilarious jokes about the wrestlers on the team. Some people disliked him, but I got along great with him. I ended my freshman season with [NUM3] wins, [NUM4] pins, and [NUM4] losses. I've never been pinned to this day, which earned me the Wrestler of the Year award from my coach, [PERSON4]. When the regional season came around, I knew I had a chance to go to the state tournament. There were six guys in my weight class, and I had beaten four of them earlier in the season. I just had to focus on my upcoming matches and wrestle without mistakes. In the [NUM6] - pound weight class, there were mostly young kids, and I was the most experienced. I was seeded first. The second seed was [PERSON2] from [ORGANIZATION1]. He dropped weight to try and take my spot for the state tournament. In my first match, I faced [CAPS5] from [CAPS6 - CAPS7 - CAPS8]. The match was short; I pinned him in about [NUM4] seconds. After the match, my coach told me a quote I'll never forget: ""[CAPS10], it's lonely at the top, but the view is excellent."" This quote stayed in my mind during all my subsequent matches. I won my second and third matches and reached the semi - finals. I was one round away from automatically qualifying for the state tournament. In the semi - finals, I faced [CAPS5] from [PERSON3], who weighed [NUM8] lbs. I knew he was a good wrestler, even though I had about [NUM9] pounds on him. As I was getting ready to wrestle, I saw him warming up across the gym. He tripped and fell on his face. My coach saw it too and started making fun of him. It was the funniest thing I'd ever seen. I wrestled well and pinned him in double overtime to qualify for the state tournament. My coach walked up to me and said, ""It took you that long to pin someone who can't even warm up without falling on his face."" My coach, [PERSON1], had only about three teeth, which he lost in various ways. He was an adventurous man who loved white - water rafting and [SPORT]. Even though I've moved away, we still keep in touch on Facebook. To this day, he's still the funniest man I know and my idol."
615	21487	8	2	Many people don't think laughter is a crucial part of a relationship. But I firmly believe that having a good laugh with your partner is a wonderful thing because it means you're having a great time together. I'll share a true story about a time when my girlfriend and I were laughing and having a blast, and another instance when laughter played a significant role in my life. In the next [NUM1] paragraphs, I'll explain how laughter has helped me a lot. Laughter is all about having fun and should never be used to hurt or upset someone. Unfortunately, some people use laughter to harm others because they don't care what they say. I've said things I thought were funny, but the person on the receiving end didn't find them amusing. My first story is about me and [LOCATION1]. I've been dating [PERSON2] for about a month, and laughter is a big part of our relationship. We love telling jokes to each other and making each other laugh and smile. If we didn't share laughter and good times, our relationship wouldn't go the way I want it to. So, I try every day to make her laugh with the things I say because laughter is important in life. [PERSON2] makes me laugh all the time, and I think it's great for her because she's a very funny person. As long as there's laughter in a relationship, it's likely to last. The person who has made me laugh the most is probably my dad. Every day when he comes to pick me up, he always has something funny to say. I can't remember a day when he didn't say something humorous. When he has a bad day at work and comes home in a bad mood, I try to say something funny to cheer him up. If that doesn't work, I go to my room to avoid him. But most of the time, he comes home in a good mood because his job is easy, and he likes his colleagues. Things would have been different if we still lived in [ORGANIZATION1]. When we lived there, he had to commute for about an hour each way from [LOCATION2] to [ORGANIZATION1], which put him in a bad mood. I didn't get to see him much then. I always try to say something funny to keep the laughter going. I believe laughter is essential for making friends. Most friends like to joke around and laugh at funny things. When you have a friend who likes to smile and tell jokes, they usually make more friends, and the whole community starts to like them until they say something that upsets people. At our baseball practices, [PERSON3], [PERSON4], [CAPS2], and I like to tell jokes to make the whole team laugh. [LOCATION3] is also very funny; he tells lots of jokes and has funny facial expressions. [PERSON1] is another funny guy who doesn't think he's funny but really is. I have great friendships with all of them. In conclusion, laughter is a wonderful thing in a relationship. It helps build a good relationship with your parents too. I hope you enjoyed my story. Writing about this topic was enjoyable because it explains how laughter has influenced my life, my relationship with my partner, and my friendships. Laughter is an everyday part of life that helps us maintain a good attitude towards others.
616	21488	8	2	As a young boy, I was prone to laughter at almost anything. It was a common trait among kids, after all. As I grew older, I developed a remarkable sense of humor, which made me popular among my peers. My sense of humor grew stronger and more confident with time. I vividly remember the joy of making people laugh and the attention it brought me.  As my body matured and my humor became even more amusing, I became increasingly reliant on my people - pleasing personality. I also taught myself to modify my voice and tone for a more comical effect, a step I believed was essential for enhancing my humorous persona. I had no intention of losing my humor and thus used it to my advantage.  I employed my humor to increase my social standing, gain acceptance from non - accepting peers, and attract the attention I craved. I started to be accepted by higher - status peer groups that once looked down on me, and I seemed to be in the spotlight. My goal was to make my peers laugh through various means, such as rolling down stairs, telling jokes, making teachers angry (which students found funny), and occasionally destroying things. All this was to fit in with the crowd that had previously rejected me.  When I entered high school, I knew my humor needed improvement to keep my peers entertained, but I wasn't sure what to do. This was when I gradually lost my funny and humorous personality. I dropped in the peer hierarchy and ended up with kids I once considered strange. My friends were often negative and lacked a positive outlook, and I allowed them to drag me down when I should have been at the top. This was my first major setback, as I successfully lost my humorous personality.  One particular friend brought me down to an extremely unhappy state, necessitating therapy to regain a normal level of happiness. I finally realized that being someone's punching bag was not fun. I broke free when she moved, as I couldn't bring myself to say I didn't want to be friends. Her departure allowed me to heal and focus on my humor again.  It was difficult to accept that I had lost my humor seemingly forever and my position in the social circle. However, after a month of hard work on both school and humor, I got my personality back to normal. Immediately after regaining my humor, I felt happier, received more attention, and felt like I was back where I belonged, although slightly lower. I had to rebuild my humor, tones, voices, and jokes, but it was all worth it. As a junior, I continue to embrace my humor, and while there's always an uncertain future, I've managed to turn a bad situation around. In the end, it's not about what you have but what you can do to please yourself, and I wouldn't change a thing.
617	21489	8	2	From @NUM1 grade to @NUM2 grade was the happiest time of my life. I had a teacher named @PERSON1, who loved Mickey Mouse. I often wish I could go back to that time.  In @NUM1 grade, when I first entered the classroom, I knew some of my friends were there, but I didn't know the teacher. At first, I wasn't sure what to think of her, but I knew I had to get to know her since she would be my teacher for @NUM4 years. During one of my meetings, my P.E. teacher taught me how to tie my shoes.  Every day in our journals, we had to tell a story. I always talked about @PERSON2, and she would always tell me to write about something new. In @NUM1 grade, my class and I went on a field trip to a coffee shop. In @NUM6, after reading over @NUM7 books, we had a party. Sometimes during the @DATE1 period, we would all get together for an ice - cream party. When @DATE2 came around, we would put on a musical every year.  In @NUM8, I went to outdoor school, and it was both fun and cool. Those years were filled with wonderful memories, and they hold a special place in my heart. I cherish the time I spent in those grades, with those teachers and friends, and the experiences I had.
618	21490	8	2	Laughter truly saved my life. Growing up, I had a pretty normal life. I lived happily with my little brother, mom, and dad in a nice suburban area. However, two years ago, everything changed for the worse when my parents got divorced. At that time, I thought such a thing could never happen to me; it seemed impossible.  As I discussed the situation with my friends and family, I learned to accept that my family would never be the same again. Although I came to terms with my new life, I was often unhappy. However, when I was with my best friends and caring family, I forgot about all the problems at home.  George and I have been close friends since the @NUM1 grade. We are inseparable. Despite having many other friends, he is the one I turn to when there's a problem. He knows me better than anyone else. We talk at school every day, text each other every night, and hang out almost every weekend. The night my parents told me they were getting divorced, I called him crying. He reassured me that everything would be okay in the end and that he would always be there for me. At that moment, I realized I had a true friend who would stand by me through anything.  We would joke about all my problems. To some, this might seem strange, but it was therapeutic for me. Making light of my life made it easier to live. It helped me understand that I needed to let go of the past and that a rough patch didn't mean my whole life would be bad. George knew how to cheer me up and could tell when I needed a good talk or a laugh.  A girl always needs another girl in her life to share secrets, do crazy things, and watch sappy love movies with. For me, that girl is @CAPS1. When we're together, we have a great time. She was by my side throughout my parents' divorce. On the last night in my house before we moved, we sat on my bed in the empty room, recalling all the good memories. Instead of being sad, we laughed for hours about our crazy adventures. We weren't crying because we were upset; we were crying from laughter. We re - lived our best moments that night and refused to let the situation get us down.  My family is unique, but we know how to have fun. I don't have many family members, but we get along well because we're close - knit. Whether we're playing wiffle ball in the backyard or playing pranks with whoopie cushions at my @CAPS2 @PERSON1's house, it's always a great time. During the difficult divorce period, I spent a lot of time at my @CAPS2's house. I didn't have to worry about being constantly questioned about my feelings; I only had to think about what to bring for a hike or a movie - night sleepover. That house is a place where I can relax and forget my worries. It's a safe haven where I can have a good time with my family.  If I didn't have these important people in my life, I don't know what would have become of me. As I grow up, I realize they have shaped me into the person I am today. They helped me through the toughest time in my life, proving their love and care. Some say laughter is the best medicine, but I believe it's love. Laughter helps us through tough times, but the people who make us laugh are what truly matter. I'm grateful for them and love them with all my heart.
619	21491	8	2	"Life is a serious matter that demands our attention. It is what we make of it, and I have always given my best to achieve my goals, even when the path seems senseless. It's difficult not to be affected by the world's chaos and daily problems, but it's surely easier and less stressful to smile than to frown. Living life in the moment, care - free, is truly exhilarating and a state of pure tranquility.  My childhood memories are somewhat faint, but I'm glad to have them. In my view, childhood happiness is the purest. Like most people, I long for that lost purity. It could be my favorite pair of plastic Barbie high - heel shoes or my special princess backpack with all the princesses or @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was my parents making funny faces that made me burst into uncontrollable laughter. All I desired was a picnic under my favorite long - green - haired willow tree, to feel as free as the birds, sing their beautiful songs, and dance with a never - ending smile. I yearn for the fragile youth of a child.  As life progresses, my purity has faded, and the distance between me, others, and the community has increased. I felt alone and isolated. Life's hardships changed me as a person. I felt betrayed and hated by God. I became a cold, impenetrable wall. When I looked at myself in the mirror, I saw only hatred, not a passion for life. This moment changed my perspective on life.  My strong hatred for the world began to hinder me in many important aspects. If I couldn't open up to myself, how could I open up to the world? My ultimate goal was to embrace life, learn, be free, and grow. Through self - reflection, I learned the most important lesson: the power of laughter, optimism, compassion, and understanding. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" and I believe this is a valuable truth.  Laughter has transformed my life and my world. It has become a daily occurrence that I'm proud of. Even in embarrassing, angry, or sorrowful moments, I can still manage a smile. Helping others has made me realize that this is my passion. I want to help the world see that life can take a turn for the worse but still end up okay. There's always light at the end of the tunnel, and for me, a smile can carry me through. I want to be that light, that reassuring presence. I live my life with a gracious smile because, in my opinion, if you create a smile, you'll receive three more. This is my motto: ""Embrace life for its new adventures, just smile, and the world will keep turning as life goes on."
620	21494	8	2	"Laughter is often regarded as a simple reaction to something funny, but in reality, it can serve multiple purposes. It can be a coping mechanism, a means of self - expression, or simply a way to enjoy oneself in the company of friends. For me, the meaning of laughter has changed significantly over the years. When I was younger, I laughed to have fun with my peers, but as I grew older, I started using it as a way to cope with difficult situations.  On @DATE1, the morning of my @NUM1 birthday, I received some devastating news: my mom had passed away. When I first heard the news, I was completely lost. Crying and grieving seemed like the only things I could do, and I sank into a deep depression. My friends tried to comfort me, telling me that ""things were going to be okay."" I knew they were right, but I couldn't help thinking that even if things got better, life would never be the same.  I started asking myself difficult questions: What would @CAPS1 be like without my mom? How would I celebrate Mother's Day? And most importantly, how could I celebrate my own birthday? It's incredibly hard to accept that someone I loved and had been with for @NUM2 years is no longer with me. However, since my mom's passing, I've tried to focus on the positives and what she would have wanted for me, such as graduating high school, becoming successful, and not letting my life fall apart.  Every day is a struggle, but I remind myself that my mom wouldn't want me to give up. You might wonder how I'm coping with this loss, and the answer is laughter. My mom always told me that ""laughter is the best medicine,"" and after losing her, I realized the truth in that statement. Now, whenever I'm upset or sad, I think about the memories I shared with my mom. I laugh at the good times we had together, and sometimes, I even find myself laughing at the arguments we had.  Laughter has helped me cope relatively well in the past four months since my mom's passing, and I hope it continues to do so in the future. I do wonder, though, if it will still work ten years from now. The future remains a mystery, but one thing I'm certain of is that I will become successful. Even if laughter doesn't always work, I'll stay strong and live my life as if my mom were still here. It will be challenging without her guidance, but I'm not alone.  My aunt has been by my side throughout this difficult time. She's been in my life since day one, and my mom and I even lived with her. I'm extremely grateful for her support. She's taught me that I shouldn't isolate myself or stop being a teenager just because my mom is gone. Instead, I should live life to the fullest and live the life my mom would have wanted me to live. She also encourages me to laugh at bad situations and not keep my feelings bottled up. Having someone to go through this with is incredibly reassuring.  Laughter might not be the best solution in every situation, but my advice to anyone going through a similar experience is to keep living life and try to release stress by laughing with friends."
621	21495	8	2	I absolutely love to laugh; it's one of my favorite things. When you're in a bad mood or just can't seem to be happy, laughing at things can surely lighten your mood. Moreover, it's beneficial for you in numerous ways. Without laughter, the world would be a dismal place. A simple smile at someone who isn't happy can completely change their mood.  I'm a very happy and energetic person, and laughing is my forte. I also smile at everyone around me. I like to volunteer at homeless shelters and old folks' homes because I believe in sharing my happiness with others. It makes me feel good to help people.  One afternoon at the old folks' home, I was having a great time, laughing and making people smile. Everyone there loves having me around as I cheer them up. I run from room to room, bringing in vases of flowers and opening the curtains to let in the beautiful sunshine. I always tell them that vitamin D is good for warming up the soul.  There was an old man who never smiled. I treated him the same as the other residents, but no matter what I did, he wouldn't smile. Whenever I entered his room, he was always gazing out of the window with a blank expression. I asked the nurses about him, and they told me he was a veteran. He didn't have much family, or at least his family didn't visit him often. They just dropped him off because they didn't want to deal with his grumpiness.  I decided to turn his frown upside - down and make him happy. One day, as usual, I went through my daily routine in the other rooms, chatting and laughing. I saved the old man for last. I didn't know his name or his background, but I was determined to try.  When I entered his room, he was staring out of the window. I hesitated for a moment, unsure of his reaction. I walked up to him, introduced myself, but he didn't seem pleased. When I asked his name, he said it was none of my business, which really disappointed me.  However, I started talking to him about his life. Slowly, he opened up and told me about his experiences in the war. He turned out to be a nice guy. The nurses were wrong about him as they never even tried to understand him. We laughed for hours, and it was so much fun. Since then, he has started interacting with the other residents.  So, the next time you're at the store and see someone having a bad day, give them a smile! It might just make their day.
622	21500	8	2	"Have you ever had a weekend where you hang out with your best friend and laugh the whole time? Many people don't get the chance to have a day full of laughter because they don't have someone to laugh with. I'm always surrounded by people who love to laugh, and my best friend, [Friend's Name], is one of the funniest people I know. Even when I'm in a terrible mood, [Friend's Name] always knows how to make me smile.  [Friend's Name] and I hang out all the time. Every time we're together, we laugh so hard that we can't breathe. One day, we were both having a tough time. The drama with our friends and boyfriends was really weighing us down.  I was sitting at home on the couch when [Friend's Name] called. ""How are you doing today?"" [Friend's Name] asked. ""I'm just sitting at home watching movies. How about you?"" I replied. ""I'm having a bad day. Would you like to come over?"" [Friend's Name] said in an upset voice. ""Let me ask my parents."" I said and ran to my parents' room. My parents said yes.  About an hour later, [Friend's Name]'s dad picked me up. I could tell from [Friend's Name]'s face that [Friend's Name] was having a bad day and just needed some fun. When we got to her house, we went to her room and started talking. After a few minutes, we were both crying because of our problems. But there was also a moment when we were laughing so hard that we started crying again.  We could sit there for hours, laughing non - stop. [Friend's Name]'s dad walked into the room because of all the noise. ""What's going on in here?"" he asked sternly. ""Sorry, dad,"" we said, still laughing. ""Okay, then,"" he replied, looking confused as he walked out and closed the door. That made us laugh even harder, and [Friend's Name] fell off her bed.  If you knew [Friend's Name], you'd know that once she starts laughing, she thinks everything is funny. The rest of the night, we sat on her bed and talked about everything, from things that happened two years ago to events that week. She told me a story about when she lived somewhere else, and it was the funniest story I've ever heard.  We've been best friends for three years, and I never get tired of her. Some people don't understand why we find so many things funny. A few months ago, when we were with some friends, [Friend's Name] screamed, ""[Funny thing] on my finger!"" It sounded disgusting, but it made me laugh so hard that my stomach hurt. Another time, she painted my nails an ugly color, and I said it looked like [Funny thing] on my finger. Since then, it's been our inside joke.  [Friend's Name] and I have the best times together. The hours we spend laughing are special and can only be shared with a best friend. I'm so grateful to have someone to share all this laughter with. Remember, you're lucky if you have people who can make you laugh, as not everyone has that in their life."
623	21501	8	2	The quote “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people” holds great meaning for many, and I'm one of them. I firmly believe that there's a lot of truth in this quote. A true story that best illustrates my connection with laughter involves my dad and me.  When I was a child living with my parents, my mom and dad fought constantly, and neither of them was ever happy. They both had good jobs, but my mom's love for spending money got them into debt. My dad often had to sell his things to pay off the debt. Eventually, my parents got divorced, which was a good thing for all of us.  After the divorce, I got to spend more time with my dad, and I discovered how much fun and funny he could be. We started going hunting and doing other activities together. I also found that my mom can be even more annoying when she's happy because she gets very hyper and loud. She makes me laugh sometimes, but it's usually at her expense.  I love being with my dad because I always have a great time and learn useful things. I think laughter is essential in any friendship. If you observe how you interact with your closest friends, you'll notice that most of your time is spent making each other laugh.  In conclusion, laughter not only brings people closer but also enriches our relationships and makes life more enjoyable. It's a powerful force that can turn a difficult situation into a positive one, as it did for me and my dad.
624	21502	8	2	"I was in a really low state, feeling utterly dejected. My life seemed to have hit rock - bottom. I had written a letter to my hero, [Hero's Name], but there was no reply. I was determined to wait and see if he would ever respond.  My hero is truly amazing. His music is like a bolt of lightning, astounding and captivating. [Hero's Name]'s music is something I deeply understand. My best friend, [Friend's Name], and I would always talk about how awesome his music is. Our friendship actually started because of [Hero's Name]'s music. At first, we were very different, and I didn't think we could be friends or have anything in common. But his music brought us together.  I wrote a letter to [Location], thinking that [Hero's Name] wouldn't even look at it. I watched [Friend's Name] write her letter too. Weeks passed, and I really thought [Organization] wouldn't read or reply. As time went by, our friendship started to fade. I felt discouraged, and we only talked about [Hero's Name] and [Friend's Name]'s photography project.  We were procrastinating on the project. I was a bit distracted by cheer - leading and high - school homework. I started ignoring [Friend's Name]'s calls and texts. But then I realized I had made a wrong choice, so I called her.  A week later, [Friend's Name], two other friends - [Another Friend 1], my best friend since seventh grade, and [Another Friend 2], my best friend since eighth grade - and I went to watch a very intense movie. After the movie, we went to meet some friends at the dorms. On the way, [Another Friend] and I were telling [Another Friend 1] and [Friend's Name] about an amazing experience in health class. Our health teacher gave us an assignment to draw a perfect body. We facetiously drew an alien - looking body with toes coming out of its shoes and warts all over. We laughed so hard that we couldn't stop, and of course, we didn't turn it in.  When we got to the dorms, [Friend's Name] introduced me to his friend, [New Friend]. [New Friend] was a big fan of [Organization]. As we played games, I noticed that [New Friend] had warts on his hands, and when he took off his shoes, I couldn't help but think he resembled our drawing. I started laughing hysterically. [New Friend] said it was rude, but I said, ""In my eyes, that's the perfect body."" We all had a great laugh and continued playing games and listening to [Organization]'s music.  The next day, [Friend's Name] and I had to work on the photography project. The project was about taking pictures of each other and the things we like and dislike, called ""getting to really know a person."" I learned a lot about [Friend's Name] through this project.  I often feel like I'm living life too fast, and school and sports sometimes hold me back, but I love my life as it gets me closer to my goal of becoming a [Goal]. The project was intense, and it felt like a sign, telling me to keep going.  While we were working, [Friend's Name]'s phone kept ringing. I got a bit annoyed and told him to answer it. He did, and then he said, ""Oh my god, it's [Hero's Name]!"" I thought he was joking, but then he put the phone on speaker, and there he was - my hero on the phone! I was so happy that I started to cry and then blacked out. When I came to, [Friend's Name] and I couldn't believe it. We cried, and then to lighten the mood, [Friend's Name] said, ""[Hero's Name], you talked to your husband."" We laughed for a long time.  Our friendship started because of [Hero's Name]'s music, and it will never end. That day, I realized that miracles can happen, laughter can heal the heart, and we should always have faith and never give up. Someone will always hear us and give us advice when we're in trouble, just like [Hero's Name] said, ""Come take my hand, we'll walk this road together."
625	21503	8	2	On a hot [Date] day during [Time period], I went on a camping trip to [Location 2] with [Person 1] and her family. We stayed in their [Type of accommodation], and our campsite was right by the ocean. We went for daily walks there. We spent a week in [Location 2].  On [Date 2] that week, [Person 1]'s older sister went into labor. She lives in [Location 1], which is a long drive from [Location 2]. That morning, [Person 1]'s parents woke us up at around 6:30 a.m. [Person 1] and I had stayed up until 3:30 a.m., so we were very tired.  We found out that we were going to take a small plane from [Location 5] to [Location 4] airport, and we got a good deal because [Person 1]'s brother works there. Knowing we had a long day ahead on only about three hours of sleep, we both drank strong coffee to keep us going.  On the way to the airport, we laughed at everything - street signs, building names, funny - looking birds, and songs. We also had [Funny accents] that made everything even funnier. My stomach muscles hurt from laughing so much. I wasn't sure if things were actually funny or if we were delirious from lack of sleep, caffeine, and a sugar rush.  When we got to the airport, we still couldn't stop laughing. [Person 1]'s parents were getting frustrated, but they were also laughing. We boarded the plane and sat next to each other.  We were convinced that there was a secret agent sitting behind us. He had spy glasses, a suit, and an earpiece like the ones secret agents who protect the president wear. We made up stories about him and couldn't stop laughing. Eventually, he started talking to us. He told us about the places he was going, and I remember [Location 3] the most. We were so excited to be talking to a secret agent!  [Person 1]'s parents interrupted and asked if we were bothering him. He replied that we weren't and that he had nothing better to do. We even made him laugh so hard that he was crying.
626	21505	8	2	Laughter, to me, is truly the best medicine and plays a significant role in any good relationship. It can be especially beneficial for a serious couple who has forgotten how to laugh and for those in need of a mood - lift. In my own relationship, laughter has made a world of difference.  Initially, my relationship with my boyfriend was far from ideal. We hardly laughed together and barely spoke. We only laughed and had a good time with friends. We weren't really jokers, and even when there was a funny joke, we either got upset or remained silent.  One night, we decided to go to the @LOCATION1 and play a few rounds of @CAPS1. When we arrived, we were in a bad mood, and I was extremely short - tempered. After we sat down, the mood lightened a bit. Then, as we started talking, a small outburst made us practically roll on the ground with laughter. Our faces turned red, and we gasped for air. We laughed so hard that we almost cried, and the jokes just kept coming. Our moods completely changed, and we couldn't even recall why we were upset. It was as if the anger simply vanished.  After realizing how ridiculous we had been, we understood that it was okay to joke around as long as it wasn't mean. Later, we went to a friend's house and had a great time. We told good jokes, laughed a lot, and truly enjoyed ourselves. When it got dark, we headed home, still cracking jokes. That night, for the first time in a long while, we were smiling and happy. Sharing that experience allowed us to connect deeply and strengthened our bond.  Since then, our relationship has been wonderful. We can laugh and have a good time without always being so serious. I now fully understand why laughter is so important in a relationship. Despite our earlier moodiness, all that joking around reminded me that laughter is indeed the best medicine. It can achieve things that nothing else can. Some may not think that laughing is the best, but I firmly believe it is. Those little giggles may not seem like much, but there is so much more to them than meets the eye. Laughter is everything to me, and I don't know how I could live without it.
627	21506	8	2	"I absolutely love laughing! It makes me feel satisfied and happy. When I laugh with a stranger, it's as if I've known them for ages. When I laugh with someone I know well, I feel completely content. But the person I love to laugh with the most is my cousin @PERSON1. I think laughter is a crucial part of our relationship because when we laugh, it's truly magical. The speed and ease with which we can make each other laugh are amazing. We'll say the most random yet humorous things and laugh until we cry.  One @TIME1, while talking on the phone, we decided to call our other cousin anonymously. When he didn't pick up, we hung up disappointed. I was thinking about the @CAPS1 movie I'd watched a few hours earlier, and an idea started to form. I began speaking in @CAPS1 to my cousin, pretending to be our aunt from @LOCATION2. I told her that I was coming for a visit on the @DATE1 and that they'd better be prepared. I described myself as a picky aunt, wanting a nice, soft bed, fluffy pillows, and my own bathroom. Everything had to be perfect for my visit. We laughed uncontrollably.  Then @PERSON1 suggested, ""Why don't we call @CAPS4 again? If he doesn't pick up, we'll leave a message."" I asked, ""What will we say in the message?"" She replied, ""We'll just say that we're his aunt from @LOCATION2, coming for a visit, and we'll make up the rest."" I hesitantly agreed. I dialed *67 and then his number.  Luckily, no one picked up. When the answering machine beeped, I was at a loss for words. Then, in my high - pitched, picky aunt voice, I started, ""@CAPS8 @CAPS4, this is your aunt @LOCATION1 and I..."" But I burst out laughing before I could continue. ""I.. I'm coming over for a visit in.."", and I laughed again. I could hear @PERSON1 laughing in the background, which made me laugh even harder. I tried again and got a bit further, laughing intermittently. By the time the maximum message time was up, I was so into it that I didn't want to stop. When the message ended, I was only halfway done. After the answering machine finished, I pressed 2 to listen to my message. As I listened, I thought about how much of a fool I sounded like. @PERSON1 kept shushing me when I laughed too loudly, but I could tell she wanted to laugh too.  When I hung up, I called her back and said, ""Let's do it again because I didn't finish."" So we called again, and this time I said the rest more willingly and barely laughed. I was saving my laughter for when we listened to it.  After we'd had our fill of laughter and wiped away our tears, @PERSON1 said, ""That was the most hilarious thing we've ever done together. We have to do it again sometime."" I agreed whole - heartedly. But it was late into the @TIME1, and it was time to say goodbye. As I hung up, I thought about what life would be like if no one could laugh. It would be such a boring, lifeless place. When I laugh, I feel alive, and I want to live to laugh another day. Not being able to laugh would be a real shame because I love it so much."
628	21507	8	2	"In my view, laughter is a powerful indicator of the importance of life. I've always believed that in any situation, whether good or bad, laughter can transform the way people deal with it. In a relationship, simply laughing can be incredibly helpful. Laughter symbolizes happiness, and it's essential for the people in a relationship to experience it.  I've had numerous difficult situations where laughter has helped us overcome challenges. It has always changed my mood and assisted me in getting through tough times. When we get overly stressed about minor issues, we often forget about the good things in life and start losing patience with each other. This has happened to me many times.  One such instance was when my boyfriend and I went to @LOCATION1 for a vacation. We hoped to escape our busy home lives, but everything went wrong. The hotel was over - booked, our car broke down, and my credit card account was frozen for @NUM1 hours. The tension between us was so high that we couldn't even look at each other without arguing. We ended up at a cheap hotel, spending our last bit of cash.  The next morning, the situation worsened. Just being in the same room made us want to fight. He left for the day, and when he came back, it was still difficult to be around each other. By the third morning, we were both fed up. We moped around and fought, realizing that this was no longer a vacation but a nightmare. There was no one to lend us money, no banks, only an @CAPS2. We had given up on having a ""good vacation"" and on each other. We no longer saw ourselves as a happy couple but as two people who despised each other.  However, things took a turn when I called my bank and discovered that I had entered the wrong PIN, which had locked my account. When I returned to the hotel, the tension was palpable. I started packing my things, and when my boyfriend asked where I was going, I said, ""to luxury."" His face lit up, and after I explained what had happened, he started laughing and hugged me. I knew then that things would be okay.  We were finally able to rent a car and reach our dream destination. At the hotel, we were smiling, laughing, and truly enjoying ourselves. Despite all the problems, I can honestly say that I enjoyed the trip. I firmly believe that everything happens for a reason, and this difficult experience led us to a week filled with laughter and true happiness."
629	21508	8	2	Laughter is essential for survival in this crazy yet beautiful world. It accompanies us throughout our lives. As humans, we age and eventually pass away, but laughter endures forever. It's often called 'the best medicine', and rightfully so. It brings joy to the sad, relief to the burdened, and life to the depressed. Moreover, laughter is free; no one has to pay for it. It's also contagious. A single smile, a thrown - back head, and a hearty laugh can spread like an epidemic through a room.  When I was younger, I had a neighbor named @PERSON1. He was an older man who spent most of his time in his carpentry shop. He rarely interacted with the neighbors, and we didn't try to strike up conversations with him either. I noticed his little red pick - up leaving in the morning and returning at night, following a strict routine.  @PERSON1's wife was also quite reclusive, and to us, she was like a monster. We'd accidentally kick soccer balls into her yard, and she'd come out yelling and waving her hands. She even left a note on my family's door, scolding us about our lawn. I felt sorry for @PERSON1 having to live with her. Her voice seemed strange, as if she were deaf, which made me a bit sympathetic towards her.  I'll never forget the day an ambulance pulled up in front of their house. I sat on my porch, watching the medics go inside. Soon after, I heard @PERSON1's pick - up. I knew this was not part of the normal routine. After about @NUM1 minutes, a body was carried out on a stretcher. My heart sank. I was young, but I understood the significance of the white sheet.  After his wife's passing, @PERSON1 became very withdrawn. My family decided to bring him meals. It wasn't anything fancy, just enough to keep him going. He was incredibly appreciative. We also made sure to stay off his lawn, as his wife had loved it.  My sister and I started walking his small, white dog and invited him for dinner whenever our mom allowed. He became more like a grandfather to us.  One sunny day, my friends and I were playing soccer on the street. The ball rolled into @PERSON1's yard. When he opened the door, he looked annoyed as he bent down to pick up the ball. But then, unexpectedly, he started laughing. It was the kind of laugh that made him seem almost crazy with happiness, with tears running down his face. My friends and I started giggling too. He threw the ball back and went inside.  From that day on, laughter has held great meaning for me. It can reach into a person's soul and connect people. Without laughter, life can seem dull. In @PERSON1's case, laughter helped him heal and start to live again.
630	21509	8	2	One day, I was at home babysitting my little brother. It was an incredibly boring day, so I checked my email. I was excited to see an email from my boyfriend, but it turned out to be a break - up email. It was such a shock that I wanted to cry.  I called my mom on the home phone and asked if my best friend @PERSON1 could come over. My mom said yes. I called @PERSON1 and told her what had happened, sobbing uncontrollably by then. @PERSON1, who is my best friend in the whole world, agreed to come over. She always knows what to do and say when I'm upset.  I waited for her for a long time because her mom takes forever when she's out. When she finally arrived, she gave me a big hug. We've always been there for each other. I've supported her when her boyfriends dumped her, so it felt good to have her support me this time.  We went to my room, and I couldn't stop crying. It was like a river flowing down my face. Being dumped is a horrible feeling, especially because he was the best boyfriend I'd ever had. @PERSON1 was sitting there texting, and I wondered why she wasn't comforting me, but I didn't say anything.  We decided to go to the mall, but when we asked my mom, who had just come home, she said no. I really didn't want to be at home; anywhere else would have been better. Back in my room, I started crying again.  Then @PERSON1 started saying bad things about my ex - boyfriend. I knew they weren't true, but it was so funny that we both laughed hard. I started to feel better. Thank goodness for @PERSON1's stupid ex - boyfriend jokes! Laughter truly is the best way to make everything better.
631	21510	8	2	"The mere thought of seeing him and hearing his laughter always brought a smile to my face. I was gradually accepting that this was an irresistible urge. His sense of humor was the most remarkable I'd ever come across, and it made my heart flutter. In my view, the most precious part of a relationship is getting to know each other and discovering the little quirks that make a person unique. A quality I always look for in someone is their sense of humor, and when I find it easily, I'm drawn to it.  My story began nearly a year ago, towards the end of my freshman year. I had a suitcase full of new memories, but one more was yet to be added. On an ordinary day, I walked into art class just @NUM1 seconds late. The air was filled with the musty smell of rain and old paint, a scent I'd grown accustomed to. Instinctively, I took my seat, blocking out the world with my headphones. I paused my music to focus on my surroundings. A highly sarcastic voice came from in front of me. ""@CAPS1 to go! You're late."" I realized that the teacher had rearranged the seats, and I couldn't help but laugh at myself. However, my seat remained the same; the only change was the people sitting around me. As class started, I greeted the familiar faces with a smile.  The teacher droned on about art - related topics that I already knew well, so I paid little attention out of habit. Instead, I was more focused on the boy sitting in front of me. I'd never spoken to him before, but there was something incredibly fascinating about him. We barely exchanged a few words that day.  The next day, I followed my usual routine of entering the room and sitting in the same place. I'd forgotten that a stranger would be sitting in front of me. He entered the room and took his seat. What I'd forgotten actually excited me. It was a free - work day, a time to socialize and work at our own pace. It was the perfect opportunity for me to learn something beyond art. I casually introduced myself, trying to convey my personality in my words. His introduction was far less enthusiastic. His lack of interest only made me try harder. I started being myself, as if I'd known him for years, even though his name was brand new to me. That's when I caught his interest, and the conversations started flowing. By the end of the day, I hadn't finished any of my work, but I didn't care. I'd just met such an alluring new person.  Each day passed in a similar way, but I learned to balance work and conversation. I couldn't get enough of this person I'd let into my life. Everything he said intrigued me, and every word pulled me in. I'm sure everyone in the room noticed how funny I found him because my laughter filled the room so often. It didn't take long for me to become deeply attached to him and his every hilarious comment.  After a couple of weeks, the hour of class wasn't enough for us, and he decided to call me. I intrigued him too. So our conversations didn't end at school; they continued over the phone. As more time passed, it became a regular thing to talk to him often. I no longer had to pretend that I'd known him for years. It was more than a month and a half into our relationship when I started to feel comfortable.  However, along with familiarity came doubts. I was opening up to him, but I wasn't getting the same in return. I'd share something from my past, and he'd make a joke of it; I'd explain my opinion, and he'd pretend to agree. I'd never laughed so much in such a short time, but it was time to have a more real connection. I wanted to be able to share personal things and get something meaningful back from him. I began to realize that I was trying to find depth where there was none. The constant laughter in our relationship was clouding my judgment of who he really was. I couldn't connect with him on a deeper level. I still wanted him in my life and to enjoy his company, but I knew it was time to stop trying to dig deeper and look for new connections."
632	21511	8	2	"One stormy night, I went to the wood shed to get some wood. The wind was violently shaking the trees, and in the distance, all the coyotes were howling at the moon. I was carefully taking one piece of wood at a time, making sure the pile wouldn't fall on me. As I watched my step, I slipped on a small, cylindrical log about a foot long and hit my head.  My brother came out to see what was taking me so long and found me unconscious. He carried me into the shop, which was connected to the woodshed, to get me out of the cold and turned on the furnace to keep me warm. In the process, he accidentally locked the door from the outside, trapping both of us inside.  When I woke up from my faint, I had a splitting headache, and all I could remember was the rain pounding against the side of the woodshed. @CAPS2 was sitting next to me, looking sad and shocked. He told me about the locked door and that we wouldn't be able to get out until morning.  I looked around, trying to find something to unlock the door, but I couldn't figure out what anything was. Our parents were asleep and couldn't hear us over the storm, so we were helpless no matter what we tried. Instead of being gloomy, we decided to tell stories and jokes to pass the time until morning.  We made up a game called @CAPS1 and discovered that we had many similar interests and laughed at the same jokes. As we laughed, time seemed to fly by as if we were in a time - warp. After three hours, we both started to get hungry, and I had a couple of snacks in my pockets. So we sat by the furnace, ate, and told jokes about our friends and parents. The laughter kept us in good spirits for another three hours.  After a while, we started to hear the storm fading away, like a ghost leaving this world for the next. We began making fun of different movies and their actors. I started joking about how big @PERSON1's ears were, and we both laughed uncontrollably. Then he joked about how big @ORGANIZATION1's lips were, and I laughed so hard I could hardly breathe.  We looked through the holes in the shop and saw the morning dew on the grass and the birds chirping in the trees. I knew it wouldn't be long before we were found. As we waited for our parents to come, we looked at each other and said thank you. We both knew that this ""thank you"" was not for me trying to get us out of the shop or for him pulling me into the shop. It was for the time we spent together, laughing. It brought us closer than we already were and gave us a memory of laughter instead of a night of disaster and horror. Ever since then, even though we sometimes fight over small things and tease each other, we know that deep down, it's out of love."
633	21512	8	2	Spending time with friends, whether it's on an adventure or just having a laid - back time, is one of the best parts of my life. I went sturgeon fishing for the first time with my buddy @PERSON2. I hadn't known him for long because I'd just moved to a new school. When he invited me to go fishing, I thought he seemed like a cool guy, so I decided to give it a try.  We'd only slept for two hours the night before because we'd been up all night having a great time. The alarm went off at @TIME2, and we were extremely tired. We got the boat ready and headed to the @LOCATION1 river. When we arrived, we unloaded the boat into the river. It was the coldest I'd ever been, and I wasn't sure if I'd have fun because I was wet, cold, and tired. Finally, the sun came out and started to warm things up. By @TIME1, we were out on the water with our fishing poles ready.  We drove the boat to the fishing spot. Everyone said we were crazy for going there because it wasn't supposed to be a good spot. But my friend's dad was one of the best fishermen I'd ever met, so I just went along with it. They taught me a few fishing tips, and before I knew it, we were catching fish and having a great time.  Around mid - day, it was lunchtime, but none of us wanted to stop fishing because we were catching so many fish. We waited a while and then finally started eating, talking about all the fish we'd caught and the fun we'd had.  As the day went on, the sun got lower, and the temperature dropped. We caught a lot more fish. It was time to get off the water, so we all reached our fishing limits. We went back to the dock, loaded the boat onto the trailer, and headed home. On the way home, all we could talk about was the fishing that day, how much fun we'd had, and how many fish we'd caught. Fishing with my friends was an unforgettable experience that I'll always cherish.
634	21513	8	2	"Laughter is like a powerful drug that works better than any painkiller or anti - depressant. It can turn an angry person happy and a happy person ecstatic. One of the best and most common ways to have a good laugh is by watching a funny movie. Whenever someone asks me about my favorite comedy, I always say ""@CAPS2 with @PERSON1"".  I remember the first time I watched a @PERSON1 movie. I was about @NUM1 years old, in second grade, and it was towards the end of the school year. I was eagerly looking forward to the @DATE1 break. It was an ordinary, boring school day, and I walked home hoping to find something fun to do. When I got home, I saw my brother watching @CAPS3. I asked him what he was watching, but he ignored me. So I went to my room to do my homework.  After finishing my homework, I walked into the living room and sat down on the couch next to my brother. I asked him again what he was watching. He sighed in annoyance and said a movie called ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" was about to start. Within the first five minutes, we were in hysterics. We weren't just giggling; tears were streaming down our faces from all the laughter. I remember saying to my brother, ""@CAPS6 is the funniest movie I've ever seen!"" By the end of the movie, my brother and I couldn't stop quoting it. Every @NUM2 seconds, we'd say a line from the movie, and the laughter was non - stop.  We sat on the couch, waiting to see what was on next, hoping it would be another amazing movie. After the commercial break, we learned that it was a @PERSON1 movie marathon, and the next movie was ""@CAPS8 @CAPS9"". The movie started just as funny as the last one, with @PERSON1 doing something incredibly stupid yet hilarious, like growling at some dogs over a loudspeaker. We couldn't get enough of him. My brother was rolling on the floor, laughing and crying, while I was eagerly watching to see what would happen next.  About halfway through the movie, my mom came home from work. She walked in to see my brother and me in fits of laughter and asked, ""@CAPS10's so funny?"" We just pointed at the @CAPS3 as @PERSON1 started rolling down a hill. Soon, our mom was also watching and laughing as hard as we were.  I was having a wonderful time with my family. I couldn't have asked for more, but then there was another @PERSON1 movie. The next one was called ""@CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14"", which was completely ridiculous and hilarious. What could be funnier than an overweight guy trying to be a @CAPS14?  We watched the movie until dinner time. We quickly ate our food and then rushed back to the couch to continue watching. When it was time for bed, I remember staying up late, reciting movie quotes in our bunk beds until our mom came in and told us to be quiet. I don't know how we managed to sleep after all that laughter.  These movies left us speechless. We'd never seen anything funnier. They made us laugh, cry, and our stomachs ache. Most importantly, they brought my brother and me closer together. To this day, my brother and I can sit down and watch one of those movies, laugh, and remember all the times we've watched them and the laughs we've shared. I swear that a large part of my childhood was filled with laughter, and @PERCENT1 of that laughter came from these @PERSON1 movies. Laughter is truly an essential part of life, and these movies are a perfect example of its power."
635	21514	8	2	I firmly believe that laughter should be a significant part of everyone's life. For instance, laughter has brought my mother and me closer than ever before. One time, we were sitting in her camper. We hadn't seen each other for a whole month, so we just let loose, and laughter was one of the things that came out. We were laughing about fake teeth. We laughed so hard that I made my mom accidentally wet her pants. We talked about fake teeth for about an hour.  Laughter makes me feel better about myself, and I think it has the same effect on everyone. It's a great way to show that you know how to have fun, and there's nothing wrong with that. Knowing how to laugh and have a good time is an excellent way to start a friendship or even a relationship.  Another example is that when I'm with my friends, I can never stop laughing. I love it because it keeps me from being sad. When I was a little girl,
636	21515	8	2	"Well, you guys wanted to hear a funny story. I've got a few, but I'll tell you just one. It all started in [DATE1]. I was living in [LOCATION1], and it gets really hot there in [DATE1]. I'd spent a couple of summers there, so I knew just how hot it could get. That [DATE1], I decided I wanted a pool, both for fun and to stay cool. But I didn't want a pool just for myself. I wanted a really nice one for everyone. I knew those kinds of pools cost a lot of money, but I wanted a big one so I could have all my friends come over, hang out, swim, and play my favorite game, Marco Polo.  I went to talk to my dad about my pool idea. He said he'd love to get a pool for [DATE1] because he'd come in and swim with me and hang out. But, as I said, pools are expensive, and that's exactly what my dad said. I told him I'd pay for half of whatever it cost. My dad finally agreed, and we went down to Walmart to look at their pools. There were some cheap, small ones and a lot of huge, expensive ones. I was looking for one right in the middle, not too small and not too pricey. I found one for eight hundred dollars that was perfect for what I wanted. I asked my dad if I could get it. He said if I paid four hundred like our original deal, I could have it. I told him that's what I said I'd do and that's what I needed to do.  We agreed we had to get the money first. So, I went back to my house in [LOCATION1] to make a plan to get four hundred dollars. My dad was doing the same, but he had a job, so it wasn't that hard for him since he got paid. It was a lot harder for me because I had no job. So, I decided to fix my bike and go look for any available jobs. I went door to door to find people who needed help around their houses. I found a couple of people who needed some things done, and they both agreed to pay me fifty bucks. So, right off the bat, I could get a hundred dollars. I had to haul a bunch of old tree branches and garbage away. When I was done, I put that money in my pool savings for later.  I also went to a place called [ORGANIZATION1]. I was good friends with one of the kids related to them. I talked to him about asking them if I could do some work for a little cash. They said I could go to every tree and put a pink tag on it, and they agreed to give me eighty-five bucks. I took the deal, but my bike couldn't go through the mud where the trees were planted. My friend said I could borrow his little fifty dirt bike to put those tags on the trees. So, I borrowed it and got that eighty-five bucks. I gave my friend ten dollars because he let me borrow his dirt bike.  I was almost halfway to my four hundred dollars. Then, I realized I'd gotten so caught up in buying this pool that I'd forgotten my birthday was coming up tomorrow. I told my dad I wanted that pool for my birthday, and he was like, ""Yeah, I already knew that. I already bought it."" I was so happy that I got my pool. Now I had about two hundred dollars to spend, and I didn't know what to buy. So, I bought a bunch of food and stuff for the pool party.  On my birthday, I invited a bunch of friends over to my house. We all got in the pool, even the parents. We decided to play Marco Polo because I wanted to. My friend [PERSON1]'s dad, who's a huge guy, was playing. I said ""Marco,"" and he lunged at me. I moved, but he kept going. He went straight through my pool's wall, and everyone fell out of the pool. I was laughing so hard, but I was also upset because my pool was already broken. Luckily, [PERSON1]'s dad is rich, so he bought me another pool. He saw how crushed I was on my birthday and knew I wanted that pool. He also bought me a new bike, and it was awesome. During [DATE1], I had a great time in my pool. And when I wasn't in the pool, I was on my new bike."
637	21516	8	2	"Laughter is an essential and powerful element in life. Without it, I can scarcely envision where I'd be today, who my friends would be, or how I'd get through my days. Laughter has been the foundation of one of the most significant relationships in my life, with [CAPS4].  I met [CAPS4] a year ago in a class. We didn't talk much or know each other well until one day when she made me laugh. It was an ordinary day in class during a lab. I saw a short, ginger - haired girl twitching on a bar stool. I immediately burst into laughter. This girl was twitching around on the stool, making awkward hand gestures and laughing herself. I cracked up, but no one else found it funny. They just gave us the ""you girls are insane"" look. When others asked what she was doing, [CAPS4] was too hysterical to speak. I said, ""Hello dudes, she is a dinosaur like from [CAPS7] the [CAPS8], 'I have a big head and little arms.... I don't think this plan was thought out very well....'"" [CAPS4] responded by pointing at me and shaking her head. I knew then that this was the start of a beautiful, laughter - filled friendship.  There have been countless instances where laughter has been the center of my time with [CAPS4]. When we hang out, we effortlessly amuse not only ourselves but also others, even complete strangers. A prime example was when we were at [ORGANIZATION1], a hotel with an indoor water park, for my birthday with two of our best friends. Our time there was already full of laughs, pictures, and a great time. But when we were all dressed up and looking for something to do, that was the highlight of the [TIME1]. After two nights of no sleep, loads of sugar, and energy drinks, our little group of four was more crazy than usual. This gave [CAPS4] the courage to approach a very attractive stranger and get him to say hello to me, the birthday girl. [CAPS4] and I started to dance and then fell to the ground laughing. Most people might have thought we were strange and left, but this guy was entertained by our laughter and even joined in.  Perhaps the best memory of [CAPS4]'s contagious laughter was when we went to see [CAPS1] to [CAPS14] your [CAPS15]. This night could have easily gone downhill quickly. [CAPS4] was yelling at the movie, cracking jokes, texting, and making us laugh - all the things that can get you kicked out of a movie and annoy the people around you. But for some reason, the people around us found her humor hilarious and laughed along with us.  Laughter has given me this amazing best friend, [CAPS4], who is crazy and humorous. [CAPS4] makes me realize that laughter unifies us. So, we should all be willing to act a bit silly, even if it seems odd. You never know who you might make laugh and what new friends you could gain."
638	21517	8	2	"My sister [PERSON3] and my niece [PERSON2] had just come down from [LOCATION2]. It had been three years since I last saw them. When my brother [PERSON1], my sister [CAPS1], and I went to my dad's for the weekend, we decided to go camping near the beach.  That morning, we all woke up early and packed everything in the car. My dad and brother did most of the work while us girls got ready. After everything was packed, we headed to [LOCATION1]. [LOCATION1] is a small town surrounded by mountains. There are just a couple of houses, a park, a river, and forests all around. My dad built a small one - room cabin there a few summers ago. It had a wood stove in one corner, bunk beds that took up almost half of the cabin, and a counter that was always messy with all the food and supplies we brought.  During the whole ride, we were all teasing each other. We gave one another horse bites, the claw, and pulled on each other's seat belts so they'd tighten across our chests. We were also telling [PERSON3] funny stories about one another to embarrass them. When we got on the gravel road, my dad started making the car slide back and forth, scaring [CAPS1]. While everyone else was laughing, she was screaming.  That [TIME1], we decided to go to bed early so we could wake up and get ready to go to the beach before noon. [CAPS1] was the only one really wanting to go to sleep. Everyone but [CAPS1] was trying to have fun for the rest of the [TIME1]. While everyone else was having a good time, [CAPS1] was yelling at them to go to sleep and be quiet. [PERSON3] and [PERSON1] started yelling random things just to make her mad. When it got silent, one of them would yell something like, ""It's not too late to sleep like a baby [CAPS5] [CAPS6]."" [CAPS1] would start yelling, and everyone else would burst out laughing.  That [TIME1] was one of the funniest nights there. Looking back now, it might seem stupid, but at the time, it was hilarious. I think we made the most of that [TIME1]. It has become one of my most vivid memories. Whenever we look back at it, we all laugh."
639	21518	8	2	Laughter is generally a positive phenomenon. When people laugh, it usually indicates that they are happy or that something is amusing. It can be highly beneficial. For example, when someone is feeling down, others often try to make them laugh to improve their mood. When I encounter someone new, my initial instinct is often to make them laugh.  Laughter has always been a source of enjoyment and remains so today. We have more opportunities for laughter than we did a hundred years ago. Nowadays, if we want to laugh, we can simply pick up a remote and turn on the [CAPS1]. We can even choose what we want to laugh at and search for comical content on the internet. Some people go to comedy clubs to watch stand - up comedians.  Comedy and laughter are inseparable. Since the first instance of laughter, comedy has existed and will continue to do so, unless happiness is somehow prohibited. I recall that whenever my parents had a new friend over, all I could hear at home was the sound of them and the guest laughing. Soon, the new guest would visit more frequently.  Laughter is also a crucial aspect of any relationship. When someone makes another person laugh, they become more pleasant to be around, which can sometimes lead to the other person liking them more. For instance, men often try to make women laugh to gain their affection. Along with physical attraction, this helps initiate a relationship.  I've heard that laughter can be therapeutic, though I'm not entirely certain. Sometimes, when I'm not feeling well, I like to laugh, so it might be therapeutic for me. If this is true, then people have been undergoing a form of therapy for many years.  Sometimes, people laugh even when the subject isn't funny. They do this to avoid an awkward situation. Everyone has a unique laugh. My mother has a loud and high - pitched laugh, while my grandpa has a low and scratchy laugh. Regardless of the type of laugh, it can make us feel better and bring us closer to others.  Laughter is one of life's greatest pleasures, and we should all take the time to simply sit and enjoy a good laugh.
640	21519	8	2	"During [DATE1], instead of staying at home idle, I decided to take up a volunteer job at the library. Some might say that a library is not a place full of fun, but for my best friend [PERSON1] and me, it was filled with numerous and hilarious adventures.  There was the time with the strange guy we nicknamed [CAPS3] [CAPS4]. One day, [PERSON1] and I had just finished working and were waiting for her grandma to pick us up. A strange guy sat down and started staring at [ORGANIZATION1] as if he knew her. He then asked us countless questions like, ""What are your names?"" and ""Do you guys have boyfriends?"" I didn't say a word and let [PERSON1] do all the talking. He also kept telling us how beautiful we were, which made the situation even weirder and made us laugh harder. As his nickname suggests, he then asked us if we wanted to start a [CAPS3] line in the middle of the library. Thankfully, [PERSON1]'s grandma showed up just in time to save us. We only saw the [CAPS3] [CAPS4] once or twice after that because he moved away shortly after the encounter.  Being ""spies"" at the library was one of the most difficult and funniest things [PERSON1] and I ever did. It all started when we noticed a cute guy sitting alone at a table that we could see through some bookshelves. I convinced [PERSON1] to let me use her iPhone to take pictures of the guy without him knowing. After successfully getting a couple of pictures undetected, I decided to take one more. But just as I was about to take the picture, I locked eyes with the guy. We had to abort the mission and crawl to the other side of the library so he couldn't confront us. The"
641	21521	8	2	"@CAPS1, get out of here before they wake up,"" @PERSON2 said as she stood up, wrapped in her blanket. I followed suit, brushing the grass off my pillow. Disappointment washed over me as I actually hoped to watch the meteor shower. ""Coming, @PERSON5?"" I asked, regarding my old friend in a new way. ""@CAPS4!"" @CAPS14 exclaimed, glaring at me with pure anger. It was @NUM1 am, and we were supposed to be in bed by ten. It was the fifth week at @CAPS5 @CAPS6. We'd made new friends and met new people. @PERSON2 and I were @CAPS15 to assist disabled children, while @PERSON5 was @CAPS15 to flirt with all the cute guys who worked there throughout @DATE1. As @PERSON2 and I walked @CAPS9 to @LOCATION1's camper to return the sleeping bags, I couldn't help but feel angry. It was the third time @PERSON5 had been rude to me on @DATE2, and I couldn't fathom what her issue was. It might have been jealousy, as @CAPS16 @PERSON5 didn't like @PERSON3. My mind raced, and I knew it would be a @TIME1. We reached @LOCATION1's trailer and opened the squeaky door. @CAPS15 @CAPS14 was lying on the couch in her pajamas, with her daughter, @PERSON1, safely tucked in bed. ""Girls!"" @CAPS14 exclaimed. ""Where's @PERSON5?"" ""On the field watching the shower with her so - called 'real friends,'"" I said, making air quotations. @PERSON2 rolled her eyes and tightened her grip on her pillow and blankets. ""@CAPS10! @PERSON4, can we sleep here tonight?"" ""@CAPS11!"" @PERSON4 replied. ""@CAPS12 in and lock the door behind you."" We entered the trailer and locked the door. As we plopped onto the beds, @PERSON4 made some chocolate milk. ""@CAPS13, ladies!"" @PERSON4 began, handing us each a glass brimming with delicious milk. ""I want to know the juicy gossip! Why is everyone mad at @ORGANIZATION1?"" ""@CAPS14 is mad at me because your daughter likes me more,"" @PERSON2 said, shrugging and taking a long sip of her drink. ""@CAPS15 is that,"" I said. ""@CAPS16 the other part is a long story. So yesterday, I was talking to her about @PERSON3. You know cute core - guy @PERSON3?"" They nodded. ""@CAPS17 I told her about a conversation @CAPS20 and I had. I told a @CAPS18 stupid joke, and out of pity, @CAPS20 laughed and said 'that's cool.' I was @CAPS18 excited, and @CAPS14 was laughing at me because I was jumping up and down."" ""That doesn't sound mean,"" @PERSON2 stated. ""@CAPS19! @CAPS14 then told me that @PERSON3 doesn't, and never will, like me. @CAPS14 said that @CAPS20 just thinks I'm stupid and feels sorry for me."" I was almost shouting. ""I mean, out loud I agreed with her, but in my head, I was screaming furiously. @CAPS20 loves me! We're gonna get married someday!! I decoded his words with my heart!!"" I slammed my palm against my chest and pretended to cry. Then I couldn't help but laugh. All three of us were laughing hysterically at my feigned passion. ""@CAPS3 should write skits for @CAPS22!"" @PERSON4 said, gasping between fits of laughter. Suddenly, @PERSON2 stopped laughing and said, ""I @CAPS18 want some coleslaw! Random @CAPS23!"" ""I could go for some coleslaw right now,"" @PERSON4 shrugged. ""I could go for some @PERSON3 - slaw right now!"" I said, smiling. Instantly, new laughter erupted from everyone. I thought about how much the humor of this story would fade each time I retold it. Somehow, I knew I couldn't do it justice. The laughter subsided. We sipped our milk quietly, lost in thought. As I looked out the window, I saw @PERSON5 walking towards us from across the field. With a groan, I got up to unlock the door. ""@CAPS24 it!"" @PERSON4 said. ""And turn off the light. Anyone who hates my @NUM2 - year - old daughter doesn't need to be here."" I flicked out the light and made my way @CAPS9 to the bed. @PERSON5 reached the door and tried the handle. When @CAPS14 found it locked, she softly knocked and waited. We buried our faces in pillows to muffle our uncontrollable laughter. Giving up, @CAPS14 walked away through the gravel. We all burst out laughing again. Looking at the clock, @PERSON4 gasped. It was @NUM2 in the morning, and @CAPS5 would start in @NUM4 hours. It was time to sleep. @PERSON4 went @CAPS9 to her bed, while @PERSON2 and I said good - night and rolled over. The trailer fell silent. Lying there, I thought about the happiness we'd created. I knew @ORGANIZATION1 would be @CAPS25. But her anger was worth what I'd learned. That @TIME1, I realized that if your happiness makes someone mad, it's their fault. Be happy and enjoy life! Anger stems from others' joy. So why not be @CAPS26? It's better than the alternative."
642	21522	8	2	It was @DATE1, and I was ten years old. I was bored and slept a lot. Even at that age, playing with toys was the highlight of most days. All my fifth - grade friends were on vacation, either surfing in @LOCATION1 or roasting marshmallows with their families at camp, while I was stuck at home with nothing to do. It seemed like it would be the most boring @DATE1 break ever until one day in @DATE3. The day I met @PERSON1 was the day I gained my best friend. I met @PERSON1 because of my brother and his sister. They had crushes on each other and wanted to date. Our parents were okay with it, but it also meant that his brother @PERSON1 and I would have to tag along. I remember the first day being incredibly uncomfortable and stiff. I could tell he didn't like me. He only chuckled at my occasional jokes. But as time passed, I must have grown on him because a few days later, he was laughing at almost every joke I made. These jokes eventually led to a lifelong friendship, which truly started when his birthday came up in late @DATE2. He was having a small overnight birthday party with me, his family, and his good friend @CAPS1. @CAPS1 couldn't stay overnight, so it was just me and @PERSON1. I didn't sleep much that night, but that was okay because the reason was good. We spent half the night talking, laughing, and getting to know each other better. Anyone could see that we were becoming close friends. Even after our siblings broke up, we still hung out just the two of us. The real test of our friendship came shortly after his birthday when @PERSON1 and his family moved to @LOCATION2, their hometown. After they moved, I still kept in touch with him, and we talked frequently. They'd been gone for about a year when I got a call from @PERSON1 saying they were moving back. I had so many questions, but the connection was bad, and the call dropped quickly after I heard that. I was happy but also a bit confused. Was he really coming back? That question kept me wondering. Days later, I got another call from him, and this time we could talk. It was true; he was coming back, but not forever. @PERSON1 came back for about @NUM1 more years, and we had a great time being best friends. But then his parents wanted to move back to @LOCATION2 again. This time, he wasn't coming back. He left my life as quickly as he'd entered. Now he's halfway across the country, with new friends and a new life, probably laughing at new friends' jokes.
643	21525	8	2	"Laughter can be a wonderful thing, but sometimes it can also be a bit sad. My family and I went to @LOCATION3 for my two little brothers' appointment. We left a bit early to have some vacation time. When we arrived, we took a ferry to an island in @LOCATION1. On the way, my sister @PERSON1 was acting like she was on the Titanic. She had the dress and everything. My brothers, dad, and I couldn't stop laughing because she's eighteen. While we were staying at our uncle's house, they have a little dog. @PERSON1 was running from it and fell hard. My family and I didn't mean to laugh, but it was hard not to. After we had lunch with our uncle and aunt, we went to their military base. @PERSON1 couldn't keep her hands off the jets. What was funny was that @PERSON1 is eighteen, and the rest of us are fourteen or younger, so we like to tease her. When we went to @LOCATION3, it was the night before the boys' appointment. Our family went on an underground tour of @LOCATION3. After the tour, we went to the gift shop at the end. @PERSON1 bought a pin with something inappropriate on it. When our @CAPS4 saw it, she threw it away because she doesn't like such things, but @PERSON1 retrieved it from the trash. After that, we got hungry and went to a place that sells really @CAPS1 tacos. We ordered food and sat down. We also got sodas. My other sister and I took a bite of our food and a drink. Then @PERSON1 said, ""Oh my gosh, there are two really hot guys right there."" Sierra took a big gulp of Tapatío, and @PERSON1 said something that made me and Sierra burst out laughing. We spit our food all over @LOCATION2, and she got up and screamed. Of course, our parents and family didn't want to stay there anymore because we embarrassed them. As we walked to the car, our uncle @PERSON3 yelled, ""PERSON1, don't fall because this is where I fell."" And then we heard our sister fall behind us. It was so funny. What made it even funnier was that me and Sierra had just stopped laughing. We laughed all the way to the car. On the way home, @PERSON1 was mad at us because we were still laughing at her, but when we went to the beach, she got over it. I think the beach was where we started to bond more. We were all playing, no cell phones, taking lots of pictures, and rock - climbing. It was fun. We left @PERSON1 and my brother @CAPS2 behind a few times. @PERSON2 tried to throw me into the water, so I pushed him back. @PERSON2 threw a rock at @LOCATION2, and she fell over. When we were taking a picture on a @CAPS1 log, we were all shaking it, and @PERSON1, Sierra, and I fell off. I hurt my arm, so we had to go to the doctor. A month after we got home, our @CAPS4 took @PERSON1, Sierra, Aunt @PERSON4, and me to @CAPS3 on ice. It was probably the best time of my life. Our @CAPS4 said, ""I don't know what's funnier, @PERSON1 waving to the actors on the ice who can't see her in the dark or the show."" Our aunt said, ""Yeah, thank you @CAPS6 for making me sit next to her."" When the cartoon ""Toy Story"" came on, Sierra and I said, ""Look, @PERSON1, what are you doing on the ice arena?"" She thought we were talking about the pig, and we all burst out laughing. Our whole family has a lot of laughter. I can't wait for more laughter - filled moments so that when I grow up, I'll have great memories. When we laugh together as a family, that's when we really communicate."
644	21526	8	2	I have a friend named @PERSON1. I've known her since fifth grade when we were in the same class. We've been friends for about five or six years, and it's been an amazing friendship. About two years ago, for her fifteenth birthday, she invited a few friends and me to spend the day at her dad's place in @LOCATION1. There was a pool to swim in, a flatscreen TV to watch movies, plenty of board games, and lots of people to talk to. On the morning of @DATE1, we loaded the car around noon and headed to her dad's apartment in @LOCATION1. After a short @NUM1 - minute drive, we arrived at the apartment complex. We were all excited for the day of hanging out and having an awesome sleepover for @ORGANIZATION1's birthday. As soon as the van stopped, all five of us in the car, including me, unbuckled our seat belts as fast as we could and got up to go to the house. Everyone managed to unbuckle except for @CAPS4's friend
645	21529	8	2	"@CAPS1 @DATE1"" @CAPS2 my brother graduated @CAPS1 year it was a great time in our lives . We all were having fun daily because it was like my brother didn't have rules any more this made him a lot more fun to be around. At the beginning of the @DATE1 my brother and I were going fishing almost daily with our friends. It was a very fun for all of us. We all got to hang out and stay connected because there is nothing ells to do in our small town except for go to the lake and fish for bass.   @CAPS2 he graduated everyone close to the family gave him gifts like money or presents. My mother however couldn't decide what she wanted to get him. @CAPS2 she saw us always going up to the lake to go bass fishing she had an idea, she would send my brother and a couple of his friends on a fishing trip. My brother was very excited to here her plan. They spent many hours searching for a place for him and his friends to travel to. They decided on going into the deserts of @LOCATION1 to a huge lake to camp at.  I myself thought this was a very cool plan and i was happy for my brother. Little had I known my brother was planing on taking me with him. He told me his plans of who he would be taking a couple weeks before it was time to depart. I was so excited! My brother said we would be taking our friend @PERSON1 on the trip with us witch was cool because he is a fun person to be around. He was so so happy @CAPS2 we told him he was going because he loves bass fishing more than us.   Immediately @PERSON1 ran out to the garage to get his camping and fishing gear ready for the trip as did we @CAPS2 we got home that night. Two weeks later we all departed for a two week trip to the deserts of eastern @ORGANIZATION1. The first day we were in eastern @ORGANIZATION1 before we even found the place we were going to stay at we went to a huge reservoir to go fishing. @PERSON1 almost caught a huge @NUM1 inch bass however his line on his fishing rod broke. My brother and I laughed at him and he was mad.  We spent the first night on the side of the road in the near freezing dry @LOCATION1 air because we had accidentally gone a day early and our camp sight was occupied in the campground. We were unhappy about it at the time but now we look back on that night with great laughter. The next few days went by with much fun. We met some collage students from @ORGANIZATION1, they were very chill people to hang out with we all joined around the camp fire and told jokes. We laughed for probably a half an hour @CAPS2 one of the guys told us about some funny collage party things that had happened. @CAPS1 @DATE1 was a very interesting @DATE1 that was full of laughter and joy.  "
646	21530	8	2	"Laughter is one of the most delightful experiences in the world. Everyone can relate to it, and no one would claim they don't enjoy laughing. As social beings, humans naturally desire and need connections with others, and laughter is the ideal way to forge these connections. Generally, laughter is devoid of negativity, except perhaps when laughing at a rude comment. When people laugh, they usually have a good time. People build relationships through shared experiences, like dating. On a first date, it's both expected and crucial for the two individuals to have fun and laugh. Otherwise, when they part ways and reflect on the encounter, their impression can either strengthen or end the relationship. This is why a first impression holds such significance. If, when recalling the date, they remember smiling and laughing, they're likely to have a positive memory and want to meet again. Think about any interaction with another person. The way you felt after your first meeting can reveal a lot about the relationship's development. Meeting new people can be challenging, but if you ask someone how to start a conversation, they'll often say, ""Make them laugh."" It's a universal approach that anyone can use. Last month, the basketball season began, and I'm on a different team from last year. Only half of the girls from my previous team are still here, so I've had to connect with younger girls I don't know well. I've become good friends with most of them because of laughter. Every day on the court, we find ways to laugh together, growing closer. No matter how tough practice gets, you can't feel too exhausted when someone makes you laugh. Laughter is essential for a more fulfilling life. Imagine if you could never laugh again. Life would be as dull as being in detention all the time, with no chance to relax and have fun. No one would want that. Laughter calms people and shapes personalities, affecting those around them. It's like a ripple in water, starting with one person and spreading to others. Laughter is contagious, bringing joy to you and those around you. It truly is the foundation of happiness."
647	21531	8	2	"Whenever my parents ask me where I'd like to go during the @DATE1, @LOCATION3 is always my top choice. The rolling green hills, beautiful sunsets, and exciting thunderstorms are significant attractions, but seeing my @CAPS7's side of the family again is the main reason. My @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is the heart of my @LOCATION3 family. With her warm smile, kind nature, and great sense of humor, she easily makes friends. However, since we live hundreds of miles apart, I only see her three times a year. My family drives to her house twice a @DATE1, and she visits my grandparents for a few weeks in the @DATE2. I cherish every moment with her, especially when she accidentally makes a funny blunder. A few summers ago, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, my @CAPS7, and I went to @LOCATION2 to explore the town's antique and flower shops before dinner. We spent hours driving around, looking for treasures for their old - fashioned homes. I lost interest after a few hours as antique shopping isn't my thing, and I was eager to go back to @LOCATION1 to swim with my cousins. After @CAPS7 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 spent most of their money on a couple of ""treasures,"" we were tired and ready to go home. We passed a pizza shop on the main street. The thought of pizza made our mouths water, so we ordered one to take home. My @CAPS1 @CAPS2 parked the white @ORGANIZATION2 pick - up in the shop's parking lot, leaving @CAPS7 and me in the car while she got the pizza. When she returned a few minutes later, the smell of pizza filled the cab, making us even more eager to get home. She put the pizza in the back seat, grabbed her coffee, and started the engine. Suddenly, the front tires dipped down and thumped onto the road. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 almost dropped her coffee, and @CAPS7 panicked, grabbing the door handle. We were all shocked. Then we realized she'd accidentally driven over the curb. We burst into laughter, and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had a red face and an apologetic smile. She drove carefully, and we all laughed hysterically with tears in our eyes. Our laughter lasted until we pulled into a vacant parking lot. I wiped the tears from my eyes and tried to calm down. @CAPS7 was still giggling, and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 turned to look at me, smiling sweetly, which made us laugh again. After the laughter subsided, we drove back onto the street. I joked, ""@CAPS27 not to run over anymore curbs!"" This made us laugh again. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 has always been there for me. Although we're separated by miles, the bond between us is strong because of the humor and laughter we share. Without them, our relationship wouldn't be as close, and we wouldn't have this world of joy together."
648	21532	8	2	"@CAPS1 days are diamonds and @CAPS1 days are stone,"" as @LOCATION1 so melodiously put it. And the day of @DATE1 was definitely a ""stony"" one. I woke up late that day because I'd stayed up until eleven the night before to finish my homework. In a hurry, I pulled on a sweater and rushed to school. Running under the gloomy gray clouds, I suddenly remembered the geometry test. By seventh - period geometry, sleep deprivation was hitting me hard, and my head was pounding. To make matters worse, @PERSON1 decided to cheat off my test. When he glanced at my paper for the third time, I sighed and stared at his paper, hoping he'd get the message. But @PERSON2 thought I was the one cheating. I took the scolding silently and went to my locker. After gathering my things, I turned to go home. A loud ripping sound made me groan as I realized I'd torn my sweater on the locker corner. Ignoring my peers' stares, I ran into the pouring rain. Once I reached my quiet road, I couldn't hold back. I shouted at the sky until my throat was raw. I'd never had an emotional breakdown before, and it felt strange. I hoped no one would see me like this, as I felt like a lost and hurt stranger. When I got home, my @NUM1 - year - old sister, @PERSON3, begged me for macaroni and cheese. I sighed and put a pot of water on the stove. Somehow, I spilled half the pot of steaming water on myself. It wasn't very hot since I'd just put it on, but I sat on the kitchen floor, head in my hands, and cried. My sobs sounded like a frog croaking. Suddenly, I felt a small hand on my shoulder. ""@CAPS2?"" @PERSON3 asked. Then she told a joke: ""@CAPS3 did the dog say to the cat?"" I just stared at her with teary eyes. She answered, ""@CAPS4 are a cat - astrophe,"" and started giggling. I couldn't help but giggle too, and then we laughed uncontrollably. It was a silly joke, but the laughter soothed the pain of the day. There we sat, a giggling little girl and a messy, laughing teenager, on the kitchen floor on that gray day. One simple joke and a fit of laughter turned my ""stony"" day into a ""diamond"" one."
649	21533	8	2	After I got my driving permit, my dad took me out to teach me how to drive. I was nervous at first, but I quickly got comfortable behind the wheel. We drove around town to run some errands. Then it was time for my first experience of going through a car wash while in control of the car. I thought it would be easy after driving around town, but I was wrong. I had a hard time pulling up to the right spot for the wash to start. Then I had to roll up all the windows and fold the side - view mirrors. But before I could do all that, the wash started! A whirlwind of soap surrounded the car. I rushed to fold the side - view mirror and managed to do it. Unfortunately, I was too slow to roll up my driver's window. The soap came back and covered me in white foam. My dad and I got wet, and the inside of the car got cleaned, even though that wasn't the plan. I finally rolled up my window and looked at my dad. He looked back, and the car was silent. Once we processed what had happened, we burst into laughter. We couldn't stop laughing during and after the car wash because the situation was so unusual. All I could think was that most people go their whole lives without having such a car - wash incident, so why did it have to happen to me!
650	21535	8	2	"You've probably had the experience of talking to a friend who tells a hilarious story, like the time @DATE1 when they spilled soda on someone at a neighborhood barbecue or tripped in front of a classroom on the first day of school. And you laugh so hard you cry. I remember those days well. Laughter always makes you feel better. When friends hang out, laughter is often part of the fun. To joke around and find things funny, you need to be comfortable with the other person. Laughter brings people together, even on bad days. We all have awkward situations when talking to someone we don't have a great relationship with. We try to make it less awkward, and sometimes a random joke can lighten the mood. When you make someone laugh, the tension eases, and it's easier to talk. I've had fights with friends and then had to talk to them for class or because they wanted to. It's uncomfortable not knowing what they're thinking or if they're judging you. But when you make them laugh, you know they're in a better mood and not thinking badly of you. When a friend is crying, you want to cheer them up. Joking around or making them smile or laugh can distract them and improve their mood, even though there's still some tension. It's said that ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" and I believe it. When you joke with someone, you learn more about them, and they're more likely to open up. If you can make someone laugh, they're more likely to become your friend. The more you and a friend can laugh together, the closer you become because you enjoy spending time with each other and understand each other better. When you can joke freely with someone, you can also talk freely about anything, knowing they'll be there for you. I love hearing funny stories, even though I don't have many of my own to remember. Laughing with friends always brightens my day. But sometimes people laugh or smile when they're uncomfortable. For example, when someone asks a question you don't want to answer, you might giggle. Or when talking to a stranger, you might laugh and mess up your sentences. I'm not sure if it's to make the situation less awkward or because you're confused about what to do. Sometimes it makes the situation more awkward, but other times it helps if the other person jokes back and keeps the conversation going. Even with people you know well, you can have awkward conversations or laugh so hard you cry. It's also said that ""Laughter is the greatest medicine,"" and I agree. Laughter improves your mood, makes you more positive, and helps in all kinds of conversations, whether they're awkward, sad, good, or just normal. Sharing a good laugh with anyone, be it a friend, classmate, parent, or even a stranger, brightens your day and eases stress."
651	21536	8	2	"Laughter holds a special place in life, as it can turn ordinary moments into cherished memories. I've had numerous such memorable times with my friends and family. There's nothing quite like laughing so hard that your stomach aches.  One of my most recent unforgettable laughing experiences was with my mom, whom I don't see often. The last time she visited my older brother and me, we went bowling. She brought her friend along. My brother and I, though out of practice, were confident we'd win. However, my mom managed to beat me. Her technique was rather unusual—she'd throw the ball sideways down the lane, yet it would somehow end up in the middle. We had a great deal of fun and laughter over this. It was the first time I didn't mind losing. Moments like these are truly special, as they can help us get through tough times.  Another remarkable laughing moment was spent with my dad and brother. Occasionally, we sit in our living room and engage in conversations about various topics, including my mom, school, our pets, and our shared love for sports. These talks are meaningful to me because we don't get to spend much time together. My brother and I are usually busy with school or sports, and my dad is always at work. These conversations have different effects on me; sometimes they make me sad, and other times they make me feel better. There are so many humorous moments in our living room. One of our favorite things to laugh about is the way my dad pronounces ""album."" For some reason, he adds an extra ""b,"" saying ""alblum."" My brother and I like to tease him about it, but we also have other things to laugh about as a family.  Laughter is an essential part of life. For someone who is on the verge of giving up or feeling down, a simple gesture to make them smile or laugh can make a world of difference. It's a wonderful way to make people feel loved and accepted and to help them get back on track when they're feeling low. I know that smiles and laughter make me feel better inside. I hope that everyone has had similar great laughing moments with the people they love and care about."
652	21537	8	2	"During the [DATE1] of [NUM1]', I spent two weeks at my aunt's house. At that time, my cousins were living with her. My cousins and I are very close, so we enjoyed spending time together. One evening, we decided to watch a movie called ""My Best Friend's Girl."" The movie was extremely funny, and we laughed continuously throughout it. My cousin [PERSON1] has a great laugh, and whenever he started laughing, I couldn't help but join in.  After the movie, we went out to get some food. We were all in high spirits, joking around and doing silly things to make each other laugh. My cousins would change their voices, imitate lines from the movie, or just make up funny things. That night, we ate at [ORGANIZATION1].  When we returned to my aunt's house, none of us were tired, so we decided to watch a late-night program called [CAPS1] [CAPS2], which was a collection of short cartoons. They were all very amusing, and we made fun of the characters, laughed, and mimicked their actions.  We stopped watching the program at about [NUM2] in the [TIME1]. I was very tired, but my cousins weren't. For a while, we just sat on the couches, talked, and continued to make jokes. About an hour later, we all fell asleep.  For the rest of the two weeks, we continued to watch movies and hang out. It was probably the best time of that [DATE1]. I was very happy because of the time I spent with my two cousins. I laughed so much that my stomach hurt, but I didn't care because I was having a great time. I still spend time with my cousins and laugh a lot. I believe that our shared laughter has brought us closer and made our relationship stronger. A person who can laugh and have a good time is always fun to be around."
653	21539	8	2	"Love as long as you live, breathe as long as you love."" It seemed impossible that [CAPS2] could be real. Breathing was a struggle, as if I were choking on air. The world around me blurred and spun violently as I clung to the freshly cut grass. Tears soothed the burning in my eyes but not the sting in my nose, yet neither caused my body to tremble as much as [CAPS2] did. My attempted screams came out as muffled moans. Alone and helpless, I could feel her staring at me, unsure of what to do. My best friend stood and watched as I became more and more agitated, pounding the dew-soaked lawn with my fists. My whimpers turned into shrieks.  A door slammed behind me, and I felt my father's arms trying to guide me towards the house. Once inside, my dad buried my face in his chest, more to silence my loud wailing than to comfort me. He apologized repeatedly; I imagine he didn't know what else to say. It was too early for the ""In a better place"" speech, but too late for everything to be okay.  I continued to cry as I stumbled up the stairs to my bedroom, [PERSON2] following closely behind. Sitting on my bed, it seemed like nothing in the world could be worse. Suddenly, I had an overwhelming feeling that I was missing something, as if he were closer than I thought. I sat up and saw his plastic sunglasses on my dresser, staring back at me. They had a black frame with neon blue sides. Memories of him and his ""stunna-shades"" flooded my mind. I remembered him standing out of the car sunroof, shirtless and flexing, or propping himself up in class pretending to be awake. Seeing the glasses was like looking into his eyes. In my mind, his face showed grief and frustration; he didn't want me crying. The few times tears fell down my face, he'd say, ""Come on, suck it up and take it like a man!""  I knew in my heart that he wanted me to be with the people he loved and for us to be smiling. With the morning sun on my back, I pedaled my bike as fast as I could. When I reached her front porch, I realized that the time I was about to spend in that house would be unlike any other. As I let myself in, as I always did, [CAPS6] peeked around the corner, her eyes swollen and discolored. I took four steps forward and embraced her tearfully. I could sense that she wished I was him. She loved him in a way I'd never imagined, but I knew all too well the desperate longing to be held by a loved one. We cried and held each other because there was nothing else we could do.  When our sobs subsided and [PERSON3] finally looked at me, she noticed that I looked as terrible as she did. I reached into my pocket and pulled out his sunglasses. It was hard not to be selfish at that moment, when all I wanted was to be comforted, but I knew what I had to do. Forcing a smile seemed impossible, but I knew it was the right thing to do. Her gaze fell to my hands. ""Oh my,"" she started weeping again, and I held her and tried to be strong. More of my friends emerged from the kitchen, their faces tear-stained and red. I smiled at them gently. They all noticed the sunglasses in my hand but didn't understand; they hadn't known him the way [CAPS6] and I did.  We spent the day together, at a loss for words and hungry. The pizza sat untouched, and the television was on just to break the silence. No one said much. ""Do you remember the time he hid our biology project in the freezer?"" I blurted out, feeling like the question was too big to swallow. They just looked at me, not sure what to think. I worried that I had spoken too soon, thinking that all the sadness and crying were supposed to last longer. To my relief, [PERSON3] smiled and nodded. ""And you got mad because he kept putting the nuts in your noodles."" I laughed out loud; I couldn't help it. The memory of him pretending to be confused about the cashews floating in the boiling water flooded back. ""Do you remember how he'd always braid your hair?"" [PERSON3] smiled even more.  The rest of that month was filled with tears, but it also overflowed with laughter. When [PERSON1] died, laughing was the last thing I wanted to do. He was the one who made me laugh the most, and I never thought I'd laugh again without him. But in reality, just because he left too soon doesn't mean the laughter had to stop. My happiness in his memory will never fade."
654	21540	8	2	"Laughter is one of the most important aspects of my life, as it often serves as the motivation I need. Whether it's looking back on an embarrassing situation and finding it funny or having my best friend make me laugh when I'm angry, laughter has a way of brightening my mood. Even when I'm feeling sad, being around the right people who can bring out the laughter in me ensures that my sadness won't last long. I know that a few giggles here and there can quickly take my mind off things.  Recently, I started going to the gym. I've always been overweight and out of shape, so I didn't think my gym routine would last. When my mom suggested we try out a gym and took me on a tour, I was really excited. It was something new, and I was so eager to start that day. However, my mom, being more practical and the one who would be paying for the monthly membership, wanted to think it over. In the end, she decided it was a good idea for us.  At first, my mom was my motivation. I was so out of shape that I got tired after just five minutes on the elliptical at the easiest setting. Seeing my mom on the treadmill beside me, working hard and not slowing down, kept me going. Just looking at her made me so happy that I'd often let out a short laugh. She'd give me a questioning look, but then she'd laugh too. At the time, I thought it was because I was tired and a bit delirious from the exercise, but now I realize I was just happy that my mom and I finally had something to do together.  Unfortunately, those happy gym days didn't last long. As usual, my mom got too tired and stopped going. I promised myself that I'd go once I could drive myself. A few weeks after my birthday, I got my license, but there was another obstacle. My car was a [NUM1]-speed, and I only knew how to drive automatic. After begging my mom almost every day to take me to practice on my new car, she finally agreed.  In the dark church parking lot, the same place where I learned to drive automatic, more laughter filled the air. She had me close my eyes and ""feel"" where the clutch and accelerator were about halfway. At first, I thought it was so ridiculous that I started laughing, and my mom joined in. Once I got the hang of taking off, which is the hardest part for me, laughter made the whole process easier.  I quickly learned to drive a stick shift, and true to my promise, my first solo trip was to the gym. My motivation this time was the satisfaction of doing something good for myself on my own. On the way to the gym, I sang [PERSON1] in the most twangy voice I could manage, which led to more laughter.  The first few times I went to the gym, I was motivated by the knowledge that I was doing something positive for my health. But after about the fourth time, my motivation started to fade. Instead of listening to my iPod on the elliptical, I started watching ""[CAPS1] I [CAPS2] [CAPS3] [CAPS4]"" because it made me laugh while I was working out. Before I knew it, the episode was over, and I had been going strong for almost an hour, burning [NUM2] calories. I was really impressed with what I had accomplished, and my motivation was fully restored.  I started going to the gym daily again. In a week and a half, I lost [NUM3] pounds just by going to the gym, working out, and, most importantly, laughing. Part of my success was self-motivation, but a big part was the laughter that distracted me from the hard work. As I got into better shape, I was able to increase the ""[CAPS5]"" level on the machine, and I still go to the gym every day. Each day gets easier, and now I have ""[CAPS6]"" and ""[CAPS7] [CAPS8]"" to make me laugh even more while I'm working out.  I believe that laughter has saved me in many situations. Whether I'm sad, mad, or lacking motivation, laughter is always an option. Knowing that I have those laughs to look forward to at the end of the day makes me keep getting in my car and driving to the gym. I'm still losing weight, and for the first time in my life, I feel truly energized. Laughter has played a huge role in this transformation."
655	21541	8	2	Laughter is the most crucial element in life. It has the power to turn a sad moment into a happy one and make a great moment even better. A perfect example of this is how laughter brought my boyfriend and me together.  I had a crush on [PERSON1] for two months. I was too nervous to talk to him. One day, my friends and I were walking down the hall where he happened to be. When I saw him, I tried to turn around and walk the other way, but my friends pulled me back. They told me they
656	21542	8	2	Laughter can be aptly described as a “@CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @CAPS3”. Regardless of the language one speaks, when something humorous happens, the natural response is to laugh. This reaction is universal, and when it occurs, it is contagious and has the effect of bringing people together. Laughter also conveys a sense of happiness and joy, which in turn makes people feel more at ease and willing to join in the laughter. In many situations, when faced with awkwardness, laughter plays a crucial role in lightening the mood and making the atmosphere more comfortable.  In @DATE1, laughter was a significant factor in the success of our annual @ORGANIZATION1. Our @ORGANIZATION1 consists of approximately @NUM1 people, including cousins and close friends. As such, getting to know and interact with everyone is not an easy task. However, during dinner, we change things up by sitting next to relatives we don't usually sit with. Initially, it is often very awkward, and for younger kids, it can even be frightening, especially when they end up sitting next to our loud and opinionated aunts and uncles.  This changes when my @LOCATION1 decides to tell one of his hilarious jokes. My @LOCATION1 has a knack for dealing with awkward situations. It's not that he enjoys being in them, but rather he enjoys observing how they unfold. About halfway through the meal, after eating in near - silence, he stands up and gives a short toast to the @ORGANIZATION1. He always concludes his speech with a well - rehearsed joke that makes everyone laugh. Some of the younger cousins may not always understand the wordplay, but what really gets them excited is hearing our aunts and uncles shout things like “@CAPS5 @CAPS6” and “@CAPS7 help me” along with their boisterous laughter.  After the fun subsides, the awkwardness fades away, leaving us with the feelings of happiness and joy described earlier. These feelings directly contribute to lightening the mood and helping everyone feel more comfortable with their dinner companions. Once this happens, conversations flow freely, and people get to know @ORGANIZATION1 members they might not have otherwise met.  Laughter is one of the keys to a happy life. Without it, life would be dull and uninteresting. Laughter has the power to transform situations for the better. In @DATE1, laughter improved a situation in my life, just as it has done many times since. In my view, laughter is the best @CAPS2 of @CAPS3. To truly get to know someone, all you need to do is make them laugh.
657	21544	8	2	I'm a person who chooses to have a positive outlook on life and am generally a happy individual. Who would want to go through life being angry all the time? Even at my lowest points, I'm aware that I have a lot to be grateful for. That's why laughter is a daily part of my life. When I'm with my friends and family, I'm always laughing. Laughter is like medicine to me, and I wouldn't be the same without it.  When I was in the fourth grade, my family and I started going to a new @CAPS3. I didn't know anyone there and was really nervous about going on @DATE1 at @TIME1. Mom walked me downstairs to the classroom, and the teacher introduced herself. Her name was @PERSON1. She was beautiful, very tall, and had a funny Australian accent. She was dressed in alligator - skin boots, black jeans, and a pink top.  Ms. @PERSON1 introduced me to the class, stating my name and grade. After I took my seat, we recited @CAPS1 verses and read short clips of @CAPS2 stories. When @CAPS3 ended, mom came downstairs to pick me up. Reluctant as I was to leave, I took her hand, said goodbye to @PERSON1, and went back upstairs. None of the other kids said a word to me, but on our way up, a girl about my age, whom I recognized from the class, said goodbye. I responded with a smile and a wave.  One week later, mom took me downstairs to @ORGANIZATION1. This time, I was determined to make a new friend. I sat next to the girl who had said goodbye to me the previous week. I introduced myself, and she told me her name was @PERSON2. We quickly became close. Every week, I was so excited for @CAPS3 because I could spend time with @ORGANIZATION2. We became best friends! We played on the same soccer team and practically lived at each other's houses. In fact, @PERSON2 has her own toothbrush at my house, and I have one at hers.  One time, when @PERSON2 and I were in @CAPS3 (now that we're older, we go to the main service), we laughed so hard that we almost wet our pants! @PERSON2 and I have so many wonderful memories together, and as we grow older, these memories will last forever.
658	21545	8	2	In my opinion, making jokes or talking about funny things and laughing with others can make conversations more comfortable and allow people to see your true self. Laughing is one of the most crucial elements in any relationship because you need to have fun and find humor in various situations. Laughter also makes you feel closer to others. Once you get to know someone well, you'll find yourself laughing at almost anything, even if it's not particularly funny.  For example, when I first meet people, I'm usually very shy and don't talk much. But if the person I'm talking to makes me laugh, I feel more comfortable and start joking around with them, which makes the conversation enjoyable. Without laughter, a relationship is almost lifeless. No one wants to be around someone who lacks a sense of humor.  I believe that everyone has a funny side. Some people like to show it, while others prefer to keep it to themselves. Some may be funnier than others, but we can all be funny in our own unique ways.  I've had many experiences where laughter has enhanced my relationships. I met my friend in middle school. I was good friends with his sister, but I didn't really get to know him until high school. Since we had many classes together, I started talking to him. Because I already knew his sister, I wasn't very shy around him.  On the first day I talked to him at school, he was joking about how I brought chocolates to his house but didn't offer him any. It was an inside joke. Our relationship began with laughter and joking around, so I immediately felt like I could be myself around him without worrying about his judgment. Now, we're best friends. We laugh about everything and have our own inside jokes. When I talk to him, I can say anything I find funny, and I know he'll laugh at it. Laughter has made our friendship a lot of fun.  One of the best relationships I have is with my sister. We laugh all the time when we're together. When either of us is going through a tough time, we still manage to make each other laugh and forget about our problems for a while. Even though we're sisters and have a natural bond, laughter makes our sisterly bond even stronger.  In my view, laughter is extremely important in a relationship. Without it, a relationship would be miserable and unhappy. Laughter brings out the best in people and often reveals their true selves. When you first meet someone, laughing can make the conversation more comfortable and less awkward. Starting a relationship with laughter can lead to a great friendship, like mine with my friend. When you're sad or angry, having someone who can make you laugh can really improve your mood and help you forget about the negative aspects of life for a while. Laughter is an excellent way to bond with others, and having someone to laugh with is essential in life.
659	21546	8	2	When I was around thirteen, my older brother and I decided to spend the day fishing. I got out of bed that morning, threw on a pair of old, torn - up blue jeans, and went downstairs for breakfast. As I walked, I could smell the delicious aroma of eggs and hash browns, which made my mouth water. My brother, Ethan, was already up and had finished his plate. My mom handed me my plate, and I reached for the bottle of @CAPS1.  Ethan, sitting across from me as I ate, said, “We'll leave in an hour or so.” I agreed and continued eating. After breakfast, we gathered our fishing poles and tackle boxes and put them in the car, along with an old boat that we sort of “borrowed” from our old neighbor lady. We loaded our stuff into the van, and mom drove us into town. It was about eight in the morning, so we wouldn't be back home until around three or four in the afternoon, depending on how the fishing went.  There was a small store in town, and a creek ran right behind it. It was a small creek that I had grown up around, so I thought I knew what to expect. We launched the boat behind the store, and mom left after telling us to be safe. It was a chilly @DATE1 morning, a bit cloudy. The water was cold, and my brother suggested I wear his waders. I thought it was silly since we'd be in a boat, but I put them on anyway, and we put the boat in the water. This was the first time we'd ever used the boat, so it was really exciting.  As we floated downstream, the water got faster and louder, and the embankment was like a wall separating us from the outside world. When we rounded the next corner, there it was: a waterfall about as tall as a man. It wasn't the kind you'd see in movies, but it was impressive to us. There was a big rock in the middle of the waterfall, with water flowing around both sides. We were pushed right up against the rock and almost thrown out of the boat. We grabbed the rock for dear life.  We were stuck, and my brother nodded as if to say that going downstream was our only option. So, we let go and let the water carry us. As soon as we let go, it was like being on the back of a two - thousand - pound animal in a rodeo that only lasts a second. When the boat sank, my waders filled with water immediately, and it took all my strength to hold onto the boat that was now pulling us downstream. We lost all our gear except the tackle boxes, an oar, and that old boat.  It was a struggle, but we finally got the boat out of the water, poured the water out of it and out of me. I was terrified. This was supposed to be a fun fishing trip, but it had turned into a fight for survival. We couldn't turn back; the only way home was to keep going. I was cold, wet, and had no other choice. We tried again, only to sink once more.  We spent most of the day carrying the boat around rapids and through brush until the water calmed down enough for us to put the boat back in. We reached a large pool, big enough to fit a house. There were small rapids running through the middle of it. It didn't look too bad, but after what we'd been through, we were extra careful. We went around the rapids through the pool. As we passed, the boat barely grazed the end of the rapids and we were pulled in.  I tried to keep from sinking, but my waders were too heavy. As I swam towards the shore, my shoe fell off and went downstream. Stupidly, I chased after it on my belly. The water was faster than I thought, and it was pulling me. I was swallowing a lot of water and couldn't breathe. I could feel the water getting deeper, and soon I couldn't touch the bottom. My shoe was right in front of me, and I finally managed to grab it, barely having any strength left. I reached the shore and just lay there, coughing up water.  After ten minutes, I got up and went back. I think it was just pure luck that we survived that day, but somehow we did. Looking back, I've learned a lot from that experience, and now I can laugh about it.
660	21547	8	2	It's true that laughter is important in any relationship, friendship, and in life. Sometimes, laughter can get you out of trouble, and other times it can get you into it. However, the more we laugh, the happier we'll be.  One instance where laughter came in handy was during my @CAPS2 school days. In the @NUM1 grade, students were divided into groups: the popular girls, the band nerds, the hippies, and the jocks. You could always tell who belonged to which group in the lunch room. The popular girls would sit with the jocks, with each girl flirting with a boy. The band nerds would be on the floor, making straw recorders and drums out of milk cartons. The hippies would sit in a circle, sharing a tray of salad. These groups rarely interacted with each other.  I was part of the hippie group. We wore green every day and decorated our small bodies with as many peace signs as possible. We were the nicest group and participated in every @CAPS3 @CAPS1 friendly activity. We did recycling every day. My @CAPS2 school experiences were amazing. The best thing about our group was that we knew how to laugh. We'd giggle, chuckle, or laugh so hard that our mouths would be wide open, our hands on our stomachs, but no sound would come out.  On a beautiful @DATE1 at @TIME1, we decided to sneak out of the lunch room. I'm not sure why we did it; we just really wanted to sit outside and eat. The golden rule at lunch was that students had to raise their hand to be excused, take a green card, and
661	21548	8	2	"Laughter is one of the most wonderful experiences humans can have. We can share laughter with friends, family, and even strangers. It transcends ethnicity, age, gender, and disability, bringing people together. Laughter is both simple and complex. It's like immersing oneself in a pool of pure joy. Just the word ""laughter"" fills me with happiness. When our days turn sour, laughter sweetens them. Without laughter, our lives would be much duller.  Laughter is a powerful tool. It has helped me make new friends and resolve conflicts with both friends and foes. It has also assisted me in achieving my goals. During my middle - school years, my family moved frequently. Each time I changed schools, making new friends became increasingly difficult. However, I noticed that laughter was key to making people like me and accept me as a friend. But as I moved more often, laughter turned from an enjoyable experience into a mere tool for making friends.  When I entered high school, I stopped trying to make new friends. I thought I'd just keep moving and repeating the process. I focused on schoolwork and getting good grades. But later, I felt lonely. When I tried to make friends again, it was much harder than in middle school. People's sense of humor changes as they grow older, and I couldn't be the funny guy I once was.  I realized that making friends isn't about making everyone laugh. It's about getting to know people, relating to them, and being there when they need you. Making friends at a new school isn't easy, but it's not impossible. You just need to be open and let people know who you are. Laughter is truly wonderful. It puts people in a good mood. Despite our differences, we can all laugh together. A good laugh feels great, especially when it's shared with someone who wants to make you happy. We should never take laughter for granted as it brings smiles to our faces."
662	21549	8	2	"One day after school, my friend and I went to my house for the night. We had a blast. First, we played video games and laughed so hard when one of us died in the game. Then it was dinner time. My mom told us to stop playing and come eat. At dinner, we had a lot of fun. When my parents weren't looking, we threw stuff at each other.  After dinner, we started playing games again. Around ten o'clock, we were really tired, so we put on the movie ""Step Brothers"". It was the best part of the day. We laughed non - stop at everything in the movie. We loved it so much that we wanted to watch it again the next morning.  But before that could happen, my friend's dad came to pick him up. That was the end of our amazing time together. We laughed all night long, and it just shows that laughter can bring people close together."
663	21550	8	2	"I had a best friend, @PERSON2. We became friends in first grade. We were never the quiet, book - reading type. Instead, we played sports with the boys, got dirty, and had a great time. Laughter was a huge part of our friendship. We would keep our parents up late with our crazy jokes, loud laughter, and wild adventures.  We had a favorite restaurant, @PERSON1 @PERSON1. @PERSON2's @CAPS5 would take us there at least twice a month, and we always ordered the same thing. We could find humor in things that others didn't understand. We'd sit in the booth and talk about funny times and stupid fights, ending up laughing uncontrollably.  On a warm @DATE1 @TIME1, @PERSON2 came to my house to spend the @TIME2. We had the whole night planned. We were going to convince her @CAPS5 to take us to @PERSON1. After that, we'd go for a jog and then an ""adventure"". We called @CAPS2 and managed to talk him into taking us, but we had to do some work first. We went to @LOCATION1's house, mowed the yard, planted plants, and weeded the garden. Then we went to @ORGANIZATION1, dirty, sweaty, and exhausted.  By then, everyone at @ORGANIZATION1 knew us well. We made jokes with them and sometimes got to go in the back room for ranch. We ate our food, got extra fries and ranch, and were full. When it was time to leave, @CAPS2 had to go to the bathroom. While he was gone, @PERSON2 and I talked about a boy she was interested in.  When @CAPS2 came out, I noticed his zipper was down. I didn't want to say anything until we were further away, but he was too close. As we were walking out, I told @PERSON2 to tell him. When she turned and saw, she burst out laughing because he was talking to a group of people with his zipper down. We were hysterical trying to tell him. Finally, he zipped up, laughing nervously.  On the way home, we laughed so hard our stomachs ached. @CAPS2 said he was in a hurry to write down the lyrics of a song he liked, which I thought was hilarious. @CAPS2 went home and bought the song on i @CAPS7 and learned to check his zipper more often. @PERSON2 is the perfect best friend for me, and our similar sense of humor makes our friendship even stronger."
664	21552	8	2	I had a best friend, @CAPS1. One weekend, while waiting for him to come over, I decided to ride my bike. I rode around the block a few times, but then I hit a curb and crashed. The handlebar hit my lower rib cage. My mom took me to the doctor, and it turned out I had only bruised my rib.  On the way home, I was in a lot of pain. My mom stopped for ice - cream, but it didn't help. When we got home, I lay on the couch. @CAPS1 came over. He asked what happened, but I didn't want to talk about it right away. We had dinner, played a game, watched some movies, and then fell asleep.  We woke up to the smell of bacon. I was still half - asleep. By the time I realized I was awake, @CAPS1 was downstairs. I was in so much pain that I couldn't get up, so I just lay there. @CAPS1 came back upstairs to see why I hadn't come down. When he saw me lying there, we started to laugh. I noticed I felt a little better, but I didn't think much of it.  After breakfast, my mom said that since I was hurt and @CAPS1 was a guest, we could play instead of cleaning. We played Mortal Kombat @NUM2 and other games. I won most of the time until @CAPS1 started to cheat, but it was still fun.  Then we watched a funny movie. We laughed so much that I almost forgot about my rib pain. We went to the park to play basketball. When @CAPS1's shot bounced off the rim and hit him in the face, I thought it was funny, but he didn't.  When we got bored, we went to the market for a snack. I told @CAPS1 what happened with my bike. We looked at the bruise, and it looked like a smiley face, which was both funny and creepy.  When we got home, @CAPS1 wanted to ride bikes. I was a bit scared at first, but we rode around my yard. His mom came to pick him up soon after. When I went inside, my mom asked how I felt. To my surprise, the pain was gone. Laughter truly is the best medicine.
665	21553	8	2	On a rainy @DATE1, there was a soccer game that I was part of. It was the last game of the season, so it was really important to me. As I left home in my uniform, my aunt said goodbye. Then, out of nowhere, a big black rain cloud appeared. I thought the game might be called off.  When it was my turn to go on the field, as I was waiting for the ball, I fell on my face. Then I fell again, and the coach took me out. I went back to the sidelines, hoping the team could win without me. Unfortunately, we lost the game by two points.  After the game, it was time to leave, but my aunt was nowhere to be found. I called her on the coach's phone, but there was no answer. I thought she was just a little late, but as time passed, ten minutes turned into an hour. Finally, she showed up.  I was cold, wet, and disappointed from the game. All my aunt said was not to get mud on the seat, which was hard since I was covered in it. She also said I couldn't go to the party looking like that. I argued that there was no time to waste. After a short argument, she agreed.  When I got to the party, I saw all the food and my muddy teammates. It was quite a day, like a scene from a movie.
666	21554	8	2	"Have you ever been hit by a basketball in the face? One day, when I didn't have school, around 3 pm, I was playing basketball with my friends. We were having a great time playing my favorite sport and cracking jokes. I was making hoops and telling good jokes, and everyone was laughing. Then, my friend Tom asked me a question about some girl, so I turned my face to him. Suddenly, the basketball hit me hard right in the face. At first, I wasn't angry because it was an accident. But then my friends started laughing non - stop, and that made me lose my temper. I wanted to hit all of them. I thought that if one of them had been hit the same way, I might have laughed too. So, I left home angry. When I got home, I was still fuming. I went to the garage where I have a punching bag. I started hitting it to release my anger, just like my dad told me when I was a kid: when I'm angry, don't take it out on the family; go run or hit something. I was in the garage for about half an hour. Then I went to the kitchen to get something to eat. My mom saw my red face and started screaming at me, asking if I'd been fighting. I was already angry, and her screaming made me even angrier. I couldn't take it anymore, so I went to my room and put on some music. After about an hour, my phone rang. I had five missed calls and three messages from my friends, still making jokes about me crying. I was still angry and couldn't forget what had happened. My younger brother, Jake, came into my room with food. I was still hungry because I'd left the kitchen without eating anything due to my mom's screaming. Jake was eating in front of me, making faces and saying it was the best sandwich ever. I couldn't stand it, so I took the sandwich from him. He asked me why I was angry, and I told him. He started laughing, and I gently punched him. Then he asked if I wanted to play a video game, Call of Duty. He's really good at it, and I always suck. Every time he kills me, he makes jokes like ""Who's your daddy?"" After a while, I forgot about what had happened and started to smile. Me and my brother went outside to play soccer. After ten minutes, my friends walked by. Matt screamed my name, and I turned my face again. This time, my brother kicked the ball hard, and it hit me in the stomach. Everyone laughed. At first, I didn't, but then thinking about getting hit twice the same day just because I turned my face, I thought it was funny and started laughing too. My friends came over, said they were sorry for laughing, and the one who hit me said it was my fault for not looking. I just said whatever. I asked them if they wanted to play soccer with us, and they said yes. After five minutes, my brother kicked the ball and hit my friend, the one who'd hit me with the basketball, right in the face. I burst out laughing and told him why he wasn't looking, saying what goes around comes around. That put a big smile on my face, and soon we were all having fun without any anger. That's how laughter changed my mood that day."
667	21555	8	2	Laughter serves as a means to express emotions to others, indicating that you've had a wonderful time or that something or someone is special. Laughter often wells up in me. I laugh heartily whenever I'm having a great time. The most enjoyable laughter I experience is with my friends after school as we head to the bus. This shared laughter helps us release the tension and stress from school. I always return home with a smile on my face. There are always jokes to tell, bringing joy to our days. When the bell rings at the end of my last class, I'm exhausted from a day of hard work. As I make my way to the bus at the front of the school, I'm still feeling the stress of the tasks I've completed. However, I eagerly anticipate the arrival of my friends at the bus. Once they arrive, we have a great time. We completely forget about school and laugh at the jokes and ridiculous stories we share. When we reach the first stop, everyone, including me, gets off the bus happily. This routine has persisted for three years. Next year will be our last bus ride together, and 7, my favorite number, is associated with this special time. I sincerely hope that we'll continue to have such wonderful moments together.
668	21556	8	2	The new trimester began, and I had leadership class in the second period. Since I had no idea what the responsibilities of a leadership student entailed, I was hesitant about taking the class. But after attending it for a few days, I started to enjoy it more and more. After about a week, the teacher announced that our class would be responsible for setting up and organizing the upcoming assembly on stage. I'd never done anything like this before, so I was a bit excited. In the days leading up to the assembly, the whole class practiced setting up the stage. We practiced running to our designated places, moving props, and stacking chairs. Finally, the day of the assembly arrived. As students filled their seats, we scurried around behind the curtains. Everything was set up perfectly. When the curtains rose, the assembly began. My classmates and I stood behind the stage, watching the event unfold. The school band performed a long and dull set of songs. When the curtains fell, the entire leadership class ran onto the stage, picked up, and stacked the chairs used by the band. Then, we rushed to get the bleachers and dragged them to the front of the stage. The choir was about to perform, so we retreated behind the curtains again. As the choir sang their songs, we watched. But when they were setting up for their last song, some students moved around, leaving a large empty space in the top row. During the choir's last song, they performed a simple swaying dance. My friends in the leadership class and I noticed the empty spot and thought it would be hilarious if one of us went up there and pretended to sing and dance. However, none of us had the courage to do it at first. After the first assembly ended, we cleaned up and prepared for the second one. When the second assembly started, everything was repeated: the students came in, the band played, and we stacked chairs and moved bleachers. When it was the choir's turn to perform again, the idea of going up on the bleachers and dancing popped into our heads once more. Eventually, we convinced one of our classmates to do it. She quickly went to the choir room, put on a choir robe, fixed her hair in a funny bun on her forehead, and stepped onto the bleachers, taking the empty spot in the top row. When the song and dance began, she started random dancing that didn't match the other choir members at all. It was obvious she didn't belong there. Soon, the crowd in the seats started to notice and burst into laughter. Then, the laughter spread backstage too. I was laughing so hard that it was painful, and tears were streaming down my face. I was gasping for air. Just as I was about to take a deep breath, there was a silent pause in the song. The auditorium went completely quiet, and I let out an extremely loud and embarrassing screeching noise. People behind the curtain stared at me, and I knew the whole auditorium had heard it. I was so embarrassed that I laughed even harder, which made the pain worse and made me even more short of breath. After the choir finished their performance, the assembly ended. The girl stepped down from the bleachers, and we all quickly cleaned up and left the building, hiding the robe on the way. We laughed all the way to our next class and could hear the students in the hallway talking about what had happened. Giggles filled the school for hours. Everyone was talking about who had done it, what had happened, and why, except for us in the leadership class. We knew exactly what had happened and had the fun of telling others the details. However, a few days later, the teachers found out. They said our actions were irresponsible and child - like. We faced a variety of possible punishments, such as in - school suspension, out - of - school suspension on March 15th, a referral, an apology to the choir class, and loss of the privilege of being in the leadership class. After the school board talked to our parents and seriously considered the incident, we only had to serve one day of out - of - school suspension on March 15th and apologize to the entire choir class. In my opinion, the prank was definitely worth it. For weeks, I went to bed every night still laughing about that leadership assembly.
669	21557	8	2	"Have you ever laughed so hard that you cried? Your chest fills with the force of laughter, tears stream from your eyes, your face turns bright red, and your body shakes uncontrollably. This isn't forced laughter; it's pure, uncontrollable joy. I experience this kind of laughter at least twice a day, complete with tears. I swear if it were possible for the laugh reflex to be connected to the tear ducts, I'd have that connection. When I have a good laugh during the day, it keeps me from feeling sad later. Laughter has made me a much happier person and has even helped me bond with others. In fourth grade at Saint Mary's Elementary, laughter wasn't a big part of my life. I was a worry - wart who dwelled on the past. But my friends were different. They had their bad moods sometimes, and when we were feeling down, we'd sit on the Blue Bench. I know, not the most creative name. The bench was navy blue and was located at the corner of the playground where the baseball field began. During recess, we'd sit there, watching the playground and reflecting on our stressful lives. One day during recess, four of my close friends and I went to the bench. We watched as the boys ran as fast as they could to the baseball field to start their daily game of touch football. Almost every boy in the school would go to the field to play; it was the cool thing to do. Sometimes the girls joined in too. While we were sitting on the bench, sulking, a few boys walked up to us and asked, ""Do you want to play football with us? We need more people!"" We weren't in the mood at first, but they kept nagging, so we gave in. The field was soggy from the previous day's rain, and the grass turned to mud wherever we stepped. We girls avoided physical contact and ran slower than the boys, but we managed to score a few points and take cover when needed. Playing football lifted our spirits more than sitting on the bench ever did. So, we started a new tradition of playing football with the boys every day, not caring about anything as we chased each other around, diving into the muddy field to save the ball and tagging each other. One day, after a storm the night before, the field was extra muddy. It was difficult to run on the slick ground, and people were slipping and falling constantly. Then it started raining again, but no one thought about quitting. We just laughed and kept playing. The rain made it hard to see, and the slippery ground didn't help. A girl picked up the football. The ball was covered in mud. She had a clear shot at the end - zone and sprinted as fast as she could. Suddenly, a boy from the other team popped up in front of her. Instead of dodging, she slid. It was like a scene from a cartoon. Her legs went out from under her, and she landed on her butt. Everyone on the field was already laughing so hard, clutching their stomachs. But she kept sliding and took out the boy in front of her. He landed face - first in the mud. Even the two who fell couldn't stop laughing. The game stopped as we all shared this priceless moment. Laughter from a simple game of football brought us all closer together."

It's a powerful force, but most people don't realize just how powerful it is. I didn't understand its full potential until two years ago when I met Mark. It all started a couple of weeks before school ended. I was part of a small youth group at a small church in a small town. Our youth leaders, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, were moving away and would no longer be able to lead the group. The whole church congregation was saddened by the news, but the youth group members were the most depressed. We had grown so close to the Smiths. Many of us, including me, had spent nights at their house, and I had even babysat their young daughter. They were like family to us, and we didn't want to see them go. As they left, there were many well - wishes and tears. Everyone in the congregation thought that no one could ever touch our hearts the way the Smiths had. But two months later, word spread that someone from Los Angeles was coming to our small town in Iowa for an interview for the newly open youth leader position. When Mark walked through the door, all the teenagers were on guard. He was only in his early twenties but had a lot of experience in ministry. My first thought was that this was a joke. How could he lead a group of kids when he was basically a kid himself? I wasn't fond of him, and neither was anyone else in the group. However, Mark was different. He wasn't afraid to share his life story, how he'd grown up, and he was completely honest in answering all our questions. That's when we in the youth group started to think that maybe he was the right person. Even though I knew Mark would be our new youth leader, I still didn't want to accept it.
671	21559	8	2	"Although my sister and I have distinct personalities and often don't find the same things humorous, we've still shared some funny moments. It's those times when you just go with the flow and enjoy someone's company instead of getting annoyed. One sunny day in @LOCATION1, I somehow persuaded my sister to go rollerblading with me. My dad drove us to a park with a large pond in the middle. The pond had a smooth sidewalk that circled around it, which was great for my sister and me to skate on. However, the pond was littered with ducks, geese, and their droppings. We always thought the pond water was one of the most disgusting things on earth. We put on our roller - blades and carefully stood up. Our dad was going to take a nap in the car while we made laps around the lake. As we skated, we noticed a man and a woman on a date in a very small boat. They were completely unaware that their boat was tilting strongly to one side. My sister and I thought it would be really funny if the boat suddenly tipped over. We let that thought pass and continued on our way. On our next lap, we heard a woman yelling. We looked up and saw it was the woman from the boat. She was now standing on the shore, yelling at the man to retrieve all her belongings that had fallen out of the boat and were floating in the gross pond water. The man was waist - deep in the water, collecting their items and trying to deal with the upside - down boat. ""That date was definitely unsuccessful,"" I thought. We could hardly contain our laughter. We rollerbladed back to the car as fast as we could. My sister was in front of me, and when she tried to stop, she couldn't. She basically crashed into the car, fell back, and rolled under it. My dad quickly opened the door to find me laughing so hard I was crying. We pulled my sister out from under the car and drove home. This shared experience of laughter and chaos strengthened our bond as siblings."
672	21560	8	2	"When I told my mom I wanted to run from sunset to sunrise to raise money for a trip to @LOCATION1, she laughed sarcastically, as if to say, ""Is this a joke?"" But when the idea of running for @NUM1 hours straight was thoroughly considered, her laughter faded. It made sense; I wanted to go to @LOCATION1 with my school's band, and the trip cost about @MONEY1. My family didn't have that money, and I wasn't going to ask my neighbors to buy cheap cookie dough from a magazine one penny at a time. I needed to earn the money in a meaningful and efficient way. What better way than a long - distance run, a skill I loved and was good at? The plan started small. I would run from sunset to sunrise with some friends, aiming to raise about @MONEY2. After consulting my distance coach, I realized that running for @NUM1 hours would mean covering over @NUM3 consecutive miles. So what if I was fifteen and had never run a marathon? Something inside me told me it was possible. We laid out the plan: I was to run about @NUM4 miles a week, with three - hour runs on @DATE3. I ran about ten miles a day, including hill repeats, running backwards, and many lunges. Both my coach and I believed I could do it. Running was one thing, but raising money was another. A family friend, @PERSON1, who was a runner and an organizational expert, helped me. When I told him my goal was to raise @MONEY2, he said I could do better. We started by approaching local businesses, asking for things from bananas to an energy gel called ""@CAPS1"". @PERSON1 taught me how to dress, talk, and present to each business, helped me create a flier for coffee houses, and showed me how to organize the money I collected. Next, I asked my friends. Surprisingly, many of them not only wanted to donate but also wanted to participate in the all - night run, so we created running ""shifts"". Soon, I had about twenty people running with me, ten businesses sponsoring me, and four ""drivers"" with cars full of mattresses, food, and water to support me and my ""crew"". Before I knew it, my whole community was supporting this seemingly crazy idea. The night of the ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 All - Night Run"" arrived quickly. The day before, I was so nervous that I couldn't rest. But as people arrived to run, drive, and cheer, my fears subsided. The weather was great, with clear skies and warm enough temperatures for early @DATE4, and everyone was cheerful and encouraging. As the sun set on @DATE1, about twenty teenagers with a crazy goal set off from my home in an awkward jog, knowing they would return when the sun rose the next day, having achieved something almost impossible. As we ran, we turned on headlamps, played music, played quirky runner games, and sang silly songs to keep going in the cold night. The hardest part for me was returning home after @NUM5 miles for a bathroom break around @TIME1 and realizing I still had seven hours left. As the miles and minutes blended together, it was hard to believe the sun would ever rise again. We all wanted to stop and rest. That night, we ran like shadows, our eyes searching for the sunrise that would signal the end. The sunrise on @DATE2 at @NUM6 am was the most welcome sight. We had run @NUM7 miles (over @NUM8 for each person in the group), and we were exhausted and cold. Everyone who had been resting joined me for the last mile. As the sun rose big and orange, and my feet finally stopped, we all let out an exhausted yet excited shout. In that beautiful sunrise, my mom and I hugged and laughed, a laugh that was no longer sarcastic but celebrated my achievement of the impossible. This experience taught me the power of determination and community support."
673	21561	8	2	"My best friend is my brother, @PERSON2. In the middle of @DATE1, we were sitting on a wooden table in our mother's backyard. @PERSON2 started telling me how much he wanted to be done with high school and that he was ""just done with all this"". I listened attentively for about thirty minutes as he poured out his heart, and his distress nearly broke mine. @PERSON2's best friend, @PERSON1, had told him that if he went out with the girl @PERSON2 liked, their friendship would end. This betrayal, on top of his fear of being kicked out of school because of his grades and the pressure from our parents, was too much for seventeen - year - old @PERSON2 to handle. I talked to him for at least another half - hour about what I thought he should do. At the end of our heart - to - heart, I told @PERSON2, ""If you don't get it together and start getting good grades, they're going to kick you out of school, @PERSON2. Honestly, if that happens, I'm going to be really mad at you because the only person they're going to have to nag is me."" We both laughed quietly, then paused, and laughed until we cried. I still don't know what was so funny. Maybe it was the seriousness of everything when we were just kids, or perhaps it was a release of stress and anxiety for both of us. My little joke at the end of our talk made everything seem okay. It made us realize how young we were and how minor these problems were in the grand scheme of life. That initial laughter allowed us to let go. After that, @PERSON2 and I went on with our lives as if it had never happened, never speaking of it again. However, @PERSON2 never got a bad grade for the rest of his high school career. He chose his friend over the girl he liked but found another girl approved by @ORGANIZATION1. I can't say for sure if laughter helped @PERSON2 through that difficult time, but I know there was laughter, and he did what he needed to do. This experience shows the power of shared laughter in helping us overcome difficult situations and grow."
674	21563	8	2	"Laughter has the power to break all barriers. A single giggle or chuckle can expand someone's world. It's a sign that new ideas, desires, or dreams are about to be born. When I first heard @PERSON1's cautious, unsure, delighted, and incredibly cute giggle, I knew I was in for something special. I was lucky to hear that laugh for three days during the summer of @DATE2. It was a @DATE1, and for the past four days, I had been exploring the mountains and hills in the endless desert of @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. That day, my cousin @CAPS1 and I were going to the mall, a familiar place for us. As a bonus, @PERSON1 with his adorable giggle was coming along. When @PERSON1 walked up to us in the food court, he tried to act cool. You could tell he had made an effort with his hair and clothes to look his best. ""Hey guys!"" he said smoothly. Our eyes met, and my cheeks started to hurt from smiling. The next few minutes were crucial. I wanted to make a good impression on him. We stood in the line at @ORGANIZATION1. He usually ordered two @CAPS3 @CAPS4' @CAPS5 without lettuce, a large order of fries, and a large @CAPS6. Pepper. I just wanted a small vanilla ice cream cone. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw @PERSON1 turn towards me. ""Do you have @MONEY1?"" he asked hesitantly. He fidgeted with his pockets and brushed his blond hair from his face. I chuckled to myself, and his smile in response is still one of my favorite things about him. Still chuckling, I said ""@CAPS8"" and gave him the @MONEY1. Eventually, he paid me back. Since that moment in the line at @ORGANIZATION1, the next several hours were filled with laughter. I don't remember a single thing he said that didn't make me smile. That day, I made a new best friend. Even though @PERSON1 is still in @LOCATION2 and I'm not, and we wish we were in the same place, we know we need to grow separately. But when we laugh together, it doesn't feel like we're fifteen hundred miles apart. This laughter has been a key part of our friendship, and I'm incredibly grateful for it. It has formed one of the best relationships in my fifteen - year - old life, and I hope it will create many more wonderful memories in the future."
675	21564	8	2	The area around us is dimly lit by a fluorescent lamp in the corner. The loud television, showing an action - packed science - fiction movie, drowns out the profane rap music coming from my brother's headphones. My sister, @PERSON2, and I are cuddled up on the couch, taking turns braiding each other's hair. Our kittens, @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON1, race towards their food and water. As usual, @PERSON1 wins, and @ORGANIZATION2 scurries up the dining - room chairs, defeated. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 gets irritated when @ORGANIZATION2 trips over his laptop charger and pulls it out of the socket, and he sighs heavily. Then we hear keys jingle, the door slam, and fast footsteps: @CAPS3 is home! By @NUM1 o'clock, we've settled on the couch. After getting some food, we all do a seat - check. The spicy @CAPS4 food fills the apartment with its aroma as we feast on chalupas and drink @ORGANIZATION1 from @LOCATION1. We distribute napkins, and the cats hover around our feet, waiting for their share. I give the last bit of my chalupa to the cats, which causes a commotion. @PERSON1 takes @ORGANIZATION2's portion, showing her thieving side. @ORGANIZATION2 hisses at her and jumps onto the coffee table. On the way, she knocks over two of the five drinks at the end of the table. The unnoticeable nacho cheese coats her gray - striped paw, leaving yellow - orange circles that puzzle us. She shows her sharp teeth and devours the remains of @PERSON2's chalupa. Blue fizzy @ORGANIZATION1 spills all over the coffee table, and puddles form at my feet near the new suede couch. @PERSON2, laughing and angry at the same time, screams at @ORGANIZATION2 for stealing her chalupa. After @ORGANIZATION2 runs away, @PERSON1 follows her innocently. To calm my sister down, I take off my newly @ORGANIZATION1 - stained sock and try to throw it at her head. Instead, it whistles past her ear and splashes on my mother's stomach. The whole family is laughing uncontrollably. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 re - enacts the situation with wild sound effects, making us laugh even more. After a few minutes, the laughter dies down, and we wait for the next funny thing to happen. I'm cold and muddy after a rainy softball practice, my siblings are just relaxing, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is frustrated about not getting a job, and @CAPS3 is tired from a long day at work. We're all looking forward to going to sleep for the next @NUM1 hours. But despite our tiredness, we're happy to spend this time together. The fact that @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION2, even though @PERSON1 is younger, create such hilarious situations amuses us daily. This time, @ORGANIZATION2's antics added extra chaos to our dinner. Laughter is the main element in our family's memorable moments, and it's a bond that will
676	21566	8	2	"On @DATE1, while vacationing in @LOCATION2, I came to realize that laughter plays a significant role in our lives and is a crucial element in maintaining strong bonds among friends and family. Not long ago, I also discovered that laughter can alleviate stress and even aid in weight loss, which I found quite fascinating. However, my sister remained skeptical. She thought the claims about laughter were exaggerated. In her view, if her friends didn't want to be with her, there was something wrong with them; and if there wasn't enough food at home, it was likely my parents' fault. She always had someone to blame and saw the negative side in everything. But @DATE1 was going to be different. She was about to learn that there was an alternative way to live.  The trip to @LOCATION2 was highly anticipated by everyone, including me. I was extremely excited to see my cousins and the rest of the family. We all packed our things, got in the car, and headed to the airport. My aunt @CAPS1 was already waiting for us at the @LOCATION2 city airport. Everything was going smoothly...  When we arrived, my aunt drove us to our small town in the state of @LOCATION1, about an hour and a half from the airport. As we neared our destination, I noticed my sister had a strange expression on her face. She seemed confused, lost in her thoughts, as if worried about something. ""What's wrong with you? You look so strange,"" I said, half - sarcastically, hoping to start a conversation. ""Your face is all weird!"" she retorted, and that was the last thing she said to me until we reached our destination.  When we got to our grandparents' house, we saw all our family members waiting outside. The joy of seeing them was indescribable. I looked around and was glad to see my sister looking happy. I thought she was enjoying the moment. It wasn't until we went to the small playground in my grandma's backyard that I understood what was wrong with her and her sudden mood swings.  During my time there, I met new family members, saw familiar faces, and recalled both good and bad memories. I thought these memories had faded from my mind, but they resurfaced. I had a flashback to a visit a couple of years ago. I saw my little sister @PERSON1 playing on the swings. Suddenly, she let go and fell into a mud puddle. Everyone, including me, laughed. I thought it was funny, but she neither laughed nor cried. She just got up and ran inside. I never asked if she was okay. I failed to realize how my actions had affected her. It was my fault. I knew she was sensitive in certain situations, but I didn't offer her the support she needed. As a result, she never learned to laugh at herself and move on.  After reflecting for a few minutes, I went to her and apologized. At first, she looked confused, but then she understood. This made the rest of the trip much more pleasant. Now that I knew what was wrong, we both tried our best to solve the problem and boost her self - esteem. Laughter was the perfect remedy for her. All she needed was to learn to laugh at herself when things didn't go as planned. It was difficult, but we achieved our goal. My sister discovered the power of laughter and learned to bounce back from her mistakes. That @DATE1, life taught us an important lesson. I'm certain it was one of the most exciting trips we've ever taken, and the memories will stay with us forever."
677	21567	8	2	"I'm someone who loves to laugh. It doesn't take much to set off a laughing fit for me, and the topic doesn't even have to be extremely funny. However, I'm not the type to do a ""nervous laugh."" I think my quiet laugh suits my quiet personality well. I always get a bit embarrassed when my laugh gets louder than usual.  Lately, the weather has been very cold, with snow falling here and there. I've been really looking forward to some warm swimming weather. This past weekend, my boyfriend, @PERSON1, and I went to the mountains to play in the deep snow. After a few hours in the snow, we headed back down the mountain to his house to use his hot tub. It was freezing, and as someone who prefers fair weather, I just wanted to get warm. First, we stopped at my house so I could grab the swimsuit I'd recently ordered online and was eager to use.  We left our clothes in the back room and ran out into the cold to get into the hot tub on his back patio. The hot water felt amazing; it thawed my icy body and relaxed my tense muscles. We were in the hot tub for about forty - five minutes before we realized how hungry we were. Since we were all warmed up, we decided that food sounded good. We jumped out of the hot tub and ran to the back room to dry off and get dressed.  I dried myself and started putting on my jeans. As soon as I put my first leg in, I had a feeling I was going to fall. Sure enough, when I got my second leg halfway in, I lost my balance, tripped over a large exercise machine, and landed hard on my butt. I started laughing, and so did @PERSON1. I was a bit embarrassed, but it didn't hurt too much at first. After I got up and walked around for a few minutes, my butt started to ache more and more.  @PERSON1 kept making jokes about me falling. Even though they were funny, I tried not to laugh. We were having a conversation, and when we finished, he turned towards the door to leave and hit his head right on the same exercise machine I'd tripped over just minutes before. I doubled over in laughter. I couldn't move; I was laughing so hard. It looked like it hurt when he hit his head, and he had a red bump under his eye. He didn't find it as funny as I did and just walked out the door.  Still laughing hysterically, I tried to follow him out, but it was difficult to move because I was laughing so much. My stomach started to hurt from all the laughing, and it took a while for the laughter to subside. I still had a little giggle left as I walked to his pickup to wait for him while he talked to his dad. When I turned around and saw him walking towards the pickup, I started laughing again. The look on his face when he saw me laughing was priceless.  Laughter is one of the few free things in the world. Everyone's laugh is unique and can change depending on the situation. There are different types of laughs, like nervous, happy, or giddy laughs. Sharing a laugh can bring people closer. Laughter is a universal sign of happiness across all ages, races, and religions. Overall, laughter is an amazing feeling."
678	21568	8	2	One morning, I was awakened by the blaring of my alarm clock. I reached over and turned it off. Then, I realized I had overslept by ten minutes. I jumped out of bed and rushed to the shower. After showering, I put on my usual @CAPS1 - shirt and jeans. I unplugged my cell phone from the charger and put it in my pocket.  I went downstairs to the kitchen to make a simple meal of oatmeal. After eating, I went back upstairs to brush my teeth. Then, I quickly grabbed my coat and hat, put them on, picked up my backpack, and walked out the door.  Standing outside on that cold and rainy morning, I wondered what the day would bring. Suddenly, there was a loud noise. I turned around and saw that the bus had arrived. I quickly composed myself and stepped onto the bus.  The bus ride was typical. Kids were chatting about what happened at school the previous day, their plans for that day, and other seemingly unimportant things. I sat there, looking out of the window, observing the bus's route.  At one of the bus stops, my good friend @PERSON1 got on the bus. As usual, she sat next to me, and we started talking about cars, music, and cracking jokes. Just as I was about to tell a creative joke, she blurted out one of her own. We both burst into laughter. I even felt a tear in my eye. We didn't stop laughing until we reached school, and I completely forgot about my own joke.  That joke has stayed with me. To this day, I think it's one of the best I've ever heard. Among all the jokes, remarks, and puns I've heard, that one made me laugh the most.  However, @PERSON1 later moved to another city. It was a sad day. But the next day, I heard an old - fashioned joke, and laughter returned to my life. I learned that friends may leave, but the jokes we share will always remain.
679	21569	8	2	It all began when my eighth - grade class planned to go see a movie together. I suggested a few movies that were in theaters: '@CAPS1 @CAPS2,' '@CAPS3 of the @CAPS4,' and another one I can't remember. As a group, we decided to watch '@CAPS3 of the @CAPS4.' The movie stars @PERSON1 and @CAPS7 from @CAPS8 @CAPS9.  I thought the movie was excellent, but there was one part that made me laugh uncontrollably. The scene starts with @PERSON1 and @CAPS7 wandering around, looking for a place to spend the night. They seem to be in @CAPS4 @LOCATION1, which is a significant setting in the movie. After a long day filled with scary situations, they find a medium - sized cave and decide to stay there for the night.  Earlier in the movie, @PERSON1 met a native named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is a creature that walks like a monkey, has a human - like face, and a hairy body. They encountered him in the desert and saved him from execution. In return, @LOCATION1 becomes their guide in the mysterious @CAPS3 that is unknown to humans.  Back to the cave scene. When @PERSON1 and @CAPS7 enter the cave, they see two full - body skeletons sitting at a table with an old record player. The record is playing music. Just then, @LOCATION1 enters the scene and does a little dance, getting close to the table. Then, he starts doing multiple pelvis thrusts in different directions, as if humping the air.  Watching that scene made me laugh harder than I ever have in my life. Even to this day, when I think about it, I laugh as hard as I did the first time I saw the movie.  About a month later, I went to a friend's house, and we watched the movie again. When we reached the scene of @LOCATION1's dance, we both fell off the couch laughing. We replayed the scene about ten more times and ended up crying from laughter.  Laughter is beneficial for the soul, morale, and building friendships. I'm grateful that we have the ability to laugh.
680	21570	8	2	A true story involving fun and laughter happened when I went to an @ORGANIZATION1 concert in @LOCATION2 with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERSON1, and her fiancé @PERSON4, who is a professional quad - racer. This concert was the best I've ever attended, and it might be the best I'll ever go to because @ORGANIZATION1 is my favorite band. They even played their signature song, @CAPS3 @CAPS4.  At the concert, the music was extremely loud. Many people were drinking and getting drunk, doing silly things. For example, there was a guy standing behind his girlfriend, who was sitting on the grass. He had too much to drink. While laughing at a joke from one of his drunk friends, he leaned on his girlfriend and fell on her, folding her like a lawn chair. My @CAPS1 and I started laughing; it was really funny. But then the girlfriend got up and left the stadium, and the guy was very sad.  The rest of the concert was also full of fun. The front - row seats were for people over @NUM1 because during the concert, the band would bring out beer guns and spray the front rows with beer. The front rows were really wild. The back rows were also crazy; some people were smoking marijuana, but we weren't. When we left, we smelled like weed, and we didn't want to get pulled over by a cop and be mistaken for drug users.  It was a long drive home. We live in @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, and we drove to @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2 and back in one day. I was so tired. We didn't even bring chairs, so we had to stand in one place for about @NUM2 hours. But it was all worth it to see my favorite band perform. There were also some other great bands before @ORGANIZATION1, like @PERSON2, @CAPS5/@CAPS6, and @CAPS7.  The second - best concert I've been to was a @CAPS8 concert in @LOCATION1 with my @CAPS9 @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 @PERSON1 during the @CAPS10 @CAPS11. Before the concert, we did many things, such as looking at animals, eating, going on rides, shopping, and walking around the @CAPS11. Many things made us laugh, like when my @PERSON1 stepped in horse and goat poop and when my mom dropped her food on her lap.  The concert was really cool. They played songs from their new albums @CAPS12 and @CAPS13. The drive wasn't as long as the one to the @ORGANIZATION1 concert, and it wasn't
681	21571	8	2	Laughter holds significant value in various aspects of life, especially in relationships. In a person's life, many elements are crucial, such as making friends, achieving success, and most importantly, finding happiness. Everyone desires happiness, and the purest form of it often stems from the heart. Laughter is believed to originate from the heart and has the power to bring genuine happiness to oneself and those around. One reason laughter is vital in a relationship is the display of optimism towards partners and friends. It shows that one is not constantly pessimistic, rude, or unhappy. Instead, it indicates the ability to enjoy life and have a good time. No one wants to be around someone who is always negative and focuses only on the bad. A partner may grow tired, and friends may drift away. Being able to laugh and joke with others makes life more manageable and relieves stress. Another factor is the sound of one's laugh. If a new partner finds one's laugh extremely annoying, it could potentially lead to the end of the relationship. However, if someone has an unpleasant laugh and is self - conscious, smiling can be a good alternative, especially for girls with cute smiles. Lastly, laughter is essential for happiness. Without laughter, a smile loses its true meaning, and happiness cannot fully shine through. Life can become dull when one doesn't laugh or smile. When a person laughs, it encourages others to do the same, creating a fun and memorable atmosphere. Memories formed through laughter are an important part of growing up. After understanding these three reasons for the importance of laughter in life, relationships, and friendships, one should embrace laughter. It will undoubtedly make a person feel better.
682	21573	8	2	"Hello, I'm @CAPS1 @CAPS11. I'm going to share one of the most hilarious experiences I've ever had. It was @DATE1, a day that my friends and I will never forget. The day started beautifully, with a clear blue sky, warm air, and the sound of children's laughter in the street. I was sitting on my back porch in a circle with my three friends, @PERSON3, @PERSON1, and @CAPS2, playing our guitars as usual. We decided to do something new, but we couldn't think of anything at first. Then, @PERSON1 suggested going to the beach to meet his cousin. He said his cousin ""@CAPS3"" had a house on the beach and probably wouldn't mind if we stopped by. We all agreed and packed our boards, guitars, and food before heading out. On the way, we decided to visit the @CAPS4 city skate park, even though none of us had been there before. We drove around for about an hour looking for it. Just when we were about to give up, @CAPS2 spotted it in the distance. We were excited and pulled in to park. But then, it started pouring, and the park got soaked. As we went back to the car for shelter, we found that @PERSON3 had locked his keys inside. Fortunately, @CAPS3 had a way to call for help, and it took an hour and a half for them to find us and unlock the car. Feeling frustrated, we decided to go to @PERSON1's cousin's house for the @TIME1. When we arrived, @PERSON2 greeted us warmly with open arms and warm clothes. After changing, we sat by the fireplace and talked for a long time. I mentioned wishing to have a big fire on the beach, and @PERSON2 took us to a place called Driftwood Bay, about @NUM1 yards from his house. It was perfect, with plenty of firewood. We built a huge fire and spent the rest of the day and @TIME1 sitting around it, playing guitars, and sharing the story of our day. Despite the rough start, we ended the day in the best way possible, laughing and making wonderful memories with our friends."
683	21574	8	2	In my opinion, laughter is extremely important in relationships. It can signify having fun and enjoying life. All my friendships and relationships are filled with laughter. Half of the time, we laugh, and the other half, we express our true selves. Laughter can also mark the beginning or end of a relationship. Although some people laugh out of nervousness, here we're talking about the joyful kind. My friendship with @PERSON3 is full of laughter. Since the day we met, we've had many laughing moments. Usually, @PERSON3 is the joker, and I'm part of the audience. But there are also times when @PERSON3 is a great listener. My friendship with @PERSON2 is another example. She's one of my closest friends. We share almost everything, including family matters. There are countless moments of laughter and joking between us, no matter how strange or senseless the jokes are. We always laugh things off and playfully tease each other. Once, I was sitting on @PERSON4's skateboard, rolling on the sidewalk. I hit a bump and flew off, landing on my butt. Instead of being embarrassed, I started laughing, and @PERSON4 did too. Laughter helped me turn an embarrassing moment into a joke. My relationship with my @CAPS1 is full of jokes. He loves to tell jokes and act like historical figures. One time, he pretended to be @PERSON1 on the phone. I saw through his act, and we had a funny conversation. Our relationship has grown stronger over time, and I've learned to trust him. In my view, relationships need laughter. Without it, they become too serious, and it's hard to stay close. I love laughing and having close friends because they can make me smile when I'm down. Laughter is a precious gift that makes the world a better place.
684	21575	8	2	To me, laughter is a way of showing joy and excitement to those around. However, it can sometimes be misused, like when someone laughs at another who is hurt. When I make someone laugh, it not only makes me feel good but also the other person. It shows that both of us can be happy and that there's joy within us. I have a school friend who always looks grumpy or upset. When someone asks if he's okay, he seems to get even angrier. As one of his closer friends, I try to help him. So far, my efforts have been successful. I can make him happy by making him laugh and smile. Every time I see him in the hallway or outside of school, I say something to make him laugh. By showing that I care and that I don't want him to be grumpy, we've developed a strong bond and spend more time together. His improved mood makes his school days more fun for him and those around him. I consider myself a very happy person who respects others and shows it. Being happy spreads joy to those around, which often leads to laughter. Laughter is an important part of daily life. It brings people closer, so we should use it without fear.
685	21577	8	2	Laughter plays a crucial role in relationships as it brings people closer, forming an unbreakable bond. It also helps a person stay composed when facing difficult situations. In my case, without laughter, I don't think I could get through my daily school life, especially the cat - dissection assignment in @ORGANIZATION1. In @ORGANIZATION1, we've been dissecting cats for about a month, and it's been a challenging experience. We got to choose our partners and work at a lab station with another pair. Fortunately, I knew and was friends with everyone in the group. The dissection process was complex. First, we had to remove the cat's skin, which could be done by cutting, slicing, ripping, or pulling. Then, we had to identify the muscles, which was difficult as it was hard to distinguish where one muscle ended and another began. After that, we removed the muscles to identify the bones and digestive organs. We also had to cut open the stomach, intestines, and kidneys to examine their structure. Finally, we removed the heart and lungs. The class was informed that the dissections would last about a month, and it's only been three weeks. It's a combination of being horrible, fascinating, and extremely stressful. My friends' jokes and laughter have been essential in keeping me from breaking down and going insane. Dissecting cats in @ORGANIZATION1 was both physically and mentally challenging. It was stressful, gross, and fascinating all at once. Without the support and laughter of my friends, I don't think I could have made it through this assignment. They guided me through the difficult process, and it's clear that laughter is indispensable for me to handle day - to - day school tasks.
686	21578	8	2	A few years ago, during my middle - school days, I met one of my best friends. Our first encounter was in math class, where she had been assigned a seat next to me. We started chatting, and even though we were strangers, laughter seemed to be the bridge that brought us close. We'd burst into laughter at the most random things as we were still figuring out what to talk about. Sometimes, the reason for our laughter didn't make any sense, and we didn't always understand each other's jokes, but that didn't stop us. Laughter was the glue that held our budding friendship together.  As time passed, we became good friends. Since we didn't know each other well initially, laughing was our main activity. We're both people who love to laugh; otherwise, we'd get bored. If either of us had lacked a sense of humor at the start, our friendship might not have blossomed as it did. We mainly hung out during lunch and in the classes we shared, and all we did was laugh at what we thought was funny, even if it was rather silly.  A couple of months later, our friendship deepened beyond just laughter. We got to know each other better, found common interests, and had more to talk about. While laughter still played a role in our friendship, it wasn't as dominant as it was at the beginning. In math class, we'd talk and laugh at our conversations, something that had never happened before. We realized that laughter wasn't the only thing keeping us close; there were other ways to get along.  I have friends with whom I interact differently. Some are not very close, but we laugh a lot. Others are very close, but we don't laugh as much. We all have our own ways of getting along and having fun. Some of my friends are calm, while others, like me, love to laugh. Most of them are the type who enjoy laughing all the time, and our friendship is strengthened by our unique interactions.  I believe that laughter can be the shortest distance between two people, but it's not the only factor in a friendship. How people get along, their commonalities, and how they treat each other are also crucial. Everyone has their own way of maintaining a close friendship, so it varies from person to person.
687	21579	8	2	One day, as I was walking to school with my friends, I stepped in dog poo. All my friends burst into laughter, and I was incredibly embarrassed and angry. My brand - new birthday shoes were dirty, and I had to go back home to clean them. I was worried about telling my mom, thinking she'd be mad since she'd worked hard to afford them. But when I told her, she wasn't angry at all.  The next day at school, my friends were still laughing at me. I went straight to my class, sat down, and started my math work. My best friend came up to me and asked if I really stepped in dog poo. Then she gave me a piece of paper with a drawing of a dog pooping on a girl. I got so mad that I started crying.  After school, when I got home, my mom asked me how school was. I didn't want to tell her that my day was terrible because everyone was laughing at me, so I just said school was good. She then told me that not all people are nice. This experience made me realize that sometimes, people can be unkind, but it's important to not let their actions ruin my mood completely.
688	21581	8	2	"Laughter, in my view, serves as the foundation of relationships, whether it's with parents, best friends, or spouses. A single laugh or giggle can initiate a connection. On social media, I've noticed that when a guy tries to approach a girl, he often attempts to be funny to break the ice. Once the ice is broken, both parties can start to reveal their true selves.  I've been friends with my best friend, @PERSON1, for five years, and I hope our friendship will last much longer. @PERSON1 has taught me to be myself, especially around her, and I try to be the same with others. We've had numerous funny adventures together that I'll cherish forever.  Recently, @PERSON1 and I went snowboarding at @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION2. It was her second time snowboarding, while I've been doing it for about three years. I promised to stay with her on the slopes until she got the hang of it and even to fall with her when she did. I taught her how to clip her bindings, the use of the stomp pad, and how to skate. Skating in snowboarding means having your front foot in the binding and pushing with your back foot on the snow to move towards the ski lift. It took us three hours to descend the first bunny hill, which usually takes no more than ten minutes for an individual.  During this teaching and bonding process, I noticed that laughing with @PERSON1 filled me with feelings of love, care, and happiness. It always brightens my day. In fact, our friendship began with laughter. After we left the slope, she said something I'll never forget: ""@CAPS2 you are the best friend I could ever ask for, if you were a man I would marry you and have your children, I love you."" This was significant because @PERSON1 usually keeps her feelings of love and care inside, and it was the first time she'd said she loved me.  Five years of shared laughter have made @PERSON1 more open with me. Laughter is an essential part of our relationship, and I believe it will continue to strengthen our bond in the years to come."
689	21582	8	2	I'm really good at making people laugh, and it's one of my best qualities. I have many stories about making people laugh. One time, on the way to camp with my friends, I saw a sign and said something funny, which made everyone in the car laugh.  Later, we stopped at a store in a city. I got into a shopping basket, and we raced down the aisles, making other customers laugh. After that, I bought a bunch of doughnuts. They were really gross; they were so dry, almost like they had no frosting. I had to drink chocolate milk with the doughnut to make it taste a bit better. In the end, we threw the doughnuts out of the window.  On the way back from camp, my friend @PERSON1 was driving. I sat behind him and messed with him a lot. I turned up my phone's volume and played a scary ring - tone, scaring him. I also licked my finger and put it in his ear, which freaked him out. Then I grabbed his arm through the window and scared him again.  We stopped at a store in a small town, and I bought a soda. In the car, I joked that I'd opened a beer, which made everyone laugh. When I took a drink of my soda, I started laughing, and some of it went up my nose. I said it burned, and we all laughed.  Ironically, about thirty minutes later, we got pulled over. @PERSON1 thought the speed limit was 65 miles per hour, but it was 50. The cop clocked him doing 75. I wanted to make the cop laugh to lighten the situation, but @PERSON1 was too mad. He got a ticket, and the cop was really dumb. He asked if the license plates were from @LOCATION1 when it was clearly written on them. Everyone in the car laughed so hard.  I don't think anyone who went to camp with me that weekend stopped laughing. Making people laugh is truly one of my greatest strengths, and it always makes for memorable experiences.
690	21584	8	2	Laughter is a complex phenomenon. It's hard to describe, much like trying to explain the taste or feel of water. Although I can't precisely define it, I have a general understanding of its power. There are many reasons and types of laughter, and it plays a significant role in my daily life. I laugh often, whether it's because my friend falls, I hear a joke, I remember something from the past, or I'm just exhausted.  I'm not the type of overly - exuberant person who always makes others laugh, but when I do, it brings me joy. When a friend tells me I've made their day, it makes me happy because I know I've made their day a little better.  One day, on @DATE1, my friend @CAPS3 invited me to The @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in @CAPS6 to meet her @CAPS4 friends. I felt out of place as I knew no one except her. After sitting quietly like a wallflower, I went to the ice - cream shop next door, and one of the boys in our group joined me. We talked and got to know each other.  After that day, we stayed in touch through a video - calling site called @ORGANIZATION1. We chatted daily, had long conversations, and even pulled all - nighters on the phone. After about a month, our relationship deepened, and he started sharing more serious matters with me.  This boy has had a very difficult life. His adoptive father abused him, and his adoptive mother did nothing to stop it. His childhood friend, the one who always stood by him, passed away. He lost his laughter. His laugh was more like a robotic response, lacking any real joy.  It breaks my heart to see him like this because he's very dear to me. I can't imagine my life without him. I've decided that one day, I'll make him laugh with genuine joy. Although we laugh when we talk, I want him to experience the kind of laughter that comes from true happiness. I'm confident that one day, he'll be able to laugh from the heart again.
691	21586	8	2	When I think about laughter, it brings back memories of shared moments with others. Around the age of six, my family and I visited my cousins' ranch in @ORGANIZATION1. Our joyful experience began as we pulled up to the house. After a long car - ride, I slowly opened my eyes and saw the porch light on. I quickly gathered my toys and some playing cards and eagerly waited at the door for someone to answer while the rest of my family fetched the suitcases. My @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was the first to greet us at the door. As I walked under his arm to place my toys in the living room, I saw @PERSON1 sleeping on the couch. He was my dearest friend, and I always looked forward to seeing him. He had brown hair, often wore wranglers, a trucker hat, and a tucked - in plaid shirt. Every time I visited, we would play goldfish together, regardless of the time of day. I was so excited to see him that I started running towards him, but my other cousin @PERSON2 grabbed me and began tickling me until I fell on the floor, screaming with laughter. My laughter woke up @PERSON1. He came running, picked me up from the ground, and saved me. He put me on the couch, and we started watching @CAPS3 until I fell asleep.  The next morning, I woke up to the howling of coyotes as the sun was rising. When I smelled bacon and eggs from the kitchen, I quickly got up for breakfast. My dad and the other boys went goose - hunting on the farm. Around lunchtime, while my mom and @PERSON3 were cooking hamburgers, the boys returned just in time. Since lunch wasn't ready immediately, @PERSON1 and I started playing goldfish until we were called to eat. After lunch, we went to the hay barns. There, we found rattle snakes and bull snakes curled up near the bales. Almost every step we took revealed another snake. Each time, @PERSON1 would tell me to jump back so he could shoot the snake in the head. After the hunt, @PERSON1 decided to make us laugh. He grabbed a bull snake and we walked to the backyard. I was unsure of his plan until we got there and @PERSON3 jumped out of her chair and started running towards the house. Everyone burst into laughter as @PERSON1 blocked her way, and she ran in circles in the backyard. After about five minutes of scaring her, @PERSON1 finally let her go into the house. We all went back inside to visit. @PERSON1 and I played goldfish at the table one last time during my visit.  The next morning, we woke up at five to work on the farm. I went back to sleep in the tractor until the work was done. When we finished, we loaded our clothes into the car and hugged everyone goodbye. I stood beside @PERSON1, not wanting to leave, but my mom picked me up and put me in the car. As we drove away, I looked back and saw them all waving.  After our visit on @DATE1, we received a call from my @CAPS4 @PERSON3 with bad news. @PERSON2 was on his way home and saw @CAPS5's truck on the road. When he approached, he found that @CAPS5 had killed himself two weeks before graduation. We attended the funeral on @DATE2. After the service, I sat in @CAPS5's room, remembering all the laughter we had shared. I learned to always cherish laughter and the wonderful times with my true best friend. Even after all these years, my memory of him remains vivid. Because of him, I always try to laugh and live life to the fullest. He taught me so much in the short time he was here, and whenever I need a laugh, I think of the last time I saw him.
692	21587	8	2	I firmly believe that laughter is one of the most crucial aspects of life. The more one laughs, the better and easier life becomes. It is wiser to laugh at unfavorable situations, such as tripping in front of others or making a simple error. This approach simplifies life and makes it more bearable. Laughter has the power to bring happiness, enhance enjoyment of things, and encourage people to look forward to the future and achieve their goals.  My family and friends are a constant source of laughter for me. They may not always say the most intelligent or hilarious things, but their efforts to make me laugh mean a great deal. When I'm in a bad mood, their jokes can quickly lift my spirits and make me feel like myself again. Simple things often amuse me and bring me joy. For instance, I might laugh at something that others find unfunny. However, I cannot laugh when someone gets seriously hurt, like tripping and getting injured. I would not want others to laugh at me in such a situation.  I also find it extremely annoying when people brag about experiences that no one else cares about, such as their excessive drinking or drug - related activities during @DATE1. It is a pointless topic, and I usually ignore them or walk away. Why would I want to hear about someone ruining their life, especially at a young age?  In conclusion, I am convinced that the benefits of laughter are undeniable. It enriches our lives and helps us deal with difficult situations. That is why I hold laughter in such high regard.
693	21589	8	2	"It is often said that laughter is the best medicine, and I wholeheartedly agree. Jokes can be a great source of laughter, but their quality varies. Some jokes are incredibly funny, while others are simply awful. Another reason why laughter is so wonderful is that it indicates a good mood. I love being happy and detest being angry or upset; it's not who I am. I especially enjoy those moments when I laugh so hard that I can hardly breathe. Sometimes, if you're very ticklish, you might even be on the verge of wetting yourself. I know several people who are extremely ticklish, and I feel sorry for them because I would be extremely embarrassed if I wet myself in public.  Laughter has been an integral part of my life; for me, any time is a good time to laugh. I have many stories about laughter, but I'll share one of my favorites. It was during my @NUM1 birthday party at my grandma's house. My friends and I were having a great time on the homemade slip - and - slide, enjoying the food and non - alcoholic drinks. My cousin @PERSON1 had come up with some games, such as the @CAPS1 relay, @CAPS2 fishing, @CAPS3 the gum in the whipped cream, and my favorite, @CAPS4.  @CAPS4 is a game where you can have as many players as you like. All you need are a lot of string, a lot of balloons, and one person to be the @CAPS4. For example, if you have @NUM2 players and one @CAPS4, the players tie balloons around their waists and try to run away from the @CAPS4. They can hide anywhere within the boundaries. It doesn't matter how, who, or what pops the balloon; once it's popped, the player becomes the @CAPS4. The game continues until there are @CAPS12 players left, and then a new game starts.  You might wonder why this game is so funny. At the party, when my cousin @PERSON1 asked, ""Who wants to play the game @CAPS4?"" we were curious and asked about the rules. After he explained, we decided to play. My friend @CAPS9 and I were running away when we heard my cousin making the @CAPS4 noise, indicating he was coming. My friend got scared and ran away. When his balloon popped, he flew about @NUM3 feet backwards. It was incredibly funny; everyone was laughing so hard that they could hardly breathe.  After that, @CAPS9 got up and started chasing people with my cousin @PERSON1. The rest of us ran away as fast as we could. We could hear the @CAPS4 noise, people running and screaming, and balloons popping one by one. Eventually, I was the last one left. I was exhausted from being chased and was about to give up. One of my friends @ORGANIZATION1 came up to me, and I asked to be out of the game. He popped my balloon, and when I asked if I could take a nap, he said I had to rest up quickly for the next round.  My cousin @PERSON1 can be a bit of a smart - aleck. He said that getting to play the game should be enough of a reward. But despite that, he is one of the funniest people I've ever met. This story shows how laughter can make any situation enjoyable."
694	21592	8	2	Laughter is a powerful force, and it plays a vital role in my relationship with my best friend. Without laughter, our friendship would not be as fulfilling and fun. Whenever I have a bad day, I can always rely on my best friend to make me laugh and forget about my troubles. Whether we are out and about or relaxing at home, we are constantly laughing, often to the point of having tear - streaked faces.  One memorable instance was on the eve of @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It started snowing at around three a.m., and we ran outside, screaming with excitement. Snowballs flew from all directions. During a game of hide - and - seek, we buried ourselves in a snow - covered leaf pile. After ten minutes, our legs were freezing, so we put on our swimsuits and jumped into the bathtub together. Having my best friend there to share the laughter made the situation much more enjoyable.  Another funny memory was during the third trimester of freshman @CAPS2. I needed a first - period class, and the only option available was intro to manufacturing. I wasn't looking forward to it until I found out my best friend was in the class with me. Since we had little experience in metalwork, we made numerous mistakes. However, we made the best of the situation by laughing at our blunders. Without her by my side to laugh with me, I don't know how I would have coped.  Laughter also helped me cheer up my best friend. A few days ago, she had a terrible day. After school, I could tell something was wrong. Talking to her didn't seem to help, so I brought up our past experiences together. Within minutes, she was laughing and feeling better.  In conclusion, I am certain that laughter is a valuable asset in difficult situations. It is the cornerstone of my friendship with my best friend. Our relationship thrives on laughter, and without it, we wouldn't be as close as we are today. Whether we need to cheer each other up or just pass the time, laughter is always there for us.
695	21594	8	2	"It was midsummer, and the cool ocean breeze caressed my skin. However, instead of a calm atmosphere, there was turmoil in my heart. I was so angry with him that I refused to talk to or even look at him. Despite his efforts to make me laugh, I remained unresponsive. I thought our three - month relationship was over, and the thought terrified me. The next day, he left for his trip without saying a single word.  I spent a week crying myself to sleep. I knew he was back in town, but he didn't call or contact me. After weeks of waiting and wondering, I began to accept that it was truly over. I confided in my sister, and she advised me to be patient, assuring me that he would come around. I tried to believe her words and keep hope alive. I called his house every night, but each time, I got the same response: ""He's not home, but I'll let him know you called."" To pass the time, I kept myself busy with cleaning and spending time with my family. A few days of not dwelling on him did me good. I started smiling and laughing again, feeling like I could finally breathe and have fun.  My sister's advice proved to be right. A week later, he called and said he wanted to see me. I invited him to come by on @DATE1 and told him I was extremely excited. After the call, I couldn't stop smiling.  In the following days, I was in a frenzy, cleaning the house and deciding what to wear. Everyone thought I was going crazy, but in reality, I was scared. I was afraid of what he would say and where our relationship would go from there. Time flew by, and before I knew it, he was knocking on my door. I let him in, and he surprised me with a big hug. We spent hours talking and listening to music, and it felt as if nothing had changed.  When it got dark, he was leaving. He sat me down on the sidewalk outside my trailer park and took my hands. He apologized for his behavior and told me that he realized how much he loved me and wanted to be with me. I couldn't help but cry and laugh at the same time, and soon he was laughing with me. It was a perfect moment.  Six months have passed since @TIME1, and our relationship is stronger than ever. Laughter has been the key to our success, keeping us close and solidifying our bond. Everyone needs a little laughter in their life, and I'm grateful to have found someone who can always make me laugh. If you ever feel hopeless, remember that laughter can turn things around."
696	21595	8	2	Have you ever shared a moment with friends or family where you laughed so hard that your stomach ached and your eyes welled with tears? Laughter is an essential part of life for everyone. A hearty laugh can brighten a person's day and bring a smile to their face. Without laughter, the world would be an extremely sad place. My friends and I are constantly laughing, often to the point of rolling on the ground and clutching our stomachs. Sometimes, we laugh about absolutely nothing. I truly don't know who I would be or what I would become without laughter. I recall one particular day when my friends @CAPS1, @PERSON1, and I were having a rough start. We all woke up in bad moods, and everything seemed to go wrong. My mom in the kitchen, banging pots and pans, woke us up. When we got up, our favorite cereal was gone. We wanted to go to the donut shop, but no one would take us. Although I realize now that it wasn't the end of the world, it felt like it at the time. My brother and sisters, with the @LOCATION1 blaring and running around the house yelling, irritated us. We were already angry, and the dog and cats, constantly trying to sneak into the house, annoyed us as well. The weather outside was gloomy and disappointing. We were already done with the day before it even began. Eventually, we decided to get up and get ready. We came up with a plan to walk to the river behind my house, even in the poor weather. The river was beyond our large backyard and past the quad - track, about a mile away. When we asked my mom if we could go to the river, she said no. She didn't want us walking there alone, even though we had done it a few times before. We begged, but we knew she wouldn't let us. This put us in a foul mood again. We had to find something new to do, and there didn't seem to be many options. We lived about @NUM1 miles out of town, which was not within walking distance. In conclusion, that day was full of setbacks, but the power of laughter with friends can turn even the worst days around, and I cherish those moments of shared mirth.
697	21596	8	2	I woke up one day, just like any other, feeling happy but lacking sleep. Little did I know that this day would turn out to be the funniest of my life. After getting out of bed, I got ready for school. When I arrived at school, everything seemed like a typical homecoming until there was an announcement over the intercom. It suddenly informed everyone that there would be a dance that night. After school, my friends and I planned to go home and get dressed for the dance. Once we were all dressed, @PERSON1 picked us up, and we headed to the dance looking stylish. When we got there, everyone was dressed appropriately for the dance, except for one guy. He was wearing corduroy pants, a red tucked - in flannel shirt, and some worn - out brown work boots. We looked at him from head to toe and thought, “Are we in a messed - up hillbilly dream?” This was just the start of what was to come. As everyone started to get into the rhythm of the music, we all began to dance. The music was great, and everyone was having a good time, including the guy in the flannel. But then, a song called “Cotton Eyed @CAPS1” came on. When the flannel - wearing kid heard this song, he almost jumped out of his corduroy pants. He started kicking and swinging his feet and arms as if they had no bones or joints. Everyone formed a circle around him and started laughing and copying his movements, including us. He didn't seem to care; he just kept dancing and singing to the song. The most amazing thing was that this was a formal dance, yet this kid managed to pull off wearing a flannel, boots, and corduroy pants. He was truly out of his mind. To this day, we still laugh and talk about that incident. In conclusion, that dance was a memorable event filled with unexpected and hilarious moments. It shows that sometimes, the most unplanned and unconventional situations can create the best memories.
698	21598	8	2	Laughter is a crucial aspect of my life. Whether my friends are making me laugh or I'm making them laugh, it's always present. One prime example was on @DATE1. I, @PERSON1, and three of my closest buddies went hunting. This trip was both the best and the worst hunting experience of my life. It was the worst because we shot at but missed two bears and one of the biggest bucks I've ever seen. However, it was the best because we reached a state of exhaustion where every little thing became funny. The hunting trip was a failure in terms of the actual hunt, but the most important thing was that we had a great time. We were @CAPS1 teenage boys riding around in a pickup truck, making each other laugh. Another example was on @DATE1, this @DATE2. I, @PERSON1, and two boat - loads of my friends went on a trip to a nearby fishing hole called @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1@NUM1 is a small, quiet place that not many people visit. It's very peaceful. I brought out my fifteen - foot duck/fishing boat and my ten - foot canoe. I was in control of the big boat, the only one with a motor, and we were towing the canoe behind us. Inside the canoe were @PERSON1 and two kids who, without meaning to, were incredibly funny. We had a good day of fishing, and as it was starting to end, on our way back, we stopped to fix a pole. The rope pulling the canoe became slack. When we started moving again, the slack tightened, and the canoe lurched forward. @PERSON1, who was standing up at the time, almost fell out. By “almost,” I mean that only his feet and hands, which were holding onto the side rail, were left in the boat, and his butt was in the water. This was the highlight of the trip, and we still talk about it from time to time. My friends and I have had many adventures. Most of them don't turn out as planned, but they all end up being funny. In conclusion, laughter makes these experiences, whether successful or not, truly valuable and unforgettable.
699	21599	8	2	I sat at the table, speechless, as the @CAPS1 shared their story with me. Over the past seven years, they had been through a great deal. @PERSON1's youngest son, @PERSON2, was born three weeks early. The doctor told her that he would live for a maximum of three days. As she recounted this, she stared off into the distance, as if reliving the moment. She said that @PERSON2 had a rare disease. Half of his brain was smooth instead of the normal rigid structure. She described those first days and how scared she was. Seeing @PERSON2 sitting next to her was the only thing that stopped me from crying. He had defied the odds and lived longer. @PERSON1 also told me that as @PERSON2 grew older, he couldn't walk. His pediatrician said that he would never take his first steps and would have to live in a wheelchair. But @PERSON2 received another miracle and started walking, with the aid of a camouflage cane. @PERSON1 informed me that @PERSON2 couldn't talk and only communicated through sign language. She also taught me how to take care of him. He was a normal kid who liked to play with cars and @CAPS2. He was no different from other kids. I had only met the @CAPS1 earlier that @TIME1 when they arrived at @CAPS4 @CAPS5, a @DATE1 @CAPS4 for disabled kids. I had known them for only a few hours, and they were sharing their life story with me. I was given the next week to become best friends with @PERSON2. We went swimming in the river, played with sticks, went on nature walks, and even rode a horse. The smile on @ORGANIZATION1's face brightened my day every time I saw it. @PERSON2 got to experience things that a child like him would never be able to in a lifetime. We went tubing, rode jet skis, and fished in a stock pond where we were sure to catch something. Each night, having had the best time of our lives, we parted. He went to his cabin, and I went to my tent. As I left each night, I could hear the family laughing and talking about how great the day was and how much fun we were having. Being part of making a child happy was the best part of my @CAPS4 experience. One event from that week at @CAPS4 will always stay close to my heart. @PERSON2 had been trying to ride a tricycle made for children with disabilities. He spent hours trying to make it move, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't. My heart broke when I saw him start to cry. He was so frustrated. He gave up and moved on to the swings. The rest of the day, his face showed sorrow and frustration. I wanted to fix it. That night, I went to our @CAPS4 director, @PERSON3, and told him what had happened. He took me to the garage, which was chaotic and unorganized. I didn't understand what he was doing until he emerged with a brand - new shiny bike. It had foot straps, a supportive seat with dragons on it, and a bell. It was perfect. The next @TIME1, after a delicious blueberry pancake breakfast, we went to try out the new bike. This was a big moment for @PERSON2 and his parents. He had been told he'd never walk, ride a bike, or talk, but he had lived through miracles before. @PERSON3 strapped @PERSON2 on the bike, put a helmet on him, and started him off. The anticipation was overwhelming. After a few seconds, the wheels began to turn. @PERSON2 was riding a bike. Tears streamed down our faces. It was the greatest moment. In conclusion, being part of @PERSON2's journey at @CAPS4 was an incredibly rewarding experience. It showed me the power of hope, perseverance, and the joy of making a difference in a child's life.
700	21601	8	2	As I recall, it was @DATE1, a hot and humid day. I remember that day as if it were yesterday. I woke up that morning and decided to go swimming. However, I had no one to go with me, and my mood was starting to turn for the worse. For the most part, the day started off okay. I called all my friends to see what they were doing that day, but as I went through my friend list, everyone seemed too busy to go anywhere with me. I was extremely disappointed. My usually happy - go - lucky attitude quickly turned to sadness. The only option left for me was to use my backup plan: my aunt. We gathered our swimming gear, blankets, tanning lotion, and ourselves, packed them in the back of the van, and headed towards @ORGANIZATION1. I was really not in a good mood, and it seemed that everyone around me was also becoming grumpy. I was bummed that all my friends had ditched me and left me to spend the day with my aunt. It wasn't what I considered fun. As the day went on, the more I thought about my friends, the more frustrated I got. Then it hit me: why let their stupidity of ditching me ruin my day? I started laughing and having a great time. Before I knew it, I forgot why I was having a bad day. When we reached our swimming hole, I looked around and saw that everyone was having fun. So, I decided to loosen up and enjoy myself. I jumped off rocks, made a fool of myself, laughed, and had a great time. We spent the whole day making the most of what we had. When I got home, I realized what an awesome day it had turned out to be. I learned that I shouldn't let my friends get me down. Laughing and having a good time can turn any day around. The most important lesson from that experience is to make the best out of every situation. Don't let failed plans shatter your self - confidence. Put on a smile, turn your frown upside down, and laugh because laughter truly makes life better.
701	21603	8	2	"I was immediately captivated when she sat across from me. Her eyes were like a warm Caribbean sunset with a flash of green, as if I were relaxing on a care - free beach. Her sun - kissed skin was utterly flawless, and her lush ruby - red lips were as juicy and refreshing as a freshly picked pink lady apple. I felt as if I were in a dream, wondering how a woman could be so perfect outside of movies or games. All I could think about was being with her, but the gap between us seemed insurmountable.  When she finally spoke, asking, ""@CAPS1 you know the answer to number three?"", her voice was like a thousand violins played by angels. I was stunned and could only reply with a ""nope"". Feeling like a bumbling fool, I noticed the cross she was wearing and tried to redeem myself by asking about the gem in the center. She smiled, batted her eyelashes, and told me it was a ruby and that she liked my cross too.  Just then, I received a text with a joke from my friend. As I read it, I burst out laughing. She was curious, and after I finished the joke, she laughed too. I then introduced myself, and she told me her name was ""@CAPS2"". It sounded like a name for an angel.  I'm forever grateful to my friend for that joke. If I hadn't made her laugh, we might not have gotten to know each other, and she might not be my girlfriend today. I still feel like the luckiest man in the world, and I'll always remember that laughter is the best way to get close to someone."
702	21604	8	2	Laughter is often regarded as a universal language that transcends the boundaries between individuals and nations. Psychological studies have shown that emotions are closely related to our physical expressions. For example, it's not that @CAPS1 cry because they are sad; rather, they become sad because they cry. Similarly, @CAPS1 feel happy because they laugh.  I recall an incident from my middle - school days. We all had to give presentations in class. Before it started, the classroom was deathly quiet as everyone was nervous. I was so anxious that I thought I might pass out at any moment. Suddenly, a kid started laughing. I didn't know what was so funny, but soon the whole class was laughing. The nervous atmosphere vanished, and everyone began to talk and move around. This helped me calm down; it was as if the heavy weight on my shoulders had disappeared.  This experience taught me how a simple laugh can turn a negative situation positive. Laughter has the potential to transform the world from a dangerous place to one of peace. I love to laugh because it makes me feel better, and those around me also enjoy my company as they can feel the joy I bring.  Laughter is crucial in relationships. My friends and I always laugh about various things when we're together. I once wondered what it would be like if there were no laughter among us; it would surely be dull. In contrast, I saw another group of people who were silent and expressionless during lunch one day. It seemed their friendship was fading. But later, when they started laughing again, it was as if their bond was restored. Laughter can change both the dynamics within a relationship and how others perceive it. In conclusion, laughter is a powerful force that benefits us mentally, physically, and socially.
703	21605	8	2	"Laughter plays a significant role in various situations, from disasters to moments when one simply wants to be cheered up. Humor can alleviate the gravity of any circumstance, no matter how serious, terrifying, or uncomfortable it may be.  The recent earthquakes and subsequent tsunami in @LOCATION2 worried me deeply about my friend @CAPS1. He lives in @LOCATION1, which my friends and I initially thought was close to the more affected areas. Naturally, we were scared for him. We tried our best to use humor to lighten the situation. Our fears grew when he didn't log onto Ning or Facebook, but we later learned that the electricity was down for him that night.  When we found out he was safe, at least for the time being, we were extremely relieved. Humor truly helped to diffuse the tense situation, as it has done on many other occasions. As of now, the story is still unfolding because there are still significant dangers in that region, including the threat of nuclear meltdown. The joking has continued into the week.  I firmly believe that humor can be extremely helpful during worrying times. By making light of a serious situation, it makes the situation seem less overwhelming. However, many people look down on this approach, which is understandable. They may either not recognize our genuine fear or misunderstand our intentions, thinking we're being ""edgy"" or ""offensive"". In reality, those who joke in dangerous situations usually have a sense of humor and are also distressed. In the end, humor can be a valuable coping mechanism even in the face of great adversity."
704	21606	8	2	One day, I was at my friend @PERSON1's house, and her dog @PERSON3 was acting crazy. She was running up and down the stairs as fast as she could, and none of us knew why. I found it hilarious, but @PERSON1 was getting really mad at @PERSON3.  We tried to put @PERSON3 in @ORGANIZATION1's room to calm her down, but it didn't work. She just ran laps around the room, and the more she ran, the harder I laughed. We guessed that @PERSON3 was on a sugar high or something, but we couldn't figure out the exact cause.  @PERSON1 and I went downstairs to ask her mom @CAPS1. She had no idea. Then we asked her dad @PERSON2, and he thought the dog was just crazy. But @PERSON3 had never been this hyper before.  @CAPS2, @PERSON1's sister, came downstairs and told us to shut the dog up, but we couldn't. @PERSON3 was running too fast and too wild to catch or calm down. So we just went back to @ORGANIZATION1's room and laughed because there was nothing else we could do but wonder what was wrong with her.  To be honest, we never did find out what was wrong with @PERSON3. She was just insanely hyper at @TIME1. About @NUM1 hours later, after @PERSON3 had calmed down, @PERSON1 and I went for a walk. We were with her friend @PERSON4, and I tried to tell him the story of @PERSON3's crazy behavior. But he and @PERSON1 didn't find it as funny as I did.  While I was telling the story, they warned me that I was about to trip over a curb, but I was laughing so hard that I didn't notice and fell. It was like the perfect ending to @TIME1. We all just sat there on the ground and laughed. It was really funny, and I haven't laughed that hard since then. It was a truly memorable day.
705	21607	8	2	Laughter is known to be a powerful healing force. It can soothe the emotional pain that comes from a breakup or the hardship of being unable to support one's family. In my life, it helped me cope with the loss of a dear friend and teacher, @PERSON2.  Recently, @PERSON2 passed away. He was supposed to set up his lesson plans at @ORGANIZATION1 in the @TIME1. That day, <@NUM1</@CAPS2> had a doctor's appointment and got a substitute. It was six o'clock in the @TIME1, and it was still dark when @PERSON2 tried to open the doors of @ORGANIZATION1. Before he knew it, he was on the ground, waiting for help.  The janitor, @PERSON1, spotted him and quickly called @NUM2. The ambulance rushed him to the hospital, where they found out he had had a heart attack. He'd had minor ones before, but this one was fatal, and they couldn't revive him. @PERSON2 was pronounced dead on @DATE1.  When we arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 that @TIME1, the principal called an emergency assembly. We knew something was wrong from the strange looks on our teachers' faces. All the students gathered in the small gym. The air was thick with anticipation.  Our principal, @PERSON3, walked out with a microphone. With a slumped posture and a grim expression, he told us the tragic news. I was shocked, and I could hear others gasping and murmuring in disbelief. Everyone in the class looked as stunned as I did.  After the principal finished, we were led out of the gym by sad teachers and told to go to our first - period classes. On my way to my locker, I heard sobbing but mostly silence. I quickly grabbed my folder and went to class.  In the classroom, I sat at my desk and started to cry as the reality of the situation set in. By the end of the first period, my sweatshirt sleeve was soaked with tears and mascara.  However, in my second - period class, things were different. Instead of silence, there was soft music. Friends were comforting each other, and students were making cards for @PERSON2's family. We started reminiscing about the good times with @PERSON2, like the funny crack in his voice when he raised it and the crooked things he hung on the classroom walls. We laughed, and for the first time that day, we felt okay.  Laughter helped us celebrate his life rather than just mourn his loss. It eased the pain and sorrow of that dreadful day and brought us together in our time of need.
706	21608	8	2	Laughter is a universal and beloved human activity. The reason we enjoy laughing is that it brings joy, happiness, and a fluttery feeling to our lives. It plays a crucial role in various relationships. For instance, in romantic, family, and friendship bonds, laughter helps build and strengthen connections. Without it, relationships can become dull.  In a family, sharing laughter is essential for a healthy relationship between parents and children. Friends also create positive relationships through funny moments, such as pranks, jokes, and humorous comments. However, laughter can have negative consequences if used to hurt others. Laughing at someone's misfortune or comment can damage relationships and lead to feelings of sadness.  Laughter is also a powerful tool for cheering people up on bad days. When someone is feeling down, a simple joke can make a significant difference. In personal experience, laughter is a cherished part of life. It helps during difficult times and makes life more enjoyable. Imagine a world filled with laughter; it would be a place full of happiness and smiles. In conclusion, laughter is an indispensable element in life, and everyone should embrace it.
707	21609	8	2	Laughter is of utmost importance in my relationships. I hold laughter dear and seize every opportunity to use it. While some may view laughter as unimportant, it is the key to my connections with others. Without it, many of the friendships I've formed in my life might not have existed.  In my childhood, making friends was challenging. I made poor choices in how I approached people, often coming across as brash, rude, or annoying. Since the first impression is vital, I realized I needed to improve. It was a long and difficult journey, but by my sophomore year at @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I felt I had mastered the art of making others laugh.  One significant friendship I built was with a young woman. When our teacher put us in a group, laughter became the foundation of our relationship. I was myself, sharing puns and euphemisms that our generation loves. We bonded over the same music, and our relationship grew into a strong friendship. Now, we look forward to being together in class and enjoy making each other laugh.  Recently, she decided to play tennis, and I'm eager to help her. Laughter has brought us together, and seeing her happy because of something I said means the world to me. I've also built many other connections through laughter, and it has made life easier and more enjoyable. At @CAPS1 @CAPS2, laughter has united us into a community where everyone is friends. Laughter is a universal language that can bring people together, and it is truly the most prescribed medicine in life.
708	21610	8	2	People often say that the saddest moments in life are the worst, as they lack the presence of laughter and smiles. These sad times highlight the importance of laughter in our lives. Joyful moments, filled with laughter, make life worth living despite the challenges of work, relationships, and society.  On my recent birthday, which fell on a @DATE1, I had no plans to celebrate. I was in high school and thought birthday parties were no longer appropriate. Without exciting activities, I didn't look forward to the day as I had in previous years. The thought of spending the day at home with my family made me feel sad and lonely.  My mom noticed my gloom and suggested a trip to the beach and a stay in a yurt. I love the beach and yurts, so I agreed. However, I was still skeptical as I worried about not having friends to laugh with and about potential family conflicts. Our family isn't the most harmonious, with my older sister often annoying me and the girls frequently arguing.  On the day of the trip, we woke up early to pack. My mom announced that it was my day, and I could choose what we did and ate. To my surprise, the day was wonderful. We visited the beach, settled into the yurt, and had a great lunch. No one fought, and we all laughed throughout the day. At the aquarium, we laughed at the fish and each other's silly antics.  Laughter pushed away my negative thoughts and made me realize the love in my family. It is a healthy and essential part of life, as it can make invisible things like love visible. In conclusion, laughter is a powerful force that can transform a sad day into a memorable one.
709	21611	8	2	It's interesting how something that isn't funny at the moment can become comical later. For example, witnessing someone getting hit by a car in real - life is a serious situation with people rushing for help. But on the @CAPS1, it can be seen as comical.  On a hot @DATE1 @TIME1, a similar incident happened to me and my friends. I live near the @LOCATION1, and there's a place called @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. The water there is greenish due to the reflection of the surrounding trees. The @LOCATION1 is about thirty yards wide, and its depth is unknown as it's impossible to touch the bottom. The main attraction is a cliff - side that ranges from @NUM1 to @NUM2 feet. On the other side, there's a beautiful golden beach with large trees behind it. The hike to @ORGANIZATION1 is a one - mile steep decline that leads to the cliff's edge. The @LOCATION1 bed and the gorge are shaded most of the day, except in the mornings.  I planned to take @CAPS2, @PERSON2, @CAPS3, and @PERSON1 there. My friend @CAPS2 is a dare - devil, although not very athletic. He's also socially awkward as he was home - schooled until freshman year of high school and isn't good at resisting negative peer pressure. I, on the other hand, can pull off crazy stunts. I was doing gainers off a @NUM1 - foot cliff. Somehow, @CAPS2 got pressured into trying one.  As he prepared, we gave him a countdown: @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6, @CAPS6! He ran to the cliff, jumped out, and brought his knees to his chest. But he didn't rotate; he just fell like a rock with his back hitting the water. There was a long pause before the splash, and the sound was as loud as a small firecracker. @NUM5 seconds later, he emerged, gasping for air.  We were all on the other side of the lake. We immediately swam towards him. I reached him first, but I waited for @PERSON1, who is big and strong. We all pulled @CAPS2 to the beach. It was partly my fault for pressuring him.  After almost @NUM5 hours of relaxing in the sun, as the sun set and shadows crept in, we noticed that @CAPS2's back was purple from the impact. Everyone except @CAPS2 saw it and started laughing at the memory. Then @CAPS2 saw it and couldn't help laughing either. This was the first time we hung out, and laughter brought us together. To this day, we still remember that hot @DATE1 at @ORGANIZATION1 when @CAPS2 attempted the gainer. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between people.
710	21613	8	2	Before my best friend @CAPS1 moved away, we used to stay up late at night just laughing for no reason. We couldn't stop until our stomachs ached, and then we'd fall asleep. Her mom would come in around @TIME1 and ask us to be quiet, which only made us laugh more. We're so close that we're like sisters.  Laughter is crucial in all my relationships. I grew up in a large family where laughter was key and positive attitudes were expected. @CAPS1 and I work well together. We can manipulate our elders, a skill we developed from years of practicing on @CAPS2. One look at each other, and we know what the other is thinking, followed by a laugh that signals to the person we're trying to manipulate that they're in trouble. Our schemes are usually harmless, maybe just causing a bit of a side ache from tickling.  I prefer positive places with an upbeat atmosphere. I dislike serious and quiet environments and often use jokes or sarcasm to break the ice. Laughter brings people together and lightens the mood. I don't like awkward silences, so I usually break them with a joke.  On a flight from @LOCATION3, @CAPS3 to @ORGANIZATION2, I met some great people. I sat between an elderly woman and a man who looked like my father. The man helped me with my carry - on, and the woman and I started talking about horses. We shared stories about horse - riding falls. Before I knew it, we landed in @LOCATION1, and they got off the plane.  When I thought I'd be sitting alone on the next flight, a teenage girl sat next to me. She offered me gum, and after a while, we started talking to avoid the annoyance of a crying baby. We talked about our families and hobbies. After we landed in @ORGANIZATION1, I was back in the rainy state.  Laughter is everywhere, and there's always something to laugh about. People are more attracted to those who can make them laugh. So, having a sense of humor will lead to good company. Giggles and smiles truly make the world go around, and we should keep laughing.
711	21615	8	2	On my [CAPS1] birthday, we went to [ORGANIZATION1] for a week. The drive there was dreadful, but once we arrived, it was a lot of fun. When we reached the house at [TIME1], it was incredibly beautiful. The snow was falling heavily, looking like white cotton balls, and the snow on the house made it seem like a princess castle from a story - book. Once inside, we all felt so relaxed that we pretty much fell asleep on the couch. The next morning, as we were eating breakfast and watching the snow on [DATE2], there was a knock on the door. Since my [CAPS17] claimed to be “too tired,” I got up to answer it. Three big boys came in and picked me up. At first, I was confused about who they were, but then I recognized them as my cousin [PERSON1], his best friend [PERSON2], and his other friend [CAPS3]. They carried me back to the table and sat me down, and everyone was laughing so hard that they couldn't breathe, while I still had a horrified look on my face. They shouted “[CAPS4]” and then went outside to build snow ramps for snowboarding. I got dressed and joined them. At first, they seemed unenthusiastic about my presence. Usually, they give me a lot of attention, but this time they didn't. So, I sat on the snowboard ramp they built. [PERSON2] knew what I was up to, but [CAPS3] and [PERSON1] were clueless. They told me to get off, and I replied with “[CAPS7],” which irritated them. [PERSON1] threatened to jump over me if I didn't move, and I dared him to do it. Just as he started to move, [PERSON2] grabbed him, pulled him off the snowboard, and started yelling at him. The argument lasted almost the whole day. I went to bed at [TIME1], and [PERSON1][NUM1] and [CAPS3] went to the bar. The next morning, I was supposed to sleep in, but I was woken up at seven o'clock by [PERSON2] and [CAPS3] screaming at [PERSON1] to get up. It was so irritating to be in the house with three hung - over twenty - one - year - olds. When they were not home, it was peaceful, and we played [CAPS15] and [LOCATION3], having a great time. The next morning, there was another argument that really annoyed me. I tried to stay away as much as possible and ended up locking myself in my room for the day. It wasn't ideal, but it was better than having them yell in my ear constantly. The day after, we cleaned and prepared to leave. It was not fun at all, but my [CAPS17] made sure I helped with the cleaning. We ate three meals and cleaned after each one. We were so tired that night that everyone was quiet when we went to bed. The next morning, we left at seven o'clock and started driving back to [LOCATION2]. Being at [LOCATION1] was a lot of fun, and we've made it a tradition. We couldn't go this [DATE1] because of the winter formal, but we're definitely going back and expect to have twice as much fun as we did two years ago.
712	21617	8	2	I woke up feeling morose and sleepy as I had to go to [LOCATION1] to watch some basketball games. Unfortunately, I was [CAPS1] injured during the previous week's practice, so I couldn't participate. Nevertheless, I still had to go and support my friends and teammates. At around [NUM1] o'clock, we boarded the bus and headed to [LOCATION1]. My friends were all happy and talkative, while I was in a daze. The bus ride felt like it would never end, but we arrived at our destination in two hours. [LOCATION1] had a nice school, but it sometimes seemed like a ghost town. It was lifeless compared to other schools we had played at before. There was no one around and no sound to be heard. We patiently waited, and after about five minutes, a man showed up and led us to the locker rooms. The boys had to wait for the girls' game to finish, so we went to an auxiliary court to shoot. Due to my injury, I couldn't take part. They were having a great time, and the thought of not being able to join them made me feel sick. After the girls' game, we changed. Then we sat around, joking and waiting for our coach to give us a pre - game pep talk. It seemed like forever before the coach finally came in. He talked about what we should and shouldn't do to win the game. When the game started, I was really depressed, but I cheered on my team. The first half of the game was great, and we were leading. However, the second half was terrible. We only scored six points and lost by a large margin. My friends tried to be strong, but I could tell they were ashamed of their performance in the second half, which made me feel sad. Next, I had to watch two more games in the old, uncomfortable bleachers of [LOCATION1]. The first game was exciting, and we won by two points. The second game was very boring and seemed to last forever, and we lost. After the final game, I waited for my cousin to come out of the locker room. When he did, we checked out with our coaches so we could ride home with our parents. First, we stopped to get something to eat at [ORGANIZATION1]. After going through the drive - through and getting our food, we pulled over to eat. My cousin noticed he didn't get the [CAPS2] he ordered, so we went inside to fix the problem. Then, when I took a bite of my burger, I realized it had no patty. I was really upset about this silly mistake. We went inside again, and the staff was shocked when we told them the problem. After they calmed down, they made me another burger. On the way home, we laughed about the events at [ORGANIZATION1]. It was a fun and unexpected trip home. Despite the initial gloom of the day, I ended up laughing a lot.
713	21618	8	2	My mom decided to send me to [DATE3] camp. When I heard this, I was quite upset because I wouldn't know anyone there. Before camp started, I tried my best to convince my mom not to send me, but I knew I wouldn't succeed. Soon, I was on my way to camp. When I got to the place where we were supposed to gather for the camp, there weren't many people. But when I arrived at the camp, I was wrong; there were a lot of strangers. It was extremely scary, and it was too late to go home. Walking to my cabin was nerve - wracking as I had no idea who would be in it. Meeting the girls in my cabin was awkward. Firstly, we didn't know each other, and secondly, our counselor was very strange. Right after meeting, our counselor made us play a game of [CAPS2]. At first, playing [CAPS2] with strangers was strange, but after a while, we started laughing. We played and laughed for hours until it was time for lunch. Lunch with the girls wasn't as scary since we had had so much fun playing [CAPS2], but we still didn't know each other well. After lunch, we played [CAPS2] again. The more we laughed and had fun, the more we got to know each other. All [DATE1], we played this silly game, giggling and laughing. On the second [DATE1] of camp, [DATE2] came, and we had almost become friends just by laughing and playing [CAPS2]. We played it so much on the first [DATE1] that we started calling it “[CAPS6] [CAPS2].” Eventually, we got tired of [CAPS2] and went our separate ways during free time. Everyone thought free time was boring, so we played [CAPS2] again. We laughed so hard that our stomachs hurt, and I think that was the day we really became friends. In just a couple of days, we became very close. We did everything together - talked, swam, played tennis, and most importantly, laughed together. Camp was much better than I expected. The girls in my cabin became friends so quickly that it seemed strange to others. Then, I got sick. It was horrible as I had to stay in bed all [DATE1], missing out on everything. I almost lost my voice, and it was torture not being able to laugh and have fun with my friends. As the end of camp was approaching, I was relieved when I could talk again. For the rest of the camp, I was able to be out of bed and enjoy it. On the last evening of camp, we had a cabin party. It was a lot of fun even though we had to stay inside. We ate all the treats we had saved from the concession stand and the ones our counselor brought. It was almost [TIME1], and we knew we had to go to bed soon because we were leaving in the [TIME2]. But there was one more thing to do - play one last game of [CAPS2]. We played for about an hour until another counselor came and told us to be quiet. Looking back at my first year of camp, I always remember how we became friends. We still talk about it every year at camp and still play [CAPS2]. That year at camp is one of my favorite memories because we became friends just by playing [CAPS2] and laughing together.
714	21619	8	2	I have a strong dislike for computers. I find them to be a source of constant frustration. Their complex systems often lead to glitches and malfunctions, which waste my time and energy. The amount of time I have to spend troubleshooting technical issues is simply unacceptable. Moreover, the digital world that computers represent can be a very isolating place. Instead of real - life interactions, people are often glued to their screens, engaging in virtual conversations that lack the depth and warmth of face - to - face communication. In addition, the constant stream of information from computers can be overwhelming and distracting. It makes it difficult to focus on important tasks. All in all, my negative view of computers remains steadfast, and I believe that their drawbacks far outweigh any potential benefits.
715	21620	8	2	Everyone is aware of the importance of laughter. Each person has a unique laugh, which can be either powerful and heart - warming or hurtful and destructive. Someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,” and I wholeheartedly agree. People laugh for various reasons, and laughter is a powerful emotion. It can turn around a person's mood when they are sad or upset. Laughter is also a way to connect with others. You laugh when you are having a good time, when you are hurt and need comfort. Laughter is unpredictable; you never know when or why you will laugh, whether it's because of a simple joke or an elaborate funny story. Recently, I was moving back to [PERSON1] from [LOCATION1]. I was very nervous and scared about being the new kid again, even though I knew some people from my previous time living there. Not long after I moved, I reconnected with some old friends I've known since the second grade. We always have a great time together, laughing and being crazy. We've all been through a lot in the past few years and that [DATE1]. It was nice to see and talk to them again after all that had happened. We've all gone our separate ways, made new friends, but we're still close. As [DATE1] was almost over and school was about to start, four of us friends decided to have one last get - together before school. We planned a big sleepover. One of the friends lives in [LOCATION2], and she came to [PERSON1] for the sleepover. It felt like we were back in second grade, and I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in my life. After we all arrived, we were laughing, talking, and having a blast. That night, we were thinking of something fun to do, and one of my friends suggested [CAPS1]'ing. We asked her mom if it was okay, and she said yes as long as we didn't go too far and kept our phones with us. It was still too early for [CAPS1]'ing, so we walked to the store down the street and bought a lot of toilet paper. Since it still wasn't dark or late enough, we watched movies, went to the mall, and put our feet in the hot tub. Finally, when it was dark, we put on black clothes to disguise ourselves and hid the toilet paper in our jackets. We tried to be quiet, but we were so loud that we didn't hear some other kids on bikes. It turned out to be some guy friends from school who were also bored. They helped us [CAPS1] some houses. As it got really late, we decided to head back. This [DATE1] is one I'll never forget. We had so much fun, and we agreed that we've never laughed so hard before. It was a tough year for all of us, and it was great to be with true friends again. We'll always cherish these memories, and I'm sure our friendship will last through high school and college.
716	21621	8	2	"Laughter holds significant importance within my family. We share laughter, experiences, and even the journey of life. For us, what brings the family together, aside from having a good time, loving one another, and spending quality moments, is the ability to laugh and stay close. Whether someone is upset or angry, there's always a time for enjoyment and laughter.  One day, I was out having an adventure with a close friend at @LOCATION1. When it was time to head home and prepare for a sleep - over at my friend's place, we entered my house to find a chaotic scene with a lot of yelling. We decided to sit down and figure out what was going on. To our amusement, we saw my step - dad, @PERSON1, yelling at my oldest sister, @ORGANIZATION1.  @PERSON1 complained, ""I can't believe the family can't simply go next door to @PERSON2's house and ask for toilet paper. I've been sitting on the toilet for an hour, hoping someone would bring it. Instead, they came and asked for our plunger, which is far more embarrassing."" His words made us burst into laughter.  My sister, @ORGANIZATION1, with a lot of attitude, retorted, ""The family doesn't need toilet paper! They could easily take a shower and use the shower head to clean up!"" This statement made the situation even funnier.  My step - dad was furious. He immediately picked up the phone and called my mother, ranting about the situation. In his anger, he said some things he shouldn't have and even started to stutter. He explained about the lack of toilet paper and how @ORGANIZATION1 refused to get some.  The step - dad was so angry that he took my sister's phone and even removed her access to toilet paper. He rummaged through all the bathrooms in the house, taking every bit of toilet paper and even removing the shower head.  When my mother got home, the step - dad was embarrassed that we had heard about his hand - wiping incident. I posted the story on @CAPS5, and he saw it, turning his cheeks red.  Even though the step - dad was mad, he also found the situation somewhat funny. A week later, he still hadn't put any toilet paper in the bathroom, saying, ""The family thinks it's funny when it happens to me, but it won't be funny when they have no toilet paper."" Laughter truly is a strong bond in our family."
717	21623	8	2	"Laughter is a crucial element in any relationship, be it with family, friends, or a partner. Let me share an incident that proves its importance. There were two weeks left of school when my family planned a week - long camping trip.  Once school ended, as we said goodbye to our friends, my parents picked us up in what my dad called an ""@CAPS1"", which resembled an ordinary school bus. We set off for our camping site.  One would expect camping to bring the family closer and be full of fun. However, my brothers were engrossed in video games, my mom and sister were on their phones, and my dad was driving. I asked them why they brought electronic devices, but all I got was a simple ""because"". So, I decided to read until we reached the camp.  When we arrived, we unloaded the @CAPS1 and set up our things. That night, by the campfire, everyone was still occupied with their devices. As I sat there, looking at the stars, I wondered if our family would ever be close and exciting.  The next morning, my mom asked if I had closed the @CAPS1 door before going to sleep. I admitted I forgot, and she got a bit mad and asked my sister to close it. As my sister approached the door, she heard noises and went inside. In an instant, she came sprinting out, screaming, with a group of raccoons chasing her.  My dad tried to be a hero and scare the raccoons away but got bitten on the butt. While we were distracted, the raccoons took our food. In his anger, my dad kicked the log that kept the @CAPS1 from rolling, and it started moving down the hill and into a lake.  As we watched it disappear, we were left without a vehicle. On the way back to the camp, my family was arguing. My mom fell into a mud pit, and my dad slipped in while trying to help her. They looked extremely angry.  When we returned to the camp, I told my dad I thought it was funny when the raccoon bit his butt and showed him the picture. Everyone started laughing, and we began to talk and act like a real family.  We decided to walk home and hitch - hike. After an hour, a local trucker gave us a ride. Once home, we spent more time together, and our family became closer. This camping trip changed us, and it clearly shows that laughter is essential in relationships."
718	21624	8	2	On a hot @DATE1 day, a group of us were looking for ways to beat the heat. @PERSON7 had a few ideas. One was to go to @LOCATION3's house where there was air - conditioning. Another was to walk @NUM2 miles to @CAPS1 swim hole, mainly because his girlfriend would be there. But no one wanted to walk that far in the heat.  @NUM3 proposed three ideas. The first was to walk @NUM4 miles to his uncle's house to see if we could catch a ride to @CAPS4 @CAPS5. The second was to go to our friend @PERSON5's house and swim in his pool. The third was to spray ourselves with the hose in the backyard.  @PERSON1 had two ideas. One was to ask his mom for money to fill his tank and pay her back. The other was to drive to the coast and camp there if he got the money.  Byran had three rather unconventional ideas. The first was to jump in the water fountain by the @ORGANIZATION1 and quickly get out. The second was to go to the @LOCATION4 (also known as the @CAPS6 @CAPS7), hop over the fence, and let us in. The third was to swim in the pool at an old people's home as he claimed to know someone.  @NUM5 had three ideas too. They were to walk a mile to the forks, walk @NUM4 miles to the creek, or get a bunch of fans and run them in @CAPS3's room.  I was on board with @PERSON1's idea of going to the coast and camping because I love beach camping, with its nice smell and the chance to see attractive people.  We waited for @PERSON1's mom to call. When his phone rang, it was just his grandma, which disappointed us. Finally, when @ORGANIZATION3's @NUM7 phone rang, it was actually @PERSON1's mom. She said she'd lend the money if we did some errands for her. We had to pick @CAPS9 from work and buy cigars for @PERSON1's grandpa.  After completing the errands, we packed our camping gear. An hour later, at @NUM4 @CAPS10.M., we filled @PERSON1's tank at the chevron and headed to @ORGANIZATION2 city @LOCATION1. The two - hour drive was beautiful, with tunnels, rivers, mountains, and tall redwoods.  When we got close to the coast, the temperature dropped by @NUM9 degrees @CAPS11, and everyone was in a good mood. At the camp site, we swam in the cold water, much to the surprise of others. We later realized we were in a red - zone with rip - tide advisories.  We also had to go into town to get propane for our stove. We ate delicious hot dogs dipped in @ORGANIZATION4 honey. We stayed at the coast for a night, but then @PERSON6 had to go to work, so we had to return to the heat. However, when we got back, my mom wanted to go to the river, so it all ended well.
719	21626	8	2	"In most stories, the relationship between mothers and daughters is either adversarial or friendly. In my story, my mother and I were both enemies and friends, but now we're just friends. I'm sixteen, and she's forty. Although she can still discipline me as her daughter, we've learned to resolve issues and laugh things off.  About seven months ago, my mother, @LOCATION5, moved from @LOCATION4 to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, while I stayed behind to finish high school with my friends. Before, we used to fight over the silliest things. I think the reason is that we're very similar. I have her looks, attitude, and even the way she laughs. We're both stubborn and love to argue, mainly with each other. However, if we were in a professional setting, like being lawyers, we'd work well together because I've inherited her work ethic.  As I grew older and we went through tough times, we started to appreciate each other more. Traumatic events in our lives brought us closer. We stopped arguing, comforted each other, and became friends, and laughter played a big role in this transformation.  My mother once said, ""Laughter brings two people together as a whole. Everyone knows how to laugh, and it's something we can all share."" After our life settled down, we still had occasional fights, but they were nothing like before, when we would throw objects at each other.  One night, we discovered that laughter helps us block out the things that bother us. I love singing, and my mother exposed me to music like The @CAPS2, @LOCATION3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4, etc. We have a special song, ""@CAPS3're @CAPS4 @CAPS5"" by @PERSON3, which we sing together in the car or in front of our family. After singing, we laugh about it because it's our special moment.  My mother grew up in a strict @CAPS6 @CAPS7 home. When we went to @CAPS8, we tried not to take life too seriously. We'd laugh at things like an ugly bug on the wall or when I dropped the prayer book on my foot.  Even though she moved to @LOCATION2 for a new job and to see the man she loves more often, we still talk and laugh. We cry on the phone when we miss each other, but laughter always follows. Laughter has truly shaped our relationship and made us closer."
720	21628	8	2	"I didn't understand the saying ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" until I dated @PERSON2. We started dating in the @NUM1 grade. Some might think it was puppy love, but I still believe it was real love.  We lived about an hour and a half apart and only saw each other two or three times a month. However, those were the best times of my life, filled with fun and laughter.  We met through my ex - boyfriend and his best friend, @PERSON1. @PERSON1 went to school with me, and our moms were best friends, so @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 grew up together. I was supposed to go to the movies with @PERSON1 and his friend, but @PERSON1 didn't show up, so I was left with @PERSON2, and we hit it off right away.  The more time we spent together, the more we laughed, had fun, and created memories. When we couldn't see each other, we'd talk on the phone for @NUM2 hours or text non - stop. We made funny jokes, talked about people we disliked, and even made fun of each other.  After about @NUM2 months of dating, things took a turn for the worse. @PERSON2 said, ""I can't do this long - distance thing anymore."" I pleaded, ""Can't we work things out?"" He hesitated and said, ""It's not fair to us.""  I reminded him of all the good times we had, and he started to change his mind. He said, ""Now I know I need you.""  After that night, things were okay for a while. We had on - and - off fights, and family issues made it difficult for us to be together. We managed to stay together for a year and a half, but in the end, we couldn't make it work.  However, laughter had a huge impact on our relationship. Even now, I can look back and laugh at all the good times we had. Laughter can keep two people far apart connected, but the question is, for how long? Only time can tell."
721	21629	8	2	"When one laughs, is it out of habit, or is there a specific cause? What exactly causes people to laugh? Is there even such a thing as a ""cause"" for laughter? If a scientist were consulted, they would likely provide a detailed, technical explanation for the cause of laughter. However, does this mean that laughing is merely a message sent from the brain to the relevant muscles? Certainly not. The true cause is what prompts the brain to send the message to the muscles, resulting in physical laughter. So, what makes people laugh? It could be a funny joke, a senseless action, or a misunderstanding; it can be anything!  On @DATE1, my older sister @PERSON4 and I unknowingly embarked on an adventure. We were headed to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 to visit our best friends, @PERSON2 and @PERSON3. They happened to have personalities almost identical to my sister and me; @PERSON2 was like @PERSON4, and @PERSON3 was like me. Whenever the four of us got together, we never knew what kind of humorous and crazy memories we'd take home. All we knew was that hanging out always brightened our days and put smiles on our faces.  On this particular day, both @PERSON3 and I were in desperate need of each other's full attention and uplifting spirits. We had both been going through tough times with some friends at school. Strangely enough, we were both having friendship issues with someone named @PERSON1, even though we didn't go to the same school. After discussions between our parents, they agreed that @PERSON2 would pick up @LOCATION3, @PERSON4 would pick me up, and we'd all meet somewhere to distract ourselves from the difficult situations we were facing. We decided to meet at @PERSON2 and @PERSON3's house in @LOCATION2.  As we pulled into their driveway, I could feel my body filled with excitement, as if the emotion was trapped in a container too small to hold it all. Before the car engine was fully turned off, I unbuckled my seat - belt and was halfway out of the car door. I slammed the door shut once I was out and ran for the door. To my surprise, it was unlocked! I pushed it open, yelling, ""I'm heeeeeeeereeeeeeee!"" A cry of laughter filled the room. I hugged both of them tightly, and as soon as we sat on the couch, we immediately started chatting about the day's events. All that could be heard were exclamations like ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4! I have to tell you what happened today!"" and ""I can't believe she said that!""  Suddenly, @PERSON2 shouted, ""@CAPS2! @PERSON3 and I baked you brownies!"" Caught off - guard by his interjection, we all burst into laughter again and made our way to the kitchen in search of the brownies. When we arrived, there was a pan of brownies on the middle counter. @PERSON3 uncovered them and gave us each a napkin with a brownie on top. We stood together, leaning against the tile counters, enjoying the brownies and each other's company.  There was a brief moment of silence. As if to break it, @PERSON2 blurted out, ""@PERSON4, do you wear a wig?"" We've never laughed as hard as we did at that moment. @PERSON3 fell to the ground, @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 leaned on each other to keep from falling, and I was doubled over, trying not to spit out the sip of milk I'd just taken. Minutes passed, and we were still laughing at the unexpected remark. To this day, @PERSON4 and I reminisce about that afternoon and the wonderful laughter shared with our best friends."
722	21630	8	2	"I'm @NUM1 years old, and throughout these years, all I can recall is laughing uncontrollably. Whether it was about something silly I did, my best friend's foolish acts, or the crazy things we did together, laughter was always present. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" and that's definitely true for my best friend @ORGANIZATION2 and me. Whenever I'm with her, I get a great abdominal workout because I'm always laughing.  It was my @NUM3 grade year at @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION3. During our lunch break outside, I was showing @ORGANIZATION2 my new jeans that I'd bought at @LOCATION2 the day before. I was also telling her about a note from a boy who had a crush on me and had asked me out. @ORGANIZATION2 asked to see the note, and when I gave it to her, she threw it over the fence. Clearly, she didn't approve of the boy.  I couldn't leave the boy waiting for an answer, especially since I liked him back. I begged @ORGANIZATION2 to give me the note back, but she refused. I couldn't just let the unanswered note stay on the other side of the fence. So, I decided to hop over the fence to get it. In my new jeans, I straddled the fence and ripped a big hole in the inner side of my thigh. I was furious. I grabbed the note and climbed back over the fence in my now - ""improved"" hobo jeans. On the way back, I lost my balance and fell off the fence. I ended up losing the note again and landing head - first in a pile of mud and pine cones.  I was so frustrated with myself. I'd climbed over the stupid fence, ripped my jeans, fallen, and lost the note twice. But then, I started laughing. I'm not sure if it was due to embarrassment or something else, but I just started cracking up. Then @ORGANIZATION2 joined in, and her contagious laughter made me laugh even harder.  Even though I probably should have been mad, I realized that laughter was the best response. That memory will stay with me forever, especially now that @ORGANIZATION2 has moved away. It might seem stupid to others, but it was a funny moment for us. It truly was one of those ""you had to be there"" moments, and it reminds me of the good old days with @ORGANIZATION2. Laughter really is a precious thing in life."
723	21633	8	2	"Many people believe that laughter can enhance one's life. When we laugh, our bodies release endorphins, which provide energy for daily activities. In relationships, when both parties are happy, the bond is usually stronger. Happiness is like a soda bottle; positive emotions build up in our bodies, and when ""shaken,"" they explode in the form of laughter and other positive expressions.  When I was born, my mother said I was the chubbiest baby in the world. As she said this, she laughed, imagining me growing into a young adult. On the way home from the hospital, I giggled in the backseat of the car. My mother, who often laughed until her eyes were full of tears, taught me to seize every opportunity to laugh. As an infant, I giggled, chuckled, and laughed my way through to adolescence.  However, during my adolescence, I was diagnosed with @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1, a mild form of autism with various side effects. Some people with @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1 have difficulty showing their emotions physically, similar to the physical manifestations of @CAPS3 @CAPS1. My main issue with this condition is that I don't process all the information given to me at once. When people tell me a joke they find hilarious, I often miss the funny parts. So, when the joke ends, everyone around me is laughing, while I stand there with a blank look on my face.  Sometimes I tell people I can't laugh, but I know that's not true. It's just hard for me to find the right moment. Often, I laugh at inappropriate times, and everyone else looks at me blankly, which makes me feel embarrassed and abnormal. People often tell me I look expressionless and try to make me smile, but I don't feel the need, even during happy times.  I haven't laughed enough, but I've been learning to turn bad situations"
