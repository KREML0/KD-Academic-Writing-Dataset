1	17834	7	2	Patience is the act of waiting. I demonstrated patience while waiting in line for lunch. I refrained from cutting in front of others to get my food. I simply stood there, patiently awaiting my turn. Unfortunately, not everyone possesses this virtue. Many individuals cut in line or yell at others due to their lack of patience. Sometimes, they even push others out of the way. They do these things because they have no patience at all. Patience is an essential quality that people need. When people lack patience, many feelings can get hurt. Therefore, everyone should strive to have patience.
2	17836	7	2	I'm not a patient person. I can't sit still for more than five minutes. However, there was one instance when I was patient, and I'm sure others were too. It was when I was learning to ride a bike without training wheels at the age of five. I kept falling off. At one point, my bike flipped, and I almost broke my jaw, but I didn't. After several weeks of constant falling, I finally managed to ride for a few minutes without falling and learned how to ride a bike. This experience taught me that with patience, we can achieve difficult tasks.

After we finished the suicides (a running exercise), I asked the coach if we could get some drinks. The coach said, ""After the double - dribble down and back exercise."" I completed the exercise, and we all rushed to the drinking fountain. I was at the end of a long line of girls. I waited and waited. Finally, when I was in front of the drinking fountain, a girl said, ""Can I have a drink? Thank you."" I was stunned. Then I heard a loud voice saying, ""Let's go!"" I was extremely mad, but I quickly took a short drink of water and rushed back to the coach. Now, I often finish first and take long drinks, so my teammates call me a fish. It shows that sometimes we need to control our emotions even when we're frustrated."
4	17838	7	2	"I'm going to tell you about a time I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 fair. We had a great time. We saw a ride we wanted to go on and got in line. Suddenly, we realized we were at the end of the line. My mother said, ""@CAPS1, let's get on another ride."" My father replied, ""We've already tried the other rides."" So, we stayed at the end of the line. We said it was going to be our last ride. Soon, people behind us started complaining. Their young children got angry, and the parents were shouting. But we just stood there, being patient. It didn't bother us because we were taught to be patient and wait our turn. I believe being patient is very important. If you act up in line, people might think they're holding you back, but it's just the line moving slowly. My advice is that when you're at the end of a line, don't shout or yell. It only causes trouble. Just distract yourself by talking to someone. You'll find the line moves faster than you thought. By the way, we really enjoyed the ride."
5	17839	7	2	It can be quite challenging for someone to be patient. A patient person is understanding and tolerant. There are times when patience is necessary. For example, when going to the dentist or doctor's office, one needs to be very patient. There was a girl who had to visit the dentist. She disliked going to the dentist as it was always so boring. First, she had to sit while her parents filled out a lot of paperwork. She had to wait for about @NUM1 minutes before going in. Then, once inside, the dentist worked on her teeth for about ten minutes, and then she had to sit for another fifteen minutes. After getting her teeth cleaned, she sat for another ten minutes while her parents talked to the dentist. This shows that even when we're extremely bored, we should be patient. Patience helps us get through such situations smoothly.
6	17840	7	2	"There was a girl named @PERSON1 who loved spending time with her mom. Every weekend, they would either go to the movies, an amusement or water park, or simply stay home. However, this time was different. @PERSON1 was even a bit scared about what was about to happen. On @DATE1, @PERSON1 and her mom were watching videos of her mom when she was young. After the video, they looked at each other and laughed. Once they calmed down, @PERSON1's mom looked sad. ""@CAPS1's wrong, mom?"" @PERSON1 asked. ""I have to go. I have to go somewhere for work and can't take you with me,"" mom replied. ""Why not?"" asked @PERSON1. ""I don't know, but I need you to wait here with your father. I'll be back soon,"" the mom said calmly. With that, @PERSON1's mom left and drove away. @PERSON1 stood there, confused and wishing her mom didn't have to go. Then she went to the phone and called her dad. An hour later, @PERSON1's dad came to her house. He calmed @PERSON1 down, who had been crying because she missed her mom. @PERSON1 went to her room and began to wait patiently for her mom. Weeks passed, and @PERSON1's mom still hadn't returned. Every night now, @PERSON1 cried, hoping her mom would come. During the day, she would wait, watching for her mom. @PERSON1 wanted her mom more than ever now. Though she never complained to her father and understood that her mom left for an important reason, she still missed her mom. Two years had passed since @PERSON1's mom had left. @PERSON1 didn't cry as much but still waited, waited for her mother to come back. One day, @PERSON1 heard a knock on the door. She answered it, and there stood her mother. They stood on the porch for a moment, then hugged each other. They both cried, and her mom whispered, ""I'm sorry,"" to @PERSON1. Now, @PERSON1 and her mom were inseparable. They never left each other's side again."
7	17841	7	2	My name is @CAPS2, and I own a very impatient chestnut quarter - horse named @CAPS1, which has a white star on its forehead. @CAPS1 is always hyper and eager to move. For instance, when we prepare for a horse ride on our backyard trails, it doesn't stand still while I'm tacking it up at the post. During the ride, it always runs far ahead, forcing me to stop it to wait for the group. That's when it gets impatient. No matter what, it won't stand still and wait, so I have to spin it around and walk back to the group. I've made numerous attempts to train it to be patient, but all have been unsuccessful. It seems that it always has to be active. However, regardless of its impatience, I'll always love it.
8	17842	7	2	A moment when I demonstrated patience was when I pre - ordered a video game called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I pre - ordered it a month before its release and was extremely eager for it to come out. I was particularly interested in it because @ORGANIZATION1, the company that makes it, was ending the @CAPS1 series as another company had bought the rights. The game finally came out on @DATE1, the fourteenth of two thousand ten. I bought it with my friends, and it's truly amazing. I'd give it four out of five stars. I'm not overly obsessed with it, though. I play it only about two hours a day, which is the limit my parents set. Hala @CAPS2 is my absolute favorite game.
9	17843	7	2	"There was a time when I showed patience. I wanted a phone but knew I'd get one someday. The day finally arrived on @DATE1, my @NUM1 birthday. I was opening presents and had no idea what I'd receive. The last and biggest present was a cell phone. I called my friend on it, and she asked, ""Whose phone are you calling from?"" I replied, ""Mine."" I couldn't believe I'd been so patient for such a long time. I was overjoyed that I could maintain my patience. I didn't think someone could be so patient for so long. Once I got my phone, I wasn't patient when waiting for a text message to come back. But eventually, I got the patience to wait until I received the message. I wish I could be patient every day, but that's not possible. I'm glad I have a phone so I can call my mom after my activities and know she's on her way, and I'll be patient with her. I wonder if I could ever be more patient. Some days, I'm impatient with everything. One day, I'll teach someone to be patient with me, and I'll be happy to do that. I hope that someday and every day after that, I'll be patient with everyone. I wish everyone in the world could be patient. Will you help others be patient so they can teach someone new every day? I'll be patient or try to be and wait for the next thing to happen in life. I hope you're patient at times too. Thanks for reading about the time I was patient and when I want to be patient. I hope you enjoyed this story."
10	17844	7	2	In my opinion, patience is a state where one has to remain calm and engage in waiting. For some people, being patient is extremely difficult, but for me, it's relatively easy. Although I can be impatient at times, everyone has such moments. Being patient can be a bit nerve - wracking, but I manage. Often, I get angry if I have to be patient for too long. I believe @PERCENT1 of the world's population doesn't like being patient. However, if one is truly patient, there will be a reward. In conclusion, while it's challenging to be patient all the time, the rewards make it worthwhile, and we should all strive to be more patient in our lives.
11	17845	7	2	Life becomes significantly more challenging when one lacks patience. Let me share an instance to illustrate this. I once learned that I was going to @LOCATION1, which was exciting. However, when I asked about the mode of travel, I discovered we had to fly. At that moment, I realized I'd need to be extremely patient, and I doubted I had enough to endure the flight. Nevertheless, I managed to get through it. Upon reaching @LOCATION1, it was swelteringly hot. We had to wait outside for the bus. The heat became unbearable, and I lost all my patience. I got so angry that I felt like I was about to explode, simply because I didn't want to wait for the ride any longer. Fortunately, I regained my composure. After that, waiting became much easier, and the bus eventually arrived. I immediately felt a lot better, realizing that patience truly pays off.
12	17846	7	2	"On a pleasant sunny day, I found myself trapped in a doctor's office without air - conditioning. The doctor's office had @NUM1 chairs in its dirty waiting room. I was cramped in the room with approximately @NUM2 people for @NUM3 minutes. I tried to be patient, but my patience was wearing thin. Sweat dripped from my face onto my black @PERSON1 short - @CAPS1 shirt. I started to feel hot and angry, yet I held onto my patience. I knew that getting even angrier wouldn't help or make the time pass faster. Suddenly, there was a ""creeeeeck"" sound, and the door opened. A tall white woman with what seemed like green shrubs on her (perhaps a unique accessory) said, ""@CAPS2."" In the end, I'm glad I managed to stay patient through that uncomfortable experience."
13	17847	7	2	"On @DATE1, I had an experience that tested my patience. It was a sweltering day, and I was at @CAPS1 point with my best friend, waiting in line to ride the dragster. The line was about an hour long, and with the sun beating down on us, it felt like an eternity. Just as we were about to board the ride, we were stopped because the ride wasn't working properly. We then had to wait an additional @NUM1 minutes. Fortunately, my best friend and I had good patience, unlike some of the other people who left within the first five minutes. We persevered and finally got on the ride. It turned out to be one of the most thrilling experiences of my life. My best friend, @PERSON1, said, ""I'm so happy we waited."" Some people, like @PERSON1 and me, can be patient, while others can't, as shown by those who left. I'm really glad we waited; otherwise, we would have missed out on that amazing experience, proving that patience can lead to great rewards."
14	17849	7	2	One day, my soccer team was in the championship game, facing the Lions. At the start of the game, I was on the bench as I was the weakest player on the team. After @DATE1, our team was up by @NUM1, but the coach still kept me on the bench. I sat there and cheered for my teammates. As the next two quarters passed, the game was tied at @NUM2. Mid - way through @DATE2, our star player got injured, and the coach put me in the game. I had no idea what to do and just chased the ball around. With one minute left in the game, I was standing near their goalie. One of my teammates shot the ball, which hit my foot and redirected into the goal. Our team erupted in cheers, and we took the lead at @NUM3. When the @DATE2 minute ended and the horn sounded, everyone cheered again and lifted me up. This experience clearly shows how patience can create opportunities and lead to success.
15	17850	7	2	"This is a story about a time when I had to be patient. I was at an @LOCATION1 called ""@LOCATION1"". Here's what happened: I was standing in line to order sausages, eggs, pancakes with syrup, hash browns, and orange juice. A man with what seemed like a ""steak for his head"" (perhaps a strange - looking hat or hairstyle) walked in, ordered something, and sat down. I got a bit annoyed but still managed to be patient. Then, I got really mad because he received his food before me, even though I'd been in line first. However, I calmed down when a nice, cute girl walked in, ordered, and sat down where I was sitting. After that, an old couple who seemed full of themselves came in, ordered, and sat down. Finally, the girl and I got our food. We decided to show the old people what ""hip"" is and challenged them to a surf contest. Even though it was @NUM1 in the @TIME1, the key was to sit, wait, and be patient, and in the end, patience led to us getting our food and having an exciting challenge."
16	17851	7	2	Tick, tock, tick, tock. Patience varies among individuals; some find it effortless, while others struggle. I admit I'm not naturally patient. However, I once managed to be patient, and here's what happened. One time, my mom, my sister, and I went to the doctor because my sister had an appointment. I asked my mom how long it would take, and she said about @NUM1 minutes. I replied with an okay. When we arrived, she asked if I wanted to go inside, but I chose to wait in the car. As I sat in the car waiting, I grew bored and turned on the music. This was around @NUM2 or @NUM3 minutes in. After about @NUM4 minutes, I got tired of listening to music. I attempted to fall asleep, but that didn't work. So, I went outside to stretch because my arms and legs felt tight. Finally, at @NUM5, my mom and sister emerged. That was the one time I was patient.
17	17852	7	2	One day, @CAPS1 went to school early in the @TIME1. He approached the day as if it were any other normal day and headed to his first - class in the @NUM1 grade. He chatted with his friends throughout the class, and then it ended. Next, he went to his @NUM2 - hour science class, where there was a lab assignment with partners. @CAPS3, @CAPS1, and @PERSON2 decided to be partners. Halfway through the lab, they were at a loss. @CAPS3, @CAPS1 went up to the teacher, interrupting her while she was with another student. The teacher said she'd be with him in a moment, but he persisted in bothering her. As a result, he received a disciplinary step. Later that day, in @CAPS2, he was working on a worksheet while the teacher was conferring with the principal. He decided to wait for her to finish to avoid getting in trouble. However, it took much longer than expected. He then moved on to the next problem. When the teacher returned, he got her help. In conclusion, @PERSON1 learned two important lessons that day. Firstly, impatience can lead to trouble and disciplinary action. Secondly, being polite, courteous, and patient in class can earn a reward, such as a good citizenship grade, which @PERSON1 achieved.
18	17853	7	2	I remember once when a famous magician named @PERSON1 performed a stunt called “@CAPS1 In Time,” which required an enormous amount of patience and courage. The magician had to stay inside a block of ice for @NUM1 days or @NUM2 hours, wearing only a sweater. The ice block was open to the public. The magnificent magician later said, “I could barely hear anything.” He endured hours of waiting, a feeling like falling into an abyss or a bottomless pit. Finally, when the last seconds ticked away, the magician was free and alive, having successfully completed the challenging stunt.
19	17854	7	2	A few years ago, one day I woke up, and my mom told me we were going to my grandma's house. I started getting ready. After getting dressed, I looked on my dresser and grabbed the @MONEY2 @MONEY3 I had been saving, just in case we went to the store. When we arrived, I saw my cousin's dad, @CAPS1, walking a puppy. I approached him and asked about the dog. He said it was his brother's dog and that he was selling it. My mom said I could get a dog, so I asked how much it cost. @CAPS1 said @MONEY1. I was extremely excited because I had @MONEY2 and could get @MONEY3 from my grandma. I called my mom, but she was busy elsewhere. She told me she wanted to see the dog before I bought it. So, @CAPS1 and I waited for hours, but my mom took forever. Eventually, I got impatient and bought the dog. Fortunately, my mom wasn't mad because she ended up liking the puppy.
20	17856	7	2	Not long ago, I had two experiences that tested my patience. One day, I went to a candy store to buy a lollipop. When the man was getting it for me, he told me to wait. It took @NUM1 minutes for him to bring me my candy, but I was patient enough to wait. Another time was at the carnival. I was at the end of the line waiting to get on a ride. A man was arguing with the lifeguard instructor because he wasn't allowed on the ride. The argument lasted for half an hour. I patiently waited for him to stop without complaining or arguing about the time he was wasting. These experiences showed that I can be patient when the situation calls for it.
21	17857	7	2	One day, during volleyball try - outs, I had to exercise patience. The two coaches were tasked with selecting players for the teams, either the “A” team or the “@CAPS1” team. My friends and I waited quietly in the gym while the coaches privately informed the kids in the hallway. They had to do it privately due to the existence of the two teams. As there were about @NUM1 other girls still waiting, I decided to go last, thinking I could handle the test of patience. However, I was wrong. The anticipation of finding out was @CAPS2! Finally, it was my turn. I walked into the hall and learned that I had made the “@CAPS1” team. Even though it wasn't the “A” team, I was glad I made it. That day truly tested my patience.
22	17858	7	2	Last year at the cheer competition, I had to be extremely patient. At the start of the day, I patiently got in line to prepare for our performance. Once ready, we waited to take the stage. After our performance, we watched the other teams, and they were really good. Then our team went for lunch while some teams were still performing. We had to wait until all teams finished. Once they did, it was award time. All the squads were called to the mat. My team members and I sat patiently, eager to know if we'd won in cheer or dance. We waited and waited until finally, our name was called. We were the junior varsity cheer - leaders! We took first in dance and fourth in cheer. It was a great day for me, and being patient paid off. Sometimes, being patient can lead to good results, but you never know until it happens. This was a time when I was patient at a cheer competition.
23	17859	7	2	I'm writing about the time I was patient on my birthday. My dad took me to a @ORGANIZATION1 game in @LOCATION1, where the @LOCATION1 team played against the @LOCATION2 Nuggets. We got stuck in a huge traffic jam caused by a wreck a couple of miles ahead. Everyone was trying to reach the game before it started. The trip was about @NUM1 ½ hours long, and my dad, uncle, aunt, and I were getting frustrated with the long wait. But I managed to stay calm throughout the @NUM1 ½ - hour drive. When we reached the arena, the @LOCATION1 and @CAPS1 teams were warming up, and the game was about to begin. In the end, the @LOCATION1 team won. It was the best birthday I've ever had. Now, I doubt I could keep my cool like that again because I've become more short - tempered. I'll never forget that birthday.
24	17860	7	2	For me, being patient is extremely difficult because I'm bipolar and have severe anger issues. One experience where I had to be patient was when I lived with my foster family. They had grandkids who really annoyed me. Also, my foster family followed the @CAPS1 religion, while I'm an atheist. They constantly told me I was wrong, which made me very upset. But I kept my mouth shut and was patient, even though I hated it. Considering my anger problems, I'm really surprised I didn't lash out at them. Patience definitely requires a lot of practice, as not everyone in the world is patient. I don't like kids much, but there were tons of the foster family's grandkids where I lived. I found them annoying but had to tolerate them. “Guardian parents” are also hard to deal with as they tell you what to do even though they aren't your real parents. However, I managed to tolerate it all. This shows that patience is something that can be learned, though it's very challenging for me.
25	17861	7	2	One time I was patient was when we were going north. We had to pack, but I'd already packed the day before. While my family was still packing, I went to sit in the car since I had nothing else to do. When I went back inside, they were almost done. I went to the bathroom, and when I came out, they'd finished packing. Once we started the journey, I had to wait over @NUM1 hours to reach our destination. But when we got to Mackinoc City, we had a great time. This experience took a lot of patience, especially considering the long drive from Nbly. That day, I learned how important it is to be patient.
26	17862	7	2	Patience is of great significance, yet I find myself lacking in this virtue when dealing with patients. Whenever I wait for my turn, I often forget what I intended to say. I believe my impatience stems from my family, as they are also impatient. We tend to blurt out what we want to say before forgetting it, and we are quite forgetful, which is likely another reason for our impatience. Patience is crucial as it helps one stay calm and wait for their turn. This is all I know about patience.
27	17863	7	2	Patience is the ability to take one's time and wait without rushing or being in a hurry as if something bad has occurred. It also implies being understanding in terms of tolerance, remaining calm, composed, peaceful, and full of love. In essence, patience encompasses these qualities that allow individuals to approach situations in a more measured and equable manner.
28	17864	7	2	I recall a time when I was patient. It was when I went down the river with my dad and two sisters. The only time I can be patient is when my dad says we're going from north to @LOCATION1. Since it's a two - hour trip, I have no choice but to be patient. There's a train - track bridge about an hour's ride down the river. My dad usually stops there to take a break and have lunch. When it's just me and my dad, we take it slow all the way. This experience shows that certain circumstances can make me exercise patience.
29	17865	7	2	"Am I a patient person? Certainly not. I'm a big fan of @PERSON1 who played in a @CAPS11 called @CAPS2 that came out on @DATE1. I've been dying to @CAPS10 it. One day, sitting on my porch, I asked my mom to @CAPS19 to @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 @CAPS2 on @DATE2. When she said ""wlc"", I was extremely upset as I really wanted to @CAPS10 it. At that time, I was being very patient. I called my @CAPS4's, @CAPS5's, sisters, and brothers to accompany me, but they were all busy, so I cried myself to sleep. A few days later, my parents were talking about going to the movies and having dinner. I walked in, screaming and yelling some angry words and then left the room. The next day, my brother and his girlfriend went to @CAPS9 @CAPS10 it, knowing I wanted to. They came home teasing me about how good the @CAPS11 was. That night, I went downstairs to demand to @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS2, saying I'd been patient but they were pushing my buttons. Finally, my mom said I could @CAPS9 on @DATE2. This was the only time I was patient, and I'm really proud of myself. I can't wait to @CAPS10 my @CAPS25 @PERSON1 @CAPS26."
30	17867	7	2	"I'm definitely not a patient person. For example, I wish my birthday came at least once a month, but since I only have @NUM1 birthday a year, I have to wait. I'd like to be patient, but it seems difficult for me. My father, on the other hand, is extremely patient. When he told me to clean the car on @DATE1 and I said I hadn't done it yet, he gave me more time. If it were my kids, I'd tell them to clean it right away or they'd be grounded. I wouldn't force them, but I wouldn't wait a whole month for the car to be cleaned. I guess I could try to be as patient as my father, which would be really tough. However, if I make an effort to be ""patient"", I'm confident I can achieve it."
31	17868	7	2	Patience is defined as waiting for an event to occur while facing difficulties without complaining. My friend @PERSON2 is a patient individual, as is her brother @PERSON1. Their father has been absent for most of their lives, serving in the military to defend our country. This is the story of a time when @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 demonstrated patience. When @PERSON1 was born, his father was @NUM1 years old and had already applied to join the army. He was present for much of @PERSON1's early life. Two years later, @PERSON2, my best friend, was born. Their father stayed with them until @PERSON2 was about @NUM2 years old, but he left that year. @PERSON1 understood why his father was gone, but @PERSON2, who has severe ADHD, was about a year behind in comprehension and did not understand why she had not seen or spoken to her father for about three years. When she turned around six years old, she realized that her father was away. Around this time, @PERSON1 also joined the army, and their father was injured in the leg by a machete. When their father returned for about a year, they spent a great deal of time with him. @PERSON2 is very delicate, and when her father tried to play with her and tickle her, it hurt her, and she would scream “@CAPS3! @CAPS3!” However, he would ignore her and continue. @PERSON1 is not delicate at all. He loves his father, and so does @PERSON2, but she does not like him as a person. She prefers my father because she sees him more often and thinks he is kinder. In conclusion, I believe that @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are extremely patient because they do not know if they will ever see their father again after he boards the plane. I have asked their mother, and she says they never complain about missing their father.
32	17869	7	2	Patience is a crucial virtue. It involves being understanding and tolerant. I have shown patience on numerous occasions. For example, I wait patiently when my mother is on the phone until she finishes to talk to her. Before events such as plays or movies, one must be patient until the performance begins. I am particularly patient during tests. Patience is of great significance. For some people, a lack of patience can be annoying. If I did not have patience, I would be a completely different person. People would have a hard time getting along with me. Instead of bothering others, it is better to be patient. In conclusion, patience is an essential quality that helps in various aspects of life.
33	17870	7	2	Long ago, in the land of @LOCATION1, there was a young boy named @CAPS1. @CAPS1 aspired to become a ninja like the older boys, but he was only six years old, too young for ninja training. One day, @CAPS1 came running home, not just running but flipping and twirling like a firework. He burst through the door and said, “Mama, mama, I'm @CAPS2 old enough to be a ninja!” His mother replied, “Well, sorry, you can't. Ninja training doesn't start for another six years.” @CAPS1 asked, “Why not now? When will I be able to start?” His mother said, “The sensei is still in training, so you'll have to be patient.” @CAPS1 waited for six long years and finally @CAPS2 became a ninja. This story shows that with patience, one can achieve their goals.
34	17871	7	2	In a land called @CAPS1 bokane, there lived a young man named @PERSON2. In the land of @CAPS2, the people lived off the land and believed that everything had a spirit. When a person died, the spirit of judgment determined their next - life form. Honor was of utmost importance to the people of @CAPS2, and no one valued it more than the hunter @PERSON2. One day, @PERSON2 and his friend @PERSON1 went into the sacred forest to hunt danes, deer - like animals. As they neared the hunting grounds, they nocked their bows and climbed an ancient oak tree. They waited for several hours before spotting a dane. When they did, @PERSON1 had no arrow ready. As a result, @PERSON2 had the opportunity to kill @CAPS6. The dane stared at @PERSON2 with unblinking, dilated pupils, snorting blue mist from its nose. However, @PERSON2 did not take the shot. Instead, the dane fled into the trees. @PERSON1 whispered, “@CAPS5 did you not take the shot?” @PERSON2 simply replied, “@CAPS6 was too far away. I was not sure one arrow would kill @CAPS6 without causing pain.” The next day, they returned to the woods, and another dane appeared. This time, @PERSON1 had an arrow ready, but @PERSON2 had the right to hunt this dane as it was the same one from the previous day. The dane's rear was towards them, and it was still staring at @PERSON2. @PERSON2 stepped back. Soon, @PERSON1 took the shot, but the arrow missed and hit an ash tree. @PERSON1 whispered, “@CAPS5 did you not take the shot?” @PERSON2 whispered back, “It is not honorable to take the life of a beast with its back turned.” On the third day, the same dane came through the hunting grove. This time, it gave @PERSON2 a clear shot at its right flank. @PERSON2 took the shot, and the arrow pierced the dane's lungs and heart. @PERSON2 said, “@CAPS9 the spirit judge @CAPS10 will be pleased.” As he carried his kill from the woods, it was evident that patience had paid off. In the end, patience is more rewarding than impatience, regardless of the circumstances.
35	17872	7	2	One time, my family and I went on a fishing trip to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1. After getting on the boat, it took @NUM1 minutes to travel through the river. At @NUM2, we started waiting, trolling through the water. The boat rocked gently from side to side, like a baby in a crib. We set up all the fishing poles and lures. Around @NUM3, we got our first bite. My dad quickly rushed over to grab the pole and started reeling as fast as he could. Eventually, he caught a @ORGANIZATION1 worth @MONEY1. Then, around @NUM4, another pole got a hit. I rushed over, grabbed the pole, and began reeling. With some assistance, I managed to catch a king @ORGANIZATION1 that was @NUM5 and @NUM6 inches tall. This experience shows that it is always beneficial to be patient. You never know what you might catch if you wait patiently. In conclusion, patience can lead to unexpected rewards, especially in activities like fishing.

It was an incredibly enjoyable destination, and I was brimming with excitement, eagerly anticipating our arrival. I knew I had to exercise patience, despite my strong desire to reach the cottage quickly. I was aware that excessive complaining would lead to trouble, as I had learned from a previous experience. A couple of weeks prior, we had visited my grandma, who lived about two hours away. During that trip, I constantly complained about the long journey. As a result, when we got home that night, my phone was taken away for a week. After that incident, I resolved never to complain about long trips again. So, on our way to the cottage, I remained silent and patient. Being patient is a wise choice. If one lacks patience, long trips may not be suitable. My patience throughout the journey to the cottage pleased my mom, and it demonstrated to others that I am a tolerant person.
37	17874	7	2	One time, I went to the orthodontist's office. I had to wait in the visiting area for approximately @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes. Frankly, I didn't mind too much because I had school afterward. It was evident that I was not in a good mood, as the expected waiting time was only @NUM3 minutes. Eventually, I was allowed in and sat in the chair. They removed my rubber bands, and I had to wait another @NUM4 minutes. I remained patient because I didn't want to enter school in the middle of class, as everyone would stare at me. Finally, the doctor came to examine me. I got new - colored rubber bands, and the doctor also checked if my braces were in good condition. When I finally left the orthodontist's office, it was about @NUM5, and I was relieved to be able to go home. This experience shows that patience can help us get through an unpleasant situation.
38	17875	7	2	There was a time when my family and I were about to embark on a trip. The day before our departure, I needed to get a haircut, so I went to the barber shop. The shop was crowded, and the barber told me I was next in line. However, more people kept coming in, and he let them jump ahead of me. I simply sat there and waited patiently. After those people were done, the barber didn't call me up. Instead, he got on his phone and went outside. Then he told me to wait until he came out of the restroom. Meanwhile, five more people entered the shop. At this point, my mom called and asked if I was done. I had been there from @NUM1 to @NUM2. She suggested I go to another barber because we were about to leave for our trip. We were set to leave at @NUM3 a.m. the next morning, and I still needed to pack my stuff. This experience tested my patience, and although it was frustrating, I managed to stay calm.
39	17876	7	2	"A couple of years ago, during one @DATE1 week, my grandparents visited. We went to my mom's sister's house. My mom and aunt (my mom's sister) decided to teach me how to tie my shoes because I was about to start kindergarten, and the teacher wouldn't help with that. They promised that if I learned to tie my shoes, I could pick something from the dollar store, which really excited me. After having lunch at their place, they began teaching me. The trick they taught involved making a ""bunny"" (tree) after the first crossover step and then wrapping the other string around it (the bunny running around the tree), and then putting it through (the bunny going into its hole). After numerous attempts, I started to understand it. Later, we went back to my house, and my mom continued to assist me. Finally, one afternoon, I mastered it. My mom was very happy and kept praising me. Then we went to the store, and I picked out something. My mom had to be extremely patient with me. She didn't get angry when I made mistakes but instead kept encouraging me. Her patience was crucial in helping me learn this important skill."
40	17878	7	2	Patience is the act of consistently engaging in an activity to ensure understanding. My mother exemplifies patience. When I struggle to comprehend a problem, she explains it to me calmly, never in a rush. Unlike my father, who loses his temper easily, my mother remains composed. Whenever I fail to understand something, my father often yells and may even curse at me in Chinese. In contrast, my mother continues to explain until I grasp the concept. Some people may be impatient due to their personality traits or health issues like high blood pressure. Patience is a virtue that many people possess, yet it seems that an increasing number of individuals lack this quality. My mother's patience has a positive impact on my learning, and it serves as an example of how patience can facilitate better understanding.
41	17879	7	2	Every year, I patiently await one special day. Is it my birthday? In [Year 1], it was a special day for my mom and dad. I was [Number 2] boy my mom ever had and [Number 3] boy my dad had. I'm still waiting for my birthday to come around again.
42	17880	7	2	Swimming is incredibly enjoyable. I love the sensation of the cool water surrounding me. Patience is a crucial aspect of swimming. You need to be patient when waiting to start practice, during stretching, when waiting for instructions while learning a new stroke or a new way to turn at the wall, and so on. On the first day of the swim team this year, the coaches went over safety rules, regulations, and our plans for the year. For those of us who already knew this information, like me, it was quite challenging to be patient. However, I believe the entire team did a great job listening. Patience truly is important.
43	17881	7	2	What exactly is patience? Do any of us possess it? I think if we reflect on it, we can all be patient. Once, when I was in [Location 1], we went to [Organization 1] and didn't have to wait for any of the rides. The next time we went there, we had to be patient because the lines were extremely long. I could wait, but it seemed that many of the little kids had difficulty standing still. Another example of patience is when the miners were trapped in the mine in [Location 2] for [Number 1] days. They had to be patient and wait for someone to rescue them. They also had to be patient when ascending from the mine in that small elevator. One final example of patience is when walking in a group with others. You have to be patient, listen to their ideas, and let them contribute. These, I believe, are just some instances that illustrate why and when we need to be patient.
44	17882	7	2	The time I had to be patient was when we were going to the disco for the first time. I was extremely excited! We only had one week left to wait, but I couldn't wait that long. I thought I'd waited long enough and wanted to go right away. Even though I had to wait, I still had a great time at the disco. I just had to be patient!
45	17883	7	2	I'll write about patience in my own unique way, even though you're adults. Once upon a time, there was a little, skinny worm getting ready to transform into a moth. However, this worm had a problem: it was still too thin to change. It needed to be nice and fat, like a fat pretzel stick cut in half. It crawled from bush to bush, eating any green leaf it could find. But then another problem arose. It was approaching winter, so every leaf it found was brown and unappetizing. The grass was also changing. But it wanted to transform into a moth so badly that it had no choice but to eat the dying leaves and grass. It was very patient about it at first. But then it got tired of eating the dying leaves and grass and grew more and more impatient because it wanted to change so badly that it almost exploded. But then it woke up and saw that it was wrapped in a white silk cocoon. It wriggled out of it and realized it was a moth after all. Then it remembered eating the nice green leaves together and curled up, wanting to sleep. And that's how it had that strange dream.
46	17884	7	2	"Throughout my life, I have lived in several different places, namely @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1, @CAPS1, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS2. That amounts to @CAPS3 distinct locations. @CAPS6 has always been a significant place. Along the way in @LOCATION2, my parents got divorced. My dad moved to @CAPS5 and eventually to @PERSON2. My sister and I moved to @LOCATION1 with my mom. It was a fun time in @CAPS6 as I hadn't seen my cousin, aunt, uncle, and grandma for about six years. Also, I hadn't seen my dad in almost @NUM1 months. My grandma told me not to worry and that I'd see him soon. However, I didn't think ""soon"" meant @NUM2 months. During those @NUM2 months, we were looking for a house near a patch of woods and a fresh - water source on @DATE1. My mom even had a boyfriend, but she later broke up with him. Now, she is dating the guy from whom we are renting a house. When my dad called to say he was coming, I was extremely happy. I didn't think I could go @NUM4 months without seeing him, but I did. Now that he's settled, I see him once a month for one weekend, which is better than not seeing him for @NUM4 months or not at all."
47	17885	7	2	On the trip to @LOCATION1, it took two days to reach there. I was hungry and needed to use the bathroom. Whenever I felt hungry, I had to wait until the next stop when we got gas. I had to be patient without complaining until the gas tank was empty so that we could stop for gas and I could eat something. I also had to be patient until there was a @CAPS1 on the right - hand side or a rest area because there were vending machines and bathrooms there. We could easily get off and back on the highway from the right - hand side. Throughout the journey, patience was required.
48	17886	7	2	I have been patient on a few occasions. One instance was when I needed to use the phone, but my mom was on it. I waited for an hour and a half to use the phone. Another time, I wanted to go to @ORGANIZATION1 to get some pop. I patiently waited while my mom got everyone ready to go to @ORGANIZATION1. These experiences show that I can exercise patience when necessary.
49	17887	7	2	"It was my first real camping trip. Although we went camping when I was one, I don't remember much of it. I was extremely excited. I couldn't help but keep asking, ""Where are we going?"" My patience was lacking. While waiting for my dad to hook the camper up to his truck, I sat there bored. I kept asking when he'd be done and when we were leaving. Each time, he told me to be patient. I tried, but it didn't work well. Finally, we left. It was a one - hour drive, which felt like an eternity when I was seven. I was so bored that I kept asking my dad when we'd arrive. He always told me to be patient. Once we got to the campsite, the first thing I wanted to do was swim. While my mom was getting her swimsuit on, I was incredibly impatient. I almost knocked on the bathroom door but then remembered what I had been taught. I sat down and patiently waited for her. Through this experience, I learned an important lesson about patience. I've found that being patient makes things happen faster, and I still apply this lesson today, though everyone gets a bit impatient from time to time."
50	17888	7	2	One time when I was patient was when my siblings and I were waiting to find out if we could get our first puppy. We waited for about an hour while our parents discussed the matter. Finally, they called us down to the basement. At first, they said no, and we were heartbroken. My mom really wanted the puppy, but it was my dad's decision. Then, my sister made a face that my dad couldn't resist, and he said yes. But we had to be patient. We were going out of town in two days, so we couldn't get the puppy the next day. The next day, my dad was at work. My mom decided to surprise him by bringing the puppy home on @CAPS1. We went to the store and got the puppy, named Shaggy @CAPS2. My aunt, who lived in a different state, gave us permission to bring @CAPS1 to her house. When my dad saw us playing with @CAPS1 outside, he was surprised and overjoyed. We all fell in love with @CAPS1, and now he is our new snuggle buddy.
51	17889	7	2	You must be patient when cooking cookies as it takes a long time. You also need to be patient when waiting to play a game or sitting in the waiting room until your name is called. When you're out in a game, you have to be patient to get back in. If you hit a home - run, you need to be patient while they retrieve the ball. For example, in the game of Sorry, you must be patient to get the cards @NUM1, @NUM2. If you get a one, you can move out of the starting position, and if you get a two, you move out and get another turn. In conclusion, patience is required in various situations, whether it's in cooking or playing games.
52	17890	7	2	My sister is remarkably patient, unlike my brothers and me. When our progress reports were due, I was extremely excited to see my results, and my brothers were anxious. We constantly pestered our mom, asking when the reports would arrive and if she had received them. However, my sister remained calm and patient throughout. When the day the reports arrived, we all got nervous, except for @PERSON1. She manages to stay patient by distracting herself through sleeping or reading. When we finally opened the report cards, everyone was happy, including @CAPS1, as we all got good grades. After this experience, my brothers and I learned from my sister, and now we all have developed patience. In summary, observing my sister's patience during this event has positively influenced our own behavior.
53	17891	7	2	Approximately one [unit of time] after I got my iPod Touch, I really wanted to watch a particular movie, which was I @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I had seen it once on my cousin's iPod, and it was so thrilling that I had to watch it again. The movie was filled with action and featured zombie attacks, along with multiple words @CAPS3. In conclusion, the excitement and action in the movie made me eager to watch it again on my own device.
54	17892	7	2	"As I prepared to do a back walkover by myself for the first time, I told myself, ""I know I can."" I bent backward, tried to kick over, and fell! Frustrated, I stood up and asked my coach, @PERSON1, ""@CAPS1 my shoulders right?"" The coach replied, ""@CAPS2 @CAPS1 your shoulder for the kick - over."" I said, ""@CAPS3 got it."" I bent backward again, slowly raised my left leg, pushed my shoulders forward, and finally did the back walkover by myself! Later that night, I showed my mom. I repeated the same steps as at practice and did it again at home. The look of pride on my mom's face was priceless. She ran over, gave me a high - five and a big hug. I thanked her for being patient, and she said, ""@CAPS5 for you baby."" In conclusion, with the help and patience of my coach and mom, I was able to achieve this new skill."
55	17893	7	2	@NUM1 years ago on my birthday, the only thing I desired was an iPad Touch. When everyone arrived at the party, we ate cake and ice cream. Then I opened the presents. I received @NUM2 presents, but none of them was the @CAPS1 Touch. I was disappointed. Then I opened the birthday cards and found @MONEY1. I told my mom that since I didn't get the @CAPS1, I could go buy it. However, I had to wait until everyone left. After @NUM3 hours of being patient, I finally went and bought it. In conclusion, patience paid off as I was able to get the gift I really wanted.
56	17894	7	2	One instance when I demonstrated patience was when my little brother kept annoying me. He engaged in silly actions like pulling down the curtains or playing with the stove. I was extremely tempted to hit him, but I refrained because I knew he was just being mischievous. This experience taught me the importance of controlling my impulses and being patient with those around me.
57	17896	7	2	I've shown patience on numerous occasions at @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS3, @CAPS1, @CAPS3's sister, brother, mom, and dad, along with me, all had to wait for @ORGANIZATION1 to prepare the shots for @CAPS3's brother, sister, and me. It took about two hours for the organization to get the shots ready. Another time, @CAPS3's dad and I waited for one to two hours so I could sign up for football. We had to wait for weighing, getting the right - sized helmet and pads, and for @CAPS3's pad punts and mouth guard. Once, we waited a long time because @CAPS3's mom bought @CAPS3's dad a @NUM1 gun, and @CAPS3's dad had to register it in his name. For basketball sign - up when I lived in @CAPS3 Pleasant, it took a long time as we had to put @CAPS3's number and last name on my @PERSON3 - sized shirt and get @CAPS3 - sized basketball shorts. When I played soccer for the @PERSON4 soccer team, it took an hour because many kids, including @CAPS5, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @CAPS6, and I, wanted to play. When @CAPS3's mom took me to sign up that year, it took almost three hours to sign up and get pictures taken. Every school day, @CAPS3's friends and I wait for twenty to thirty minutes to get lunch or snacks like crackers, zebra cakes, or granola bars. It takes a long time before we can go outside to play football, soccer, volleyball, and kickball. In conclusion, I've had to be patient in various situations related to activities and sign - ups.
58	17897	7	2	I showed patience when my mom was giving birth to my baby brother. My sister and I sat in the waiting room for @NUM1 hours. I slept @NUM2 times because I was so tired. My dad got @CAPS1 food as he was hungry. In the first hour, I was excited and couldn't wait. In the second hour, I colored with the crayons and paper the nurse brought. I watched TV in the third hour. In the fourth hour, I slept until about @TIME1, as my sister told me. Then my dad came out wearing a plastic - looking dress, a matching head/ shower cover, and slippers. He said that the next time he came out, my sister and I would be sisters to a baby boy. An hour later, he came out and asked if we wanted to see @PERSON1. We screamed yes. When we saw the baby, we were overjoyed, thinking he was all ours. This experience made me realize that patience can lead to wonderful moments.
59	17898	7	2	If you could ask for one thing, would it be patience or motivation? In my case, I'd choose patience. I recall when I was about four or five years old. My two sisters and I boarded a @CAPS1 to Florida. It felt like we sat on the @CAPS1 for hours before it took off. After about ten minutes, I asked if we'd be there soon. My sister said no, as we'd only been in the air for ten minutes. I watched the other passengers; some were on laptops and listening to @CAPS2 players. I wondered how my sister could be so patient. When I asked if we were almost there a second time, she didn't answer. I sat there with nothing to do and no way to entertain myself. I didn't say a word for two hours and eventually fell asleep. Looking back, I'm still not extremely patient, but I'm more patient than I was then. So, I think patience is something that can be developed over time.
60	17899	7	2	"@CAPS1! Look out!"" @CAPS2 shrieked. The deafening sound of crunching metal filled the air. There was no escape. My eyes, though wide open, felt like they were sealed shut. The eerie silence that followed was terrifying. I felt arms grab me and pull me to what they considered safety, but it was just the start of a living nightmare. What I saw was a gruesome sight: @CAPS3 cars, twisted, tangled, and smashed so tightly together that they seemed like one mass. Beside me lay a small boy, my brother @ORGANIZATION1. His chest rose slowly, accompanied by excruciating sounds, and blood trickled from his many cuts. It was unbearable to watch. The wailing sirens of ambulances grew louder as they approached. I hadn't seen my father yet, and that scared me the most. I still have nightmares about that night, the night everything changed. I lost my father and brother, and in a way, I lost my mother too. @CAPS5 would never understand the pain of watching your little brother die because of something you wanted. If I hadn't made my father turn around to get my forgotten notebook, I'd still have my @CAPS1 and little @ORGANIZATION1. Since the funeral, my mother and I have been growing apart. We fight constantly and don't listen to each other. Sometimes, the silence between us is scarier than the shouting. My mother is now trying to understand me. She said, ""I know I haven't been patient with you lately, and I'm sorry. I'll try to be patient starting now. I just want to know why you blame yourself."" I told her, ""I made @CAPS1 turn around to get my stupid notebook."" A tear rolled down my face. She said, ""That's not your fault! You had no idea it would end like this."" I was annoyed but didn't snap at her as she was trying to help. I regained my composure and said, ""That's how I feel."" She hugged me tightly, like she used to when I was four and broke my leg. With time and patience, our relationship has started to heal, and we've developed a healthier bond."
61	17900	7	2	One time, during a certain period (@TIME1), my little brother had just finished eating and wanted to play his @CAPS1. However, he faced difficulties turning it on. The root of the problem was that some of his games were scratched. It took me a while to get used to the situation. The next day, we bought him a bunch of brand - new games. But even when he tried these new games, it still didn't work. He then asked me for help, and I assisted him, yet it remained non - functional. Eventually, I cleared up the play station. We had to wait patiently, and as we did, my little brother and I kept chanting “work, work, work, work”. Finally, it turned on. To this day, we still say that phrase whenever we want the @CAPS1 to work.
62	17901	7	2	I showed patience when I had to babysit. I rocked the baby, played with him, fed him, and took him for a walk. He fell asleep, but my mom still wasn't home from work. I was going to be late for the movies with my cousins. I played the @CAPS1 game for a bit, then looked out the window, went outside, and sat on the steps. My cousins were outside and asked me to stay a little longer. Just then, my mom arrived, and I was finally able to go.
63	17902	7	2	There have been numerous instances where I've demonstrated patience, and here are a few examples. One late afternoon, my family and I were supposed to attend a significant function. As usual, I was indecisive about what to wear. After about an hour, I found an appropriate outfit and went downstairs. To my dismay, no one else was ready, and we only had an hour and a half (@NUM1 1/@NUM1) left. Frustrated, I told everyone to get ready, but they ignored me. When I was about to take a shower, my mom came and said I had to wait as she needed to shower first. One by one, everyone took a shower except me. I was losing my patience but refrained from causing a commotion. Eventually, I got to take my shower. We all got dressed and were ready to go. At the last minute, when we were in the car, my sister realized she'd forgotten her bag and jacket, so we had to wait for her. We finally made it to the party, albeit late. In conclusion, I showed patience when waiting to take a shower and when waiting for my sister to retrieve her belongings.
64	17903	7	2	I was patient when waiting for my mom to have her @CAPS2. She was being difficult and mean to me. I thought to myself that she needed to have the @CAPS2 so that all this unpleasantness could end. This was when she was only @NUM1 months pregnant, so I knew I had to be extremely patient until the @NUM2 months were over.
65	17904	7	2	One day, during a baseball - related event, @CAPS1 was involved in signing up for something related to baseball, like a speech or a trophy - related activity. Her friend @CAPS2 walked out of the room because he lacked patience. When he came back in, the sign - up process had already passed. After the conference, @CAPS2 had to talk to some people to sign up, and he also had to endure a scolding from his dad. When it came to playing baseball, @CAPS2 quit. He was at the bottom of the batting lineup and only played in the outfield. When someone hit a home - run over his head, he dropped his mitt and walked off the field. His lack of patience led to his early exit from the baseball activity.
66	17905	7	2	I was patient when I wanted my thought @NUM1, and I had to wait until my birthday to get it. I was patient to obtain my new phone, but I had to behave well at school, which was difficult for me because I used to always be misbehaved and do such things. I used to desire everything, yet I had to be patient and always be good to acquire it.
67	17906	7	2	"@CAPS1 Patient!"" @CAPS10 shouted as I was nearly jumping out of my skin waiting for @CAPS2's friend to arrive at @CAPS2's house. ""I get it. I just can't wait! It's @CAPS2's first time. What do you expect!"" I told @CAPS2 and @CAPS10. DING! The doorbell rang, and I dashed to the door. ""@CAPS5!"" ""@CAPS6!"" @CAPS5 exclaimed. ""@CAPS8, you guys need to go wait in the garage for @CAPS18 @CAPS9,"" @CAPS10 said. ""@CAPS11!"" we replied in unison. We went outside, and it was pitch - black. ""I can't see. Hold me!"" I shrieked in fear. All we saw were headlights, and we knew it was @CAPS2's @CAPS18 @CAPS9. ""Are you guys ready? It's almost @CAPS13 @CAPS14, and we gotta leave or we won't make it to @CAPS15 @CAPS16!"" @CAPS2's @CAPS18 @CAPS9 was excited. Just hearing the word, @CAPS15 @CAPS21 was the key to getting there. The @CAPS23 thing was great, but at @CAPS15 @CAPS16, you've got to have a lot of @CAPS21."
68	17908	7	2	One of the most effective ways for an individual to exercise patience is when being hunted in a paintball game. I once had such an experience, and I sincerely hope it never repeats. I was playing paintball with many of my friends. Had I not been patient, I would have likely been shot in the head with paint. I was in a small forest, breathing heavily after a close - call encounter, and I took cover behind a very thin tree. I had eliminated all opponents except one. My breathing quickened as he was right beside the tree I was leaning against. I realized that if I stayed put, I might as well sacrifice myself, so I climbed up the tree. Fortunately, I was wearing a camouflage shirt; otherwise, I would have been an easy target. I nestled deep in the tree, but it hardly mattered as I was too heavy for the branches. I fell out of the tree, but as I was falling, I managed to shoot the enemy in the leg. I emerged victorious! This is a testament to how patience can bring rewards.
69	17909	7	2	A few years ago, I was patient with my brother @PERSON1. It was nearly his birthday, and he was extremely excited. He was eager because he wanted a flying toy helicopter he had seen on TV. The helicopter was quite expensive, and I wasn't sure if he would receive it as a birthday gift. He kept pestering me to tell him if he was getting it. I was so annoyed that I wanted to yell at him or hit him. However, I refrained because I knew I'd get in trouble. So, I came up with a game to play with him in the hopes that he'd forget about the helicopter and stop asking. It didn't work, as he continued to inquire. Then I created another game where you jump on the trampoline and spin your arms like a helicopter without falling. Finally, he stopped asking about the helicopter. After we ate cake, we actually had to remind him of it. When he opened his presents, he did get the helicopter. We spent the rest of the day trying to make it fly.
70	17910	7	2	One night after cheerleading practice, I came home starving, and dinner wasn't even on the grill yet. We were having steak, brown rice, and mac and cheese. To pass the time, I went upstairs to take a shower. It took me ten minutes, and the food still wasn't ready. So, I did some homework, including math, reading, and studying for a test. The mac and cheese was ready, the steak was almost done, but the brown rice was nowhere near being cooked. I was so hungry and tired, but I remained patient. Oh, the food smelled so delicious! I was so eager to eat right away that I had to chew gum to keep my mouth occupied. Two minutes later, the steak and mac and cheese were ready, but we were still waiting for the brown rice. My sister and I set the table and poured our drinks, and I still held my patience. Five minutes later, the food was finally ready. All four of us sat down at the dinner table and ate. Oh my goodness, it was so yummy! I had two small pieces of steak, three scoops of rice (I love rice), and a tiny piece of mac and cheese. The dinner was amazing. After that delicious meal, I went straight to bed.
71	17911	7	2	One time, I went on a trip to @LOCATION1 with my dad. We took a train first. I didn't have my game or music player, and the journey seemed to last forever. But I didn't complain and just sat patiently in my seat. After getting off the train, we took a bus to the Museum of Science and History. The bus stopped frequently, but we finally arrived. The museum was amazing, with tons of interesting things like an exhibit that made tops or @CAPS3. Then we visited the history section. Dad wanted to see everything, and it was like the long train ride all over again. After that, we took the bus back to the train. This time, I had a top, but it got boring. Still, I didn't complain. Dad said the trip had been long and that I could bring my own entertainment next time. This experience shows my patience.
72	17912	7	2	I wish I could say I found her right away, but I didn't. It took @ORGANIZATION1 and all the other @CAPS1 (with @CAPS2 intelligence) for me to figure it out. Love is patient. If you rush to it, it probably won't stay, but if you wait patiently, maybe it'll come to you. I just have to make sure I'm somewhere she can find me, I said in the church. @NUM1 year later, @CAPS4 said, “@CAPS3 what's this?” and asked if they could shut the door for the night. @CAPS5 @PERSON1. @CAPS8 replied, “Patience, @PERSON1. We're waiting for @CAPS7.” Then someone said, “@CAPS3 here he comes now.” @CAPS11 said they found something in the church. @CAPS4 said they found the @CAPS1 and that they were waiting for it to unlock. They wondered when it would open and said they'd have to wait and see, if it would open at all. This shows the importance of patience in waiting for things to unfold.
73	17913	7	2	One day, my friend @PERSON1 came to my house, and we played Halo. We had a great time, eating popcorn, drinking a lot of soda, and having lots of candy. Then @PERSON1 went to the bathroom. He was in there for a while, and suddenly I needed to use the bathroom too. I waited and waited, and I really had to go. But I was polite and patient. I didn't yell at him or knock on the door to tell him to hurry up. I only asked him once if he was okay, and he said yes. After that, I just waited. Finally, he came out, and then @CAPS1 a very big relief. This shows that I can be patient even in uncomfortable situations.
74	17914	7	2	When you hear the word “patience,” what comes to mind? When I was young, I thought it was impossible to have patience. However, after I severely injured my ankle and had to wear a cast and use crutches for four months, I truly learned what it means. My mom always said, “Patience is a virtue.” Have you ever wondered what it takes to be patient? It's essentially the ability to control yourself. You need to be able to endure tough situations while maintaining self - control, especially when people annoy you or things take a long time. This experience taught me the importance of patience.
75	17915	7	2	We went to the doctor's office, and there were a lot of people. So, my parents, my sister, and I decided to stay and wait. My sister and I wanted to go outside and play, but our parents said no. Instead, we watched TV while my mom read a magazine and my dad read a newspaper. Finally, when there were only a few people left, the doctor called my sister's and my names. My parents went with us so that my sister wouldn't be scared. The doctor just did some check - ups. After that, my dad paid the bill, and we went home. This is how we showed patience during the visit to the doctor's.
76	17916	7	2	One day, I had to queue for @NUM1 hours to board a roller - coaster. It was extremely hot, but I remained very patient. Eventually, I ended up standing with my eyes open while falling asleep. My mom also had to be patient when we were stuck in traffic on our way to the camping grounds. We spent @NUM2 hours trying to get out of the traffic jam, yet mom didn't panic at all. Despite the long waits, we managed to persevere through these situations.
77	17917	7	2	One time, there was a boy at the front of the lunch line. He was about to enter the lunch area, but since he wasn't fully within the line, he was sent to the back. He got angry but remained patient and went to the back. In the end, he found himself at the front of the line again. I believe that patience means staying calm and not rushing things. When you do so, you'll find yourself next in line, just like that boy.
78	17918	7	2	Patience involves waiting for something over an extended period. It is beneficial to have patience, and I can share an instance when I demonstrated it. Last year on @DATE1, after school, my dad and I went deer - hunting in @CAPS1. We found a homeguard's blind, and my dad sat in a chair, waiting for a deer to appear. Hunting requires patience. Initially, we saw nothing, but then a deer came along. My dad got ready, told me to cover my ears, and fired. However, we didn't see any deer blood, so he must have missed. After that, we packed up and went home. Although we didn't get a deer, I showed patience during that hunting trip.
79	17919	7	2	I showed patience when I broke my foot. It was @DATE1, and I was at the park. I was climbing a pole to ring the bell when I slipped. My little brother ran over, and I told him to get help. Since he had no idea where to go, I lay on the ground with a broken foot for over @NUM1. When he returned and asked where to go, I told him to go to the gas - station across the street and ask to use the telephone. I tried to be patient. When he came back with my mom, my mom said I was really patient. She picked me up, and we drove to the emergency room. The place was crowded. They got us in as soon as possible, but it seemed like a long time to me. When my name was called, my mom carried me to the doctor. The doctor asked what happened, and we told him. He examined my foot, and after ten minutes, he came back with the x - rays and announced that my foot was broken. He gave me a cast and crutches, and then we left. I thanked my brother with a big hug. The next day, my schoolmates said I was brave and patient, and I thanked them.
80	17920	7	2	"One time, I showed patience while at @LOCATION1, waiting to get on a ride called ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 parents @CAPS3."" There was a @CAPS5 long line, and usually, I'd be saying ""@CAPS6 on!"" or ""@CAPS7's go!"" But this time, I was extremely patient in the line. I was proud of myself, and so was my mom. This was a memorable instance when I managed to control my impatience and stay calm."
81	17921	7	2	One time, I had to show patience at the doctor's office. My appointment was at 2 o'clock, but I had to wait and wait. I sat there until it was [NUM1], and they finally called me in. Once inside, I had to wait again. It was extremely difficult for me to be patient because I can't even sit still for [NUM2] minutes. The tick - tock sound of the clock was driving me crazy. However, I managed to stay calm and not complain, just sitting there and looking at the [CAPS1] magazines. It was hard to believe I could be so patient, but I did it. This experience taught me that while being patient is sometimes very challenging, it's possible to achieve.
82	17922	7	2	One time, I went on a 22 - hour car ride to Florida with my cousin, two sisters, and parents. It was a long and boring journey. I sat in the back with my sister, and we kept arguing over foot space. After about five hours, I started feeling cramped. We stopped for dinner and then continued on the road. When night fell, the road froze, so we stopped and slept in the car. We woke up at sunrise and went to Cracker Barrel for breakfast. The breakfast was delicious. After that, we got back in the car and drove the rest of the way to Florida. It might have been a long drive, but it was definitely worth it as it created a memorable family trip.
83	17923	7	2	Some people claim that if someone is trying to annoy you and you remain patient, they'll stop. But from my experience, that's not always true. One day, my brother was downloading new ringtones. It didn't seem like a big deal until he downloaded the mosquito tone. This is a loud, high - pitched noise that only people under a certain age can hear. It's fun for the person playing it, but it really hurts the ears and gives you a headache. My brother, being a jerk, decided to follow me around and play it as loud as possible. It was unbearable; it made my blood boil. After 30 minutes, I called someone, but it didn't help. When I started listening to music, he turned up the mosquito tone. Then I had a great idea: I stole his battery. The next day, I made a deal with him. If he stopped playing the ringtone, I'd give him back his battery. Of course, he agreed, and I didn't have to hear that tone anymore. This shows that sometimes, patience just isn't enough.
84	17924	7	2	"I was patient for a whole [DATE1] because [CAPS2] mother promised to buy me a brand - new Wii video game system. I was immediately interested in the Wii when I first saw it. It had advanced graphics and was really impressive. I told [CAPS2] mother about it right away, and she said, ""[CAPS1], I'll buy it for you since your report card was excellent."" I was so excited and started expecting to get it within [CAPS6] weeks. But then [CAPS2] mother said I'd get it between one and [CAPS6] months. I was shocked and disappointed. [CAPS2] mother explained that there were more important things to consider. So began the longest period of waiting in my life. After about one and a half months, [CAPS2] mother finally said, ""[CAPS9] are going to [CAPS10] today to buy your Wii."" I was overjoyed. When we pulled up to my favorite video game store, I was so excited I couldn't sit still. When we got home, I played until [TIME1]. This experience taught me that patience pays off."
85	17926	7	2	Patience is really hard for me as I have very little of it. So, going to Disneyland was a huge test. The drive there was long and horrible. It felt like we were in the car forever. I tried my best to be patient and didn't complain at all. When we arrived at Disneyland on the first day, the lines were terrible. Some waits were up to [NUM1] hours long. My little brother wanted to go on all the kid rides with huge lines, but I held my patience so as not to upset anyone. At dinner, I was on the verge of exploding. It was at a seafood restaurant, and I hate seafood. It took an hour to get our meals, but I still kept my cool. Waiting for the Disney buses to go back to the hotel was also a pain. My parents were very proud of me for being patient throughout all the waiting. I learned two important things. First, Disneyland isn't a good place for impatient people like me. Second, patience is one of the hardest things in life, but many of the best things require it. So, this was the [NUM2] time I had to be really patient, and I realized that having patience is a good thing.
86	17927	7	2	The seconds on my watch ticked by as I continued waiting. It was the fifteenth of October, and people were coming in and out of the area, some with presents and boxes, giving out tree - shaped candies. The coat changes didn't attract a large crowd. At the apartment, I went to the window and listened to the ride outside like a loud, unreliable vehicle. The fastest thing that happened was losing my bag. Eventually, I went back to the airport and then headed home. Throughout this, I was patient. I realized what patience truly meant during this entire experience.
87	17928	7	2	One day, I went to a concert at @ORGANIZATION1. There was a very long line. While waiting in the line, there was a girl who had no patience because we had to wait for @NUM1 1/@NUM1 hours. After that time passed, we all went to get our spots, but there was another long line, even longer than the first one. However, I was patient. This patience reminded me of when my mom went to the doctor's office for @NUM3 hours and I had to wait in the waiting room. Also, one time in the living room, my mom started talking on the phone. She told me to hold on, but my sister kept interrupting her. I told my sister to hold on and let mom finish. She ran up the stairs and called me a stupid punk, but I didn't care. In conclusion, these experiences taught me the value of patience.
88	17930	7	2	I recall a time when I had to be patient with my parents. It began when I saw a game I wanted at the store. I politely asked my dad to buy it for me, and he said he'd get it the following weekend. So, I had to patiently wait for the weekend. I was so excited about getting the new game that I mentioned it often, forgetting my dad's request not to tell my mom. When the weekend finally arrived, I asked my dad if he was ready to go, but he said no. When I asked why, he said it was because I hadn't kept quiet, and my mom didn't want me to have the game at that moment. Of course, I was angry because my mom always has something to say when I get a game. Just then, my dad entered the room and said maybe tomorrow, which was @DATE1. He said I could borrow money from my grandma and get the game then. That's exactly what I did, and I got my game. Later, my dad repaid my grandma, and we were all happy. In the end, it took a great deal of patience to get my reward.
89	17931	7	2	Being patient as a kid is never easy. I think being patient is like taking a lollipop from a baby—it's just not pleasant. But one time, I really had to exercise my patience. It was at Kings' Island. We waited in line for @NUM1 hours just to go on a ride. Then, it stopped working. We waited about another @NUM2 minutes, maybe @NUM3 minutes, and finally, it started working again. Many people left, which was good because the line got shorter, but it still seemed like it would be a long wait. It was nice when we got into the building as it was air - conditioned. We sat around, debating whether to stay or leave. In the end, we decided to stay and waited what seemed like an eternity. Finally, we stepped into the ride. There was another room we had to pass through to reach the actual ride. At last, the wait was over! Using my patience and waiting in line for so long really paid off in the end. It was an amazing ride.
90	17932	7	2	" @PERSON1, this is so boring! I want to try my backflip!"" I complained. ""@CAPS1, you're not ready yet. Just wait. If you wait and practice more, it'll be easier,"" @PERSON1 said as she watched one of the other gymnasts do a back - hard - spring. We'd been working on back - hard - springs for weeks, and I was the best in the class at them. We had to wait another two weeks to start on backflips, but I was eager to try. I rolled my eyes at @ORGANIZATION1's response and kept practicing my back - hard - springs. I was doing them down the wedge and adding little rolls for fun in the middle. When someone called @PERSON1 and she left the gym to talk, I thought just because she was my coach, she shouldn't dictate when I could do a backflip. I really wanted to try, and with her out of the room, it was my chance. I took a deep breath and attempted a backflip. As I was in the air, I realized I didn't know how to land it, and I landed on my ankle. ""@CAPS2!"" I shouted. I tried to stand but couldn't because my ankle hurt terribly. @PERSON1 ran in as I fell. ""@CAPS3 happened?"" ""I tried my backflip.""  ""I told you not to! If you'd been patient and waited for me to show you, this wouldn't have happened!""  ""@CAPS4…"" ""I'll go get an ice pack."" Since that day, I've had ankle problems. If I'd been patient, I wouldn't have gotten hurt and could still be doing gymnastics. From then on, I've learned that being patient is the right thing to do."
91	17933	7	2	One instance when I demonstrated patience was during a visit to the doctor for a check - up. My dad and I waited in the lobby for quite some time. Eventually, everyone went in for their appointments. I was extremely restless, but my dad insisted I stay, so I remained silent. Though I desperately wanted to voice my frustration, I held my tongue. Finally, when we were called in, I was overjoyed, feeling like the happiest person on earth. That concludes my story about patience.
92	17935	7	2	There was a time when my mom took my older sisters and me shopping while my dad was at work. It was a dull experience, yet the store was somewhat crowded. The store had a separation, with boys' clothes on one side and girls' on the other. One store only sold girl's clothes, which I disliked. However, I remained silent. Due to my patience, my mom asked me where I wanted to go. I said Best Buy, and I got a college football game. Having patience can yield rewards in the end, and it's important to be patient wherever you are.
93	17936	7	2	I am a patient person as I often have to wait for things or earn them. I go on outings with my parents, but I have to wait. I also have to wait to visit my aunt. The most difficult waiting time is when going to @CAPS1/a up @LOCATION1 for camping. In general, patience is a virtue that I constantly practice in these various situations.
94	17937	7	2	I've had several experiences where I showed patience. One time, I patiently waited at the doctor's and had a great time. Another instance was at the dentist. The third time, I was patient while going to @ORGANIZATION1; though the wait was boring, I endured it. Lastly, I patiently queued up for the Tower of Terror, which was the most fun ride there. Patience in these situations made these experiences possible and enjoyable.
95	17938	7	2	"Patience is crucial in life. When one lacks patience, things often go awry. For example, in a long - line situation where talking is prohibited, an impatient person might say ""@CAPS1 my gosh this is taking forever"" and get into trouble. If you're sick and there's a long line at the doctor's office, impatience could lead you to leave, causing your condition to worsen. Also, when shopping for shoes, if the cash register malfunctions and you're impatient, you might leave without getting the shoes you like. In contrast, having patience can prevent such negative outcomes. Clearly, patience is a valuable trait, and lacking it can lead to unfavorable results."
96	17939	7	2	"I sat there, gazing into the distance, awaiting an event. I casually reclined in my chair and tilted my head towards the ceiling. I made every effort to clear my mind and remain patient. However, when I opened my eyes, I found myself standing in a queue at @ORGANIZATION1 for a cellar paint - related ride. The sounds of numerous people filled my ears, a mix of laughter, happiness, and an undercurrent of excitement that hinted at danger. The estimated wait time for the line was two hours, yet my friend @PERSON1 and I were eager to take the ride. We looked up at the roller - coaster as the sun beat down, seemingly taunting us. ""Why is this taking so long?!"" I exclaimed impatiently. ""@CAPS2, next time we should come during the week. Do you want to leave?"" ""@CAPS3."" I struggled with myself to be patient for the ride. The line inched forward slowly. Beads of sweat formed on my forehead. Determined to stay patient, I took out my music player and focused on the music. I became more willing to wait. Before I realized it, people were shouting at us to move forward. Embarrassed, I quickly stuffed my music player into my pocket. The line had moved a significant distance. After about an hour and forty minutes, we reached the boarding area. I was proud of my patience. We looked at the ride and boarded it. Truly, patience pays off. I learned that patience is essential in all aspects of life."
97	17940	7	2	I am always patient when I hunt and fish. Whenever I go hunting, I find a spot and either set up or climb into a tree. I wait for a long time for deer, turkey, and @CAPS1. Sometimes, I don't see any game at all. The key to a successful hunt is to go out early and be patient. Most of the time, during deer season, I usually see @NUM1 deer when I go out. The reason I see them so often is that I exercise a great deal of patience. In conclusion, patience is the cornerstone of a rewarding hunting and fishing experience.
98	17941	7	2	"One time I had to be patient was when I was waiting for my fitted, mirror, league hats to arrive in the mail. I was told it would only take @NUM1 days, so I thought, ""Okay, that's not too long."" As the days passed, the day when the hats were supposed to come arrived. When the mail truck came, I was extremely excited. But there was only a box for my mom. ""@CAPS1,"" I said. I was really disappointed, but I told myself they would come the next day. However, they didn't. I remained patient, though I was close to losing it. After two more days, I just gave up. Then, one day when I got home from my friend's house, there they were. Yes, finally, all my patience had paid off. This experience taught me the value of being patient."
99	17942	7	2	A moment when I demonstrated patience was when the most anticipated event of the year, the @ORGANIZATION1, drew near. I had patiently waited all year, counting down the days until @DATE1. Schoolwork, including reading books and doing homework, was almost finished for another year. The air was thick with tension as everyone watched the clock tick on the last day of @ORGANIZATION1 at school. As the hours, seconds, @CAPS1, and @ORGANIZATION2 passed, everyone grew restless. But I remained patient. I sat quietly, waited calmly, listened intently, and read books. Nothing could compare to the final moment when the bell rang and the students cheered. There was a smile on every face as they left the school door for the last time that year. This experience showed me that patience can lead to the enjoyment of long - awaited moments.
100	17943	7	2	Some years ago, I had to be patient to get my first phone. It was a brand - new phone that had just come out, and I was determined to have it. I did a lot of chores around the house and at school. My mom said I could get it the next week. I was so excited, but then she said it would be next week on @DATE1. I just kept doing what I was supposed to do. On @DATE1, I got in trouble, but I still got paid for my housework. I also helped the neighbors and earned some more money. Finally, I got the phone. It took a long time, but it was worth it. This is my story of patience, which taught me that with patience and hard work, we can achieve our goals.
101	17944	7	2	One day, Alex was bothering me. Initially, I decided to be patient. However, he continued his annoying behavior incessantly. Eventually, I told him to shut up. But he ignored me. I then informed @PERSON2 that Alex still hadn't stopped. I remained silent and tried to be patient with Alex, who talks a lot, and @PERSON1. Fortunately, my patience paid off, and Alex finally stopped, which made me happy. But he started again, so I warned him that I'd tell the teacher if he didn't stop. He just shrugged and kept making stupid noises. I then told the teacher, and the teacher told Alex to stop immediately. Alex then began fidgeting with his pencil on his paper. In the end, I learned that sometimes it takes firm action to get someone to stop their annoying behavior.
102	17945	7	2	A @DATE2 ago, my @CAPS1 was admitted to the @ORGANIZATION1 because the incision from a previous operation had opened. Due to the emotional turmoil during @DATE2, I've missed three days of @DATE1 and one day of @DATE2 school as I was visiting her. Now that I'm back, I'm trying to catch up on all my classes. So far, I've managed to catch up in @CAPS2 and social @CAPS3, but I still need to catch up in other subjects. Although students are only allowed one day to make up for each day they're absent, my teachers have been extremely patient and helpful. They're willing to delay grading me until I catch up in their classes. I believe I'll be able to catch up with their support.
103	17946	7	2	"I'm writing about a time when I had to be patient. I'm not naturally a patient person. One time, my mother forced me to be patient. We were waiting for the bus, and I was extremely angry because it seemed to take forever to arrive. My mother told me, ""@CAPS2, stop complaining and be patient! @CAPS1, I'm serious!"" As soon as I sat down, the bus arrived. This experience taught me that sometimes, patience is the key, even when it's difficult."
104	17947	7	2	“@CAPS1 @CAPS8! Really?” It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 at @LOCATION1 Pritz. The forecast was @CAPS8, @CAPS8, and @CAPS1 @CAPS8. The Tigers were playing the “@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.” @PERSON1 was pitching for the @CAPS4, and Justin @CAPS6 was pitching for the Tigers. My family - my dad, mom, brother, and I - were sitting just two rows from the front. In the bottom of the first inning, I felt a huge drop of @CAPS8 hit my head, followed by more drops. My dad yelled, “@CAPS7, go upstairs for shelter!” As soon as we reached the shelter area, it started pouring. The players went into the dugouts. My mom called my grandpa to check the forecast. “@CAPS8,” @CAPS9 said. My mom took off her sweatshirt and gave it to me and my brother, saying, “It's going to be a long @TIME1, so rest up now.” At first, I didn't understand, but after she explained, I realized it would indeed be a long wait. At that time, I was only @NUM1 or @NUM2, and waiting wasn't my thing. An hour passed, and it was still raining. Then @NUM3 hours, @NUM4 hours, and finally 41/@NUM3 hours passed. It was @NUM6 at @TIME1, and the game still hadn't started. My mom called my grandpa again, and @CAPS9 said there was still another good hour of @CAPS8 left. We sat there for what seemed like forever, and we were all so bored. But my mom said patience would pay off. @NUM7 ½ hours later, the weather cleared up. They wiped down the seats, and we were ready to watch the game at @NUM8 am. My dad bought us all ice cream for being so patient. The game ended at @NUM9, but we only stayed until @NUM4.00 because of the drive. In the end, I learned that patience truly pays off as I got to see an awesome baseball game and enjoy some ice cream.
105	17949	7	2	Patience means being quiet while waiting in line, waiting to do something, or waiting to go somewhere. It involves not getting restless, like pacing the wall or going crazy while waiting. For example, waiting to get a game or waiting for a ticket to see a movie are situations where one can practice patience. One day, I was waiting in line to get a game. It took a very long time, but I stayed in line and exercised patience. In life, there are many such situations where patience is required, and by being patient, we can avoid unnecessary stress and achieve our goals.
106	17950	7	2	Patience is often difficult to maintain, yet I recall a specific instance when I managed to be patient. It was in @CITY1. My group and I had to wait for everyone to return to the bus. We were the first ones to reach the bus, so it took some time for the others to arrive. Before they did, I remained as calm and patient as possible. In the end, everyone got on the bus, and that experience showed me that I could be patient when necessary.
107	17951	7	2	One time I demonstrated patience was while I was skating. I was waiting for my mother to pick me up from @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I told my friends that they'd need a ride. Unfortunately, I made a mistake and informed my mother of the wrong time. The actual time was @NUM1, but I told her @NUM2, so I had to wait a full @NUM3 hour. Despite the long wait, I managed to stay patient, and eventually, my mother arrived to pick me up.
108	17952	7	2	"I'm not generally a patient person, and there are few occasions when I've been able to show patience. However, I still vividly remember three years ago when I was in @NUM1 grade. That entire day was filled with patience. I was being picked up early from school because that night I was going to @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1. When I woke up, I was extremely excited as I had been waiting for this day for four whole months. At school, I couldn't wait to share the news with everyone. A friend who had gone a few days before said that @ORGANIZATION1 was great. As the end of the day neared, the speaker in my classroom announced ""@CAPS1"". Then, the lady and I were involved in an early - pick - up mission. After being picked up, we also picked up my cousins from school. We went to their house, got ready, and finally set off for the much - awaited day. It was a day that tested my patience but was well worth the wait."
109	17953	7	2	"The only time I can recall being patient was when we went to the mall to get my customized hat. I went to a store named Lio's. I selected my hat and told the staff that I wanted ""Saad"" written on it. The guy said it would take @NUM1 minutes. We wandered around the mall and returned to the store after about @NUM2 to @NUM3 minutes. When I asked if it was done, he said ""not yet"". I watched him working on another customer's hat. I didn't want to cause a scene, so I patiently waited. It ended up taking about an hour for my hat to be ready. I thanked the guy and left the store with my new hat, feeling quite happy."
110	17954	7	2	A person urgently called for help, and was asked by someone to sit down. This person was going to tell a story about a time when his @CAPS4 took a suit to a tailor for a conference. He was looking for his suit, and the staff said they were trying their best but might have given it to someone else by accident. Since he needed the suit for his conference, the staff suggested that he pick out another suit and they'd have the tailor start immediately. He chose a suit, and the tailor asked what needed to be done. He said the pants should be long. The tailor promised to finish it in @NUM1 minutes. The person mentioned that he had a plane to catch for @CAPS2 in two and a half hours. The tailor assured him it would be ready in @NUM1 minutes and even offered a free tie. In the end, @CAPS4 got his suit and was able to proceed with his conference plans.
111	17955	7	2	A time when someone I knew demonstrated patience was when my mom learned that my aunt, @PERSON1, was getting married, and @CAPS1 offered to help plan the wedding. @CAPS1 showed remarkable patience as, during the wedding - planning period, @CAPS1 was attending @ORGANIZATION1 and was only two months away from graduating from @CAPS2ís @ORGANIZATION1. Additionally, @CAPS1, with the assistance of my dad and me, was taking care of a seven - month - old baby boy. Moreover, @CAPS1 was trying to arrange for her parents to come from @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, along with handling numerous other tasks. After two months of wedding planning, taking excellent care of the now eight - month - old baby, studying for a test, and helping her parents arrive, @CAPS1 graduated. Eventually, on @DATE1, @CAPS1 successfully contributed to planning a beautiful wedding. This was a clear instance of someone I know being patient.
112	17957	7	2	In my view, patience is a powerful virtue. Consider the situation of waiting for your house to be built. Without patience, you'd likely go crazy as you wouldn't want to continue living in a shabby trailer, camper, or perhaps even a sub - standard house. Similarly, if you're in a doctor's office for @NUM1 hours, it's inevitable that you'll feel agitated. However, if you possess patience, you can endure these waiting periods. Patience truly is power, and it's essential in various aspects of our lives.
113	17959	7	2	Being patient is extremely challenging when you're waiting for something you desire. It's especially difficult when you're in a noisy line or when you order something online and have to wait just two or three days. If you can't wait for the simplest things that only take a short while, you're an impatient person. Impatient individuals often come across as selfish and angry, and clearly, they lack patience. In conclusion, patience is a quality that we should all strive to cultivate.
114	17961	7	2	One time, I went to the mall with @PERSON1. We first went to a flea market and bought matching hats and skirts. Then we headed to the Chinese stand. There was a long wait; we waited for about half an hour to get our food. We patiently waited and finally got our food. We sat at the last available table. A family of four was looking for a seat, and @CAPS1 and I got up and gave them our table. After that, we went to the movies. @PERSON1 was being impatient while waiting in line, so we had him save our spot. I took @PERSON1 across the walkway and got him a show ticket. When it was time to pay, we walked back to the movie theater. We bought @NUM1 bags of popcorn and then patiently waited in line to get our seats. This is one of the stories of me being patient with my friends.
115	17962	7	2	Hunting is among my favorite hobbies, and it demands a great deal of patience. When you're sitting in a tree blind in @MONTH1, you'll likely experience some of the most boring @NUM1 minutes of your life, which definitely calls for patience. Once you settle down and stay quiet, the woods around you come alive. I must admit that I'm not naturally a very patient person, but hunting requires a unique kind of patience. Many might think that hunting is just sitting around doing nothing. However, if you're patient and quiet enough, you'll be rewarded with your prey. Hunting is something that truly requires a lot of patience, but it's an entertaining form of patience, not the typical kind one might think of. That's why I believe everyone should strive to be more patient in their lives.
116	17963	7	2	Once upon a time, there was a pre - teen named Lola who lived in a land called Wonderland. Lola was a single queen with plenty of money, food, and a big house. However, there was one thing she lacked: a pre - teen prince. Many boys were vying for her attention, but none of the cute and strong pre - teen boys seemed right for her.  One day, Lola decided to visit the village to see her people. They were overjoyed to see her, shouting her name and telling her she was the best queen they'd ever had. After the cheering stopped, Lola saw a cute and strong pre - teen prince named @PERSON2. She fell in love at first sight, walked over, and said hello. He responded, and she invited him to her place for dinner, which he accepted. When he asked where she lived, she said in the big place, and they agreed to meet at six.  He didn't know Lola was a queen. When he went to her place, they had crab legs for dinner and then played video games. After that, they started to like each other. A month later, they became boyfriend and girlfriend, and things were going well.  Lola hoped he would propose to her, but she had to be patient. She waited for a year, but he still didn't propose. So, the next day, she went out with her friends @PERSON1, @LOCATION1, Feanne, and @CAPS5 to the @CAPS6. They sat in the mud bath and talked about how @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 were doing. @LOCATION2 said they were doing fine, but Lola complained that he just wouldn't propose and she thought he might not want to, even though they were living together.  The next day, when Lola came home, all her friends and family were in her house. In front of everyone, he proposed to her, and she said yes. Everyone was happy for her, and he said he was going to propose but wanted it to be a moment she'd never forget. Lola asked her friends if they knew, and they said yes, that everyone knew but couldn't tell her.  A year later, they had a beautiful wedding. It was the talk of the village, and everyone attended. They partied all night. The celebration was truly memorable.
117	17964	7	2	"There was once a soldier named Connor, a private first class. His best friend, @PERSON1, was also a private. Connor said, ""I can't believe we have to wait six months before we actually get to deploy."" @PERSON1 replied, ""That's just how it is, man.""  They were walking to the firing range. When a bullet struck the target, it made a ""ping"" sound. @PERSON1 said, ""Great shot!"" Connor responded with something. The bullet had hit right in the center of the target. Connor had excellent aim, but he still had to wait for deployment. @PERSON1 told him to be patient. Although Connor was trying to be patient, he was extremely eager to go.  Finally, the time for deployment arrived. He was very excited. One day on patrol, his convoy was severely hit by mortars, and he was killed instantly. This story shows that patience is crucial in all things. We should always remember the importance of patience when we have to wait."
118	17965	7	2	Patience can be shown in one's own way. To show patience, one should not be rude and should simply stand or sit quietly and wait for their turn. In my view, patience means remaining calm and refraining from making rude comments while waiting.  For example, once when my mom's friend was waiting for my mom as she exchanged my brother's helmet, she showed patience. When I was in the store, my cousin was patiently waiting for me to pick out an outfit, even though I took a long time. When my brother and I were in the store and he was buying a pair of shoes, I was patient and didn't get mad or make any rude remarks.  Another time, when my nephew and I were in the store and I was ordering food, he made rude comments because he was impatient. The choice to be patient means waiting for your turn.  The main point of this writing is that patience is essential in life. We should always strive to be patient in various situations.
119	17966	7	2	One time, when my family went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, we had to wait in line for a roller coaster. I couldn't even remember which one it was. I wasn't as patient as my sister, but I was still fairly patient. After the ride, I had completely forgotten how long we'd waited in line. My parents thought we had left the park and driven off somewhere.  There have been many other instances when I've been patient. For example, my friend took two days to put music on my @CAPS2. She had just gotten her @CAPS2 touch and wanted to put music on it. She asked if I wanted more music on my @CAPS2 too, and I said yes. Even though I can't go a day without using or even just looking at my @CAPS2, I had to be patient. After two days, she finally gave it back. I thanked her and asked what took so long. She said the composer was taking forever and there were some issues with the transfer.  These experiences show that patience is often required in our daily lives, and it can lead to positive outcomes.
120	17967	7	2	"@CAPS2 asked, ""@CAPS14, can I go over to @CAPS1's house after school today?"" Her @CAPS14 replied, ""I'll call and tell the school, okay?""  You might be wondering who @CAPS1 is. Well, she is @CAPS2's best friend in the world. They've been friends since they were in diapers. They are now thirteen years old.  Let's talk about @CAPS2 for a bit. @CAPS2 comes from a family of five: her @CAPS14, dad, brother, and her @CAPS14 is expecting a baby. @CAPS2 is really excited about the new baby and has always wanted a little brother or sister.  At school, @CAPS2 got the message that she could go to @CAPS1's house. So, she and @PERSON1 started walking there. When they arrived, they had a snack. @CAPS1 asked, ""@CAPS6 @CAPS2, do you want your @CAPS14 to have a boy or a girl?"" @CAPS2 answered, ""It really doesn't matter to me, but if I had to choose, I'd want a @CAPS16. I've already thought about it."" @CAPS1 said, ""Be patient. You'll get what you want.""  On @MONTH1 @NUM1, when the doctor said, ""It's a girl"" as her @CAPS14 gave birth to her new baby @CAPS16, @CAPS2 was overjoyed. She wanted to hold the baby right away, but every time she asked, she was told the baby was too young or it wasn't the right time. Finally, one day, her @CAPS14 came into her room and said, ""Here, can you watch your @CAPS16 so I can take a @CAPS15?"" That was the happiest moment of her life.  Over time, @CAPS2 and her new baby @CAPS16 grew up to be the best of friends, just like @CAPS2 and @PERSON1. This shows that when one is a little patient, good things can happen."
121	17968	7	2	My teacher announced, “We are starting the MEAP test!” The students sighed in unison. After the teacher distributed the booklets, we filled in our information, wrote our names, and began the test. As it dragged on, I completed my part relatively quickly. However, there were some students who were very slow. I grew bored, with nothing to do but sit. I considered complaining but refrained for the sake of my classmates. Eventually, Part 1 was over. The teacher then exclaimed, “Time for Part 2, students!” I thought to myself, “Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me.” Part 2 was short, yet it took one student 4 minutes to finish. At the end of the day, the teacher was very proud of me for being patient. Later that year, my MEAP results came in, and they were excellent.
122	17969	7	2	One time I demonstrated patience was during a car ride to [LOCATION1]. The journey was [NUM1] hours long. I was hungry, bored, and desperately needed to use the bathroom. I kept quiet because I knew we couldn't stop. I looked out of the window, but that soon bored me too. We were headed to [LOCATION3], and I was glad when we stopped there to eat. I knew the distance from [LOCATION2] to [LOCATION3] wasn't far, but it was around noon when we finally ate. We spent about an hour in [LOCATION3]. I did well being patient because when I'm impatient, I get moody, and people don't want to be around me. In the end, my patience during that long car ride paid off as I was able to enjoy the meal and the rest of the journey.
123	17970	7	2	A patient person is someone who can handle difficulties without complaining. For example, when waiting in a doctor's office for a check - up, whether it's a general practitioner, an eye doctor, or a dentist. The doctor's office is usually quiet, and then the phone might ring. After that, the doctor or dentist enters, and all that remains is a long period of waiting. Patience is essential in such situations as it allows one to endure the inconvenience without causing a fuss.
124	17971	7	2	The teacher happily announced, “Time to go outside!” The kids rushed out. One girl sweetly said, “Come play with us! We're playing jump rope!” As the students swung the jump rope, a little girl tapped her flat shoes on the cement lightly enough for [PERSON1] to hear. Impatiently, she said, “I'm waiting.” The student responded with an upset tone, “Come on.” The little girl replied, “Fine!” and crossed her arms, swaying back and forth. Another student approached [PERSON1] and asked, “Do you want to play tag or hide - and - seek?” The student said sweetly, with arms folded in the lap, and then ran away, waving arms. [PERSON1] laughed but thought, “If I play with him, my other friend will be mad.” The student had been mean to the little girl. A little boy, waiting for [ORGANIZATION1] to decide, hopped like a bunny to make her laugh. The little girl jumped up and down, shouting, “[PERSON1]!” [PERSON1] said, “I don't have to play with [NUM2].” The student said, “But I'm your best friend,” getting a look that only her mom would forgive. [PERSON1] retorted, “Your puppy - dog eyes don't work on me!” The student said “Fine!” again and ran off. Then she said, “I can play with you now. Let's play tag?” She laughed, and [NUM3] said, “Thanks for playing with me.” In the end, everyone found someone to play with, and the outdoor time was filled with fun.
125	17973	7	2	Last [DATE1], I went to [CAPS1] [CAPS2]. We drove for hours, and I was so uncomfortable that my butt hurt. When we arrived, there were no parking spots, so we went to the back lot. As we walked towards the park, I was excited to ride the Wicked Twister. My [CAPS3] asked me to choose the first ride, and I picked the Wicked Twister. When I saw the line, I realized it would take [NUM1] minutes to get on the ride. I was very patient that day. As we got closer, there were about [NUM2] more people. That day, I rode almost all the rides in the park and ate a whole [NUM3] - pound burger, fries, and a shake. This is my story of how I showed patience during that park visit.
126	17974	7	2	Crash! Boom! Oh no, there's been an accident. @CAPS1 @CAPS1, traffic has come to a halt. “We can't stop. Not now,” my younger sister shouts. “I'm going to be late for dance class.” “Oh, @PERSON1, just be patient. This traffic will start moving before you know it,” I say. As minutes ticked by, @PERSON1 needed to use the bathroom. My mom told her she had to wait, but she replied, “I don't want to wait.” I sat silently, looking out the window because that's all I could do. @PERSON1 screams, “I have to go to the bathroom!” “@PERSON1, please just be patient,” I pleaded. I gave her a piece of candy, which only quieted her for a couple of minutes. After @NUM1 minutes, my sister fell fast asleep. I asked mom when she thought the traffic would clear. She said she had no idea. @NUM2 minutes later, the traffic started to move, then stopped, and then started moving again. Finally, we reached our exit, and my sister made it to the dance class. She jumped out of the car and dashed into the studio. That was a time when I showed patience.
127	17975	7	2	Approximately three years ago, my family and I spent a weekend at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 at sunset. It was an ideal weekend, save for the four - hour car ride with my older and younger siblings. The car was noisy, with crying and all sorts of annoying commotion, but I remained patient. When we arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, it was extremely crowded, packed like sardines. My mom took my little sister and brother on the kiddy rides, while my dad took my brother and me. Our group went on all the big, scary rides. I went on almost every single scary ride that day, except for the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3! This was the biggest ride of all time, and I was eager to go on it. Our group got in line and realized that the line was about half a mile long and the park was going to close soon. Twenty minutes later, I was being very patient in the line. We were about a quarter of a mile from the front of the line when my dad decided it wasn't worth it. So our group met up with the rest of the family, and we sadly left @ORGANIZATION1. It was one of the saddest decisions regarding a ride. Maybe next time, I should be more patient.
128	17976	7	2	Have you ever waited for someone or something without complaining? If so, you are demonstrating patience. Patience is not merely waiting for an extended period; it involves being respectful and refraining from complaining while waiting. To be patient, one must be respectful and quiet, unless spoken to. Developing patience requires effort. For instance, at school, if you need to use the bathroom, wait until the teacher has finished talking to someone or is off Powerschool. Do not interrupt teachers during a meeting or while they are speaking. People will tend to like you more if you are patient. So, when waiting for someone or something, always keep the concept of patience in mind.
129	17977	7	2	When I was in third grade, I befriended a classmate with some disabilities. I had to learn to be patient with him. When interacting with someone like him, patience plays a crucial role in our friendship. Even though he had his difficult days, I would tell myself, “You have him as a friend, so be patient.” To this day, we are still friends, which shows that patience can help maintain long - lasting friendships.
130	17978	7	2	I'll tell you about a time when I showed patience. I was looking forward to this trip for a long time, and I hope you'll find my story interesting. I was on my way to @LOCATION1 to visit Disney World. The journey seemed to take forever! It took three days of driving. We played games like I Spy or used our Game Boys. We rarely stopped for restroom breaks or to eat. I didn't enjoy the trip much at the time. However, when we finally arrived, it was all worth it. We had a great deal of fun, and it made the long journey worthwhile.
131	17979	7	2	"One day, while at home and preparing to go out for a meal, I encountered a very long queue. I was on the phone with @LOCATION1 and @PERSON1, discussing the @CAPS1 test. Frustrated by the long wait, I exclaimed @CAPS2, wondering why it was taking so long. They advised me to be patient until it was time to order. When I asked what ""patient"" meant, they explained it as understanding, being tolerant, and refraining from complaining. I decided to give it a try. Before I realized it, I was sitting at a table in Red Lobster, eating and still on the phone. Now, I've learned that whenever I face long lines, all I need to do is be more patient and avoid complaining."
132	17980	7	2	"This is a story about a time when I demonstrated patience. My family planned a camping trip to @LOCATION1. The campground was large, and one could reserve an area to camp. However, it was about @NUM1 hours away. I packed a magazine, some paper, and my @CAPS1, determined to make the best of the journey. My sister @PERSON1 and I played against each other in @LOCATION2 for about an hour. As @CAPS4 played, all I could think about was the camp. Later, I looked at a magazine about camping; initially unaware of its topic, it made me even more excited. I then spent about half an hour drawing pictures, which was enjoyable. I took a nap for another half - hour. When I woke up, I stared at the road, wide - eyed, constantly thinking about the camp. Finally, @CAPS2 announced, ""We're here, kids!"" Everyone exclaimed @CAPS3. We set up camp, played on the playground, went swimming, and had a bonfire. All the waiting was worthwhile. Strangely, the ride home seemed much quicker. This is the story of a time when I was patient."
133	17981	7	2	"I'm writing about the topic of patience. In my opinion, patience is of great importance to the world. If people lacked patience, they would act chaotically and get angry all the time. Patience is crucial because life is not always fair, and one has to wait for their turn. For instance, when I go for my allergy shots, I must be patient as others who arrived first need to be served. I also have to be patient during football games since everyone should get a chance to play, and I can't take @CAPS1's place for the whole game. Impatient people often make others lose their patience. The term for being not patient is ""impatient"". Everyone should possess some level of patience. Our world definitely needs a bit more of it."
134	17982	7	2	This is a story about a time when my mom showed patience. One day, my mom and I went to the clinic to get my medicine. We were among the first to arrive. Then, many more people started to come. My mom thought we would be the first ones called, but @NUM1 groups were called first, followed by another @NUM1 groups, and then @NUM3 more groups. Finally, my mom and I were called. This is the story of when my mom was patient.
135	17983	7	2	Have you ever experienced a moment of extreme patience in your life? Let me tell you about one of mine. One day, I was at home watching TV. Suddenly, I really needed to use the bathroom. Unfortunately, my mom and my sister also needed to go. My mom went first, and my sister was next. My mom didn't take long, but my sister was in there for a while. I started getting angry, but I still waited patiently. I was holding it in, knowing that eventually I would have to go. I did everything I could to get into the bathroom, like banging on the door. Finally, I got in, took care of my business, and in conclusion, this was a time when I was patient.
136	17984	7	2	Patience is a virtue, an essential quality in life. Without it, we struggle to achieve much. People may become easily bored when lacking patience. I once had an experience that tested my patience. After @DATE1, I decided to purchase an iPod Touch. Since no physical stores were open, online shopping was my only option. I used Amazon to place the order. I was extremely eager to receive it, but unfortunately, I had to wait about a week. The waiting period was dull, yet I found other activities to occupy my mind. When the iPod finally arrived, I was overjoyed. I'm glad I exercised patience. Through this experience, I learned that we can't obtain everything immediately. Those who are patient will be rewarded. Moreover, I became better at waiting for things. This is how I demonstrated patience and improved my ability to be patient.
137	17985	7	2	"Over the @DATE2, specifically on the @DATE1, my family and I decided to go to a local park to watch the fireworks. It was also a chance for my brother and me to meet our friends, and we were extremely excited. It took us more than an hour to reach the park. I remained patient because I knew that if I wasn't, my mom would be in a bad mood. My brother kept whining, ""Are we there yet?"" I replied, ""@CAPS1 my @CAPS2, @PERSON1, we just got in the car."" My brother has always been like this. I stayed silent throughout the journey, and every time he spoke, the ride seemed to get longer. In the end, our patience was rewarded as we enjoyed the wonderful fireworks display at the park, and it was a memorable experience for all of us."
138	17986	7	2	Patience holds great significance in life. I've had numerous instances of being patient, and I'd like to share one particular experience where my patience paid off. It was @DATE1, precisely two months before my birthday. I asked my mom if I could get a phone. She thought I was too young, stating that she didn't own a phone until she was in college. I argued that almost everyone else had a cell phone, which was partly true. She said she'd consider it and warned me not to pester her about it again. As @DATE3 approached, with only @NUM1 days left until my birthday, I constantly daydreamed about the phone I wanted, including the color of its case. Weeks passed with these thoughts in my mind. Then, on @DATE2, my birthday, I woke up to the smell of pancakes. After breakfast, we went to my grandma's house as it was also Thanksgiving. After dinner, we returned home for my birthday surprise. I opened presents from my relatives, and finally, the last box. To my delight, it was the phone I'd been longing for. I was ecstatic and immediately called all my friends. It was the best birthday ever. Being patient was truly worthwhile as I got the phone I desired. This is why we should always practice patience and wait for the right time. By @PERSON1.
139	17987	7	2	"One day, I was home alone. My uncle was seriously ill, and my parents went to visit him. I felt utterly alone and scared, as if @CAPS1 had abandoned me. I prayed fervently but received no response. Eventually, I fell asleep. In my dream, I heard @CAPS2's voice. I was running in a grassy field. I saw a man dressed in white walking through the mud, and when he emerged, there was no dirt on him. I ran up to him and asked, ""Man, who are you?"" He replied, ""Little child of @CAPS1, why do you look so lonely? I am your angel, and I've come to convey what your father has said."" He talked to me for a long time, and I no longer felt scared or lonely. There was a single cloud in the sky. He said he had to leave but that he was my guardian angel. Then he ascended into the sky. I'll never forget him; he is my angel. This was a time when I needed to be patient to hear @CAPS4's voice, and it taught me the power of patience in difficult times."
140	17988	7	2	The time I showed patience was around Christmas. Initially, I was impatiently waiting for Christmas to arrive. My mom told me to be patient and that it would come soon. I really wanted a Wii console and The Sims @NUM1. So, I endured the waiting. Finally, when Christmas came, I received not only what I wanted but also some additional gifts. Usually, @CAPS1 isn't very patient, but this time, I listened to my mom. Through this experience, I learned that when we truly desire something or want to do something, being patient will make our wishes come true faster. Therefore, we should always practice patience in life.
141	17989	7	2	Every day on the bus, a kid sits beside me. He can be annoying, yet I still listen to him. Usually, we get along well, though we do have debates sometimes. He tells outrageous stories about @CAPS1 and snipers. He isn't really my friend, but he is someone to talk to. I believe listening to and talking with this kid is a god - sent mission as he doesn't have many friends.
142	17990	7	2	Have you ever wondered about the importance of patience? I firmly believe that patience is a virtue we all need, especially in the future. Patience can be exercised in various situations, such as at the fair, in the lunch line, and when teaching a dog tricks.  At the fair, patience is essential. Whether you're waiting in line for rides or getting tickets or a bracelet, you must remain patient. This is one clear instance where patience is required.  The lunch line is another scenario. We all need to eat, so waiting patiently is the right thing to do. I've had people rush around me, lacking patience. This shows that patience is necessary in the lunch line as well.  Teaching a dog tricks demands a great deal of patience. You can't expect a dog to learn tricks immediately; it's a gradual process. You need to be slow and patient.  In conclusion, patience is crucial at the fair, in the lunch line, and when teaching a dog tricks. It is also needed at school and at home. That's why patience is so important in our lives.
143	17991	7	2	"Patience is a quality that people sometimes lack. I once struggled with it, and I'd like to share that experience. It was a bright, sunny day, and all my family members were outside. My dad was grilling hot dogs and hamburgers, my mom was setting up the table, and my siblings and I were playing catch with a football. Everyone in the family knew how to throw and catch the ball except my little brother.  We all decided to teach him. We tried multiple times, but he just couldn't seem to get the hang of it. Eventually, my sisters got tired of explaining the game and gave up. However, I kept repeating the instructions until he understood. I, too, grew weary of telling him what to do, but I thought, ""Give the kid a chance; he might just get it."" So, I continued to help him.  Then, my mom called out, ""@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside."" I told my little brother, ""Time for @CAPS1; let's go inside."" But he exclaimed, ""@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!"" I replied, ""@CAPS3, but just one time."" Even though he had said that many times before, I thought one more try wouldn't hurt.  As I threw the ball, my little brother ran up and caught it! He shouted, ""I did it!"" I looked at him proudly and said, ""Good job."" He ran inside to tell our parents. I was really glad that I had taken the time to help him. I knew he could do it, no matter how many attempts it took. And he finally did! That was the time I learned the value of being patient."
144	17992	7	2	In my opinion, when someone is being patient, they are calmly waiting in line or for something. They are not rushed and remain quiet. This shows that patience is about maintaining composure and self - control while waiting.
145	17993	7	2	"My brother had a check - up today, and I accompanied him. All I could do was sit patiently for @NUM1. There was nothing I could actively do, but I managed to keep my cool. Waiting in that dark room was a challenge. I picked up a nearby car magazine and started flipping through it. The only interesting thing I found was an article about a new @CAPS2 that was coming out.  I read for @NUM2, then went to the bathroom and quickly returned to the dimly - lit room. I took out my phone and texted a few people. Five minutes passed, and I got no replies. I closed my eyes, leaned back, and just waited. I was so bored that I felt like bashing my head against a wall.  Finally, my brother entered the room and said, ""That's it."" Right at that moment, I received texts from two people. It would have been much better to get those texts when I was extremely bored. In the end, I realized that waiting patiently can be a real test of one's endurance."
146	17996	7	2	One time, I showed patience while snowmobiling with my family. My dad and I had to warm up the snowmobiles, take them off the trailer, start them. Then, he rode one around to find a track, and I followed him on another sled. I also had to put the snow groomer on. We went to my aunt's house in @LOCATION1. I've been to many places on the snowmobiles. This experience required patience, and I'm glad I was able to handle it.
147	17997	7	2	"This was the time when I showed patience towards my friend @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and I live in the same apartment building, so we often hang out. One day, I had an idea to go to the carnival. I noticed she wasn't keen on the idea and said she was ""scared"" of roller - coasters. I told her it wouldn't be a big deal and we wouldn't go on big rides. On the day of the carnival, both @PERSON1 and I were excited. When we arrived, she was very scared to go on the rides, so I suggested we start with the smallest one. After a few rides, she was less scared. As we were walking, she saw one of the biggest rides and said we should go on it. I told her we could if she wanted to, and she was sure. After that ride, we went on different bigger rides. While walking, she thanked me for being patient and said I was a good friend. In summary, that was the time I was patient with a friend."
148	17998	7	2	There have been moments in my life when I had to exercise patience. One day, my friends and I decided to go to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. I love roller - coasters, but I dislike the long lines. When we got there, we waited half an hour to enter. We decided to go on the @CAPS2 ride first and then had to wait another @NUM1 minutes to board. Other rides also had long waiting times. Even when getting food, we had to wait. Throughout the day, there was a significant amount of waiting. My friend and I had to be understanding and tolerate the long lines. By the end of the day, we had grown accustomed to being patient. That trip to @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 taught me to be more patient.
149	18000	7	2	The engines roared, the propellers spun, and the plane moved forward towards the runway. Everyone cheered. Then, a loud crack was heard, and the plane stopped. We sat there for over an hour. Finally, the pilot announced over the intercom that we should collect our luggage, exit the plane, and return to the @LOCATION2. I was on the verge of losing my patience but managed to hold it together. It all began at the @LOCATION2. I've never been a big fan of planes. However, when I learned we were traveling from @LOCATION4 to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, I chose the plane over a long car journey. We boarded the plane at @LOCATION2 through gate @NUM1. It took off quickly, and we were flying. I was confused when we landed @NUM2 minutes later in @LOCATION5, as I thought we were going to @LOCATION3. It turned out there was a two - hour layover. I had to sit patiently for two hours, which was difficult as I was eager to reach @LOCATION3 and hate waiting. Two hours later, we found out the flight was delayed by an hour. We waited until we finally boarded. As the plane started moving forward, its wing tip caught on a building and broke off. The flight attendants helped us unload. I saw the grumpy faces of fellow passengers, and I empathized with them but tried to be patient. After three hours of waiting, the plane was fixed, and we took off. I knew that without patience, I wouldn't have made it on this long journey to @LOCATION3.
150	18001	7	2	One time, I was sent to my room and had to sit on my bed without being able to do anything. I asked to get out once, but that only added more time to my punishment. So, I had to stay in my room for about an hour and a half. I took a twenty - minute nap. I was extremely bored. Finally, I was allowed out. This experience taught me the importance of patience in difficult situations.
151	18002	7	2	"When I was @NUM1 years old, I desperately wanted a new bike and had no patience. One day, I asked my dad if I could get a new bike. He initially said not now, but I pleaded, and he said later. When I saw my dad getting dressed, I assumed it was for buying the bike. I told him I was ready, but he said no, not then. I got angry and sat down. After an hour, my dad appeared. I ran to him and asked if we could go. He told me to be patient. I was confused as he had said we'd go. Then, my dad parked the car, went downstairs, and had lunch. I got angry and sat on the couch, watching @CAPS1 while he ate. After he finished, he said, ""Ali, let's go!"" I asked where, and he said to buy me a bike. I ran quickly, hugged my dad, and went to get dressed. Eventually, I got my new bike after being patient."
152	18004	7	2	When I was about @NUM1 years old, I believed in aliens. I went to a field, sat, and waited for them. I waited and waited. At one point, I thought I saw something, but it was just a shooting star. I was excited, but it wasn't what I hoped for. Suddenly, a deer started running after me, so I shot it. Bored, I made up a song while waiting for the aliens. As it got dark, I finally saw something. It was the aliens in their spacecraft, which stopped in the field. The aliens walked out, and I shot them. I took them home and showed them to the whole town. They didn't believe me, so I told them to go to the field and see the spacecraft. They all fainted. That was a time when I was patient.
153	18005	7	2	"When we arrived at Cedar Point, there was one ride I wanted to go on, the @CAPS1. The problem was that there was a @NUM1 - hour wait. Standing in the blazing sun on @NUM2 hot days, I started having second thoughts. Looking up at the light and the @CAPS3 - colored green truck, I knew it would be worth it. After @NUM3 minutes, my brother @PERSON1 was already bored. So, we played @NUM4 @CAPS4 to pass the time, and I won every time. Almost an hour later, we reached the first popcorn stand. I got three popcorns and about @NUM5 candy bars, while @PERSON1 got double what I did. Two hours later, we reached the elevator that took us up. At the top, we were strapped into the front - row seats. The roller - coaster slowly climbed the hill with a ""Crank! Crank! Crank!"" sound. Then the cart dipped down, and we were going @NUM5 miles per hour, going up, down, side - to - side, and even upside - down for three minutes. When we finally pulled back into the station, @PERSON1 had punched something @NUM1 times. Meeting my group at the car, we began the @NUM8 - hour car ride home. I turned to my brother and said it was time for another game of @NUM4 @CAPS5."
154	18006	7	2	When I was ten years old, my mom promised me a phone. However, she said I had to wait until @CAPS1. I was mad because @CAPS1 was next month. I couldn't wait because the phone was a touchscreen with a keyboard. I tried to be as patient as possible. The next day, I kept seeing commercials for the phone I wanted. It was extremely difficult to be patient, but I did my best. Every day, I had to try to distract myself from thinking about the phone. Some of my friends already had phones, and I really wanted to text them. Before I knew it, it was only a week until @CAPS1, so I was excited, even though I had to pay the phone bill. I wished time would pass faster, but it didn't. All I could do was wait. After six days, @CAPS1 was tomorrow! My days of miserable waiting finally paid off. I woke up the next day, opened my present, and it was a brand - new phone. My heart started pounding with excitement. I was so happy and thanked my mom. Clearly, being patient will eventually pay off.
155	18008	7	2	When I was in fourth grade, I was going to a concert and had to be very patient. I was waiting in a long line to get in. While in line, I talked to my friends, played games, and took a few steps forward every few minutes. I sat with my mom, moved up a bit, and sat again. It seemed like the line wasn't moving at all. Finally, we reached the front, and my friends and I were extremely excited. Being patient paid off because if I had bothered my mom too much, she might have gotten mad at me. I had a great time at the concert. That was a time when I was patient.
156	18011	7	2	Patience is essential when one is not in a rush to reach their destination. For instance, when checking out at a store or during work, some individuals may be rude and fail to exercise patience. At school and work, patience should always be employed. For example, I exercise patience at Kinchat School because there are over a hundred first - graders. During lunchtime, half of them are rowdy, and the other half may get hurt, not knowing what to do. In conclusion, patience is a valuable quality in such situations.
157	18012	7	2	I demonstrated patience when I took the [specific test name]. The test spanned two days, from [DATE1] to [DATE2], from [NUM1] am to about [NUM2] pm. I successfully passed the test! After that, I had to patiently wait until [DATE3] to receive my [specific certification] at the [specific level]. This has been one of my greatest accomplishments in my life so far. It wasn't easy. I started at the age of five and am now twelve. I had to perform [NUM3] [specific skills] I knew at the time, about [NUM4] stances, including [list of stances], and complete [NUM5] minutes of sparring (kumite), [NUM6] minutes of practical self - [ORGANIZATION1]. I also had to create a poster, obtain a parent recommendation, a teacher recommendation, write a [NUM7] - page report, and a written [specific document]. I needed to perform a [specific skill], show self - [ORGANIZATION1] application, do a [specific weapon skit] and a practical self - [ORGANIZATION1] skit, and send in a progress report. In conclusion, achieving this goal required a great deal of patience and hard work over many years.
158	18013	7	2	One time, I went to Center Point. We were in the car, about an hour away from Center Point Park. I was talking with my sister on [DATE1] and then fell asleep. When we arrived, I was extremely excited and couldn't wait to go on the [specific ride]. As we walked into the park with my sisters, mom, and dad, all I could hear were people screaming on the rollercoaster. When we got in line for the [specific ride], I was at the back of the line. I was so impatient that I kept thinking “come on” in my mind. I even started to feel like I didn't want to go on it anymore. But when it was time, I got on the ride, and it was over in [NUM2] seconds. This experience taught me about the importance of patience.
159	18014	7	2	Patience is a virtue I've always desired. Sometimes, I lose my patience when things take too long. At [ORGANIZATION1], there was an event called [CAPS1]. It was a rainy situation, and many people were curious to see if [CAPS2] would close down. The rain eventually stopped, but I had to wait until [TIME1]. It was only six o'clock! So, my family and I had to stand and wait for two hours and thirty minutes. Those two hours felt like an eternity; it was truly unbearable. My brother kept making annoying squeaky noises and had to be scolded three times before he stopped. Finally, at [TIME2], we were let in. We got popcorn and hotdogs, found our seats, and started watching. I'm really glad I was patient because the show was definitely worth the wait.
160	18015	7	2	One day, when we were going to [LOCATION1], we drove for a whole day because we went in the wrong direction. My mom got angry at night. Around 1:30 am, I was the only one awake as my three brothers [PERSON1], [LOCATION2], and Caman were sleeping in the back of the van. My sister [CAPS1] and I were in the front. I got really angry when a guy took the last room the hotel had. But we managed to find a room the next day. We went to the [ORGANIZATION1] to stay and were going to the water park and museum park. There was a new ride called “The Scoping Tail,” but we had to wait for an hour to go on it. I was patient, but my mom was getting tired and angry because it took so long. The next day, it rained, so we went to the indoor pool at our hotel. However, there were too many people, so we had to wait. I wasn't patient as I really wanted to swim. After almost half an hour, we finally got to swim. The next day, we had to leave, and it took almost two days to get back home. We arrived at [TIME1]. I was patient enough to help my parents bring all the stuff into our house, and then we finally went to bed. It was such a relief to end this tiring but eventful trip.
161	18016	7	2	The teacher addressed the kids, saying, “Today, you all are going to look into our microscopes. I will assign your partners.” The teacher called out the names, and PERSON1 was involved. PERSON1 chose CAPS2 as a partner. The narrator thought CAPS2 was very intelligent. The students were assigned to a microscope. The teacher instructed them to draw everything they saw in their notebooks. CAPS2 looked through the microscope and observed blue lines scattered everywhere. The narrator asked, “Can I see?” CAPS2 replied, “I have to draw it in my notebook.” The narrator impatiently urged, “Hurry up.” PERSON1 then said, “Who can accept PERSON3 in their group? He needs a partner.” CAPS2 looked up from the microscope and raised her hand, saying, “We can.” The narrator complained, “Really, CAPS2?” PERSON1 admonished the narrator, “Don't be rude. You know he is new to our class.” PERSON3 walked over, got a chair, and sat in front of the narrator. He patiently waited for CAPS2 to finish drawing. The narrator shouted, “Can you go any slower?” CAPS2 retorted, “Can you yell any louder?” Finally, it was PERSON3's turn. He looked through the microscope and started drawing. The narrator tried to peek at CAPS2's paper, but she noticed, and the narrator quickly looked back. CAPS2 told the narrator, “You really need to wait your turn and be patient. We will all get a chance to look through it.” The narrator apologized, “You're right. Thanks, CAPS2. I'm sorry I was acting like that.” CAPS2 suggested, “It's alright. I act like that too. Maybe we should all sit together at lunch.” PERSON3 agreed, “That would be cool.”
162	18017	7	2	Being patient can be challenging at times, while other times, one may not mind waiting. There have been numerous instances when I've had to exercise patience. Sometimes, I've had to wait for an hour or NUM1 minutes. One such occasion was at a dance class. My mom dropped me off at NUM2. I arrived a bit early and waited for five minutes. After that, I started to worry that the class might be in a different room, but that wasn't the case. After waiting for thirty minutes, I was extremely bored and recalled that the dance class started at TIME1. I couldn't call home as I didn't have my phone. When another five minutes passed, I went to the playset and was swinging by myself. At TIME1, my mom came to pick me up, but I told her, “It starts at TIME1. So I have to stay.” She kept asking why I didn't call, and I repeatedly explained that I didn't have my phone. Then she left, and I attended the two - hour dance class. For me, being patient for such a long time is a humbling experience. I can manage fifteen minutes of waiting, but an hour is quite difficult. That was one of the tough times when I had to be patient.
163	18018	7	2	I demonstrated patience when I had to watch over NUM1 little mischievous girls at my sister's house. My sister asked if I wanted to spend the TIME1 at her place, and I agreed. Then her god - children came over. That TIME1, my sister remembered she had to go somewhere. So, in the morning, she left me in charge of the kids for NUM2 hours. I had to patiently wait for her to return. Eventually, she did come back.
164	18019	7	2	One day, I had to wait for about NUM1 hours, which felt like an eternity, but I didn't complain. I sat in the doctor's office with my mom, waiting to be called. I sat there reading a magazine while my mom texted her friend. In forty - five minutes, about three people were called in. I just sat and continued looking at the magazine. When they called a kid named PERSON1, I thought it was me because my name is PERSON2. I finished one magazine and started on another. I thought I'd like it as it had a war scene on the cover, but it was just a cover; there was nothing exciting inside except a floating translucence trick. After about an hour, only five people had been called. I finally finished all the magazines and was bored. I watched as people were called one by one. Eventually, only my mom, I, and another group were left, and of course, they were called before us. It took about three hours until we were called. When we were finally called, we had to wait even longer due to technical difficulties with the machines. Once we got in, we had to wait for half an hour for the doctor. When we finally saw the doctor, he made my knee twitch and made me hop on one foot. I'm not sure why he did that. He also did the regular check - ups, like putting the otoscope in my ear and the thermometer on my tongue. Finally, we were done and went home. My mom asked me how I could be so patient, and I replied, “I have no idea.”
165	18020	7	2	When I was going to the doctor, I had to be patient. The reason I went was that there was a crack in my auntie's driveway. I was riding my scooter and wasn't paying attention. My scooter hit the crack, and I sprained my knee. My dad came out of the house to pick me up. I had to use a wheelchair and wait because there were no more available curtained areas. I waited for an hour before it was my turn. They examined my knee and provided me with aids to help me walk. It was quite difficult for me to climb the stairs to my house.
166	18021	7	2	I showed patience while on my way to @LOCATION1 to visit my @CAPS1. I remained calm because I didn't want to get overly excited about @CAPS2. In the past, when I got excited, our plans often changed, and we had to cancel. So, I kept my composure. We were in the car for a little over an hour when my brother realized he'd forgotten something. We had to go back and get @CAPS2. Throughout this, I stayed patient. We were quiet during the entire journey. This is the story of my patience when going to @LOCATION1.
167	18022	7	2	Have you or your parents ever applied for a job? My uncle did and was extremely patient. He desired the job as much as a child wants ice - cream. One day, he typed up an application for the job he wanted. After finishing, he copied and pasted it into an email and sent it. Immediately, he grabbed his phone, hoping for good news. He constantly checked his phone to ensure he didn't miss any calls or messages. He knew he had to be patient. After a week, he considered calling the place @CAPS2 but didn't. One afternoon, he got a call, and he rushed to answer it like a cheetah. It was just my mom asking if he got the job @CAPS2, and he sighed and said no. I felt sorry for him. Then, one morning, he got a call and picked it up, shouting, “@CAPS1 do you want!” without realizing it was the boss. He apologized and got the job. He was overjoyed as his patience had paid off. This shows that one should always be patient as good things will come.
168	18023	7	2	One day after school, on the bus ride home, I was eager to get home. When I finally arrived, I ran inside and saw my high - school brother with a box of pop. I asked where he got the money from. You won't believe it, but he said he took it from my wallet. I was furious because I was saving that money to go to the movies. In a fit of anger, I punched him in the nose, and it started bleeding. I tried to run, but he could catch up with me easily. However, he said he'd get back at me later. I realized then that he was being patient with me; he could have really hurt me but didn't. The next week, he saved me, and he hasn't hit me since. This experience taught me about patience.
169	18025	7	2	I was in @CAPS1 visiting my family, and my cousins were coming from @LOCATION1. I was extremely excited and impatient, constantly asking, “When are they gonna be here!” Around lunchtime, I was eating cold pizza and watching out the window. I kept counting down from ten, saying they'd be here in @NUM1, but they never showed up. By about @NUM2 p.m., I realized I wouldn't see them until the next day. So, I decided to be patient and not waste the whole day thinking about it. After a good night's sleep, I had breakfast and watched some @CAPS2. Then I heard honking and thought it might be my cousins, but it was uncle @CAPS3 on his big motorcycle. A few hours later, when I heard the sound again, I initially thought uncle @CAPS3 was leaving. But then I heard my cousins' voices. I jumped out of my chair and gave them a huge hug. It truly shows that patience is the key.
170	18026	7	2	When I was younger, my sister taught me how to braid. It was a long - drawn - out process as my small hands couldn't always do things correctly. But my sister always helped me whenever she had time. I thought I'd never learn to do it right. Then, she told me, “Practice makes perfect.” She let me choose from her best string selection and slowly showed me how to braid. Before I knew it, I was braiding as well as she did. I'm really grateful that she encouraged me to keep trying and was patient with me throughout. This is a great example of someone being patient with me.
171	18028	7	2	One time, waiting was arduous, yet I remained patient, and ultimately, it was @CAPS1. On one occasion, my family and I planned to visit @CAPS2 world. The morning I woke up, I was extremely excited as I was eager to reach the airport and head to @CAPS2 world. After we packed the car, we drove to the airport. In the car, my brother and I discussed our excitement. Once we arrived at the airport, our excitement soared. When we reached the waiting area for our plane, the airport staff informed all passengers waiting for the same flight that the plane to @LOCATION1 would be approximately one hour late. My entire family and I were eager to reach @ORGANIZATION1 world as soon as possible, but we had no choice but to wait. We wandered around the airport and had something to eat. Then we learned that we only had to wait for another twenty minutes! My family and I sat down and chatted. Before we realized it, we were boarding the plane. Patience can truly contribute to resolving situations.
172	18029	7	2	On @DATE1, it was my @NUM1 -th birthday, and I was overjoyed. While I was in high spirits and my elder sisters were preparing for my party, my mother was at work. The party had an array of items such as juice, soda, food, candy, chips, and ice - cream, but there was no cake. My mother was supposed to pick it up after work. Then it was time to open the gifts. After opening all my gifts, it was time for cake and ice - cream. We had the ice - cream, but there was no cake. I didn't throw a tantrum like a child, though my sister did as she was only @NUM2, while I was @NUM1 and had to act my age. My mother called and said she was running a bit late and would come after getting my cake. When my mother got home, we cut the cake. When I took the first bite, I thought to myself that it was definitely worth the wait! I was glad I waited like a mature kid, and I was even happier to be @NUM1 years old.
173	18030	7	2	I'm usually a patient person, but the day I had to be most patient was on @DATE1 when I babysat with my older cousin @PERSON2. We were taking care of twin four - month - old baby girls for eight hours. Babies are incredibly demanding, and taking care of them requires a great deal of patience. One instance where patience was crucial was when the babies cried. These babies cried frequently and for long periods, so it took a while to soothe them. For example, when I put one twin down and she fell asleep, she'd start wailing, and I'd patiently take the time to calm her. Another time I needed patience was to get them to sleep. The baby I mainly cared for took ages to fall asleep. So I patiently walked around the house, bouncing her up and down in my arms. Eventually, they both fell asleep. A third situation where I used patience was when feeding them. Since they were very small twins, they ate slowly. Also, when I was feeding the baby I was in charge of, Natalic, I had to be patient when she spit up all over my shirt. My cousin @PERSON2 also showed patience when “her baby,” @PERSON3, spit up on her. That day demanded a lot of patience, but it was still very enjoyable. Taking care of @LOCATION2 and @PERSON1 was a lot of work, but patience helped me and @LOCATION1 get through it.
174	18031	7	2	Patience is a challenging virtue, but the rewards far exceed the time spent waiting for what one desires. Whether waiting for a computer to boot up or standing in line for a roller - coaster, patience will be rewarded. However, many people, including myself (@CAPS1), lack patience. Nevertheless, over time, they can learn to be as patient as monks. In conclusion, a bit of effort and a great deal of patience can make a difference.
175	18032	7	2	When I was a child, our family was going to the dentist in Ann - @CAPS1. There was heavy traffic, and my sister, brother, and I were in the car. We ended up waiting for @NUM1 hours. I was extremely unhappy, so my mother told me to be patient. At that time, I didn't understand what “be patient” meant, but now I know it means waiting calmly. When we finally reached the dentist's and I sat down, I found out I was late. As a result, we had to go back home and make the trip again the next day.
176	18033	7	2	"One instance when I demonstrated patience was during a visit to Cedar Point. We embarked on a long drive from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2. Upon arrival, there was a lengthy queue to enter the park. My mother advised, ""Alright, everyone, it's time to be patient."" Once inside, we headed for the first ride we spotted, which also had a long line. Mom remarked, ""If we want to experience all the rides, we'll need to be patient throughout the day."
177	18034	7	2	Have you ever had to exercise patience? I did when my older brother broke his finger on a trampoline at a friend's house on a sweltering @DATE1. When it happened, he seemed like @PERSON1. My mom, as moms often do, wanted to examine his hand, knuckles, and so on. It felt like an eternity to get a response from her, even when she was in the same room as my brother. On the third day after the accident, Mom called the doctor's office and secured an appointment for my brother. I thought I'd stay home while he went, but Mom insisted I accompany them. I tried to come up with excuses, but she wasn't convinced. The short car - ride felt like an excruciatingly long one. Once at the doctor's, we sat in the waiting room. Time seemed to stand still; seconds blended into minutes, and minutes into hours. It was pure torture. Finally, the doctor entered and called for my brother. The doctor was incredibly boring, using long - winded words. I was so exhausted that I stopped caring. When it was time to leave, I was the only one happy. In summary, I had to be patient when my brother broke his finger. He became @PERSON1 and needed medical attention. The doctor's office was extremely dull. My patience was rewarded with the ability to leave the doctor's office.
178	18035	7	2	On one occasion at the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I went to purchase some arrows. However, there was no one available to ring up my purchase. Instead of repeatedly ringing the bell, I patiently waited. After approximately @NUM1 minutes, someone finally showed up. They thanked me for my patience, processed my payment, and I was able to leave. This was a time when I displayed patience.
179	18036	7	2	One time I showed patience was while waiting in line for lunch. I remained patient because there were many people in the queue, and some were letting others cut in, causing the line to grow longer. This is the story of one of the instances when I was patient.
180	18037	7	2	One time I had to be patient was when my dad promised to send me a @CAPS1 present. I waited and waited for it. During this time, I went about my daily routine: sleeping, eating, playing games, going to class, and watching TV. After two weeks, the package finally arrived. It contained an @ORGANIZATION1 game and a hundred - dollar bill. I called my dad to express my gratitude. He played the game all night, and I saved the money until my birthday. That was the time I demonstrated patience.
181	18038	7	2	While walking down the lane in search of the perfect gift I had seen the day before, I discovered it was sold out. It was my mom's birthday today, and the gift I had in mind was a precious moment figurine. I asked the manager if they had any in the back, but unfortunately, they didn't. He informed me that the new shipment would arrive at five. I didn't think I could wait another three hours. My dad drove me home. I paced back and forth, hoping it would pass the time, but it didn't. Finally, I realized I needed to relax and be patient. When it was five o'clock, my dad and I went back to the store, and there, right in front of me, was the perfect gift. I picked it up and gave it to the clerk to scan. I handed her the money and headed straight home. When mom got home, I gave her the gift and realized that patience comes in handy when waiting.
182	18039	7	2	One day, my parents and I were driving to @ORGANIZATION1 for a very special event. The purpose of this event was to see the president of the United States of @LOCATION1, @PERSON1. When we reached the park where the event was to take place, we were shocked to see cars parked a mile away. After finally finding a parking spot, we started our long walk. It was a tiring journey, but I was excited when we finally reached the gate. After going through security, we thought we'd never make it to our destination. My parents and I stood in line for about two hours. Finally, everyone spread out and took their places. We sang the national anthem, and then the president stepped up to the podium and gave a long speech. It was the longest line I'd ever stood in, but I remained patient throughout. This experience taught me the value of patience in such situations.
183	18040	7	2	One day, I went to a baseball game in @LOCATION1. The line to enter was incredibly long, stretching out for half a mile, and we were at the very end. It took us approximately an hour to reach the entrance. I had to be extremely patient because if I wasn't, my dad would have lost his temper. This is my story about the importance of patience in a real - life situation.
184	18041	7	2	"There were only @NUM1 minutes left in class, and I had @CAPS1 to do. I watched the clock tick down agonizingly slowly. With @NUM1 minutes remaining, at @NUM5, the teacher asked, ""What are you doing?"" I replied, ""@CAPS1. I have @CAPS1 to do."" The teacher then said, ""Why don't you put your head down?"" I was on the verge of losing my patience and snapping, but I managed to hold back. I put my head down, and before I knew it, it was time to go. By keeping my patience, I avoided getting into trouble, which shows that self - control can have positive outcomes."
185	18042	7	2	"Did you know that patience is one of the keys to happiness? For instance, I was walking when a guy approached me and started talking about his family. At that time, I wasn't very patient. He just kept going on and on, and finally, I snapped and said, ""Do you know how to shut up?"" Sadly, he said ""yes"" and then ran home, crying. When I got home, I felt sorry for the guy, so I went to him and said ""sorry."" To my surprise, he said ""got you."" I was initially very angry, but I was relieved when it was over. This incident taught me a valuable lesson: always be patient because you never know who might be watching."
186	18043	7	2	I always remain patient with my family. My mom and @CAPS1 do a great deal for me, and I'm always patient when they take me somewhere. Sometimes, they take me to hockey games. Usually, @CAPS1 takes me, but on @DATE1, my mom took me, and I was patient. When it comes to homework, I'm also always patient. If I'm going to @PERSON1's golfland and my mom says she'll take me, I'm always patient. In all these situations, patience is a virtue I hold dear.
187	18044	7	2	My cousin, Romeo, is the most patient person I've ever met. He's studying to be a doctor at @LOCATION1 and has to go through eight years of college. This involves learning complex terminology, studying cells, and understanding human anatomy, all of which demand a great deal of patience. Romeo attends @ORGANIZATION1, which is close to where I and my aunt live. He comes home often and never complains about homework or school. He's in his fifth year of college, meaning he has four years down and four to go. Besides squeezing something (though it's not clear what), he doesn't have a specific way to relieve stress. Before leaving for @ORGANIZATION1, he told me that patience is half the process and half the reward. Romeo truly exemplifies patience and is the perfect role model.
188	18045	7	2	"Here's a story about patience, called @CAPS1's @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I hollered at my @CAPS4, @CAPS1, ""Hurry up and find my shoes! I don't want to be late for school again."" @CAPS4 replied in a hurried voice, ""You asked me a second ago. It doesn't take a second to find lost shoes. You just have to be patient."" I sighed and said, ""I know, but I still don't want to be late."" @CAPS4 said, ""I know, but remember, being patient will get you far."" I agreed. At school that @CAPS3, @CAPS1 remembered her mom's words and was very patient throughout the day. She didn't whine about the slow bus, didn't cut in the lunch line, and didn't grab the volleyball when someone else had it. By the end of the @CAPS3, her friends at @LOCATION1 started acting like her. Their teacher noticed their patience when they raised their hands instead of blurting out answers and gave them candy. Other students noticed and wondered how to get candy too. In the next class, @CAPS1 could feel everyone's eyes on her, but she knew it was for a good reason. Everyone learned to raise their hands and not push when leaving the classroom. Soon, everyone started getting candy, and the teachers were happy. When I got home that @CAPS3, I hugged my @CAPS4 tightly and told her what happened at school. From that day on, I learned to be patient."
189	18046	7	2	One day, I queued up for some free @CAPS1 of Lay's chips at @ORGANIZATION1. I was number @NUM1. By the @CAPS2 time I reached the front, @NUM2 friends of mine were also there. It was a giveaway day. I was really patient and waited for @NUM4 hours and @NUM5 minutes. We chewed on something (not clear what) and finally got one chip and left. Then we got into a game (not clear what kind), and we were very tired. We were going to @LOCATION1, and it was the worst test of patience I've ever been through. @PERSON1 was also part of this experience, and overall, it was a long - awaited and tiring event that tested my patience.
190	18047	7	2	@CAPS1 was a beautiful morning. The sky was blue, the birds were singing, and my sister and her boyfriend, Zone, were planning to go skydiving. My friend, my parents, and I tagged along to watch. There were a few people in front of them, so we had to wait for about an hour. Then another hour passed, and it still wasn't their turn. We started to get hungry, so we went into town and ordered breakfast. Just as we got our drinks and were about to get our food, we got a call saying they were going soon. We had to cancel our meal and rush back. When we got there, it still wasn't their turn. Due to some unknown issue (related to 'wide', not clear), we had to sit in the middle of the field for almost four more hours. Finally, it was their turn. They got in the plane and flew up. They circled the field for a while, and then it looked like a little dot fell out of the plane, followed by another. They landed successfully. It turned out we had sat there for eight hours before they jumped, not including the hour - and - a - half drive there. I think I was pretty patient that day, and the experience taught me the value of waiting.
191	18048	7	2	Left! Right! High kick left, roundhouse right! The boy's arms move so rapidly that they are barely visible. His legs strike the punching bag with great force. The old man named @ORGANIZATION1 shouts, 'My boy, @CAPS1!' @CAPS2 comments, 'You are lacking patience.' Then, the old man blindfolds the boy named @CAPS3 and starts throwing sand - bags at him. The first bag hits the boy on the head, but he kicks the second one, bursting it open. @CAPS2 grabs the third bag and uses it to block the fourth. Through this experience, the boy learns to be patient and wait for the enemy to strike first.
192	18049	7	2	"One time, when @PERSON1's @CAPS1 wouldn't work, everyone sat down quietly. The whole hour was taken up. There was a bit of chatter here and there, but mostly everyone was quiet as a group of students helped her. We were going to watch a movie about @NUM1 themes of @CAPS2. However, when she tried to play the movie, it didn't display properly. You could hear it but not see it. At the end of the hour, you could see it but not hear it. @PERSON1 said the next day, ""It worked for all the other classes."" She gave us fruit snacks for being so patient and managed to get the movie working. First, it was in black - and - white, then she jiggled a card and it showed color. That was the @NUM2 time I was patient. I was patient with the teacher, and she was proud of me, and I was proud of myself too. I couldn't believe what I did for @PERSON1. Then it happened again. This time, she let everyone just relax in their chairs and talk with friends, but I just watched her fix her @CAPS1. The next day, she didn't give us a treat because the treat was just chilling in our chairs and chatting with friends. That was a time when my classmates and I showed patience."
193	18050	7	2	When I was being patient, we had to wait in line for a @CAPS1 coaster. I was scared, and some kids in the line were impatient and wanted to get on the @CAPS2 quickly. I patiently waited until we got on. I was very frightened while on the coaster. But when I got off, I had a smile on my face. I'm glad I was patient. Patience allowed me to have this experience, and I realized that being patient can lead to positive outcomes.
194	18051	7	2	"Patience is important, and people should never rush things. All one needs to do is take their time and wait. If one is not patient, certain things won't happen. One day at @ORGANIZATION1, my cousin Shayna was impatient because she wanted to get on the dance box. However, a little girl named @ORGANIZATION2 was on it, and Shayna was unhappy. As is typical for girls, she got an attitude. Shayna got angry, started crying, and rolled her eyes at @ORGANIZATION2. Then she came up to me and said, ""She won't let me get on."" I replied, ""@PERSON1`@CAPS2, you have to be patient and wait your turn. She was on it first, and it would be rude and unfair to make her get off."" @PERSON1`@CAPS2 apologized, and they both took turns on the dance box. In the end, @PERSON1`@CAPS2 was happy and learned the importance of patience."
195	18052	7	2	A time when I was patient was when my mom broke her hip. After the accident, she moved even slower than my grandpa. You might wonder how this relates to patience. Well, I had to follow her everywhere. If I wasn't patient, my mother's condition could have worsened. It took her nearly fifteen minutes to walk to her bedroom. Normally, I'm not a patient person, but in this situation, I had to be. I'm glad that on @DATE1, I was patient because it has made me more patient than before. My mom is proud of my behavior as I stepped up to help her when she needed it. Being patient is a good thing as it makes you view life differently. I'm not glad that my mom got hurt, but I'm glad about the positive change in me as a result of this problem. After this accident, I've learned that everyone needs a bit of patience, just like I did in this situation. Without my mom's accident, I might not have realized how important patience can be.
196	18053	7	2	"I have a friend named @PERSON1. She is an exemplary individual who consumes all her vegetables, diligently completes her homework, and consistently achieves straight A's. However, @PERSON1 has a single shortcoming: she lacks patience.  One Saturday night, @PERSON1 and I decided to visit the movie theater. As expected, it was quite crowded. There was a long queue to purchase the tickets. @PERSON1 looked at me and let out a groan. I consoled her, saying, ""Be patient, @PERSON1. It will only take around ten minutes."" She groaned again and crossed her arms. I playfully told her, ""Get over it.""  After approximately two minutes, we were only five people away from the ticket counter. @PERSON1 started pacing back and forth as if she was in a dire situation. She began pulling her hair while I stared at her blankly. She ran up to me and exclaimed, ""@PERSON2, we have to reach that counter before I lose my temper!"" I gave her a look that conveyed my wish for her to be quiet. Then she nodded.  Throughout the night, I remained patient with @PERSON1, ensuring that she did not lose her composure. I kept my cool to prevent us from being kicked out. This experience taught me that one should always be patient, as impatience can lead to unfavorable outcomes."
197	18054	7	2	Today, I'm discussing patience. Patience means approaching something calmly or handling a situation with composure. For instance, I went to an ATM to withdraw money. I inserted my card and entered my PIN, then requested $@NUM1. However, the machine only gave me a receipt and neither dispensed cash nor returned my card. Instead of getting angry, I simply called the bank and retrieved my money and card.  Here's another example. I went to the mall to buy a pair of shoes. The shoes were originally priced at $110 but were on sale for $100. When I tried to purchase them, the cashier asked for $110. I informed him that the shoes were on sale, but he rudely told me to leave the store. I calmly returned the shoes and left.  These are instances when I demonstrated patience. Patience allows us to handle difficult situations more effectively and often leads to better outcomes.
198	18055	7	2	"I once demonstrated patience when I went to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 with my grandma, grandpa @PERSON1, and my brother @ORGANIZATION2. We were strolling around when we noticed a man drawing cartoon portraits of people. I pleaded with my grandma, ""Can we do that, please?"" She agreed.  My brother went first. I patiently waited for his turn to end. When his portrait was finished, we all had a good laugh. Then it was my turn. I sat on the seat, and the sun was directly shining on me. I felt extremely hot and was tempted to leave, but I remained patient. I didn't utter a word and just sat there with a smile on my face. The drawing, which took about @NUM1 minutes, felt like half an hour.  Finally, my portrait was done. I looked at it, laughed, and smiled. I really liked it. By being patient, I was able to get what I wanted. This was a memorable time when I showed patience at @ORGANIZATION1."
199	18056	7	2	"I'm not usually a patient person, but on this occasion, I made an exception. My brother, @PERSON1, ran into the car, escaping the pouring rain that set a gloomy mood that day. He opened the car door, and the first words out of his mouth were, ""We need to talk."" My mom responded, ""About what?""  I knew my mom didn't want to discuss what had happened to @PERSON1, who had received an in - school suspension, in front of me. If my brother hadn't cared about me hearing, I might not have been so patient. But this wasn't the right time to object.  @PERSON1 began to tell his story, and the atmosphere in the car became tense. ""Some so - called friends deliberately poured water on my sweatshirt. I went to tell the principal,"" he said. My mom interrupted, ""That's the right thing to do.""  @PERSON1 continued, ""The person who did it, @PERSON2, got in trouble and was put in timeout. When he came out, he started following me, and I felt threatened."" I held my breath and stared straight ahead. The tension was palpable.  My mom asked, ""Did you start punching him?"" @PERSON1 miserably admitted, ""Yes."" My mom scolded him, ""You need to find better ways to deal with your anger. There will be many unpleasant people in the world, and you can't just punch them.""  @PERSON1 replied, ""I know now. I'm sorry."" I timidly asked him, ""Would you like a hot dog when we get home?"" He responded in a rather mean tone, but I bit back any rude remarks. I understood that he had had a bad day.  On this day, I realized that being patient and understanding with my brother was the best course of action. I believe I gained a bit more patience that day."
200	18057	7	2	I showed patience at my mom's doctor's appointment. The healthcare facility was located on @LOCATION1 Road. It was a small place, and I had to wait in the lobby, which was quite boring at first.  I started watching Channel @NUM1 news, and it soon caught my interest. Then I went to the front counter, got a blue pen and a blank piece of paper, and began drawing. When I finished, the drawing resembled a car, as if it was seen from afar.  After that, I was looking for something else to do. I searched around and found a car magazine. It was filled with pictures of cool cars, including low - riders, exotics, and custom - made vehicles.  When my mom's appointment was over, I had patiently waited. Then we left and went home. This experience taught me that patience can make waiting times more bearable, even in uninteresting situations.
201	18058	7	2	"One time, I demonstrated patience while standing in line at the petting zoo. The animal I was eager to see was a donkey. It was a sweltering day around three in the afternoon. Unsurprisingly, the donkey was the crowd's favorite, with only a few people observing the other animals. In the donkey line, there were hundreds. I was roughly in the middle. I grew tired, but I was determined to see the donkey. I waited and waited. Finally, only a few people remained ahead of me, and I caught a glimpse of the donkey. A few minutes later, I was petting it. I thought to myself, ""Was all that patience worth it? Absolutely!"" I left the petting zoo content. I had never been that patient in my life, and I mentally congratulated myself."
202	18060	7	2	One time, I was at the doctor's office. There were a lot of people there. When my dad and I arrived, he suggested we leave due to the large crowd. But I said we should be punctual and wait, and he agreed. We waited as person after person was called. It took [@NUM1] hours before they called our names. We went in, and I got my five vaccine shots. Then we left, went home, and had dinner; we had taco salad. Despite the long wait, we managed to get through the visit, and the meal at home was a nice end to the day.
203	18061	7	2	I'm not usually a patient person, but last year, at the end of the school year, my older sister [@PERSON2] was having a baby. Since it was going to be my first nephew, I was eager to be there. So, I went to the hospital along with my grandma, mom, another sister, [@CAPS1], and my sister [@CAPS2]'s boyfriend. There were a lot of people, and not everyone could go in at the same time. I was too young to witness the birth and didn't want to anyway. My sister got mad because she couldn't go in either and left, but I stayed. It was incredibly boring, but I persevered. We arrived at nine, and it took [@NUM1] hours for the baby to be born. The baby was born around [@NUM2]. I went home to sleep at [@NUM3] and returned at [@NUM2]:00. We saw the baby at [@NUM5]. His name is [@CAPS3], and he is so adorable. I'm overjoyed to be his [@CAPS4]. Now, he's six months old, and I love seeing him. I hope that when he grows up, he'll know that I patiently waited for his arrival. Love, [@PERSON1].
204	18062	7	2	"A memorable instance of someone being impatient occurred in my science class during a lab project. It was quite amusing to me. My classmates and I were divided into groups and stationed at different areas of the lab. We were working on a plant - classification project, identifying the different characteristics of plants. Everyone was in a hurry to finish their projects by taping the plants onto their posters. After a scuffle with another group that was hogging the tape, our group finally got hold of it. Just as our group finished, two students from another group came to get tape. One of them started taking some pieces, and the other one thought it was taking too long. In a display of impatience, the waiting student exclaimed, ""[@CAPS1] [@CAPS2]!"" It was truly hilarious to witness such impatience in the middle of a lab."
205	18064	7	2	When I was [@NUM1] years old, I was patient while waiting for an item I ordered online. [@NUM2] days passed, and there was no sign of the package. A week later, a UPS truck stopped at our house, dropped off a package, and left. I was so excited that I didn't even check who it was for. I opened it and found Pampered Chef items, realizing it was for my mom. I was extremely angry. Another [@NUM3] weeks went by with no sign of my order. I was really upset and didn't know what to expect. Then, a UPS truck came again, and I didn't notice it at first. When I finally checked, there was my item in the package! I didn't even realize it until [@DATE1]. I was so happy to get it that I even forgot to order a game to go with it. That was the time I showed patience, and it all worked out in the end.
206	18065	7	2	"One day, a new and exciting game was released. A young boy, aware of its volumes @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, and the fact that @DATE1 was considered the ""hot volume,"" asked his mom for @PERCENT1. His mom inquired, ""What for?"" The boy replied, ""So I can buy this cool new game."" His mom explained, ""@CAPS3 your father and I have to pay bills and buy food."" The boy, in a disappointed voice, said, ""@CAPS4 I understand."" Then, when his hard - working father came home, the boy asked, ""@CAPS5, could I please get @NUM4 so I can buy this game?"" The father responded, ""@CAPS6, I know how much you want this game, but I'm sorry I need to help your mother pay bills."" The boy again said, ""@CAPS4 I understand."" Later, the boy's grandmother called and said, ""I need someone to cut my lawn for @NUM5."" The boy grinned and said, ""I'll be right over there."" He mowed the lawn with great excitement. Once he got the @NUM5, he went straight to the game store. When he arrived, he found the line was @DATE1 blocks long. His grandmother told him, ""Well, you gotta have patience."" As the boy was next in line, the story is to be continued."
207	18066	7	2	"One day, I went to the mall with Sharae and Reynal. Me and Reynal wanted to go to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, but Sharae wanted to go to Pac Sun. So, we were patient and let her go to that store. Then, me and Reynal wanted to go to @CAPS3, but Sharae wanted to go to @CAPS4. Again, we were patient and let her go. Next, me and Reynal wanted to go to @CAPS11, but Sharae wanted to go to @ORGANIZATION1. Finally, at @CAPS5, we said, ""Enough @CAPS6. WE @CAPS7 go to @CAPS11!!!"" She pleaded, ""Ok, ok, ok but can I just... no. Please, no, please. NO!"" Then she said, ""Alright @CAPS12 we'll go to @CAPS11. I was just gonna ask to go to the bathroom."
208	18067	7	2	"Patience is a valuable trait that can assist one in navigating through life. Being patient involves waiting calmly or being content. A ""patient"" typically refers to a person waiting to see a doctor. There are multiple interpretations of the term ""patient"", such as the noun ""a patient"" and the abstract concept of ""patience"". I'm going to discuss two of these meanings, perhaps not the ones you'd expect. I'll talk about a patient in the medical sense and the act of being patient. Although there's no pun intended, both remind me of a story.  One cold - seeming morning, I had to make a trip to the doctor's office. It wasn't a field trip or a vacation; I needed to get my yearly vaccine. I was probably just nervous, so the morning felt cold. When we arrived at the seemingly far - off doctor's office, the office staff called me and my dad to the front window. My dad said, ""I have an appointment for my son."" The lady at the window asked, ""The @NUM1 appointment?"" My dad replied, ""@CAPS1 that's the one."" Then she told us, ""Your son looks to be scheduled for a tetanus vaccine,"" and asked us to have a seat.  I waited patiently, reading my book. After some time, I started to get antsy and bored. I found myself fidgeting with my fingers in my pockets. My dad, who likes making funny remarks, said, ""You know what? You're a patient patient!"" I laughed, but my laughter was cut short when the doctor opened the door. Before I knew it, I was getting a needle in my arm. After that, I was fine. What I learned was that being a patient patient helped me stay calm during the vaccination. If I hadn't been patient, it might have been more painful. That day, I learned an important lesson about patience."
209	18068	7	2	This story revolves around Chicken Hound, the fox, and a time when he had to exercise patience. The scenario begins when the scourge condemns Chicken Hound and his mother, @PERSON1, to be boiled. They were both supposed to be killed and thrown into a ditch. However, Chicken Hound only fainted. When he regained consciousness, he assessed his situation and realized that he had to wait until nightfall to reach @CAPS1 wall. While waiting, insects swarmed around him.  Finally, when night covered the land, he rolled in the mud to stop further blood loss and then started his journey. Throughout this entire ordeal, Chicken Hound had to be patient, which was crucial for his survival and the start of his escape.
210	18070	7	2	Patience means waiting. One time, one of my brothers needed to be bailed out. We spent six hours trying to get him out, and we had to go to four different prisons. I was scared, but I knew that if I was patient, everything would turn out well. We had to bail him out before @NUM1 o'clock. We arrived at the prison as early as @NUM2 in the @TIME1. My mom was extremely nervous, and I repeatedly told her to calm down, assuring her that everything would be okay.  My cousin and I went in and asked if we could bail my brother out. They told us that they weren't doing bail - outs at that time and that it might be around @NUM3. So, we went to get something to eat. When we went back, they told us we had to sign a paper, which we did. By then, it was @NUM4 o'clock. They gave us something that we had to cash. We went to @NUM1 different stores, but they said they couldn't cash it. Eventually, we went to the Chase Bank and cashed it. Finally, we were able to take my brother out.
211	18071	7	2	I've employed patience on numerous occasions, such as when traveling with @ORGANIZATION1 on the bus, at home, and at school. The first instance I recall using patience was while fishing. At that time, I held my tweety @CAPS1 fishing rod in one hand and a bag of salt and vinegar in the other. As I waited for a fish, I encountered my friend Bubbles, a Norwegian goose that was perhaps about a week old. When we met, I offered him some of my bait. Since I guessed he liked worms, I gave him all my bait and set down my fishing pole. Just as I grabbed my chips, I felt a bite! It turned out to be a very small sunfish. Even to this day, I see Bubbles once a year as he lives near my favorite fishing spot. This year, he had two companions, two ducks I named @CAPS2 and @PERSON1. They are extremely friendly and have a fondness for Skittles. @CAPS2 is somewhat shy around other ducks, while @PERSON1 is quite content just sitting beside me or on a bench. Bubbles adores cheese and cuddling with his duck friends and me on the calm @DATE1 grass. This story is indeed true, and it showcases the power of patience.
212	18072	7	2	One year, my family and I planned to visit @LOCATION1 during the @DATE1 break. I was extremely excited about the trip, but we had to endure two long flights to reach our destination. We woke up very early to drive to the airport, and it took approximately @NUM1 hours to get there. After checking our bags, going through security, and searching for our plane, we discovered that it had been delayed. We spent a few hours sitting in the airport until the plane finally arrived. Once we disembarked, we went to find the next flight, only to learn that it too was delayed. We had to wait a few more hours before boarding the second plane. After another long flight, we finally reached @LOCATION1. This trip truly tested my patience as I was eagerly anticipating our arrival. In the end, despite the setbacks, the experience taught me the importance of remaining calm and patient in the face of unexpected delays.
213	18073	7	2	"Let me share my thoughts on patience. @PERSON2 and his mother were on their way to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. @PERSON2 had been waiting his entire life to visit this place. However, his mother received a call from his cousins, @PERSON3, Bob, and @PERSON1, who asked if they could join the trip. His mother readily agreed. Being a patient boy, @PERSON2 didn't object. Later, his mother got another call from his five friends, who also asked the same question. Once again, his mother said yes. Since each of his friends lived in a different and distant location, it took about twenty minutes to pick up each one. Finally, they were all on board. Although @PERSON2 was extremely frustrated, he managed to remain patient. When his mother received yet another call, @PERSON2 exclaimed, ""Who is it now?!"" It was his father calling from the @CAPS3, saying that he was there with @PERSON2's brother and sister and asking where they were. His mother replied, ""I'm pulling in now."" This story perfectly illustrates the virtue of patience, as @PERSON2 endured numerous interruptions and delays without losing his temper."
214	18074	7	2	"Hi, my name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and right now, I'm in school doing the meat testing routine. Well, let's talk about a time when I had to be extremely patient. I was looking forward to seeing the movie ""Eclipse"" from the Twilight Saga. We bought tickets about a month in advance, so I had to exercise a great deal of patience. As the days passed, time seemed to move incredibly slowly. I started thinking that if I stopped dwelling on it, the time might pass faster. So, I asked if I could go to a friend's house. She was also going to see the movie, so the month went by, and the night of @CAPS6 finally arrived. I was supposed to go and see the movie, but my friend called me. She said she was so excited that she couldn't sleep. I stayed up all night, constantly thinking about what was going to happen in the movie. Not knowing was driving me crazy. Finally, I fell asleep. Guess what? When I woke up, there were only @NUM2 more hours until I could get ready to watch ""Eclipse."" The time passed, and as soon as I woke up, I was ready to go. We finally made it to the theater, sat down in our seats, and watched the movie. It was a long wait, but I was patient. This experience taught me that patience is truly a virtue, especially when anticipating something exciting."
215	18075	7	2	"@PERSON2 and her twin brother, @PERSON1, were excitedly waiting in line for a concert. @PERSON1 disliked going places with his sister because he thought she was @CAPS6 weird. ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS2 whined. ""@CAPS3,"" @PERSON1 asked, taking an earbud out of his ear. ""@CAPS4, why did I have to come?"" @CAPS2 impatiently inquired. ""@CAPS6, you could learn to be patient, smart one,"" @PERSON2 said as she looked to see how many people were still in line. @PERSON2 put her earbud back in and played the song "" @CAPS7 @CAPS8 The @CAPS9 Of @CAPS10 @CAPS11"" by Allstar Weekend at full volume. Allstar Weekend was the amazing band they were going to see in concert. @PERSON2 had always been the patient twin, and in fact, that's what everyone called her. @CAPS2, on the other hand, was the complete opposite, the impatient twin. @PERSON2 actually enjoyed waiting as it made her even more excited for the event. When the time finally came to see the concert, @PERSON2 was glad she had been patient. She was ten times more excited than anyone else there. This shows that patience can enhance the enjoyment of an experience, and it's a quality that can truly make a difference."
216	18076	7	2	One time, I was very patient while waiting for my cousin, @PERSON1. We were walking around town, looking for some silly bans. First, we went to the @DATE1 store, but when we arrived, it was closed. So, we continued walking. Then, we saw my brother and another cousin, @CAPS1. They were on bikes, and we were on foot. @CAPS1 told us there was a @PERSON2 store down the road, so we walked there. After that, @CAPS1 and my brother let us get on the bikes and they walked. We went to @ORGANIZATION1 to check the prices. Some coats cost @MONEY1, and some cost @MONEY2. Then we went to the @PERSON2 tree, where there were items priced at @MONEY3, but @PERSON1 didn't like them, so we didn't buy. We searched everywhere, but when we found what we were looking for, @PERSON1 didn't want them. Finally, we went to my grandma's house. She asked where we'd been all day, and I said we'd been looking for silly bans. Grandma advised me not to always follow @PERSON1's lead and to listen to my mom. I tried to be patient and not get angry at @LOCATION1.
217	18077	7	2	There was a day, @DATE1@NUM1, when report cards came out. My grades were good; I had @NUM2. However, my friend @PERSON1 was failing math with an @CAPS1. She knew if her mom saw it, she'd be in trouble. @PERSON1 tried to cross out the grade and put a good one, but she knew her mom would find out. So, she told her mom that the report cards hadn't come out yet, and her mom believed her. Then, she attempted to re - print the report card. She called me for my opinion. I gave my honest thought and said @CAPS2, but also mentioned that it could avoid trouble. When her mom asked if the report cards had come out, she said yes. Her mom discovered it was a fake report card, called the teachers, and found out the grade was fake. @PERSON1 got in trouble but was patient and told the truth. Her mom went to the office to get the real grades. Even though @PERSON1 lied and tried to change her grade, she was honest and patient about it in the end. I admit it was wrong of me to give the okay, but she begged me so she wouldn't get in trouble.
218	18078	7	2	"Have you ever experienced the rewards of being patient? I have. I was sitting in the waiting room at @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1 @CAPS2, planning to get my @CAPS1 washed, deep - conditioned, and flat - ironed. The lady at the front desk called me and said, ""I'm sorry, but @PERSON1 won't be here today. Is there anyone else you'd like to do your @CAPS1?"" I was perplexed and asked if @CAPS3 @CAPS4 was available. She replied that @CAPS4 was with a client and could take me the next day at three o'clock. I agreed, though I was a bit disappointed. However, when I walked outside, it was raining. I realized it was actually a good thing I didn't get my @CAPS1 done. Clearly, being patient has its advantages."
219	18079	7	2	"I showed patience on a trip to @CAPS1, the largest indoor water park. We were on the way, and our robotic @CAPS3 announced ""@CAPS2 time @NUM1"". But it was only @NUM2, which meant I'd have to be in the car for almost three more hours. I thought it was unfair, but I knew I had to be patient if I wanted to reach @CAPS1. I told my mom I needed to go to the bathroom. She asked if I could hold it, which I thought was ridiculous as I felt like I was about to burst. She said we could pull over, but it would add to our @CAPS2 time. I ran out of the car, yelling back at her. When I got back in, the @CAPS3 said ""@CAPS2 time @NUM3"", which meant no more bathroom breaks. I'd have to hold it if I needed to go again. After an hour or two, the @CAPS3 announced we'd arrive at the destination on the left. I screeched with excitement and rushed out of the car towards the main entrance of @CAPS1. But then I saw a sign saying the water park was closed. My dad patted my shoulder and said we might try the next day. Unfortunately, it was still closed the next day because they were working on many rides, which was dangerous. We were supposed to leave the next day, and the park was closed until five, but we had to check out at @TIME1. Dad decided we could stay one more night. Finally, I got to go into the park. That was when I showed patience."
220	18080	7	2	In my opinion, patience means being calm and not being bothered by what others are doing. For example, when your mom is shopping for a long time and you want to go to the video - game store but you stay with her, that's a good sign of patience. A bad sign is throwing a tantrum in the store. At an amusement park, if there's a long line and you don't complain, that's a very good sign of patience. Complaining the whole time is a bad sign. When waiting for your big sister to get out of the bathroom and just waiting quietly, that's a good sign. Breaking down the door and having to pay for the damage is a bad sign. If you're locked out and go to a friend's house patiently, that's also a good sign of patience. In conclusion, patience is shown in various situations, and how we react determines whether it's a good or bad display of this virtue.
221	18081	7	2	One morning, while at my cottage, I witnessed a large bass leap out of the water. I patiently ate breakfast before deciding to go fishing. My younger brother also wanted to join, so I waited as he prepared his new bait and then went outside with him. Once we were out front, he caught a small bass. I removed it from the hook and took him to show our parents his catch. Little did I know that a massive @NUM1 - pound bass was lurking nearby. On my very first cast, a huge bass took my bait. Initially, I thought I'd caught a carp, but when I saw that @NUM1 - pound bass jump with my bait in its mouth, I was shaking with excitement. When I showed the fish to my dad, he was nearly faint, and the same reaction came from my mom, brother Cody, and me. Currently, that fish is at the taxidermist.
222	18082	7	2	One day on my way to school, I picked up my friend. He told me about his new game, Call of Duty: World at War, and kept talking about what he did online in the game. During the last class of the day, he sat next to me and said he couldn't wait to go home and play it. I said it was cool, and then he started complaining that he had to wait another hour. I advised him to be patient. He agreed, saying it wasn't going anywhere and he could play it anytime. Then he invited me to his place to play. We went to his house and played the game. I reminded him to always be patient until the right time comes.
223	18083	7	2	The time I demonstrated patience was when I was waiting for the new game Kill Zone @NUM1. I had to gather @NUM2 dollars - @NUM3 for the game and @NUM4 to put it on hold. As soon as the store had it on the shelves, I got it. The manager was taking them out, so I grabbed one and made the purchase. I went home, plugged in my PlayStation, and started playing online. I now have a total of @NUM1,190. Overall, the game is quite difficult. On the first day, there were store managers around, one in the back. I don't recommend this game for those under @NUM6.
224	18084	7	2	"One day, my family and I were on our way to @PERSON1 to visit Jimmy, who was working on fixing a belt - line in @LOCATION2. After my brother and I got home from school, we set off for @LOCATION2. During our journey, we saw many things, such as the city of @LOCATION4 and its numerous buildings. Then we saw a sign saying ""You are now leaving @LOCATION3"" and another indicating ""You are now entering @LOCATION1"". That's when we encountered a traffic jam. We were passing through @LOCATION5 at @NUM1.m, which wasn't a very smart move. The worst part was the waiting, which lasted for hours. We found ways to amuse ourselves, like watching the sea @PERSON2's waves and looking at the buildings. This experience is an example of patience."
225	18086	7	2	I showed patience during a doctor's appointment. I stood there calmly and quietly. When the doctor called my name, I wasn't nervous. The doctor gave me @NUM1, something that @CAPS1 didn't have. After that, my mom and I went home happily. We got some food and watched @CAPS2. Then we had spaghetti and went to bed early for school. The next day, in @NUM2 grade while in the land, I had a good day at school. When I got home, I did my homework, cleaned the house, watched @CAPS2, had dinner, and then went to bed early for a fresh start.
226	18087	7	2	On my birthday, about a week prior, my dad and I ordered an @CAPS1 girl doll. I was extremely excited as it was my first doll. However, shipping became an issue. During the week of my birthday, I constantly awaited the arrival of the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 truck. I was disappointed because it was shipped from @LOCATION1, and it shouldn't have taken that long. Another week passed, and it still hadn't arrived. I had to exercise great patience. Although I could track it online, I remained unhappy. The reason for the long wait was that once it reached its destination, it was kept at the post office. Eventually, my mom inquired about when it would be sent, and the lady said it was on the way. A few minutes later, the doorbell rang. When I opened the package, I let out a scream. The wait was truly worth it.
227	18088	7	2	Personally, I don't have any patience. I prefer things to happen quickly and dislike it when people do things slowly. In conclusion, patience is not a virtue I possess, and I find it difficult to tolerate slow - paced activities.
228	18089	7	2	Patience is not an innate trait; it is a skill that one must acquire. A three - hour car ride serves as a prime example, just as I experienced. As we prepared to travel to @CAPS1 city, I was brimming with excitement. I had already packed my suitcase, but my parents were still lingering. I exclaimed, “Please finish packing! I really want to go!” My dad replied, “You'll just have to wait a minute.” Unable to contain my impatience, I grabbed my things, threw them in the car trunk, and went to the kitchen to read a book while they finished packing. After they were done, my dad was carrying the last of the bags from their bedroom. When he noticed me sitting patiently, he thanked me and said, “Thanks for being so patient. Mom and I have a surprise for you.” He put down the bags, walked briskly to a white plastic bag, and pulled out a rectangular gift. It was exactly what I had hoped for. I was overjoyed and thanked him. This incident clearly shows that patience pays off, as long as one refrains from complaining.
229	18090	7	2	When I was @NUM1 years old, my mom woke me up on @DATE1, saying it was time to go to the dentist on @DATE2. I initially said I wanted to sleep, but she insisted. I popped up and started screaming, and she told me to be quiet as others in the house were trying to sleep. I agreed and then went to grab some clothes as she asked. On the way, I kept saying I was going to the dentist to get stickers. When we arrived at the parking lot, I said, “We're here.” After she parked the car, I opened the door. My mom signed us in, and we sat down. There were a lot of people in the waiting area. @NUM3 minutes later, they called our names. I almost yelled but held back. The dentist lady took me to the room and told me to lift my head so she could put a device on. Then the male doctor came in and said they were going to clean my teeth. I started crying because I thought it would hurt. They put the device on my teeth and assured me it wouldn't. @NUM4 minutes later, they were done. The female dentist said I could pick @NUM5 stickers. I was so happy to finally get the stickers. After we left, we got in the car, and I fell asleep. That was the day I showed patience.
230	18091	7	2	One day, I had to be patient. It all began when I raked some leaves with the expectation of getting paid for my work. I wanted the payment right away, specifically on the day @CAPS1. However, I had to exercise patience. In the end, waiting for the payment taught me the importance of being patient in such situations.
231	18092	7	2	One of my experiences of showing patience occurred when I was at my uncle's place. I wanted to play with a toy. There were about five other kids there too. I asked if I could play, and I was told to be patient. So, I sat quietly and waited. It felt like I waited for at least an hour or two, not uttering a single complaint. Eventually, I got my turn to play. That's my story of being patient.
232	18093	7	2	I was with @PERSON1 when I was about to have an allergy test. I sat and waited for @NUM1 hours. I played with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for an hour and then watched TV. I got so restless that I started pacing, and my parents had to stop me from leaving @NUM2 times. On the sixth time, I almost left the floor. Then it was time for me to go to the angio room. It was a struggle as I wanted to walk, but they insisted I shouldn't. They prevailed. After the angio, I had to lie flat for @NUM2 hours. Finally, I was able to go home.
233	18094	7	2	@NUM1 years ago, the immigration limit was reached. To become @CAPS1 @CAPS2, we needed green cards. So, we went to an immigration center in a hurry. We approached the front desk and informed the lady of our arrival. She directed us to the waiting area. There were approximately @NUM2 people there. I knew at that moment that we would be there for a while. In the waiting area, I had no means of entertainment. It clearly stated at the front that gaming devices, musical devices were not allowed, and all phones had to be switched off. It was torture. After about an hour and a half, they called our name. I was extremely pleased. After getting our fingerprints taken and completing all the procedures, we walked to the car. My mom said she was very satisfied with my behavior in the office.
234	18095	7	2	I recall a time when I demonstrated great patience. I used to be able to wait for anything. Once, I asked my mom for a game, and she said she'd get it tomorrow. But she actually got it on the same day I asked. I once thought I was the most patient person in my family. I'm so patient that I can wait a month before going to Cedar Point. I believe patience is something you're born with. Some of my friends are patient, but they can't wait as long as I can. Some even ask me to teach them how to be patient. I always tell them the same thing: you have to be born with it; it's not something you learn over time. I can go three weeks without getting paid by my dad. Some people become less patient as they age, but that's not true for everyone. I know that someday, when I get older, my patience might be like everyone else's. Who knows, maybe there's someone in the world more patient than me.
235	18096	7	2	I've shown patience on many occasions, but I think the most patience I've ever had was while hunting. You simply have to sit quietly and stay still. I went hunting behind my house with my uncle @PERSON1. We arrived there at 6 a.m. and waited until 9 p.m. Finally, the deer started to appear. One deer got close enough for me to take a shot. I drew my bow and shot, but it was so dark that I could hardly see, and I missed. My uncle didn't even see the deer until the last second. When I released the arrow, I knew right away that I'd missed. All we could hear was the deer running away and the arrow crashing through the leaves. Later that night, we went home, extremely hungry.
236	18097	7	2	"A warm tear trickled down my cheek as the hot wind blew my blond hair away from my face. All I could think about was why God had to take her so soon. Let's rewind a week. We'd just learned that my grandmother was soon going to heaven with the angels. The very next day, we were on a plane headed to @LOCATION1. This was my dad's mother. He remained calm then, but we all had to be patient with him since he was the closest to her among the @NUM1 children. During the entire @NUM2 - hour flight, we were in turbulence. That meant we couldn't get up, have food, use the restroom, and we had that queasy feeling in our stomachs. It was the worst flying experience I've ever had. I fly often, but this time was truly horrible! We had to make @NUM3 stops before reaching @LOCATION1. Then we waited another @NUM4 minutes for our bags. I was so relieved to get out of that death - trap! When we reached the house, I had my last moments with my grandmother. It's a memory I'll never forget. The stubborn little smirk on her face when we walked in was priceless. One thing I'll always remember is the nickname she gave me, ""chicken little."" This experience taught me the value of being there for loved ones in their final moments."
237	18098	7	2	"@CAPS1! @CAPS1! @CAPS1!"" @PERSON2 exclaimed, ""I wanna go first!"" In cheerleading, this girl named @PERSON2 always thought she should be first at everything. My name is @PERSON3. I'm always a flyer, just like @PERSON2. I'm usually patient and wait my turn because I don't want to complain or be a problem. "" @CAPS3 set! @NUM1, @NUM2 down up @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6,"" the two bases and backspots shouted. They popped @CAPS4 out and up and then screamed, ""@CAPS5!"" ""@CAPS6 job,"" @CAPS7 said. ""@CAPS8, it's my turn. @PERSON3, you can do this. You're better than her,"" I thought to myself. "" @CAPS9 we can do this,"" one of our bases, @PERSON1, said. I got into the @CAPS3 position, hands on shoulders, ready to be popped up into the air. Our other base @CAPS10 said, ""@NUM1, @NUM2 down up! Okay, @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6 - @CAPS5!"" ""@CAPS6 job @CAPS12!"" @CAPS13 cheered, but the attempt didn't fully succeed. ""I was so excited. I just did a pop @CAPS5 without messing up my @CAPS5,"" I thought with excitement. Being patient can be rewarding. From that day on, I've always tried to be patient. It helps you understand what you need to work on and what you're good at."
238	18099	7	2	"Are you good at being patient? Sometimes I am, but sometimes I'm not. I'm going to tell you a story about a time when I was patient, even though I'm usually not in situations like this. I went to school with my mom so she could take a test and then drop me at the mall to meet my friends. While waiting, I was texting and on the internet. Then my stomach started to rumble; I was hungry. I wanted to text my mom and make her hurry so I could get something to eat. But as I was about to text, I stopped and thought about how hard she'd studied for that test. I didn't want her to get a bad grade, so I just sat there. I texted other people and took calls, which took my mind off food. After my mom finished her test, she came out of the room. I asked her, "" @CAPS5 did it go?"" She looked at me, smiled, and said, ""I felt confident, but now I'm hungry."" I shouted, ""Me too!"" We got in the car and went to Subway. I had the forest now meal with cookies, chips, and a drink. It was delicious. My mom dropped me off at the mall, and I told my friends what happened. We laughed for some reason. Then we went to @ORGANIZATION1, Charlete, @CAPS7, @PERSON1, and other places. Later, I thought about it and decided I never want to do that again. I was so bored, and my butt started to hurt. I sat there for @NUM1 hours with nothing to do. But at least I had some bonding time with my mom, which was a bright side."
239	18100	7	2	One time I showed patience was when I was at school. I was sitting in my seat, waiting for my science teacher to call my name so I could get ready to leave. The teacher was calling students one by one to stand by the door to go to their next classes. I patiently sat there, knowing my turn would come. Eventually, my teacher called my name, and I was able to move on to my next class. This simple experience taught me that patience in small situations can make the daily routine go smoothly.
240	18102	7	2	"One instance when I demonstrated patience was when I ordered a @CAPS1 online. It was a cool @DATE1 @TIME1. After reaching the shipping section, I paid and went to the checkout screen. There, I saw it would take @NUM1 weeks for the @CAPS1 to reach my home. "" @CAPS3?! That's a long time,"" I exclaimed. But it was decided; I had to wait @NUM1 weeks. I was prepared. I waited and waited and waited some more. Then, on one @DATE2, I saw a @CAPS1. The address on it read ""@CAPS6 @CAPS7""! I was extremely happy. This incident taught me that one should always be patient because, in the end, you'll likely get what you want."
241	18103	7	2	Patient @PERSON2.Hay, when will the food be here? (@PERSON1 asked). You have to be patient, @PERSON2 replied. Well, in that case, @CAPS1, @PERSON1 said. Well, you will have to wait, okay. @CAPS2, here's your food. (Yes, @PERSON1 shouted. Patience is always the key. @PERSON2, I'm done. Let's go, @PERSON1 said. Hold on, I haven't finished my food. Hurry, have patience. Fine, I'm done.) Wow, that... Patience is the... Are you ready? Yup, off we go. Success! Lala - wait, you posted it. And @PERSON1, all right, btd an. @CAPS3, hurry, have patience, @PERSON1 said. Fine, I'll just go slower, @PERSON2 said. @CAPS4, I'll have patience. We're here... @NUM1 min. This is good news. That was a good... Right, @CAPS3? I'm dad. You have @CAPS3... now. So, thanks. Hey, @PERSON2, look at that dumb person talking down to us. Where? @PERSON2 replied. The @NUM2 story building. @CAPS4, watch out, @PERSON2 said. Patience, @PERSON1 said. You don't need patience. Yes, I do. Just... I told... Splat, @CAPS3. If only I wasn't so patient.
242	18105	7	2	Have you ever had to wait in a line for @NUM1 hour? That's exactly how it was for me and @CAPS1. We were at Cedar Point and decided to ride the Top Thrill Dragster as soon as we arrived. However, the line had about a three - hour wait, but we still queued up. After the first hour of waiting, it felt like three. I knew I had to be patient and relax, but time seemed to stand still. After another hour, my stomach started growling. I checked my watch; it was @NUM2. We had arrived at @NUM3. I was starving and tired, but I persevered. Finally, an hour later, it was our turn. When I got off the ride, I knew that being patient was worth it. In conclusion, I learned that patience is essential in many aspects of life.
243	18106	7	2	"Don't you ever wish everyone in the world could be patient? Well, I do. Once, I wasn't a well - behaved girl and did something I wasn't supposed to. Fortunately, my great parents tried their best to be patient with me. Like all parents, they had to give me a lecture about my actions and didn't let me off the hook easily. "" @CAPS1 @CAPS2, please come down to the office,"" I heard over the announcement. As I walked down the hallway, I was really nervous and kept asking myself, ""What have I done?"" By the time I reached the office, I said, ""Yes"" to the person there. ""Do you know why you're here?"" @CAPS3 asked. ""No,"" I replied. ""@CAPS4, I've been getting some complaints from these girls,"" @CAPS3 told me. ""@CAPS4, oh, yeah,"" I said. ""@CAPS4, yeah, what?"" @CAPS3 asked. ""The only reason I was being mean was that they were being mean and so full of themselves. They told my friends that the only reason I hung out with them was because they had money, which wasn't true,"" I explained. ""Okay, I understand where you're coming from. Let me call them down,"" @CAPS3 said. ""@CAPS5 and Alyssa, come down to the office, please."" I could hear their footsteps as they came down the hallway. I really didn't want to talk to them, and the situation continued."
244	18107	7	2	One thing I have very little patience for is the MEAP. I'm not patient with it because it's extremely boring. You can't talk during it, and it's just dull. I hate the MEAP; it's very difficult. You don't see ten - year - olds or @CAPS1 doing the MEAP. The MEAP expects you to do too much work. It's one of the reasons I dislike Michigan. The MEAP asks questions with words you've never seen or heard before. In my opinion, if we're going to have the MEAP, they should ask questions and use words that we know. Another thing I don't like is that they grade our writing based on their opinions, on what they think of it. To me, the MEAP is stupid. If I had a choice, I'd choose not to do it. But since it's important for my grade, I do it. These are the reasons why I'm very impatient with the MEAP.
245	18108	7	2	"When I was little, I was patient. I would always sit and wait for directions, and my mom always liked that about me. Now, since @CAPS1 is bigger, she thinks @CAPS1 is impatient. @CAPS5, what? @CAPS1, no, I'm patient. I get along well. I'm not antsy. I'm not the type who says, ""When are we going, you guys?"" That was when I was @CAPS4 learning how to speak. I guess that's how it goes. And @TIME1, I was patient because my mom and dad were having a talk, and I didn't want to hear it. It was a serious talk. In conclusion, my patience has been a part of me since I was young, and though others may think differently as I've grown, I still believe I possess this virtue."
246	18109	7	2	My mom is patient even though I frequently use her phone to text my girlfriend and call friends. She informs me when she needs to use it and asks me to stop using it at that time. This shows her understanding and patience in dealing with my phone - using habits.
247	18110	7	2	There was a time when I had to be patient for a @ORGANIZATION1. For @CAPS1, my mom told me she was getting me a @ORGANIZATION1. I was overjoyed. But when @CAPS1 arrived and I opened the presents, there was no @ORGANIZATION1. She said she'd get it on @DATE1 when taxes came, so I had to wait for @NUM2 months and a few days. I was angry as I thought she already had it. I had to go to school and wait. The days seemed to stretch on; I got angrier and angrier. Those @NUM2 months felt like the longest ever, like a year had passed. After @DATE2, it was finally @DATE1, but I didn't get the @ORGANIZATION1 until the end of the month. It was a huge disappointment. However, when I finally got it, it was amazing to play with the games, apps, and controllers. A @ORGANIZATION1 is expensive, so I keep it in a special place away from little kids. I rarely let them play with it, only under my supervision. I learned that waiting for something you really want can be tough, but once you get it, you must take good care of it.
248	18112	7	2	The first time I babysat was for @NUM1 little girls, a toddler named @PERSON1 and a baby named @CAPS1. After their parents left, everything was going well until @CAPS1 started crying uncontrollably. At first, I thought she was saying “@CAPS3, @CAPS3!”, but then I realized she was saying “@CAPS5, @CAPS5!”. Her @CAPS5 is a blanket. When I gave it to her, she stopped crying immediately. I'm glad I was patient enough to figure out what she wanted. I hope that in future babysitting jobs, I'll be just as patient.
249	18114	7	2	One of the most memorable times I had to be patient was when I ordered my first classical guitar from a reputable guitar website recommended by my guitar teacher. I waited and waited. Finally, when I got the guitar and took it out of the @CAPS3, it was chipped. I was extremely angry. We sent it back for a new one. Around @DATE2, I got another guitar. I thought it was new, but when I opened it, it was the same one I'd sent back. I was even more furious. We sent it back again, hoping to finally get the right one. On @DATE1, I got my guitar. I was so happy this time. I was eagerly looking forward to my guitar arriving on @DATE3, which is my birthday. Patience was really tested during this whole process, but in the end, it was worth it.
250	18115	7	2	Patience is a challenging skill for some, and I'm one of them. Even as a little girl, I had no patience, and that hasn't changed. However, my friend is always patient with me. She'd tell me to hurry up or she'd leave, but I'd just laugh and come right away. She'd wait while I picked up a stray cat and took it to the pound. Once, she waited for @NUM1 hours to learn about history. I wouldn't have had the patience for that. She did well on her @CAPS2 homework, which shows that her patience paid off. She always says that patience is a top priority. I may not learn patience until @CAPS1, but I'm sure I'll learn it someday. This experience with my friend taught me the value of patience.
251	18116	7	2	On a bright sunny day, a long line formed outside the airport. People were waiting for their flight to @LOCATION1. After three hours, impatience set in among the crowd, yet a young boy remained calm and patient. As five hours passed, the flight was delayed, the sun went down, and a riot broke out. Still, the boy waited patiently. By midnight, twelve hours had passed, and people began to leave. But the boy stayed put. At dusk, only fifteen people were left, and the boy was still there. When the flight finally arrived, only three people were present and they boarded the plane. Those who had left saw the plane ready to take off and ran towards it, but it was too late. Only the two girls and the patient boy made it to @LOCATION1. The end.
252	18117	7	2	Patience is a challenging virtue. Whether it's waiting in line or for a letter in the mail, it tests our resolve. I experienced this when I came up with a great poem. I learned about a book where one could submit poems for possible inclusion. I worked hard for a couple of days and managed to write @NUM1 lines. With no more ideas, I submitted it. The website stated that the response letter would arrive in @NUM2 to @NUM3 business days. I waited for a long time. @NUM2 months after sending the poem, I received an apology letter for the long wait. In the letter, it was mentioned that I had shown patience. In conclusion, this experience taught me the value of patience in the face of uncertainty.
253	18118	7	2	One day, I had to do something I didn't want to. If I didn't, I couldn't go anywhere or to the movies. I was at my aunt's house, and she asked me to clean it before she returned. I was the only one there, but I wasn't keen on the task. Later, at @CAPS1 point, everyone went on a scary high - in - the - sky ride, taking off their shoes. Then we got something to eat. The next day, after waking up at the hotel, we went home, had breakfast. I didn't want to ride my uncle's four - wheeler down the hill, but he started it and pushed it. I was wearing knee pads, elbow pads, and gloves. When I got to my grandma's house, I didn't want to help, but my mom made me. As a result, no one went outside to play football. I watched the game through the window as I was still working on the wall. It was a good game, but I was impatient because I wasn't part of it. In the end, that day was filled with tasks I didn't want to do but had to.
254	18119	7	2	Today, I had to be patient during the @CAPS1.E.A.P. When we entered the classroom, no one wanted to take the test. The teacher told us to write on five pages and finish part two on @DATE1. When we got the packet, we had to bubble in answers and fill out something on the front. We also had to write our names before taking a break. After the break, we got a free - reading book, and the teacher read the directions. When some students finished early, they got bored and started talking. The teacher went to the bathroom, and while she was away, the guys made paper basketballs and shot them into a small hoop. When the teacher returned, she told us to start the last writing session, which might go through lunch. Everyone was freaking out, but I remained patient throughout. This experience made me realize the importance of patience in difficult situations.
255	18120	7	2	I had to exercise patience during my first NASCAR race. There were a lot of people, and I didn't want to end up last. I had to wait for the people in front to get to their seats. Finally, we got ours, and I had to sit next to a scary and weird person. As the race was about to start, the racers got into their cars, jets flew over us, and the @ORGANIZATION1 was in action. Then the racers took off. My favorite racer, @PERSON1, was in the lead. The cars were speeding around, and I could feel the bleachers shake. It was a fun experience, but it required me to stay close, listen, and be patient. This race taught me that patience can enhance the enjoyment of an exciting event.
256	18121	7	2	I am not a patient person; I'm only patient once in a while. Sitting still and doing nothing drives me crazy. When I'm idle and it's extremely quiet, I get terrible headaches. For instance, in school when I'm waiting, I become restless. I tap my foot, my pencil on the desk, and pretty much everything around me. I have to be doing something, or I'll lose my mind. Waiting in a doctor's office or on a plane for some time can be incredibly boring. If I wait too long, I feel lazy and tired because I'm not moving at all. I get antsy when I have to be patient and wait for something. Usually, within half an hour, I start to feel really bad. I can't be patient for long; otherwise, I become irritable. One way I cope is by playing sports and staying constantly active.
257	18123	7	2	Patience is the capacity of an individual to wait and make sound decisions. For me, it is the ability to remain calm. Patience is of great significance as it enables me to rationally handle situations, thus preventing me from getting into trouble. However, exercising patience during stressful times is challenging. This is because people may put pressure on you. Without patience, individuals tend to make poor decisions, which in turn leads to unfavorable outcomes. Patience allows me to deal with unwise ideas, such as [the @CAPS2í@CAPS3]. By exercising patience, I can address the problem and then move forward. [The @CAPS2í@CAPS3] are indeed a very bad idea. In conclusion, patience is an essential quality that helps us navigate difficult situations and avoid making hasty and regrettable decisions.
258	18124	7	2	"It was the night before @CAPS1 Eve, and I could hardly contain my excitement. In my family, on @CAPS1 Eve, we go to my grandparents' house. As my mom, dad, and I drove up to the house, I couldn't open the car door fast enough. I sprinted up to the front door and rang the doorbell repeatedly. ""Hello there, @CAPS4,"" my grandpa said. ""Grandpa, can we eat quickly so I can open my presents?"" I asked. ""Yeah, sure,"" he replied. After we finished eating, I dashed down the stairs as fast as I could. I was so eager. I waited patiently as all my older relatives opened their presents. Finally, it was my turn. I tore off the wrapping paper and saw that it was a game. Since it was the first present, I opened it in a hurry, but from then on, I waited patiently for my next turn. This @CAPS1 Eve was filled with anticipation and joy, and the experience of waiting for my presents taught me a bit about patience."
259	18126	7	2	I saw someone being patient. They got to a restaurant before I did. Then I ordered my food, and it arrived. Meanwhile, they still hadn't received their food. I left, and finally, they got their food. That's what I call patience. It shows that sometimes, waiting can pay off, even if it seems like a long time. In this case, that person's patience was rewarded when their food finally came.
260	18127	7	2	When I was seven, I played on a basketball team called the @CAPS1. We were playing against the @CAPS2 for the championship, and I wasn't initially in the game. My coach told me to stay on the bench because I was the least - experienced player on the team. Without me, our team was down by @NUM1 points, and the coach still didn't put me in. I knew that if I stayed calm and patient, the coach would let me play. With a minute left in the game on @DATE1 and our team down by @NUM2 points, the coach told me to get in and win the game for us. I got in with @NUM3 seconds left. I got the ball and started making shots. But with @NUM1 seconds left and our team down by @NUM5 points, I got fouled. I had to take a technical shot. I made the first shot easily, but for the second one, I was unsure. Then I thought about the patience I'd shown to get into the game. I took my time, got patient, and thought through the shot. When I took it, I made it. After that, when the other team tried to inbound the ball, we stole it and won the game. If I hadn't been patient in that game, we wouldn't have won, and I wouldn't have gotten to take the trophy home. This experience taught me the importance of patience in achieving success.
261	18128	7	2	On the day my grandma passed away, I was astonished by my mom's patience as she typically has very little. Amidst the sorrow of that terrible day, when all of us just wanted to cry, she took her time carefully and slowly, as if each movement had to be flawless. She knew that my grandma would have wanted her to be happy, so she was mindful of her every action. As soon as I arrived, she immediately came up to me and gave me a big hug. No matter what my little brother and I did, she didn't mind at all. It was truly a surprising day because I had never seen her so sad yet so patient before. This experience showed me a different side of my mom, and it left a deep impression on me.
262	18129	7	2	On my twelfth birthday, I demonstrated patience. All my friends, except one, wanted to keep playing. We decided to walk the dogs, have dinner, and then open presents. I was really excited to see my presents when we finally got to that part. I was proud of myself for prioritizing what my friends wanted to do. In the end, I received a lot of exciting gifts, and I realized that waiting and putting my friends' wishes first was a great decision. I'm quite certain that we all had a wonderful time that day, and it taught me the value of patience and consideration for others.
263	18130	7	2	One day, @PERSON1 was swinging with her friend all day. She was swinging so high that the chain came loose, and she fell, screaming in pain. They then walked into the house. Once inside, with @PERSON1 still screaming and crying, they all got in the car and drove to the doctor's. The nurse informed them that @PERSON1 had to wait an hour to see the doctor. @PERSON1 was impatient until she started talking with her friend. When the doctor was ready to see her, she had even forgotten why she was there. It turned out that she had broken her arm. Later that day, @PERSON1 thanked her mom and then called her friend to thank her for helping her stay patient. This incident showed how a friend's support can help one through a difficult and painful situation.
264	18131	7	2	When I got hurt during a football game and was on a stretcher, I was touched by everyone's patience. They understood my limited mobility and waited for me in the hallways. They also helped carry my stuff from room to room. For example, @CAPS1 @PERSON2 needed to hurry to the bathroom but walked slowly with me so I wouldn't be alone. Another example is @PERSON1, Lauren, who was patient with me when I asked her something (though the exact request is unclear). This experience made me realize how important it is to have patient and caring people around during difficult times, and it also made me appreciate their kindness even more.
265	18132	7	2	I showed patience during a visit to the eye doctor with my mom. It was my first time there. We approached a lady and waited for the doctor to call us. After sitting for @NUM1 minutes, we heard the doctor calling my name. We went into the doctor's room, and I sat down while the doctor performed various procedures. Then he told us we had to see one more doctor. We sat down again and waited. When we heard my name called again, we went in. The worst part was seeing the medicine on the table; I was extremely scared. The lady asked me to look up and open my eyes wide. Then she took the medicine and put it in my eyes. It burned a little, and I didn't want her to do the other eye. I wanted to run out, but I couldn't. She did the other eye and told me to keep my eyes closed until she returned. When she came back, she said we were done. I thought to myself that it wasn't as bad as I had feared, and this experience taught me that patience can help me get through scary situations.
266	18133	7	2	I forgot to take my helmet and pads from my mom's car because she works until @NUM1. At @NUM2, something happened. Then, my friend Patience showed up.
267	18134	7	2	Patience encompasses multiple meanings. It can signify understanding or tolerance. A patient person refrains from complaining. For instance, if you ask someone to obtain something for you and they state they will do so within a specific number of days, and they fail to deliver on the promised day while you were anticipating it, you should not become angry. Patience is also required when waiting for something. If you are purchasing a new pair of shoes that need to be ordered, you should not complain if the process takes a long time. You should be capable of waiting without getting frustrated about not having them yet. These examples illustrate the concept of patience. If you can exhibit such behaviors, you can consider yourself a patient person. That is the essence of patience.
268	18135	7	2	When I go fishing, patience is my constant companion. In some fishing spots, it may take nearly fifty casts to get a bite. After getting a bite, one must wait for the fish to swallow the bait. Additionally, patience is needed when selecting the lure. This is because factors such as water color, the amount of weeds, and the fish's diet need to be considered. Moreover, after running the motor, one has to wait for the fish to return to the area. Clearly, a great deal of patience is required for fishing.
269	18136	7	2	Anna sat there, waiting patiently. “Come on, come on, come on!” she thought to herself. She was extremely excited to perform her now - improved beam routine. As one of the last gymnasts to go, her situation was even more challenging. She took a deep breath and sat down again, patiently awaiting her chance to impress the judges.
270	18137	7	2	On @DATE1, I went to see the Creed concert with my parents. There were approximately @NUM1 or @NUM2 people in front of us in the queue. I heard and saw people shoving and pushing to get inside. After about @NUM3 to @NUM1 minutes, my legs started to ache, but I persevered. I kept telling myself, “The pain is worth the wait!” Finally, we reached the security guards, who used a metal detector on us. When we entered the concert hall, I said, “It was definitely worth the long wait.”
271	18138	7	2	"Two weeks ago, @CAPS4 @CAPS2 said that her @CAPS1 was coming. @CAPS4's grandma was happy and bought a bus ticket for her sister. The bus ticket cost @NUM1 dollars, which was a significant amount of money. @CAPS1 couldn't miss this bus because I really wanted to see her. I was so eager that I couldn't wait. @CAPS1 was supposed to arrive on @DATE1, but she didn't show up. I was sick at the time, so I called @CAPS4 @CAPS2 at her job and asked, ""@CAPS2, why didn't @CAPS3 come?"" @CAPS4 @CAPS2 replied, ""@CAPS5, she is coming. You just have to be patient."" I agreed. The next day, @DATE2, I asked again, ""@CAPS2, is she here yet?"" @CAPS4 @CAPS2 said, ""@CAPS8, @CAPS5, be patient. She will be here tomorrow."" I said, ""@CAPS6, I understand."" I started to give up, thinking that @CAPS1 wasn't coming. Then @CAPS4's mom called @CAPS4's godmom and was told it was @CAPS6. She then told me she was going to @ORGANIZATION1. I love @ORGANIZATION1; it's so great. I asked @CAPS4 @CAPS2, ""@CAPS11, I have a @CAPS12, @ORGANIZATION2 cheese burger."" I mentioned @CAPS13 to @CAPS4's uncle, and @CAPS4's mom said @CAPS1 wasn't coming. I told @CAPS4's mom that I wasn't giving up and that @CAPS1 would come. Then I hung up. @CAPS4's mom asked @CAPS4's uncle @CAPS14, ""Should I get her something to eat?"" I initially thought she meant @CAPS4's grandmother. I was confused about who ""her"" was. So I called back. @CAPS4's mom said she was getting food for uncle @CAPS14's dog. I asked, ""@PERSON1's? For a dog?"" She said it was dog food. @CAPS4's mom picked me up from @CAPS4's godmother's house. I couldn't walk because every part of my body, including my legs, back, and arms, hurt. @CAPS4's grandmother came to her house since we had the keys. She asked, ""Where @CAPS16?"" @CAPS4's uncle whispered something, and I shouted, ""She's here!"" I ran into @CAPS4's uncle's room and hugged @CAPS1, asking how she was. When I went for @CAPS4's grandmother's birthday, she lived in South Carolina. This is @CAPS4's writing, and it shows a time when I was patient and waited for @CAPS4's mom's @CAPS1."
272	18140	7	2	Two years ago, when the first @CAPS1 was released, my step - dad paid eight hundred dollars for one. He was extremely happy and spent a lot of time bragging to his family and friends about it. At that time, my mom broke her phone, but my step - dad didn't want to let her use his. As a result, my mom was without a phone for at least three months. She was a bit angry, but being patient was worthwhile. When a newer and improved version of @CAPS1 appeared in stores, my mom was able to purchase it. She was very glad because her new @CAPS1 had more apps and a webcam. In my opinion, my mom did a great job being patient. If it were someone else, they probably wouldn't have been able to wait that long. This shows that patience can lead to better outcomes.
273	18141	7	2	"When I was about @NUM1 years old, there was one thing I really wanted in the world. While some girls might want a baby doll, I wanted a toy rex. This toy was the biggest and meanest dinosaur toy at that time, at least in my eyes as a little kid. It was so cool to me; it could walk, talk, run, and even ""bite"". Every time I went to the store, I would head straight to the toy section, find that rex, look it in the eyes, and say, ""You will be mine one day."" I really wanted it right away, but my mom said Christmas was coming up, even though it was still @NUM2 months away. I didn't want to wait @NUM2 months; I wanted it now. So I thought about what I could do to get the rex before @NUM2 months. I decided to clean up more around the house, walk the dog more often, and do better in school, hoping it would work. I asked my mom, ""Mom, if I start doing all this good stuff, can I get some of my Christmas things in a week @NUM5?"" She replied, ""No, you'll just get more things at Christmas."" I was so angry that I almost cried. However, @NUM2 months wasn't that long. Soon it was time to open my gifts. I thought I had opened all of them, but I didn't see the rex. I was sad even though I had about @NUM7 or more gifts. I still didn't have that rex, so I walked sadly to my room. Then my mom came into my room with a big box. Could it be the rex? I jumped out of my bed so fast that I'm sure my mom didn't even see me move. But when I looked in the box, it was full of baby dolls. Then my mom said, ""Go downstairs."" And there it was, the rex, looking so happy to see me. This experience taught me that sometimes patience pays off."
274	18142	7	2	"During our pom - pom team practice, our coach, @PERSON1, would shout, ""ì@NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6, @NUM7, @NUM8!"" as we repeated the dance over and over. I love poms, but it can get really tiring at times. We have practice on @DATE1 and @DATE3. There are six girls on our team, including me. Our coach likes to make us perform the dance individually. On our first game, we had a practice right before leaving for our first performance. We were all extremely excited and just wanted to go and perform all day. The game was scheduled for @NUM5:45 pm, but it didn't start until @NUM6:00 pm, which was much later than expected. So our whole pom - pom team, our coach, and all our family members had to wait patiently on the bleachers for over @NUM11 until we finally got to perform. Finally, on @DATE2, when the clock struck three, we went to the track to stretch. We were happy but also a bit sad that we hadn't performed earlier. We had a minute on the clock, so we walked to the other side. As we got into formation, the clock quickly counted down from fifty seconds to @NUM12, and then we only had @NUM13 seconds until we went on. I couldn't believe it; only @NUM13 seconds until our very first performance. The excitement rushed through my head as the man announced, ""@CAPS1 performing @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 pom - pon team"" and then our names over the speakers. The crowd roared as we entered the field. We quickly reminded ourselves to smile. Then the music started, and we danced with all our hearts, showing our gratitude to our coach and parents. After we finished, our friends and family surrounded us. At that moment, I realized that waiting and being patient wasn't so bad after all; it was definitely worth it."
275	18143	7	2	When interacting with toddlers or the elderly, patience is essential. Patience is crucial in all human interactions, but the very young and the very old require even more of it. Elderly people often become confused, have difficulty hearing, or are slower in their actions. We must practice patience and show them respect. Toddlers can also be confused as they are in the process of learning. If we have no patience with them and start to yell, they will often become upset and refuse to do what we tell them. Patience is also vital when dealing with mentally or physically challenged individuals. They can't help their conditions. Mentally challenged people may not understand or may not want to do things, similar to toddlers. We should be patient with the physically challenged because some tasks can be difficult for them to complete. In general, we should be patient with everyone because patience is a form of respect. Fear is not respect. This is my view on the concept of patience.
276	18144	7	2	One instance when I had to be patient was while babysitting. The children I was looking after were misbehaving, and it was quite challenging to get them to calm down. However, I observed that if I remained patient, they were more likely to follow suit. Initially, I sat down and told them to settle, but they didn't listen. I repeated my request, and this time, they became a bit quieter. I realized that ignoring their antics or being patient would make them stop trying to get my attention and eventually settle down. It worked; they calmed down, and the same thing happened the next time I babysat them. This experience taught me the power of patience in dealing with difficult situations.
277	18146	7	2	"Pull harder on the reins!"" my teacher shouted. ""I'm trying, but he's not listening!"" This horse had to be the most stubborn one I'd ever ridden in my life. He did whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted, and paid no heed to me at all. ""Bring him in,"" my teacher said. I slowly guided the horse to the center of the ring. ""I really am trying, but he won't listen,"" I told my teacher. ""I know he can be hard - headed, but I make you ride him because I believe you can handle him."" The horse's name was [Horse's Name]. He was a reddish - brown color with big, glassy brown eyes. He looked like a well - behaved horse, but I was wrong. He was neither nice nor sweet and didn't listen at all. ""Walk him around the perimeter a couple of times,"" my teacher instructed. ""Fine,"" I replied. As I was halfway around the ring, [Horse's Name] stopped, turned right, walked to the window, and started licking the beaded water on it. ""What is he doing?"" my teacher yelled. ""I think he's licking the water off the window,"" I said. ""Get him away from there; he could get sick!"" As I mentioned earlier, this horse had terrible listening skills, and now I was getting in trouble because of him. ""Be patient,"" my teacher said. I guess I needed to calm down, so I relaxed a bit and continued riding without further issues. I realized I needed patience and to relax. Even so, I'm still never going to ride that horse again."
278	18147	7	2	"I was on my way to [Location] to visit my dad. In the car, there was food, and I brought my [Device] to keep myself occupied. I brought it along because I knew asking ""Are we there yet?"" every [Number] minutes during a [Number] - hour drive would be annoying. Most of the time, I played games to make the time pass quickly. When I wasn't gaming, I'd have a snack, play with my baby cousin [Person], or take a nap. After a while, I'd sit back and relax. The whole trip was [Number] hours, but by doing all these things, it felt more like [Number] or [Number] hours. This way, the long journey became more bearable."
279	18148	7	2	"Patience essentially involves waiting and tolerating situations. Every year on [Month] [Number], my family becomes seasonal visitors at a campground. There, we play, have fun, and make many lifelong friends. Every weekend, we take our speedboat, ""The Glass Fro,"" put it into the lake, and dock it at a pier. Then we go fishing all over the lake and sit there for six hours. This is where patience comes in. We have to sit and watch our bobbers floating on the smooth, glass - like lake. We sit, talk, and soak up the sunlight. It's quite peaceful, especially since I'm off school and can spend time with my parents. During the school year, I have to be patient and wait for the year to end. Then, at the campground, we sit until suddenly one of our bobbers sinks into the water. After that, there's some yelling and calls for the net. The funny part is that the catch is either a large bass or a small one. All of this requires a great deal of patience."
280	18149	7	2	My dog, Teddy Bear, is extremely impatient. Whenever he comes in from outside, he knows he'll get a treat. However, he has to wait for the other dogs to come in first, and this waiting period clearly frustrates him. This shows that even our furry friends can struggle with patience when there's a reward at stake.
281	18150	7	2	On @DATE1 at @TIME1, I waited patiently for my sister - in - law to tell my brother to let us enter the hospital room and see their newborn baby, @CAPS1. My parents, sister, brother, and I were in the waiting room/lobby. We waited for about an hour and a half. I considered myself patient, though every ten to fifteen minutes, I'd get up and walk around because I was extremely nervous, shaky, and jumpy. It probably didn't help that I had drunk three cans of Pepsi just before I started waiting. Eventually, our wait came to an end, and we were able to see the new addition to the family.
282	18151	7	2	In my view, patience is a personal mindset that translates into action. I've been patient on numerous occasions. Once, I went to the store on the corner of my block. There was a long line that extended halfway down the block. I went inside, got my things, and joined the end of the line. Half an hour passed, and it was five minutes until closing time. I managed to reach the window and pay for my items @NUM1 minute before the store closed. I had just been standing in line doing nothing. The store owner gave me a total of @NUM2 things for free. I got half of the items I wanted, and the other half were household things. This experience shows that being patient can be rewarding and open up various opportunities. So, we should embrace patience and leave impatience behind.
283	18152	7	2	You need patience when fishing and when waiting for your food to be served. Moreover, it's important to be patient with everyone else. Patience in these situations helps to make the experience more pleasant and less stressful. Whether it's the slow bite of a fish or the delay in getting your meal, maintaining patience can lead to better outcomes. So, cultivate patience in these common scenarios and in your interactions with others.
284	18153	7	2	Right after I finished my hamburger, I noticed an old - looking bus parked outside the restaurant window. In my squeaky seven - year - old voice, I asked, “What's that?” My @CAPS3 replied, “That bus takes people to the palace across the street, where @PERSON1 is playing.” I then asked, “Wouldn't it be cool if we could go?” I saw my mom whisper something to my brother, and then they told me we were going to the show. Excitedly, I climbed into the back seat of our car, and we drove across the street to the palace of @ORGANIZATION1. It was an enormous building! All I wanted was to enter, but my @CAPS3 kept saying we had to wait. About fifteen minutes later, the two Pepsis I'd drunk earlier made me need to use the bathroom. I kept telling my @CAPS3, “I have to go to the bathroom.” Finally, my @CAPS3 took me through the front doors. The inside was even more amazing than the outside. However, a red rope blocked our way. My @CAPS3 asked a lady at the front desk, “Can my son use the bathrooms?” She gave a cold “No,” and we had to go back to the car. Another fifteen minutes passed. As the concert was about to start, we returned to the building. This time, the red rope was gone, but there was a line of nearly fifty people waiting to get through the metal detector. It took almost @NUM1 minutes, but we made it to the front, passed through the detector, and took our seats. It was a real test of my patience, but it was all worth it when I finally got to use the bathroom.
285	18154	7	2	I was patient when I went to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1. It all started when my friend @PERSON1 gave me a call and asked me to go with him. I said yes. I had to be patient until @DATE1. He drove for a long time, but I remained patient. When we finally reached the entrance, I felt good about having been patient. This patience during the journey allowed me to enjoy the anticipation and the eventual arrival at our destination.
286	18156	7	2	"Once upon a time, there was a place named Impatient Land. On Grumpy Lane, a little girl named @ORGANIZATION1 lived. She was the most patient girl ever. One day, @ORGANIZATION1 went to get her hair cut at MTSO Fast Saloon. When she arrived, everyone was screaming at @CAPS1, the hair - cutter. @ORGANIZATION1 stood up and said, ""Hey, if you want your hair to look good, sit down and be quiet."" And everybody did. @ORGANIZATION1 went home with a beautiful haircut, just like everyone else. Then, @ORGANIZATION1 became the mayor of Impatient Land and renamed it @CAPS2 Land. From that day forward, everybody was patient."
287	18159	7	2	There was a time when I demonstrated patience. I went to the doctor with my step - mom, Jody, and my brother. My brother was getting his knee examined. We were in the waiting room for about two or three hours. Jody was getting really irritated, but I told her the doctor would be out soon. I remained very patient while my brother and I were playing with his phone. This seemed to calm Jody down because usually, people tell me I'm really impatient. For some reason, when I'm excited, I can be fairly patient. I was extremely excited to see if my brother could get his knee brace off. Sure enough, he did. He was so happy that the two - hour wait was definitely worth it. This was a time when I was patient.
288	18160	7	2	One time, I showed patience. It was December @NUM1, @DATE1, @CAPS1 Eve. I was extremely excited about @CAPS1. On the morning of @CAPS1 Eve, I slept until @NUM2. I was eager for @CAPS1 to come. To be patient, I played video games and tried not to think about @CAPS1. When I went to the store, I saw all the @CAPS1 - related things. I felt like I couldn't wait any longer. That night after dinner, I was torn between staying up and going to sleep early to make @CAPS1 come faster. A part of me wanted to sleep, but I also wanted to stay awake. I made some more food and then went to sleep. When morning came, I was overjoyed and ran into the living room. There were the presents, just as I hoped. My mom and dad were still sleeping. I decided to watch some TV until @NUM3. I really wanted to open the presents, but I knew it wouldn't be right, so I went back to sleep. At noon, I woke up and ran to the living room. My mom, dad, and brother were there. I opened my presents with great enthusiasm, like a lion feasting on a gazelle. I was so glad I had waited.
289	18161	7	2	"When I was patient, I had no fears and no arguments, and I got a good deal. I had a @CAPS1. @CAPS4 was so wonderful that my sister @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS2, can I get some?"" I replied, ""@CAPS3 you @CAPS2."" @CAPS4 was like a miracle. So, I was driving her car at the gas station. Then I went to @ORGANIZATION1. I said, ""@NUM1 @CAPS5, please."" @CAPS4, who was a cousin of mine, said, ""@NUM2 days ago."" I was amazed and said, ""Wow."" @PERSON1 called my phone because @CAPS4 was my daddy's weekend. She said, ""Get down there now."" I was again taken aback and thought, ""Wow."
290	18162	7	2	"A time when I had to be patient was during a drive to @LOCATION1. The journey took a few hours, so here's what happened. As we were leaving the house, I realized I'd forgotten something. I quickly ran inside to get @CAPS2's dog, Penny (she's a real dog). The dog bolted out the door, but I managed to put her in the truck. We stopped at @CAPS2's grandparents' house to rest. Then we traveled on many roads until we reached the highway. I said, ""@CAPS1 is going to be a long ride."" We passed many cars, and then they passed us. For a moment, we lost sight of our grandparents' car. I looked back and found them about twelve cars behind us. We reached @LOCATION3 in about four hours. Knowing it would be a long trip, I decided to take a nap. During my nap, @CAPS2's parents, especially @CAPS2's mom, took pictures of me. I thought that wasn't very nice. We still had one more state, @LOCATION2, to pass through before reaching @LOCATION1. By the time we got to @LOCATION2, it was already @NUM1. We decided to get a hotel room. In the morning, we stopped for breakfast and then got back on the road. I had to be patient because we still had a two - hour drive left. It was the longest five - hour journey I'd ever had, but my patience made the trip go smoothly. We arrived in @LOCATION1 but had no idea where we were going. So, @CAPS2's dad turned on the GPS, and we found our way to our cabins. That's the story of a time I had to be patient."
291	18163	7	2	I've often demonstrated patience, and one particular instance stands out. My little sister kept bothering me, yet I refrained from yelling or hitting her. She asked me to turn on the music, and when I said no, she threw a tantrum. I calmly picked her up and gently told her to stop before she got into trouble. She stopped her outburst. I then instructed her to sit quietly and watch TV. In conclusion, this was a moment when I showed patience with my little sister. I didn't lose my temper despite her disturbance, proving that I can be a patient person.
292	18164	7	2	For me, patience is about helping others with their problems. In this story, I'll illustrate what patience means. Patience involves being willing to sit down and assist someone with their difficulties. I possess a great deal of patience as I frequently take the time to help people with their issues. One day at my old school, a girl named @PERSON1 was facing severe problems at home. When she came to school, she was in tears. I approached her to inquire about what was wrong. She explained that she didn't want to be at home because her mother wouldn't let her go out and made her stay home to watch her two brothers. I spent the entire day sitting with her, giving her someone to talk to. As we conversed, she seemed to feel better and regarded me as a true friend. In conclusion, I truly felt that I demonstrated patience that day. Since then, I've continued to offer a listening ear to those with problems.
293	18165	7	2	"There was a day when I was incredibly patient. It was @CAPS1 eve, and around @NUM1, I woke up. I had breakfast, brushed my teeth, and took a shower. Usually, by this time, I'd have asked my mom @NUM2 times if I could open a present, but on this day, I hadn't asked even once. I was upstairs playing on my PlayStation when my mom called out @CAPS2. I opened my door, and as always, my cat was there. I shut the door, stepped over the cat, and headed for the stairs, shouting ""food."" I rushed down the stairs to the counter. As I descended, I heard a @CAPS3, so I ran as fast as I could, knowing my two @NUM3 - year - old brothers were coming. They met me at the counter and asked, ""How many times have you asked to open a present?"" I replied, ""@CAPS5."" They looked shocked. After lunch, I went to my friend's house across the street to play basketball. About an hour later, we finished the game and went for a bike ride. We got back around @NUM4 for @CAPS2. About @NUM5 minutes later, I finished watching TV, took a shower, and went to bed. My mom woke me up at @TIME1, and when I saw all the presents, I screamed @CAPS7 @CAPS8. This was the day when I showed patience for the whole day."
294	18166	7	2	"My little sister @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2. Can you help me practice kicking a soccer ball? We're doing it in gym, and I don't know how."" I replied, ""Of course. Let's go to the backyard."" On my way out, I grabbed a ball. I placed it on the ground in front of me and said, ""All you do is step forward with your left foot and kick with the top of your right."" She said doubtfully, ""I'll try."" She ran up to the ball and kicked, but missed. That was okay. She tried again and missed. She sat down on the ground. I walked up to her and said, ""Don't give up. It's only your second try. Not everyone is good at soccer right away. Try one more time."" She said, ""Okay, one more try."" She ran up to the ball and kicked. The ball sailed into the goal. She said, ""@CAPS9 you for teaching me @CAPS2."" I said, ""It was my pleasure. Just be patient with yourself, and you'll be a great soccer player. I promise."" She said, ""Okay, but I want to practice some more."" I replied, ""Okay."
295	18167	7	2	Patience is characterized by understanding and tolerance. Many aspects of life can be accomplished through patience because some things are indeed worth waiting for. There is always an appropriate time and place for everything, and reaching our goals is made possible by the great virtue of patience. In essence, patience is an essential quality that enables us to navigate through life's challenges and achieve our desired outcomes.
296	18168	7	2	During the plane journey to @ORGANIZATION1, we exercised patience. We also remained patient while checking in. Then, a true test of our patience awaited. We sat at a table in a hotel restaurant. The waitress took our drink and food orders and then disappeared. We received our drinks and waited for our meal. We waited for @NUM1 minutes, @NUM2 minutes, @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5 minutes. After an hour, we called the waitress over and asked for bread. Miraculously, she brought bread! We inquired about our food, and she promised to bring it out immediately. We continued waiting until we had been waiting for @NUM6 hours. We called the manager over to voice our complaint, and he brought out the food a minute later. After @NUM6 hours of patience, we finally got to have our food.
297	18169	7	2	"Two years ago, I demonstrated patience. I was working at my @CAPS1's home to earn money. The work there was arduous as he assigned a great deal of tasks. I cut all the grass at his farm, chopped wood, and did many other chores. After approximately seven hours of strenuous work, I asked my @CAPS1 for my payment. He hesitated, and when I asked why, he informed me that he had given a large sum of money to my uncle for a vacation. My heart sank. I asked when I would receive my money, but he shook his head as if he had no clue. I felt a surge of anger. One week later, I returned to his house to ask again because I really wanted to buy something. He again shook his head no. My rational mind told me to be patient, but my impulsive self resisted. I decided to listen to my mind. Waiting was excruciating, but I knew patience was the right approach. Patience often brings opportunities. Three weeks later, he still hadn't paid me. One day, I heard a knock on my door. I went to open it, and it was my @CAPS1, wearing a big smile. Suddenly, he placed my hand open and gave me twenty dollars! I exclaimed, ""@CAPS1, that's more than double!"" My heart was pounding. He replied, ""I know, but you deserve it."" I was stunned to hear him say that. That day, I truly showed patience, and it paid off handsomely. So, the next time you're reluctant to be patient, think of my story because it might just lead to a rewarding outcome."
298	18170	7	2	On @DATE1, my family and I embarked on a trip to Cedar Point. The journey was either three or six hours long. I dozed off during the drive, and when I woke up, we were at Burger King. I ordered a kids' meal, and it was delicious. After getting back in the car, I stayed awake for the rest of the journey. As we approached our destination, I started seeing water parks and hotels, which looked really appealing. Then, I spotted a very tall roller - coaster and got extremely excited. I rushed to the line, only to find that all the lines were long. I had to wait for @NUM1 minutes. When it was finally my turn, I was overjoyed. After getting my stamp, I ran towards the @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 indoor roller - coaster. I had to wait an hour in line, and I got really tired, but I kept moving forward. Finally, when I reached the stairs, I got on the ride. I was a bit scared because it was dark inside. When the ride took off and ended, I was dizzy. I then went on another ride and got even more dizzy. I also got on a ride that rocks side to side. This was a time when I showed patience.
299	18171	7	2	"While waiting in the line to enter @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I complained, ""@CAPS2! When are we going into the park?"" My mother hissed back, ""@CAPS3 patient."" I grumbled again, ""Being patient is boring!"" My sister shouted in agreement, ""Yeah, @CAPS4 so bored! It's not fair and I feel hurt."" Then my @CAPS2 shouted, ""@CAPS5! We're almost there!"" It seemed like hours passed before we finally reached the ticket booth. I exclaimed, ""@CAPS7!"" We then entered the park. I asked my sister, ""@CAPS8 first?"" She pointed to a ride and yelled, ""That one!"" She then ran towards the ride, and we followed. As we walked towards the line, my dad said, ""@CAPS10, let's ride @CAPS12. It looks fun."" I shouted, ""@CAPS11! More waiting!"" I complained, ""@CAPS12 is gonna take forever!"" Despite my complaints, I knew I had to be patient to enjoy the rides in the park."
300	18172	7	2	"A time when I and my family - my mom, dad, and big brother - were going to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, we had to pack up and leave within an hour. I was a bit disorganized at first but managed to get everything ready. During the long journey, I decided to rest my head and wait, daydreaming about there being no lines at the destination so I could hop on every ride without delay. As I was about to get on a ride, I felt someone shaking me. It was my brother. When I opened my eyes, I saw a large sign that said ""Welcome to @CAPS1 @CAPS2"". I was initially elated thinking there were no lines, but my hopes were dashed as the lines were as long as the distance to @LOCATION1 itself. I could tell it was going to be a long wait. As my patience wore thin, I started to get fidgety. Then my mom grabbed me and asked why I was in a bad mood. I told her it was because of the long lines. She advised me to be patient, saying it would be worth the wait. I heeded her advice. Finally, it was our turn. I got on the ride, and she was right - being patient in line was worth it, and it was a lot of fun once I was on the ride."
301	18173	7	2	When I was around nine years old, I brought my homework home. I showed it to one of my older brothers. He looked at it and then started helping me. He even provided a few answers to show me what I needed to do, as I wasn't really sure how to complete my homework. After that, since he had his own homework to do, he told me to work on mine. So, I began doing my homework and answered all the questions correctly. However, there was a really difficult question. I wanted to ask my older brother, but I didn't because he was busy with his work. In the end, I managed to solve it on my own.
302	18174	7	2	I'm a new student at Middleton Middle School. My name is @CAPS1. People might assume I'm a boy, but I'll make this clear: patience is a virtue. On my first day, I entered @PERSON1's class and sat next to a girl with wavy blond hair, sparkling blue eyes, and a warm smile. She introduced herself as @CAPS4 in a perky voice, and I introduced myself as @CAPS1. @CAPS4 offered to show me around, and I was excited. We quickly became friends. But when she introduced me to her friends, they mocked me for having a boy's name. @CAPS4 defended me, but I told her it was okay. She wouldn't let it go, so I told her to let me handle it. She crossed her arms, tapped her foot, and questioned my ability. I got a bit angry as she didn't seem to understand the concept of patience. She stormed out of the room. I chased after her and explained that getting angry at them wouldn't solve the problem. I told her I knew she was trying to protect me, but it was better to be patient. She finally understood, and after that, we never had such an issue again.
303	18175	7	2	"I was on my way to Tennessee with my @CAPS1, @CAPS2, my younger brother, @PERSON1, and my grandparents, whom I call @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1. We were traveling in two different cars. I was in @CAPS1's white Mercedes with @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, while @PERSON1 was in @LOCATION1's gold minivan with @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1. With the windows down in our car, @CAPS1 and I smelled burning rubber. As we slowed down, @LOCATION1 pulled up beside us and told us to pull over. We did so, and @CAPS2 got out and noticed that the car was leaking transmission fluid. We drove into town with @LOCATION1 following. We stopped at an auto shop. It was empty. The mechanic told us to take out everything we needed from the car. After we cleaned it out, he put the car on the lift, and that's when I saw the garage for the first time. It smelled of gas, and everything was greasy and dirty, including the mechanics. I worried that this would ruin our trip, but @CAPS2 said we couldn't be sure. It was hard to be patient. I paced between the minivan and the garage for about two hours. More mechanics came, but no one could figure out what was wrong with the car. @CAPS2 looked up car parts on the computer there, but it didn't help. The day before we left, @CAPS1 had taken her car to @CAPS10's garage for a tune - up, but we weren't sure if that was related. After about three hours at the shop, I got hungry, and so did everyone else. We went to a restaurant across the street for lunch. @CAPS2 stayed at the shop a bit longer. At lunch, @CAPS2 said we'd have to call Triple A and go back home. I was very upset. On the way out of the restaurant, I tripped and sprained my wrist. We went to the Walmart behind the auto shop, got a bandage for my wrist, and picked out books. I got ""The Vampire Diaries,"" and @PERSON1 got a Star Wars book. We read them on the way home in @CAPS12's car."
304	18177	7	2	When I went deer hunting with my dad, I had to be patient. Patience in this context meant waiting quietly and staying still. The most challenging part was maintaining silence and remaining motionless. I spent the whole day waiting for a deer. Even though I didn't manage to get a deer, I remained quiet, still, and patient throughout the hunt. This experience taught me the importance of patience in deer hunting.
305	18178	7	2	After months of waiting, the time is almost here! My mother is going to give me her old cell phone. It might be old to her, but it'll be new to me. I'll be able to talk to my friends whenever I want and won't have to worry about being late for appointments. I know I might not get all the services I want, but it's still a great thing. I'm not the most patient person, but this wait is definitely worth it. You see, I'm involved in track, cross - country, and choir. Since these activities end after the buses leave and I take the bus home, I need a cell phone to arrange for someone to pick me up. My mom set three conditions for me to get the phone: I need to be thirteen, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone, and I need to prove that I'm dedicated, can keep my grades up, and am responsible enough. I turned thirteen on @DATE1, she's transferred everything, I've shown my dedication and kept my grades up. Now, I'm working on proving my responsibility. I've been watching the neighbors' pets, mowing their lawns, helping with babysitting, and cleaning the house. I've convinced my dad, grandmother, brother, and half - sister that I'm responsible, but my mom still has doubts. I think if I can clean half of the house and keep it clean until @CAPS1, she'll finally give me the phone. Even after getting it, I'll have to keep up my good behavior. It's a long process, but in the end, having my own cell phone will make it all worthwhile.
306	18179	7	2	Patience is important. If you do not have patience, you will not achieve much in life. People will not like you at all if you lack patience. Moreover, without patience, you will not be able to finish things. In conclusion, cultivating patience is essential for a fulfilling life.
307	18180	7	2	The story is about the time when @CAPS2's mom ran out of gas. She was driving down @LOCATION1 @NUM1 on her way home. Soon, the car started running out of gas, and to make matters worse, it was raining. Eventually, the car ran out of gas. First, she had to flag someone down and ask if they had a cell phone. Someone finally did. She then asked if they could get gas, but everyone said “@CAPS1!”. @CAPS2's mom then decided to call @CAPS2's dad and ask him to get gas. He showed up an hour later with a couple of gallons of gas, which was just enough to get them back to @LOCATION1. If @CAPS2's mom had not had @CAPS1 patience, she would have gone crazy. This incident shows the importance of patience in difficult situations.
308	18181	7	2	One day, I was out camping with my friend @PERSON1. I asked him if we could climb the dunes, and he said we would do it later. I waited for hours, and then he said after our lunch. After lunch, I asked again, and he said yes. When I saw the dunes, I knew it was a bad idea for me to climb them, but I did it anyway. After reaching the top, I fell and @CAPS1 stayed there like a dead animal. Five minutes later, I was okay and continued climbing to the top of the dune. After getting up, I ran down the dune. When my friend told me to stop, I stopped. However, I got sand in my coat pocket. Then I hit a rock and did a front - flip. When I fell, my friend came down, and we both laughed. Then we went back to our campsite. This camping experience was full of unexpected events but also a lot of fun.
309	18182	7	2	My name is @CAPS1, and I am writing about a time when I had to be patient. It was a nice @DATE1 @TIME1 on the eighteenth of @DATE2. We were going to drive down to @LOCATION1 for a vacation at @CAPS2 land. Everyone in the household was packing everything into a van that we rented for the trip so that everyone could fit into the vehicle. After packing all the things into the car, my mom made us a delicious breakfast of sausage, pancakes, bacon, and scrambled eggs. After breakfast, we got into the car and hit the highway. I fell asleep an hour into the drive. It was ten o'clock at night when I woke up. My sister was yelling at my brother, and then my sister and I got into an argument. My mom told all of us to be quiet, and we did, but we were all getting on each other's nerves. I had to be patient for another two days. Finally, we arrived at our destination, and I was glad to be there. Overall, it was a fun trip until we had to go back.
310	18183	7	2	I was on the farm waiting for my dad to get home so I could ride my four - wheeler. Later that night, he called and said he would be later than I expected. He came home three hours later. Since nobody was home except my grandma, and my dad doesn't want me to ride the four - wheeler when he or my uncle @PERSON1 is not there, I had to wait until the next day. At that point, I was impatient. The next day, my dad called again and said he had to work late, so I still couldn't ride. I was even more impatient. But then my uncle @PERSON1 showed up. I asked him if I could ride, and he said I could if my dad said it was @CAPS1. I called my dad, and he said it was okay as long as my uncle was fine with it. Then I could ride my four - wheeler, and I was no longer impatient. This experience taught me that sometimes patience pays off.
311	18184	7	2	Hunting requires patience. One cannot simply go out and immediately get a deer. One has to wait and watch because deer do not come directly to people. Deer do not like humans and can smell them. If one is not patient, one will not get anything. In conclusion, patience is essential in hunting.
312	18185	7	2	Last year, I had to sell my sick cow. I had been waiting for eight months to get a new calf but didn't know where to get one until I asked my uncle. He dealt in a small cow breed that normally costs @MONEY2, but he gave me a deal for @MONEY1. It took me eight months to find her. During those eight months, I was extremely eager and couldn't sleep well at night. When I finally got her home, I was overjoyed that I had found her when I did. However, I still worry about her at night because of the cougar roaming in the countryside. In conclusion, getting a new calf was a long - awaited and difficult process, and the threat of the cougar adds to my concerns.
313	18186	7	2	Have you ever liked waiting in line at the store? Well, I don't either. I'll tell you about a time when I was both impatient and patient. Every morning, I take the bus to school. Usually, I arrive at the bus stop @NUM1 minutes early to talk with my mother. One day, I woke up too early and got to the bus stop very early. After @NUM2 minutes, I decided to go back home. By the time I got home, I was going to be late. I rushed to the door, but it was too late; the bus had left. I should have been more patient. Another day, I went to a burger place to get a hamburger with bacon, cheese, and a toaster. When I got there, there were about @NUM3 people in line, so I decided to wait my turn. People paid at the cash register one by one. Finally, it was my turn. I ordered my burger, and it was worth the wait. In conclusion, one must be patient in everything, whether it's in sports, school, at home, or in public. I hope my story makes you realize the importance of patience.
314	18187	7	2	On @DATE1, at the @ORGANIZATION1, I had a very patient experience. It was around @NUM1 in the @TIME1 when we claimed our seats right in front of the stage. We waited about @NUM2 minutes until the first performer, @LOCATION2, came on stage. Their appearance was strange; they looked like a rock - style performer, but they played normal music. I had never heard their songs before, but now I hear them more often. The second band was also unfamiliar to me. I can't remember their names, and their music wasn't to my taste. The next performer I knew well; it was the @PERSON1. They were great. Their lead singer had a long beard and an afro, which was quite funny. Time seemed to pass quickly when they were performing because I enjoyed them so much. Next was @PERSON2, another great singer. He improvised a song about @LOCATION1 for about four minutes without stopping. By the time he finished, it was about @NUM3 @CAPS1 at night, and I was getting tired. But then I saw the @CAPS2 boys getting ready, and I got really excited. They opened with a song named @CAPS3. There were strobe lights and regular lights everywhere. The stand holding the drum even moved; it did @NUM4, a @NUM5, went @NUM2 feet in the air, and did flips. Their lead singer @PERSON3 and the drummer had a drum - off, which was really cool. It all lasted until about @NUM7. It was an amazing experience, and I probably will never witness something like that again.
315	18189	7	2	Being patient can be difficult at times but easy at others. Take @CAPS1 for example. My brother and I always wake up very early on @CAPS1 morning and lie on the couch. We get up around @NUM1 am and turn on the @CAPS1 tree. Our eyes light up at the sight of all the presents we're going to open. First, we lie on the couch, staring at the presents, trying to guess what's inside. Then we move to another chair to look at them from a different angle. We keep doing this until we end up on the couch again. We get yelled at one or two times to go back to bed, but it's useless because we never do. Around @NUM2 am, we start getting restless. We go to our bedrooms to find something to do to distract ourselves, but that doesn't work either. Then we go back to the couch. At about @NUM3 am, we go to the kitchen to make coffee for our mom and dad because they say they need coffee before we open presents. Then we wake them up. When they finally get out of bed, we rush them to drink their coffee so we can open the presents. Finally, about @NUM4 minutes later, they finish, and we get to open our presents. It takes a long time, but the joy of opening the presents makes it all worthwhile.
316	18190	7	2	I was in the car with my mom, and she went into a store to get something. I accompanied her. I showed patience as I didn't ask her when we'd go home or complain that it was boring. I simply went with the flow. I stayed there for an hour, but I didn't mind because I was the one who wanted to come. If I had complained, she would have asked why I came. In the end, my mom said that since I had been patient, I could get a chocolate bar. This shows that if you're patient, there might be a reward at the end.
317	18191	7	2	The time I was extremely patient was when I had to get my teeth pulled. The procedure took two hours. The dentists took a break of about @NUM1 minutes every half - hour. I received many shots in my mouth. They cut open my gum and extracted two teeth, then my two bottom teeth. I remained patient throughout. The dentists even said I was one of their best patients considering all I went through in my mouth and the long - lasting pain. This was the time I got @NUM2 teeth pulled and demonstrated great patience.
318	18192	7	2	“When can I drive?” I whined. “When the time comes, you have to be patient; otherwise, you won't,” @CAPS1 yelled over the loud, heart - warming sound of @CAPS2 starting up for the @NUM1 time that year. I loved that sound; it's my second - favorite sound. The vibrations rattled my legs as @PERSON1 drove it away. I could wait for my turn. After a ride and @NUM2 minutes, @CAPS1 said the words I thought he'd never say: “@CAPS3, your turn.” I looked at him and then at the truck. Wow, he looked small next to that truck. I ran as fast as I could to the pit. I climbed onto the tire's rim, then to the top of the tire, and into the cab. “@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6, gaggag @CAPS7. Oh yeah! This felt right. I couldn't go fast, but I almost tipped it over. So that's a good thing. All in all, patience pays off.
319	18193	7	2	I'm not usually a patient person, but I'll tell you about a time when I was. It was a sunny day on @DATE1 after school, and I had no homework. So, I invited my friends over, and we planned to go to the Landslide skate park. We were all at my place, but @CAPS1 was missing. My mom said, “@CAPS2, if he's not here in two minutes, we have to go without him.” I was angry and started writing a note for the door that said, “@CAPS1, we had to go without you because you were late! Sorry, be on time next time. - @CAPS4.” But just as I was signing the note, he arrived. That's the story of when I showed patience.
320	18194	7	2	In @DATE1, I took a test called the @ORGANIZATION1 (@CAPS1). My friends and I finished the @ORGANIZATION1 early, so we had to be patient. There were things we could do, but our options were limited. Being patient is difficult; sometimes, it seems like ages have passed when only @NUM1 minutes have gone by. Patience often requires a great deal of mental calmness. Once, my dad and I were going to work in @LOCATION1. The bus was late by @NUM2 minutes, and it felt like weeks. Patience can be both good and bad. Good patience is shown when an audience waits patiently for a team to score a goal. Bad patience is when you're late for work due to traffic or a late bus, and you have to wait. Sometimes, you can distract yourself while being patient, like texting, calling a friend, or playing a game with a kid or by yourself. As you can see, patience can have positive and negative aspects and demands a lot of mental peace. @ORGANIZATION1.
321	18195	7	2	When I was about @NUM1 years old, I went to @CAPS1 with my grandparents, mother, and father for a family reunion. We made so many stops that I couldn't even count them. I didn't want to stop or be patient because I was eager to reach our destination and see what it was like. It seemed like a long journey, and the downside was that we had to leave our dog at home for a week.  We left home at @TIME1 and arrived at the motel at @TIME2 am. By the afternoon, I was tired of sitting in the car and didn't want to get back in for the return trip. It was a long time to spend in the car, and I was extremely impatient. I thought it would have been much better if the journey had taken half an hour or so instead of @NUM2 hours.  However, it was fun to see new things on the way there. On the way back, I mostly slept. I was so bored that I switched cars at every stop. At that time, I didn't have a @CAPS2, but I had my iPod and cell phone. I could only call and play games on them. I was so impatient that I would rather go to the hotel and sleep than listen to the older people talk about things I hardly knew about. In the end, although the journey was long and I was impatient, it was still a memorable family trip.
322	18196	7	2	"One time, I was patient while waiting to use the computers. I told my mom to wake me when she finished using the computer. After an hour, I fell asleep and woke up a short while later. To my dismay, my brother had been on the computer for three hours, reading manga that we already had.  Just three minutes later, my dad kicked me off the computer to check his email. He said he would be done soon, but he ended up spending the rest of the day and a bit more of the next day watching ""Indearath Star"" for six hours. Considering he spends eight hours connected to the internet at work, this adds up to @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours on the internet every day of the year. It was really frustrating that my patience was not rewarded, and I had to wait so long again to use the computer. In conclusion, it's important for everyone in the family to be more considerate when it comes to sharing resources like the computer."
323	18197	7	2	After @NUM1 years and @NUM2 ½ weeks, I finally gathered the courage to ask a guy I liked a lot to go out with me. He agreed to go to the dance with me but declined to start a relationship. A week later, I asked him again, and he asked me to wait until the end of the week.  I waited impatiently, feeling like time was dragging on forever. Then, on @DATE1, my friend couldn't stand it anymore and asked him out, and he said yes with great enthusiasm. However, on @DATE2, after getting to know me better, he broke up with me. Since then, we've had our share of fights, but we're still best friends. Despite the ups and downs in our relationship, our friendship has endured, showing that sometimes, the bonds of friendship are stronger than romantic connections.
324	18198	7	2	Patience is a challenging virtue, and not everyone possesses it. However, it is an essential quality in many aspects of life. You need to be patient in various situations, such as waiting in line or dealing with people who are learning or being taught.  When I was around four or five years old, we went to @ORGANIZATION1. My older sister wanted to go on a ride, but I was too short to participate. So, my mom stayed with me while my older sister and my @CAPS1 went on the ride. I was very sad, but my mom told me to wait patiently and not get restless.  As time passed, I started asking my mom when the ride would be over. She kept saying she didn't know and that it would be when @PERSON1 and @CAPS1 got off. Eventually, I couldn't wait any longer. When my @CAPS1 and sister got off, they said they wanted to go on the ride again. I was disappointed, but then my mom said that because I had waited so nicely, she would take me to get a smoothie. I was overjoyed as I love smoothies.  This experience taught me that patience is important. By being patient, I was rewarded with something I loved. Although it's difficult to be patient at times, once you master it, it can bring positive outcomes. In conclusion, cultivating patience is a valuable skill that can enhance our lives in many ways.
325	18200	7	2	Last year, I went to the doctor for a regular check - up. The doctor tested my vision and hearing and also examined my chest to check if my heart was okay. Then she checked my neck, and I could feel her cold fingers on it. After about a minute, she said she'd be right back.  Another doctor came in and continued to examine my neck. When my mom asked what was going on, they said the glands in my neck were full and that I needed to have my blood tested to see if I had a thyroid problem. Having a thyroid issue would mean taking pills for the rest of my life.  A few days later, we went to get my blood tested. As I waited, I got extremely nervous, with butterflies in my stomach. @NUM1 minutes passed, which felt like an hour, and then they called me in. The nurse told me everything would be fine, and I trusted her. She tied a rubber tube around my arm, which pinched a bit. Then, the needle went in, and I watched the blood flow into the tube, which was kind of cool.  After that, we went home. I had sleepless nights for a week because I was so anxious. Finally, the doctor called my mom. It seemed like it took forever to know the result. From my mom's expression, I couldn't tell. Then she said the result was negative. I was so happy. My patience during this difficult time helped me stay calm instead of rushing to the doctor's office myself. In conclusion, patience is crucial when facing uncertain and worrying situations.
326	18201	7	2	I asked @CAPS1, “When do we get the Xbox?” He replied, “@CAPS2 hours.” I exclaimed, “@CAPS3!” He confirmed, “Yes.” I repeated, “@CAPS4.” He echoed, “@CAPS4.” @CAPS2 hours... I thought it would feel like an eternity. First, I got on the computer. After ten minutes, I logged off as there was nothing interesting. Then, I checked the TV guide. There was nothing appealing. I wondered why I was so tired. I was about to figure out the reason when, fortunately, I dozed off. When I woke up, there were four hours left. I checked the TV guide again, still to no avail. So, I turned on the TV. A @PERSON1 show had just ended. The @CAPS8 commercial announced, “@CAPS7 up next on @CAPS8 land is The @PERSON1.” I said aloud, “@CAPS10 see this.” It turned out better than I expected. It was a black - and - white @PERSON1 about a police official and his son. After watching it for four hours, I heard the door open. I heard @CAPS1 come in and say, “@CAPS12 got it!” Then I said, “@CAPS14,” and fell asleep again. @CAPS1 whispered, “@CAPS15 wake him up.”
327	18202	7	2	One time, my brother @PERSON1 demonstrated patience. Patience is the ability to be understanding and listen through difficulties without complaining. Our family lived in @LOCATION1 and planned a vacation to Cedar Point. We had a great time throughout the day. At @NUM1, we decided to go on @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1 chose the blue @ORGANIZATION1, while the rest of the family opted for the red one. The blue @ORGANIZATION1 holds riders at the top for @NUM2 and then drops them, whereas the red one shoots riders up to @NUM3 feet. Since the line for the red @ORGANIZATION1 was shorter, we got to ride it first. After our ride ended, @PERSON1 was already at the top of the blue @ORGANIZATION1. We heard a loud noise indicating the blue @ORGANIZATION1 cart was coming down, but it didn't. @PERSON1 was stuck @NUM4 feet in the air, getting a bird's - eye view of the park. If I were @PERSON1, I would have been terrified. At @NUM5, the ride lights came on, and the cart plunged down. Finally, he got his ride. As compensation, each of us received free season passes to Cedar Point. This was a situation where @PERSON1 truly needed to show patience.
328	18203	7	2	On @DATE1, we went to the Dollar Tree. I wanted to go to the Game Stop, but I exercised patience. Eventually, we went to the Game Stop. This shows that waiting patiently can lead to getting what you want.
329	18205	7	2	In the morning, I woke up feeling extremely sick. I took a shower, got dressed, and then asked my dad, “Can I go to the doctor? I feel sick.” He replied, “We will leave at @NUM1 am,” and it was @NUM2 am at that time. I had to wait on the couch while my brothers, dad, and mom took their showers. I was tempted to yell and complain because they were taking their time and trying to look their best, but I held my tongue. After they finished, they searched for the keys until they found them. It was @NUM3 am, and my dad's favorite music was on. We watched the whole program. At @NUM4 am, we headed to the doctor. We had to wait for everyone to have their turn until @NUM5, which was our appointment time. They examined me, and it turned out there was nothing wrong. I left and waited for my brothers to finish. In the end, I was extremely frustrated because I had to wait for them to get in the car. My dad asked, “Are you happy? You said you felt sick, and there's nothing wrong.” As we drove home, I realized I had been patient throughout the day and learned that patience can make the day pass more smoothly.
330	18206	7	2	During the @DATE1, I went to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 to visit my aunt @CAPS1. We got up early and drove to @LOCATION4. It was my first time on a plane. My dad told me to be patient, or the journey would be boring. My sister and I boarded the plane and flew to @LOCATION3, which took @NUM1 minutes. It was an easy flight. Then, we boarded another plane directly to @PERSON1. The flight took @NUM2 hours, a long and tiring journey. I managed to be patient, but my sister was impatient the whole time, constantly asking when we would arrive. This experience showed that I could display patience during a long - distance travel.
331	18207	7	2	I once demonstrated patience when a group was going camping. They packed up and loaded the car. The journey was several hours long, so I had to be patient. I played a game on the PlayStation for a couple of minutes. The group left early to have time to do something upon arrival. I tried to relax, but it was difficult with the children screaming and yelling. Eventually, I fell asleep. Then, the car hit an obstacle and ran out of gas. Fortunately, they were right in front of a gas station. It took an hour to get it fixed. They snacked on something and then left. The children got excited as they neared the destination. I was happy as I could set up the tent and go to sleep. When they reached the campsite, they had to set everything up. I had to be patient before going to sleep. Then, the kids found a pack of something. Some wanted to go somewhere, and the mom wanted me to take them. I was so tired that I didn't want to. The park was quite close to the campsite. I ate quickly and finally went to sleep in the tent.
332	18208	7	2	"I remember a time when I showed patience while on my way to Cedar Point. My friend and I took a bus, and the journey took seven hours. My friend, PERSON1, decided to watch movies on a device. We watched ""Street Dreams"" and ""The Incredibles"". We were still far from Cedar Point, so we decided to play a prank on my mom by calling her. It was really funny, and we did it again. Then, we took turns napping and looking out at the open road. Eventually, we both fell asleep. When we woke up, we had arrived. This experience of waiting patiently taught me a valuable lesson. Because I waited patiently then, I don't mind waiting now. I learned to occupy myself with something else while waiting, which has allowed me to wait for longer periods. This patience has been beneficial in my life."
333	18209	7	2	I was patient during the MEAP test. I finished early, while many others were still working. Usually, when I finish early, I like to draw or do some other work, but I didn't have any work with me. So, I waited for everyone to finish. After they did, we waited for a few minutes and then started the MEAP again. When I finished that part, no one else was done, so I waited for a while longer. Once everyone was done, we stretched and walked around for a bit before sitting back down to start part five. I'm usually the first one to finish the test. When I'm done, I get up and walk around to stay focused. I aim to get good grades like A's and B's on tests like the MEAP because it's very important. I've realized that being patient helps me achieve those good grades.
334	18210	7	2	"On my last visit to CAPS1 Point, I made a rather unfortunate decision. I waited in line for NUM1 hours to ride the Mantis. It was extremely challenging to be patient because the mister fans were experiencing technical difficulties. How could I stay patient when it was NUM2 degrees outside? The only redeeming factor of the line was the shade. I kept telling myself, ""Just be patient, and soon you'll be on the ride."" However, I spoke too soon. Half an hour felt like an eternity, but I think the heat was getting to me. Finally, after NUM5 hours in line, the mist fans started working again. Patience truly can bring luck. I waited for what seemed like only ten minutes but was actually an hour. After getting off the ride, I felt a huge sense of relief. I've come to believe that in many ways, patience is the key to having a successful and enjoyable experience."
335	18211	7	2	One day, a man named PERSON1 had a doctor's appointment but overslept. When he got out of bed, he realized he was late. He rushed into the bathroom to take a quick shower, but it was getting late, so he didn't have time to wash up properly or brush his teeth. He grabbed a piece of gum on his way out the door. When he arrived at the doctor's office, he went inside and saw that the waiting room was full of people. He checked in and sat down. As time passed, he started to get frustrated and tired of waiting. However, he managed to calm down and understand the importance of patience. He kept himself occupied for two hours by playing with his phone and using the apps he had downloaded. He was so engrossed that he didn't realize he was the last person still waiting. Some people had their check - ups and left, while others left without getting checked. Finally, they called him in for his appointment. As he went in, he popped a couple of pieces of gum in his mouth and started talking. After the appointment, he rushed home, took a shower, brushed his teeth, and then went to bed. This experience taught him the value of patience in difficult situations.
336	18212	7	2	Patience is a virtue that eludes me. I find it extremely challenging to be patient as I am inherently impatient and struggle to wait for things. During school hours, I constantly glance at the clock, eager for classes to end. I often feel that I rush through tasks. I wish I could be more patient, but my curiosity about what comes after the waiting makes it difficult. For instance, in class, I get excited about the end of the day. I hope to improve my ability to wait, though I doubt it will happen soon. In conclusion, while I recognize the importance of patience, it remains a significant hurdle for me.
337	18213	7	2	At my home, patience is highly valued. My mother often emphasizes that patience is essential for success in any endeavor. One day, I was at home, enjoying myself while surfing the web on the computer. My mother called out for me to come to her. I got up from my chair, walked through the kitchen and hallway, and entered her bedroom. She informed me that she was going to @CAPS1 to buy groceries and asked if I wanted to accompany her. I declined and requested that she make me a sandwich, to which she agreed and then left. While she was away, I tidied my room, folded the laundry, and watched TV. By @DATE1, she still hadn't returned. I was extremely hungry and started to worry about her. I was tempted to call her but then remembered my mother's words about the importance of patience for success. Approximately half an hour after @DATE1, she arrived home with some lunch meat for me to make a sandwich. She told me she was proud of my patience during her absence. I firmly believe that patience is crucial, and I think everyone could benefit from being a bit more patient.
338	18215	7	2	In my view, a patient person is someone who can wait when necessary. I express it in my own way because no one in my family is particularly patient. A patient person can calmly sit through traffic jams or long queues. They can wait for something they need. To me, patience is about waiting for my turn, whether it's because I have to or because something is out of stock and I need to wait for it to be replenished. That's my personal understanding of patience. In conclusion, patience, as I see it, is an important quality that involves the ability to wait calmly in various situations.
339	18217	7	2	I'll share a time when I was impatient. In @DATE1, I worked every day, striving to earn as much money as possible. I was saving up to buy a three - hundred - dollar bow, a forty - dollar target, forty - dollar broadbands, and other hunting accessories. As the days passed, I grew more and more impatient. I got tired of working, bored of saving, and was tempted to spend the money. Finally, I had saved enough and purchased the items. I practiced shooting all day and soon became more accurate, feeling ready for hunting. On my first night out, I passed up a doe at eight yards. Since then, I haven't had a shot at anything close enough. In conclusion, my impatience during the saving process and the subsequent lack of hunting success taught me the value of patience in achieving my goals.
340	18218	7	2	One time, I had to be patient when there was a flu shot campaign. I had to go to a specific place to get the flu shot. When we arrived, we joined a long line. I had to be patient as it took a long time to get through. We brought chairs, hot cocoa, and other things to keep ourselves occupied. I endured the wait until I reached the front of the line. The worst part was that most of the time, we were outside on @CAPS1 eve, so I had to be patient in the cold. When we finally entered the building, I was overjoyed. Around @DATE1, we reached the front of the line. I'm relieved that I'll never have to wait in line for three hours to get a flu shot again. In conclusion, that experience of waiting patiently for the flu shot was a test of my patience, and I'm glad it's over.
341	18219	7	2	I was being patient during a game, but it took so long that it made me angry. Then my mom gave me a hint. I earned some money, and she used it to buy me a toy. She took me all the way home. Now I'm patient again. I'm also patient to go to lunch. I have @NUM1 dollars for lunch, so I'm going @NUM2 houses away to have lunch. Don't take too long for some guests. In @NUM3 hours, I'll have lunch. I'm mad that it's @NUM4 until lunch. Now, when is the test? I forgot to ask. The game is over, and it's @NUM5. We go to lunch at @NUM6. Now I'm in line. I'm being patient. She made my snack so good that I ate it all. Then I drank my milk. Then we tried to be patient. I received some greetings, and I was happier than ever.
342	18220	7	2	One time, while I was in sixth grade, I learned the importance of patience during a basketball practice at @ORGANIZATION1. It was in @DATE1, though I can't recall the exact date. We were in the gym running suicides. Out of nowhere, I had an accident. Running too fast, I couldn't stop and went head - first into a brick wall. Since no one expected this to happen, it was quite a shock.  I didn't panic because I knew I had to be patient. First, I had to wait a long time for an ambulance. Then, it didn't take long for a doctor to give me stitches. Finally, I waited for the doctor to give me the discharge papers. When I hit my head, it didn't hurt, but some parts hurt when I got the stitches. It didn't hurt when they were taken out, yet I had a massive headache. I was really glad when everything was over.
343	18221	7	2	I consider myself a very patient person, and an example of this is my experience with games. Some games require waiting for weeks, months, or even years. I've gone through such waiting periods before, which shows my patience in this regard. In conclusion, my ability to wait for games demonstrates my patient nature.
344	18222	7	2	In my life, I've had to be patient on many occasions. One memorable instance was waiting in a long line for the opening of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 on @DATE1. There were at least @NUM1 people in the line. This was one of the largest apple orchards in the area where I lived. It was my first time going, but my sister, along with her friend @PERSON1, had been there countless times before. My sister said it was one of the scariest things she'd ever experienced.  The opening was scheduled for @TIME1, and it was only @NUM2, yet the line behind us kept growing. My heart was pounding, and I checked my watch almost every @NUM3 seconds. Time seemed to stand still. Finally, at @NUM4, we heard an announcement. The orchard would open in @NUM3 more minutes. Many people in the line groaned, and a lot of them left to come back the next day. Andrew, @PERSON1, and I decided to sit and wait it out.  Then, we heard the last announcement, inviting us in for @CAPS3 @CAPS9. This is my story of being patient.
345	18223	7	2	Waiting for my child was the longest @NUM1 hours of my life. I spent most of that time in the waiting room. The nurses tried to calm me with updates, but it didn't work. So, I lit a smoke to ease my nerves. I was filled with worry, not knowing if my wife or our baby would live. I wondered if the baby would have a happy life, if it would be picked on, or if it would shut life out.  I sat there, ignoring the nurses' pleas to reassure me, shutting out the rest of the world to focus on my thoughts. My silence was finally broken by the sound of a baby crying. I rushed to my wife's room and found her holding a beautiful baby girl. She said, “Waited long enough.” In the end, all my worries melted away as I saw our new - born daughter.
346	18225	7	2	"One instance when I demonstrated patience was when my family visited @CAPS1 Avengers. We were in line to ride Shiver Me Timbers, the largest roller - coaster in the park. As we were queuing, a kid cut in front of my friend @PERSON1 and me. I firmly told the kid, ""You're in line,"" and the child went to the back of the lengthening queue. Everyone around cheered. When we reached the top of the ramp, the ride malfunctioned. We had to wait for about an hour before it was fixed. We got in, and I took off my glasses. The ride started. It climbed the tallest hill first, then went down smaller and smaller hills. After that, there was a turn and finally, the last hill. It sped like a diver at @NUM1 mph. When the ride ended, I realized it was a time when I had shown patience."
347	18226	7	2	We were on our way to @LOCATION1. My uncle lived there. Since he always visited our place, we decided to go to his new home. I was really excited about the trip, but there was a catch - it was a more than ten - hour drive. The morning we were supposed to leave, my parents woke me up. I was so tired. I checked the clock, and it was six thirty a.m. We didn't plan to bring a lot of stuff, so we started packing and getting into the van. However, it took longer than expected. My dad said we'd leave around seven thirty, but we ended up leaving an hour later than planned. Once we were on the road, about an hour in, I fell asleep in the back seat. We made a stop at an hour and @DATE1, and I woke up. After we got back in the van, my brother and I watched a movie on our portable DVD player. I knew the journey would take a while, so I tried to be patient and slept most of the time. When we finally arrived at @DATE1, it was amazing. Their house was on a mountain. I had a great time visiting them. We walked around town and went into stores. Seeing my uncle and aunt was really fun. This was definitely a time when I was patient.
348	18227	7	2	A time I showed patience was when my family went to @CAPS1.I. Adventures. We all wanted to go on the Leaver water slide, which was the biggest one there. The line was incredibly long; it curled around, and our family was at the end of the curve. It was early morning when we finally made it to the slide. It was huge, about @NUM1 feet tall. We got in line, and only half an hour had passed when my mom left. Another half an hour later, my older brother left. Now, only my other brother, my sister, my dad, and I were left in the line. Then, someone got hurt on the ride, and they shut it down for two hours. When they finally reopened it, my other brother and sister decided not to go. So, it was just my dad and me in the line. When it was almost our turn, my dad got scared and left. So, I ended up going on the same raft with an old man. The old man kept his cool, and I was so happy to finally get on the ride. This experience truly tested my patience.
349	18228	7	2	Patience is an extremely important quality as it can contribute to success in numerous aspects of life. In an educational setting, patience is crucial because there are often tasks that require waiting. For instance, in the games of chess or checkers, being patient is essential. While the opponent is making their move, one can use that time to strategize a counter - attack. Patience is also relevant when it comes to waiting. Take @CAPS1 eve as an example. Everyone is excited and eager for morning to arrive, but they must be patient and wait. Similarly, on one's birthday, instead of peeking at the presents, one should be patient and wait to open them. Overall, patience is a highly useful skill that can enhance various life experiences.
350	18229	7	2	"Yay! Today is the day we get to go to @CAPS2 Point,"" @CAPS3 @PERSON1 exclaimed. ""Come on @PERSON1, let's hit the road,"" @CAPS5 announced. The family was planning a long - awaited vacation to @CAPS7 Point @CAPS22 @DATE1, and today was the day they were finally leaving. They loaded all their suitcases into the car. Once everything was in place, they set off. ""@CAPS8 @CAPS11, how long is this drive going to take?"" @CAPS9, @PERSON1's older sister, asked. ""@CAPS10, about six hours, sweetie,"" @CAPS11 replied. The family lived in @LOCATION1, so they had to drive a long way to reach @LOCATION2. ""@CAPS13 @CAPS11!!! I can't survive six hours in a car!!!,"" @CAPS9 complained. ""@CAPS14 @CAPS9, you wanted to come here, so you have to be as patient as @CAPS3 @PERSON1,"" @CAPS11 said. ""@CAPS18, I guess I'll try to wait,"" @CAPS9 responded. About three hours into the drive, @CAPS9 kept asking, ""Are we there yet?"" Even though the answer was always ""No,"" she continued to ask. Eventually, @CAPS3 @PERSON1 got annoyed and shouted, ""Stop it! Just have some patience!"" ""@CAPS18, I'll stop,"" @CAPS9 replied. After about two more hours, they finally arrived. The parents bought the tickets and asked their children which ride they wanted to go on. They both smiled and said, ""The @CAPS20."" They walked up to the line and started waiting. They waited and waited. After what seemed like four hours in line, @CAPS9 gave up and shouted, ""I don't want to wait in line anymore! I'm leaving!"" So, the family got back in the car and drove off. When they got home and settled, @PERSON1 told @CAPS9, ""All it takes is some patience, and you can have fun."" @CAPS9 didn't say a word. This shows that patience is necessary to fully enjoy experiences."
351	18230	7	2	"One day, @PERSON1's mom, ""@CAPS1"", decided to go shopping. @PERSON1 desperately wanted to go with her, but his mom kept saying @CAPS2. @PERSON1 begged persistently, and finally, his mom relented, saying, ""@CAPS3, but you can't complain."" So, @PERSON1 went shopping with his mom. When they arrived at the store, around @DATE1, @PERSON1 said, ""I'm bored. Can we go now?"" His mom replied @CAPS4, @CAPS2, encouraging him to be patient. @PERSON1 retorted, ""Patient? You want me to be patient? We've been here for like @DATE1 hours!"" His mom corrected him, stating they had only been there for ten @DATE1. @PERSON1 claimed he had @CAPS2 more patience. To resolve the situation, his mom made a deal with @PERSON1. If he behaved well for @NUM1 more @DATE1, they would go to the ice - cream place. However, during those @NUM1 @DATE1, @PERSON1 kept saying he was bored and urging his mom to hurry up, driving her crazy. Finally, they left the store. They got in the car and drove past the ice - cream place. @PERSON1 noticed and said, ""Wait! We passed it."" His mom simply replied, ""I know."" @PERSON1 reminded her of their deal. His mom acknowledged it but said he had broken the deal and asked what he had learned. @PERSON1 joked that when making a deal, one should sign a contract. His mom then said @CAPS2, emphasizing that patience is a virtue he needed to learn. This is the story of @PERSON1's lesson in patience."
352	18231	7	2	A time when I demonstrated patience was when I took the @CAPS1 test in @NUM1 grade. In my class, there were only @NUM2 @NUM1 graders, while the rest were @NUM4. As a result, we took the test in the principal's office. On that day, we had to complete a writing section. These writing tests are challenging and time - consuming. When the test started, some students rushed to finish as quickly as possible. I, however, took my time to plan what I would write about. Since we had a generous amount of time, I believed it was important to make the most of it to ensure the quality of my work. This required being patient with myself. To achieve this, I carefully reviewed my answers to make sure they were correct. After finishing the writing section, I still had plenty of time left. So, I went over my work again to double - check. Once I was satisfied with my corrections, I waited for the other students to finish by reading. This experience was a clear instance of when I was patient.
353	18232	7	2	"Patience is everything."" Have you ever heard these words? They often come to mind when you're waiting in line for a test, at a food restaurant, or stuck in traffic. You may feel annoyed and angry, but then these words offer a reminder. One time, I was waiting in an incredibly long line to reach the ordering counter. I was in a hurry because I had a class to attend in five minutes. When I finally got a view of the counter, I saw the employees rushing around, struggling to handle all the orders. I then noticed the cause of the hold - up. There was an old man at the front of the line, desperately trying to place his order. With so many choices, he was understandably confused about what to pick. The rest of the line was not as patient. Some people were shouting, ""Hurry up!"" and ""@CAPS1"". I, on the other hand, waited patiently, thinking that the line was not being fair to the old man. I decided to suggest a choice for him, and he was able to place his order. As a result, I was @NUM1 minutes late for my class. However, I was patient and understanding towards the old man. As the saying goes, ""What comes around goes around."" For the rest of the day, I felt good about my kind deed, realizing that patience and kindness can have a positive impact."
354	18233	7	2	"Are you always or sometimes patient? If not, that's normal. @CAPS1 - @CAPS1. However, everyone on @LOCATION1 should strive to be patient as it will be beneficial in the long run. If we were all more patient, life would be a little easier. For example, if your brother is using the bathroom and you need to use it, you can wait for him to finish. This way, you avoid an argument and show patience. I often say, ""I'm patient!"" but that's a lie because I'm far from being patient. I know it's not easy, but we should all make an effort to be more patient. By doing so, we can create a more harmonious environment and make life a bit more bearable for everyone."
355	18234	7	2	"@PERSON1 was a hamster. One day, @PERSON1 was out of his cage, playing with his owner's sister's hamster, also named @PERSON1. @PERSON1 had just gotten a brand - new hamster toy. This toy, @CAPS5, had a bunch of tubes to climb in, a slide, and a running wheel. @PERSON1 wished he had one too, but his owner didn't have enough money yet. Even when he played with his own toys, he still yearned for a @CAPS5. It was very difficult for @PERSON1 to wait, especially when he saw @PERSON1 playing in his new toy. One day, when @PERSON1 was talking to @PERSON1, @PERSON1 said, ""I really wish I had one of those hamster toys. But my owner doesn't have enough money!"" @PERSON1 replied, ""Don't worry. You can play in mine until he does. I hear he's almost got enough."" @PERSON1 agreed, saying, ""Okay, I guess that's close enough."" A few days later, @PERSON1 got his own brand - new @CAPS5. He exclaimed, ""I guess waiting was worth it!"" His @CAPS5 was twice as big as @PERSON1's, so they could share it. And from then on, they both lived happily ever after, having learned the value of patience and sharing."
356	18235	7	2	"I'm not a very patient person, so I'm going to write about what patience is. Patience is when you don't complain when you're bored or waiting for something. For example, I'll tell a story about patience. Note that this story is completely untrue. I was walking home and saw an elderly woman having trouble with her groceries. I wanted to help her, but I was thinking about my cousin who would be arriving at my house any moment. I walked up to the woman and asked if she needed help. She replied, ""If you could, I live over there,"" and pointed to a large tan house. I carried her things to the door. ""There you go,"" I said. ""Would you mind helping me put them away?"" the woman asked. I thought about how my mother never wanted me to go into a stranger's house, but I sort of knew her, so I said I would help. The woman smiled. I then picked up the bags and said, ""Is your home unlocked?"" ""No, it's not,"" she replied. ""Where are your keys?"" I asked. ""I believe they're lost somewhere in the lawn."" I searched for about a half - hour and found them under a bush. I brought the keys to her and said, ""There you go."" She opened the door, and I helped her with her groceries. When they were all put away, I said, ""I ought to be going."" ""Not without some way I can repay you,"" said the woman. ""Go find my purse."" I waited and waited; it must have been an hour. The woman came out of the kitchen with some change. ""It's only change; I couldn't find my wallet,"" she said and gave me the change. I left feeling like a good person because I was patient with the woman. I told my mom about my good deed, and my cousin got to stay longer. This was my example of patience. If this ever happens to you, make sure you're patient and get to know the person."
357	18236	7	2	One day, after coming home from a movie, we were stopped by a train. At first, we thought it was just one train. But then, a very large train came. In the car were my dad and me. We sat in the car for at least [NUM1] minutes, but the train showed no signs of ending. Suddenly, it stopped dead in its tracks. We considered turning around, but the [ORGANIZATION1] cars were blocking the way. In about [NUM2] minutes, the cars began to move slowly. After [NUM3] minutes, the train finally ended. After the [CAPS2] went up, we started driving, but another train was coming. So my dad stepped on the gas and got us out of there. We were very patient. In total, we spent [NUM4] minutes, almost an hour, waiting. But we were patient, and that long - awaited journey finally ended.
358	18237	7	2	When we drive to [CAPS1], I have to be patient. The journey takes [NUM1] hours, plus the extra time we spend going to the restroom, having lunch, and staying overnight. When we're on the road, it can be quite [CAPS2], which is why I need to be patient. I bring a car bag to keep myself entertained. It contains a book, a pad of paper, and my dad's laptop. My iPod is also a big help. I especially don't like it when my legs get all cramped and uncomfortable. I really hate that feeling. But in the end, I love the destination. You just have to be patient enough to get there, and the end result is always worth it.
359	18238	7	2	One day at school during lunch, I was extremely hungry. The lunch area was filled with kids. I could hear my stomach growling. I stood in line for ten minutes and then thought about cutting, but I didn't. It felt like an hour had passed as I kept waiting, trying to be as patient as possible. Then I realized the line was moving faster and faster. Finally, I got my food and ate. I only had five minutes of recess left, but I was just happy to have eaten. This shows the importance of patience.
360	18239	7	2	"I know someone who was patient. This person was at the doctor's office. She was six years old and still waited patiently. A way to solve the problem of waiting could be to ask nicely, ""Can I go ahead of you, please?"" This would solve everything in a kind and respectful way. That's what I think is the respectful approach."
361	18240	7	2	"When I was six years old, I went to the walking clinic due to my asthma getting worse after being sick for a while. I waited at the clinic for almost [@NUM1] hours. During this time, I asked the staff to change the TV channel to [@ORGANIZATION1]. After [@CAPS2] ended, I fell asleep. It seemed like forever before someone said, ""[@CAPS6] salslory."" My mom tried to wake me up but couldn't until I fell off the couch seat in the kids' area. When they called me, my mom said I was really patient, and the nurse even commented on my patience and gave me a small lollipop. After that, I went home and went to bed. That was the time I was patient for two hours."
362	18241	7	2	My mom is one of the most patient people I know, especially on a particular day when we were on our way to church. My brothers, sister, and I can be quite difficult to handle at times. On this day, my brother and I started arguing and fighting for no reason as usual. My youngest brother and sister were screaming at each other over silly things like him sticking his tongue out or her pinching. When we arrived at church, my mom thought the chaos would stop, but our three - year - old brother, [@PERSON1], ran around and threw things in the church. My oldest brother called my sister names, and I talked with my friends. I know I wouldn't be that patient in such a situation. After church, my mom just asked us to behave. Realizing her patience, we decided on our own that we should listen to her and be well - behaved.
363	18242	7	2	One day at the fair, I wanted to ride the bumper cars. I got in line, and there were about [@NUM1] people in front of me, so I knew I had to be patient. The ride let [@NUM2] people in at a time, so it took a while for my turn. When it was almost my turn, I wanted to go with my friends, so we let some people go in front of us. After [@NUM3] minutes, it was finally our turn. We picked our cars and had a great time. That was a time when I showed patience.
364	18243	7	2	On [@DATE1], my mom and I were riding bikes on a trail. At the end of the trail, my mom turned a corner too fast and flipped over her handlebars. I didn't realize she had broken her wrist until she stood up and told me. I was shocked as no one in my family had ever broken a bone before. Mom calmly told me we had to walk our bikes to the car since we drove there. On the way to the car, she didn't complain about the pain. When we reached the car, I had to put the heavy bikes in the backseat, which was difficult. The situation became stressful as the bikes didn't fit easily, and my mom was in pain. She saw I was getting upset and directed me on how to put the bikes in. Then she asked me to get her glasses that we left on the trail. I ran to get them, but they were broken. Since we had the same eyesight, I gave her my glasses. Mom had to drive herself to the emergency room as I'm too young to drive. At the emergency room, we waited a while. I was freaking out, but mom was joking about how she got hurt while exercising. I really admire my mom for her patience and calmness in such a difficult situation. She never complained about the pain or yelled at me when I was struggling. I know I wouldn't have handled it as well if I were in her place. I hope I can develop the same understanding and tolerance as her.
365	18244	7	2	"One day, my mom took me to the doctor to get flu shots, just like every other year. In the car on the way there, I kept asking if we really had to go, but my mom said yes. When we arrived at the doctor's office, we had to wait a bit. My mom went to get the papers, and I stood there watching the fish swim. Then she said, ""Let's go to the waiting room."" She said I had been patient while waiting, except for my whining in the car. I thanked her and asked when we would go in. When we finally got in, I had to be weighed and answer a lot of questions. Then the nurse came in and gave me shots in my left arm. She said I was almost the only kid patient who had been patient. That's the story of when I showed patience."
366	18245	7	2	People vary in their levels of patience. Some individuals are patient, characterized by understanding and tolerance, and can endure difficulties without complaint. Others have short attention - spans and struggle to sit still or wait, thus lacking patience. The well - known saying “patience is a virtue” is familiar to many. True patience is exemplified by waiting in line for @NUM1 hours to watch a movie without fidgeting or pacing. It is also about maintaining composure in the face of problems. In essence, patience is an important quality that not everyone possesses.
367	18246	7	2	On @DATE1, my family and I went on a trip to @ORGANIZATION1. When we arrived at the airport, we had to wait a long time. We were at the airport, about to leave for @LOCATION1, when our flight was delayed due to an early - morning thunderstorm. The wait seemed interminable; every minute felt like an hour. After half an hour, I asked my mom for money to buy breakfast, but she refused. I was on the verge of losing my temper when an announcement came over the speaker saying that the flight to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 would be delayed further. Then I remembered I had a @CAPS5 in my bag, but when I tried to turn it on, it was dead. After an hour, the storm stopped, and we were finally able to board the plane. From that experience, I realized that I am not a patient person.
368	18247	7	2	This is a story about patience. One day, my friend asked me if I had ever been patient. I told him I had never been patient in my life, and he advised me that I should be. Another day, my friend was telling me about a new game that was coming out, but I interrupted him while he was talking. I could tell he didn't like it. In class, I boasted about winning a race against him. However, lacking patience, I started complaining to him. He said I had no patience, and our argument went on. Then another friend intervened, scolding me for having no patience and saying I had lost @NUM1 game. They asked us to stop fighting. The next day, I asked my friend if he had something to tell me, promising to listen better. I learned that listening to others before speaking can take our friendship to the next level.
369	18248	7	2	Some people claim that patience is the key to life, but I'm not entirely sure. Patience means being quiet and being able to wait for things. It is the ability to handle difficult tasks without feeling frustrated, angry, or sad. When one has patience, they can perform tasks with ease and without difficulties. Patience is associated with self - respect, kindness, fairness, and not being self - seeking. It involves showing respect rather than disrespect, having no evil intentions, not boasting, and not lying. Patience can improve difficult situations, making it easier to focus and do things better. It also helps in waiting for things, which is an important aspect of life.
370	18249	7	2	When I think about being patient, I recall the time I went to Southrend @LOCATION1 for a hockey event. We were on the road for @NUM1 ½ hours. During the journey, I didn't ask how much longer it would take, even though I was on a crowded bus with my hockey friends watching a hockey movie. To me, patience means waiting without constantly asking “Is it done yet?” or “Are we there yet?” Personally, I don't have the best patience. When I want to use the computer, ride the guard or the four - wheeler and someone else is using them, I often ask “When will they be done?” Patience develops as we grow. As we get older, we can wait for longer periods without getting stressed about how long things take, even something like this test requires patience.
371	18250	7	2	"It all began on a frigid and snowy @DATE1, just two days away from @CAPS1! @CAPS1 is my most beloved time of the year as one can behold all the lights in the vivid colors of the rainbow. Moreover, people are extremely jubilant during this period. I typically become impatient while awaiting @CAPS1 to arrive. However, this year, I resolved to be patient. So, I accompanied my mother to purchase new lights for the @CAPS1 tree and presents for my family. As we shopped, the store was filled with all sorts of people. When we reached the checkout line, there was a long queue. My mother advised me to be patient, and I heeded her advice. Once we finally left the store, we rushed home to commence decorating. I set up the blow - up @LOCATION1, which took an inordinate amount of time, but I persevered with patience. Eventually, it was time to make the cookies, the most enjoyable part. We cut the dough and placed it in the oven. The cookies took a long time to bake. My mother told me to be as patient as possible. I remained patient, and eventually, the cookies were adorned with sprinkles. With everything prepared and set up, we were ready for @CAPS1. ""It's coming on @CAPS1,"" I murmured to myself. I knew I had to be patient, or @CAPS1 would never arrive. Finally, on @CAPS1 @CAPS10, everyone came over, had dinner with us, and received the presents I had bought for them. As everyone left, I walked to my room, oblivious to the fact that it was @CAPS1 @CAPS10. When I woke up late and everyone was waiting for me, I was overjoyed: my patience had paid off."
372	18251	7	2	Patience implies being understanding and tolerant. I demonstrated patience when I went to @LOCATION1 during @CAPS1. When I visited @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I had to wait in line. Although the waiting time was not overly long, I still had to endure it. I didn't relish the experience, yet I remained patient. The wait was worthwhile. I also had to wait in line for food as there were numerous people queued up. That wait was also worth it because the food was delicious. This is how I applied the life - skill of patience. Undoubtedly, patience is a valuable life skill to cultivate.
373	18252	7	2	"One time, my cousin was impatient because she was planning to go to a movie and a party at @CAPS1. There were many kids at her house, and she had to clean up the house before her mother returned. Additionally, on that day, she called all our moms, but none of them answered. So, she rushed to clean up before her boyfriend came over. Then she quickly took a bath, got out, and put the kids in the tub. She still had cleaning to do and showed us what needed to be cleaned. After that, she rushed out of @CAPS1, leaving us there while she went to get us something to eat. We cleaned up while she was away. Then she called me and said she was on her way with food. I simply replied, ""oh"". Next, her boyfriend arrived and was ready to go. When she came back, the house was clean. Then her mother came home, went into the room to change clothes, and asked where she was going. She said she was going to the movie and a party. Her mother said no and told her to clean up the bathroom first. She got angry and said, ""Mom, I've been patient all day, and I'm ready to go."" Eventually, she cleaned it and then they left."
374	18253	7	2	Patience is the quality of being understanding and tolerant. I'm going to tell you about my friend @PERSON1, who is an extremely patient person. @PERSON1 is understanding because whenever someone asks her to wait, she listens attentively and waits patiently. For instance, when her parents were having a conversation and she wanted to tell them something, they told her to wait as it is impolite to interrupt adults while they are speaking. @PERSON1 truly embodies the virtue of patience.
375	18254	7	2	A moment when I showed patience was when my birthday was approaching. I was eager for my birthday party to arrive sooner, but my parents consistently said no. Finally, when the party came, I received all my presents except those from my parents. They said they would give them to me after everyone left. However, no one left until ten o'clock, so I fell asleep. When I woke up, no one was awake, and I still had to wait. (I really dislike waiting.) When my mum woke up, I asked if I could open my presents, and she said to wait until my father got up. Finally, when my dad woke up (@NUM1), I was finally able to open my presents. The wait was indeed worth it.
376	18255	7	2	On a certain day, I woke up to the sound of the alarm. It was early, and my mom was on time to prepare. I was in a rush as it was the day the Xbox @NUM2 was released, and I really wanted it. My mom had made an agreement with me: if I remained patient during our errands, I could get it. After an hour, we reached the grocery store. I quickly went inside and grabbed a cart. My mom reminded me to be patient. For the rest of the time in the store, I followed my mom without showing any signs of impatience. After what seemed like hours, we finished shopping, and our next stop was the library. I couldn't do much there without getting in trouble, which I disliked. But I just sat on a bench quickly. It was already dark when we finally went to Best Buy to buy the Xbox @NUM2. We got it, and I was extremely excited. My mom said I deserved it for being patient all day.
377	18256	7	2	On @DATE1, I traveled to @LOCATION1. What one often forgets about this journey is the @NUM1 - hour plane ride. We were part of a group of @NUM2 families, all my friends. When we boarded the plane, we were excited. People at the gate were scattered everywhere. So, I sat with my @NUM3 favorite friends during that trip. We were all loaded with electronics. As we took off, I thought the flight would be easy, but I was wrong. At first, it was fine. We talked and played games on our iPods and such. However, after about @NUM2 hours, we started to get itchy, and our iPods died. Then, we decided to watch a movie on the in - flight DVD player. But it started to run low on battery, and the player malfunctioned. It stopped working, and we still had another @NUM2 hours to go, and we only managed to watch one movie. There was a TV on the back of each seat, so we tried to turn it on, but it was one of the @NUM6 that didn't work. We started to get really bored, and the flight was getting long. We didn't know what to do; it was hopeless. We had to sit and wait, which was a real test of patience. Finally, when we landed, we were so relieved. It was the longest @NUM3 hours ever. We did nothing but wait. As soon as the flight was over, we bolted out of our seats. We no longer had to be patient.
378	18257	7	2	Patience is difficult for me, but there was a time when I was patient. It was the first day of school, at the end of the day when there were volleyball tryouts. I wanted to try out, but I didn't have my physical. So, along with @NUM1 other people, I sat and watched the volleyball tryouts for @NUM2 @DATE1. I wasn't very patient at that time. However, at the end of the tryouts, my mom came to pick me up, and we went straight to the sports center's doctor's office so I could get my physical. When we went in, my mom had to sign and fill out paperwork because she hadn't made an appointment for me. That took about @NUM3 minutes. Then we waited and waited. In total, if you add it up, we waited for @NUM2 @DATE1 with nothing to do. I was patient, but my mom definitely wasn't. Finally, they called me in. They took my mom to a room to wait while they measured my height and weight. Then they took me to the room where my mom was, and we waited for another @NUM3 minutes. Finally, they gave us the physical form, and we left. Volleyball practice ended at @NUM7, and we didn't get home until @NUM8. That was a time when I was patient.
379	18258	7	2	There was a time when I showed patience. I wanted to play football with my dad, but he didn't want to. When he was putting on his shoes, every time I asked him to play football, he would take his shoe off. I had to wait for two and a half hours just for him to put one shoe on. When he was putting on the second shoe, I didn't say anything. Eventually, we went and played football. That's how I learned that if you exercise patience, you'll be able to do what you want.
380	18259	7	2	A time when someone showed patience was when my mom found me writing on the wall. She was very angry with me. Then my sister said she did it too. My mom showed patience and listened to what we had to say. She then said we were in a lot of trouble because we should know better. She still made us clean everything for a week. But she was very patient with us. That's how someone I know, my mom, showed patience.
381	18260	7	2	Patience is a sense of tolerance. Having “the patience” implies that one can wait, knowing that what they desire will come in due time. For example, gobbling food down out of the fear that it will be stolen is unnecessary, as it would still be there if left untouched. Patience also means being aware that everything will turn out well and that there is time. When one has the patience to do something, they take their time and proceed at their own pace, confident that they will finish. Generally, patience refers to how long one can wait to do something or endure a situation. It could also indicate how long one can tolerate something, like a bully who repeatedly makes fun of them. Eventually, there comes a point when one's patience wears thin, and they can no longer take it. That is what patience encompasses.
382	18261	7	2	“Hey, [PERSON1], it’s [PERSON3]. How are you?” “I’m good. What’s up? [PERSON3], I’m calling to ask if you want to go to [CAPS2] [CAPS3] with me.” “Yeah!” “I haven’t been there in a long time. Hold on, let me ask.” “Okay.” As I explained what was happening, I said, “My grandma’s gonna come pick you up.” “What time?” “[NUM1] o’clock!” “See you later! Bye!” Then I called, “[PERSON1], come help us pack the cooler.” “Okay.” There was a knock and the doorbell rang. I flung the door open and said, “[PERSON3], I missed you so much!” “Yeah!” We played guitar for [NUM2] hours straight until we both passed out. “Girls, time to get ready.” “Mom, we’re up!” We all got ready and got on the freeway. [PERSON1] and I took goofy pictures, and [PERSON3] fell asleep with [PERSON3] sleeping on me. I was so tired that my eyes were closing. “It was a long drive. We stopped so we could tell [PERSON3] we were going to [CAPS2] [CAPS3].” I looked at my mom and said, “Are you kidding me? The whole family is going?” “Just [PERSON2], [PERSON4], you, and me are going.” “What about [PERSON5]?” “She can’t go. She has to work.” “That really sucks, mom.” “I know.” “When are we going?” “We’re leaving on [DATE1] and coming back that day.” “We’re not staying the night?” “We can’t afford it.” “How did you get the [CAPS2] [CAPS3] tickets?” “I won them on a radio station.” “Cool.” “Can I bring someone?” “Like who?” “Maybe [PERSON3]. Can I call and ask if she can come?” “Here, use my phone.” As I scrolled through my mom’s phone to find [PERSON3]’s number, I hit the send button and it dialed. “Hello?” “Hi, this is [PERSON3]. Is [PERSON3] there?” “One second.”
383	18262	7	2	The time I demonstrated patience was when I was at [LOCATION1], wanting to go swimming at [ORGANIZATION1]. The place was extremely large, capable of accommodating [NUM1] people. I showed patience while going up the stairs to the waterslide. Everyone rushed in front of me to go down the [NUM2] slides. So, I waited for about [NUM3] minutes to get on the fun slide. The reason it took so long was that one had to walk up [NUM2] flights of stairs. The second time I went up, I ran up the stairs to be the first one, but I still had to wait because there were people from the previous time. Eventually, I waited for my turn. This was the time I showed patience.
384	18263	7	2	When I was patient, I was in line at Cedar Point for the [CAPS1]. We arrived at Cedar Point late, so we joined the end of the line. There was a sign halfway through indicating that the wait would be [NUM1] hour. We stood in line for an hour, and finally, we reached the front. I was extremely excited as I walked up the stairs. Then I realized that I had just waited for an hour and [NUM2] minutes for this. After that, I rode it.
385	18264	7	2	A time when I was patient was when [CAPS1], [CAPS2], and I went to the [CAPS3] [NUM1] hours early. When we walked up to the front desk, panting from running because we thought we were late, the [ORGANIZATION2] asked, “Are you ok?” I replied, “Yes, am I late for the appointment for [foyce]?” She said, “You’re [NUM1] hours early.” I said to [CAPS2], “You pulled me out of [CAPS1] two favorite hours in school to be [NUM1] hours early.” [CAPS2] said, “Sorry. Would you like me to take you back to school?” I replied, “I’m good.” We waited in the lobby. I was fine with it because I had the [ORGANIZATION1] ball game to play. I played it until I got bored and then read some strange adult magazine. By the way, I was only [NUM5] when this happened, and now I’m almost [NUM6]. Then the [CAPS3] walked out, and I got [CAPS1] shots. That was the time I was the most and longest patient.
386	18265	7	2	"On @DATE1, I went to the store with my sister and mom. There were people pushing, running into each other, and shouting ""Get out of my way!"" This behavior angered me and others, yet like everyone else, I refrained from yelling at the over - excited shoppers. As it was close to Christmas, I understood why people were so irate. We were all just trying to mind our own business. However, for some reason, people's actions made everyone angry, and that's when patience became crucial. Eventually, we managed to leave the store and go home. This experience shows that having patience is essential."
387	18266	7	2	One day, I went hunting with my brother at @CAPS1 oaks. It was a one - and - a - half - mile walk to get there. Once we set up, the hunt commenced. We waited patiently, but initially saw nothing. We were determined not to give up. After an hour, a flock of turkeys appeared, wandering around like penguins. Their feathers were losing color, and as they approached, the males' beards swayed side to side like trees in a windy day. After observing them for about @NUM1 minutes, they likely caught our scent and fled. We thought the deer wouldn't come out, but about @NUM2 minutes later, a deer emerged. We watched it until it came within shooting range. I noticed deer surrounding us and told my brother. He also saw them, and only one was a deer. As they got closer, like an approaching storm, my brother drew back his bow. He held it for over @NUM3 minutes, almost like a statue. He waited for the deer to turn around, and when it was in perfect view, he shot. The arrow flew out like a bullet from a gun but missed the deer by about @NUM4 feet. The deer ran off after hearing the arrow. We waited for more deer but saw none. Then we cleaned up our blind, lugged our equipment back to the car, and went home. When we arrived, everyone was waiting at the door. We told them we didn't get a kill. After that, my brother and I had dinner, and the whole family sat down to watch a movie.
388	18267	7	2	Patience is a valuable virtue in life; sometimes, it's the only thing that can keep us calm and rational. It plays a crucial role in various situations. For instance, my dog ran away, and I'm patiently waiting for her to return. There are often situations where we have to wait for someone, and in those cases, patience is the only reasonable choice. In conclusion, cultivating patience can help us navigate through life's uncertainties more smoothly.
389	18268	7	2	I enjoy building a house or doing a puzzle. Building a house and completing a puzzle both require time, dedication, hard work, and patience. If one lacks patience, it becomes more difficult to finish these tasks as they may get bored easily. Therefore, patience is a key factor in successfully accomplishing such activities.
390	18269	7	2	My dad is well - known for his patience. For example, he waited a full @NUM1 years to acquire a single lens for his camera. His patience allowed him to achieve this. My mom is also very patient. She waited an entire month for a pair of slippers. I'm extremely proud to have such patient parents. Their patience reflects their responsibility, and in my opinion, patience is closely linked to being responsible. This shows that patience is an important quality that I admire in my parents.
391	18271	7	2	When my brother, father, and two cousins emerged from the car after a @NUM1 - hour drive from @LOCATION1, we were certain that we were in for an exciting time. I looked up and was greeted by a magnificent sight: an abundance of roller @CAPS1. We were at Cedar Point, an amusement park. In the car, we had discussed various @CAPS1, such as the Maverick, Millennium Force, @NUM2, @CAPS2, and the Mantis. As soon as we entered the park, I knew it would be a fun day. Right at the entrance, we spotted the @CAPS2, but the line was extremely long, so we decided to come back later. As the day progressed, we managed to go on almost all of the @CAPS1. When we approached the @CAPS4, we saw at least @NUM3 people in line, which dashed our hopes of going on the tallest ride. By the time we returned to the @CAPS2, the line had grown even longer than at the start of the day. After some discussion, we decided that the line wasn't going to get any shorter and decided to queue up. About an hour later, a @NUM4 - year - old boy was standing with his mom. There was a cool fish printed on the back of his shirt, so my cousin asked him what it was. He said it was a tropical fish from @LOCATION3. We ended up chatting with them for half an hour until it was our turn to get on the ride. The ride was truly amazing and well worth the wait. This experience taught me that patience can lead to great rewards.
392	18272	7	2	One time, I went to @LOCATION1 with my @CAPS1 + cousin. His family was getting ready to return to @LOCATION2, and I had to babysit my cousin @CAPS2 while his parents packed their things. My cousin can be quite a handful and always wants things his way. However, I remained patient and waited until the trip was over. Although my cousin and I had many arguments during that vacation, I still love him. I knew his mom would be proud of me for being patient, even when I had to give in to his demands. For instance, when we went for a walk to a pond to look for alligators, @CAPS2 wanted to go to the park instead. Considering his young age of @NUM1 and immaturity, I decided to go with the flow and we went to the park. This was a time when I had to exercise patience, and it showed me that being patient in difficult situations can maintain harmony in relationships.
393	18273	7	2	Patience is a virtue that not everyone possesses. To be patient, one must understand and tolerate challenging circumstances. I am one of those people who value patience, as I believe it is a precious gift. Developing patience takes time, and one cannot always be in a rush. For example, one day, I heard someone talking in the basement. As I made my way downstairs to see who was in the house, I heard giggling and sounds of excitement. I continued walking until I traced the voices to a closed door. When I opened it, I was greeted by a sight of various gifts and saw my mom and dad. They quickly closed the door and told me to go back upstairs. I ran up to tell my brothers what I had seen, and they were all very excited. The next day passed, and I was eagerly anticipating @CAPS2. I had to exercise patience and wait. This experience reinforced my belief that patience is essential in life, as it often leads to pleasant surprises.
394	18275	7	2	@PERSON1 really wanted a dog. She had been asking her @CAPS1 for one for quite some time. Every time she asked, her @CAPS1 would reply, “You can't get a dog until you earn it.” @PERSON1 was confused about how to earn it. She thought about it for a while but couldn't quite understand what her @CAPS1 meant. Eventually, she figured that her @CAPS1 wanted her to show some responsibility. Looking at the clock, which showed @NUM1, she realized it was almost dinner time. She thought her @CAPS1 was probably in the kitchen preparing dinner, so she went in. @PERSON1 asked a bit loudly, “What's for dinner?” Her @CAPS1 replied that it was steak and mashed potatoes, which was @PERSON1's favorite. She nodded and said, “Can't help!” Her @CAPS1 questioned why not. @PERSON1 then asked what she could do, and her @CAPS1 told her to get the salt and pepper and put them on the cooking steak. Her @CAPS1 was quite happy that @PERSON1 was willing to help. @PERSON1 did her part and then went upstairs to her room, hoping her @CAPS1 would understand her eagerness. After having dinner with her @CAPS1, she went to bed. The next day, she ran downstairs to find her @CAPS1 sitting on the couch. She quickly asked, “What are we doing today?” Her @CAPS1 said they could just stay around the house. @PERSON1 was getting impatient as she really wanted a dog and had been trying her best to be good. Finally, she lost her temper and shouted, “Are we ever gonna get a dog???” Her @CAPS1, a bit surprised, started to say, “Well...” but @PERSON1 interrupted, “@CAPS1, I really want one and I've been trying my best for you!” Her @CAPS1 then said that if she had been more patient, she was going to suggest they go look at some dogs. @PERSON1 felt bad for losing her temper and realized that being patient would have led to a better outcome. Later that day, she and her @CAPS1 went out and had a good day, and this experience taught @PERSON1 the importance of patience.
395	18276	7	2	One day, my sister accidentally dropped my phone in Kool - Aid. I was going to get a new phone, but it depended on my behavior. So, I had to be extremely well - behaved and patient. For the rest of that week, I was on my best behavior every day. However, I still hadn't gotten a new phone, so I asked my sister when she was going to buy it. Since it was her fault, she offered to buy me a new one and told me to be patient as it was on its way. Another week passed, and I was starting to lose my patience, but I managed to hold on. The next day, my sister took me to the Metro PCS store to pick out a new phone. This experience clearly shows that by being patient, I was finally able to get a new phone. It was a valuable lesson that patience pays off in the end.
396	18277	7	2	One instance when I had to exercise patience was during a visit to @ORGANIZATION1. Patience is particularly crucial when everything is sold out. For example, when I was in line to purchase a shirt, the queue was extremely long, forcing me to wait patiently. This required a great deal of patience as @ORGANIZATION1 was completely sold out, and there were only three booths selling @CAPS1 - shirts. At the venue, there were multiple situations where patience was necessary, such as finding parking and getting to our seats. When @ORGANIZATION1 took a @NUM1 - minute break, I went to buy a soda. All the lines were long, and I spent approximately @NUM2 minutes waiting to get my soda, my cousin's fries, and a soda for my sister. Finally, I got everything but forgot my soda. Fortunately, the vendor gave me a new one just in case the original one wasn't mine. I returned, drank my soda, and watched the show. Patience is essential, and waiting allows us to obtain what we need. This was a time when I had to be patient.
397	18278	7	2	Patience can be likened to a jungle cat hunting its prey. The jungle cat must remain completely motionless to successfully capture its target, demonstrating remarkable patience. Once it has assumed the correct position, it pauses briefly. Through patience, the cat achieves its goal of catching the prey. In essence, patience is a vital quality that enables the accomplishment of objectives, just as it does for the jungle cat in its hunt.
398	18279	7	2	I had to exercise patience during my dance audition at @ORGANIZATION1 Grove College. Every year, I audition there to secure a scholarship to help cover my tuition fees. I was excited and well - prepared for the audition. There were about @NUM1 people in the dance room. After putting in a lot of effort during the audition, my teachers informed me that we would receive a letter in the mail indicating the amount of scholarship money I had been awarded. Every day, I eagerly waited by the mailbox, hoping for my letter. A month passed, and I still hadn't received anything. I began to worry that I wouldn't get any scholarship. Just when I had given up hope, a letter arrived. It stated that I had only received @MONEY3, which was disappointing as my classes cost @MONEY1, and @MONEY3 was of little help. I even considered quitting dance, but I didn't want to give up on my talent. When dance classes started, my teacher informed me that there had been a mistake, and I actually received a scholarship of @MONEY2. My mom and I were overjoyed. The teacher apologized for the mix - up and the delay. That year, I learned that patience can bring rewards, and we should never give up because things will eventually turn out well. Additionally, learning patience at an early age is beneficial as we will face numerous challenges in the future, and patience will help us overcome them.
399	18280	7	2	One time, I went to the doctor with my brother, sister, and mom. The doctor instructed us to wait in a room, saying that another doctor would come in. We ended up waiting for three hours. My mom got angry because the doctors had forgotten about us. It turned out that the doctor who was supposed to see us had gone into the wrong room. To make matters worse, I had to get three shots, and I detest shots. In the end, I realized that my mom isn't very patient. However, after the doctor's visit, I got ice cream. This experience taught me that patience often has a reward.
400	18281	7	2	"Another @NUM1 minutes have just gone to waste! I knew I should have arrived earlier. Ugh! There were so many people and so little time. Have you ever had to wait a long time for food? Three days ago, I decided to stop by my locker before going to lunch. I slammed my grey - coated locker shut and rushed to the cafeteria. I dashed past a large group of seventh - graders all eager to get to lunch. I grabbed a tan plate and waited for my @CAPS8 patty. I kept thinking, ""What's taking so long?"" Finally, I reached the place where the food was supposed to be. I reached out, but then I wondered, ""Where's the food?"" The food trays were empty! The smell of pizza filled the air, making my stomach growl with hunger. I paced around angrily, repeating, ""Where is the food?"" Then, a lunch lady announced that she would have to make @CAPS8 @CAPS9 on a sub bun. So, I went to another line. Disappointedly, I used tongs to put chips and cheese on my plate. At least I had some food. I sat down at my table, and another lunch lady came up to me and gave me a soft, squishy, warm @CAPS10 @CAPS11 as a thank - you for my patience. I thought, ""I got a cookie! A warm, delicious, @CAPS11."" Sometimes waiting can be really annoying, but sometimes it pays off."
401	18282	7	2	There was a time when I had to demonstrate patience. I went to the hospital with a broken foot. In the waiting room, I waited for about an hour and a half. It was extremely boring as many people went in before me. My mom and I simply sat on the chairs all that time. Sometimes, it's truly challenging to be patient. Finally, the nurse called my name, so I entered the room. Then, we had to wait for the doctor, which took around twenty minutes. The doctor only wanted to know how I broke my foot. After that, we waited for the nurse to come back and put a cast on. This process also took a long time. First, they placed about five layers of cloth on my foot, then two layers of the casting material. I then had to wait for the cast to dry. In conclusion, being patient can be difficult at times, but everyone is capable of it.
402	18283	7	2	Not too long ago, my brother, PERSON1, faced homework troubles. This is indeed a story about patience. Every night, my brother comes home with homework, mostly math. One day, he asked for help. I inquired about the problem, and he replied that his math homework was too long and he couldn't do it. Considering he's in fifth grade and the homework only had fifteen problems, I told him to just do it. Around two minutes later, he whined again for help, and I assisted him. It required a great deal of patience as he took an hour. While he was working, he had a fight with my mom, and he even took a shower. When I checked his work, he only got two answers right. While waiting for him to finish his shower, I copied the problems onto a separate paper, solved them, and got them all correct. When he came out, I hid the answer - sheet. He got mad when I told him he only got two right. But with my patience, I helped him. At the student - led conferences, I saw that he got an A. It's a truly happy ending for this patience - filled experience.
403	18284	7	2	Patience encompasses a multitude of aspects and is utilized daily. One might wait for a check or a letter. The process of being patient can be either fast or slow. Patience can be applied in school or at work. When standing and waiting patiently, various things can occur. In a test, patience can be used by waiting a bit longer to find the answer to a question instead of rushing and getting it wrong. In experiments, patience is crucial, and it can also be employed in math to find solutions. When building a model, one must exercise patience to ensure the result is correct; otherwise, without patience, the outcome will be incorrect. In summary, patience is an essential part of everyone's daily life, and we all have to use it.
404	18285	7	2	Patience is an extremely important value. To achieve success, one needs patience. In my life, I used patience when I got my first horse. The horse was stubborn, self - centered, and poorly trained. I had to teach her moves gradually so that she could remember how to perform them correctly. Additionally, she had just moved to a new place and was unfamiliar with the surroundings, which also required me to be patient. These are just some instances where patience has played a role in my life. In conclusion, patience is a valuable asset that helps us deal with various situations in life.
405	18286	7	2	Sixty - nine days ago, three miners in Chile got stuck underground, half a mile from the surface. Now, they are safe at home. The question is how they managed to stay alive. The answer is patience. Patience means being understanding and tolerant. When the miners got stuck, they didn't panic or blame each other; they simply waited for help. After they were found on DATE2, they were informed that they would be rescued around DATE3, which was four months away. None of the miners complained or got angry. They understood the difficulty of the rescue operation. Thankfully, on DATE1, all the miners were safely rescued. The entire rescue process took NUM1 and a half hours. In conclusion, it was patience that made this successful rescue possible.
406	18287	7	2	We were on our way to @CAPS1 point. I was silently screaming in my mind; it was incredibly crazy. We had just de - rusted on Lake Erie, and I could see it clearly, just a short walk away. When we pulled into the parking lot and made our way to the stamp station, we got our stamps and then headed towards the medal bars. However, the security stopped us, saying it only opened at ten. So, we waited. As time passed, more and more people arrived, and the area became extremely crowded. My cousins @PERSON1 and @CAPS2 and I went to play Phase Title and had to wait in line for that too. Finally, when it was time to enter the park, we all crowded up to the fence and squeezed our way in. Then we queued for the Raptor for @NUM2 minutes. The line was long, but it was truly worth it. Indeed, patience pays off a great deal.
407	18288	7	2	"On @DATE1, it was my brother's @NUM2nd birthday. He was really getting on my nerves because he kept asking our mom for things, and she repeatedly told him she didn't have them. Then he'd turn to my other brother, saying he had money for his ""baby"". His constant asking was so annoying because when people said they didn't have what he wanted, they really didn't. I kept quiet because it was his birthday. I know how to be patient when something is important or special. I just watched him until I finally said, ""Here, you can have my money. It's your birthday."" I gave him what he'd been so insistent about. I was patient and didn't get angry at him because it was his special day, and it was nice to see him get what he wanted."
408	18289	7	2	"One day, I had to be patient. I had an asthma attack and was extremely scared. To make matters worse, my inhaler was broken. My mom rushed me to the doctor. The doctor provided a breathing machine, and I felt better. The doctor also gave me a prescription and said, ""Use this whenever you feel like you can't breathe again."" I agreed. My mom and I went to @ORGANIZATION1 to drop off the prescription and said we'd return in an hour. I went home and fell asleep. Then my mom woke me up to go pick it up. When we got to @ORGANIZATION1, they asked us to wait. We sat in the car for another hour, waiting. I was very patient, but my two little sisters were crying because they wanted to go home. My mom was impatient and got mad. Finally, the worker apologized and we paid and left. That day, I showed great patience."
409	18290	7	2	A time when I demonstrated patience was when my family and I went to West Virginia. We woke up early to avoid traffic. When we arrived, we found a nice house. But when we went to a restaurant, we had to wait in a long line. It took @NUM1 for us to get in. After that, we had a lovely dinner. This experience showed that patience can lead to enjoyable moments.
410	18291	7	2	Patience is the ability to understand, tolerate, and endure difficulties without complaint. I'll share a story that many parents can relate to, which requires a great deal of patience. My baby brother, @PERSON1, was born on @DATE1. Since then, my mother has been dreading the potty - training phase, which she knew would come soon. With the high cost of diapers and pull - ups, when @PERSON1 turned @NUM1 years old, the potty - training began. Potty training demands a lot of patience because sometimes the child may not use the potty and have accidents. My mom is aware of this, but she still gets frustrated when @PERSON1 has an accident. At other times, she is patient, understanding that it's all new to him as a young child. She is still learning to be patient, but she knows that soon @PERSON1 will be able to use the toilet independently. Clearly, patience can bring positive outcomes.
411	18292	7	2	Two years ago, my father underwent surgery on his [broken body part] as he had sustained the injury at work. I was compelled to sit in the waiting room for nearly ten hours on an extremely uncomfortable wooden chair with nothing to occupy myself. Every two hours, my mother, grandmother, grandfather, and I would head out to the car to stretch our legs. After approximately four hours, I grew extremely fatigued but managed to stay awake. That was the longest I had ever remained seated in one place throughout my life. Initially, it was hard to believe that nine and a half hours had passed; it felt like only two. This experience taught me the endurance of waiting during a difficult time.
412	18293	7	2	I'm a patient person in many aspects. When I play games or take tests, I can be patient. In fact, I'm almost always patient. There are lots of other patient people too, but some aren't patient at all. Like some of my friends when we play soccer. They're so impatient that they just want to grab the ball and score. One time at the park, we were playing soccer, and a friend kept telling me to pass the ball. He was really impatient that day. It shows that patience can vary from person to person in different situations.
413	18294	7	2	Patience serves as the linchpin for enduring troubles and problems and prevents one from making tragic mistakes. In the face of life's challenges, patience is indispensable. Without it, individuals may rush into situations with unfocused mindsets. When attempting to handle a situation without the requisite level of patience, the likelihood of making a critical error and diminishing the chances of success and goal - attainment increases. In scenarios such as sports games, arguments, and disasters, patience proves invaluable. In sports, patience aids when awaiting playing time, when the team is trailing, or when teammates fail to fulfill their duties. Overall, patience facilitates a team's smooth execution and encourages respectful sharing of opinions, thereby helping to resolve the situation more effectively. During disasters like house - fires or tornado damage, patience allows individuals to assess their losses and think clearly. Having experienced a house fire, I can attest that patience is an excellent way to navigate such situations. In essence, being patient enables one to endure difficulties without complaint. Although you may not think patience applies to you currently, life is not always a bed of roses, and patience will eventually be needed. While waiting patiently does not come naturally to humans, it is a necessity in daily life. We must recognize the importance of patience to lead better lives, and this learning process should also be approached with patience.
414	18295	7	2	One day, we were in line at Cedar Point for the Speed Racer. The wait seemed interminable. I was losing my patience, so my dad suggested I go get a drink and return to the same spot. When I was standing there, someone told security, and they made us go back to the end of the line. We were furious, and my dad was also losing his temper. We waited for hours until it was finally our turn. After such a long wait, the ride lasted only a couple of minutes. We decided then and there that we would never go on that ride again. That was a time when I truly lost my patience.
415	18296	7	2	There was a time when I babysat my little brothers. They wouldn't listen to me or my sister. Instead of getting angry, I took a deep breath, sat on the floor, and started playing with them. After that, everything went smoothly. This experience taught me that patience can turn a difficult situation into a pleasant one when dealing with kids.
416	18297	7	2	"Have you ever felt as if your head is about to explode? Have you ever wanted to say something but refrained because you feared it would worsen the situation? That's precisely how I felt in this story. Little siblings can be so infuriating that I often feel like I'm on the verge of exploding. The story begins at [@TIME1] pm. My brother [@LOCATION2] had just finished work and had been complaining about walking home alone. So, I decided to surprise him by walking home with him. As I passed the high school, I heard my name being called. I looked around, and the voice persisted. I stopped, and my sister [@PERSON2] and my friend [@LOCATION1] emerged from behind me. [@PERSON2] said, ""I didn't want you to go to [@LOCATION2] by yourself."" We continued walking, and [@LOCATION1] and I took turns on the scooter. However, it gradually slowed down because two of us were riding it. We stopped, pressed the power - reset button, and resumed our journey. Then, we called [@LOCATION2] and told him we hadn't seen him, and it was already [@NUM1]. He said he was at his friend's house and that our mom was coming to pick him up. We turned around, and two minutes later, the scooter died. Pressing the power - reset button had no effect. I ran home to get the bike. Sweat poured down my face, and my legs felt numb. As soon as I reached the house, my legs gave out. I got up, put on shorts, grabbed the bike, and rushed out. [@PERSON2] and [@LOCATION1] were already at the party store. [@LOCATION1] asked me, ""Why did it take you so long?"" I explained what had happened while [@PERSON2] pushed the bike and [@LOCATION1] rode on the handlebars. In my mind, I was fuming about how long it had taken me to get there. I was so angry that I felt like I was going to explode because the scooter had died. We put the bike and scooter away, walked in the door, and collapsed. The lesson I learned is that one should not act unless they are certain that the event will occur. I learned this the hard way and will never repeat such a mistake."
417	18298	7	2	When my family went to Makiew, we had to wait to board the boat. We remained patient as boarding the boat required waiting. We waited for at least [@NUM1] minutes. The [@NUM1] - year - old [@CAPS1] didn't act obnoxiously; he simply waited in line. Once we arrived, we cycled around the island. We did what [@CAPS1] wanted to do, and throughout this time, I maintained my patience. In my opinion, the trip went quite well because everyone was patient. This shows that patience can contribute to a pleasant experience during a trip.
418	18300	7	2	I have to exercise a great deal of patience for a while because my sister is going to have her sweet [@NUM1] on [@DATE1]. It's rather challenging for me to be patient in this situation because my mom and sister are making numerous plans simultaneously. It becomes difficult for me to relax while they go out to purchase items for the party. Moreover, we are planning a trip to [@LOCATION1] before her birthday. So, we have a lot of planning to do within a month and a half. My sister also has to be patient as she watches my mom plan the party and still manages to organize the trip to [@LOCATION1] with our family. Throughout my life, I've always struggled with patience, but now I'm really trying. It's a tough task, but I know that being patient is necessary in this situation. In the end, I hope that all the planning pays off and that both the party and the trip are successful.
419	18301	7	2	My story about patience occurred when my sister was at the doctor's. It was a long day. Initially, we entered the doctor's office, and it took an hour for her to be seen. While she was in the examination room, I sat in the waiting room. I observed about [@NUM1] people come in and then leave. To pass the time, I sat and read magazines. Finally, my sister came out, and by then, the day was almost over. It was truly a day that required a great deal of patience. This experience taught me that patience is sometimes needed in situations where we have no control over the waiting time.
420	18302	7	2	"One day, when the [@ORGANIZATION1] [@CAPS1] came out, I really wanted it. I asked my mom, and she said maybe for [@CAPS2]. And guess what? [@CAPS2] was approaching. It was [@DATE1], and I was extremely excited. I went to school every day, looking forward to getting it. I kept telling my mom, ""I'm sure I'll get a [@ORGANIZATION1] just like you said."" I must have said this to her about a hundred times. She then told me, ""You have to be patient. Otherwise, I probably won't get it for you. You have a little brother, and if he hears you constantly saying you want this and that, he'll think [@LOCATION1] isn't real. So, be patient."" For the past few days, I started being patient. I had to be patient for a while because it was only [@DATE2]. Going to school was boring and a waste of time, but I didn't care because I was about to get a [@ORGANIZATION1] [@CAPS3]. I just had to endure it and be patient. I'm really lucky that I haven't been asking for a [@CAPS3] in the past few days. I've been so patient, and I can't believe it. I've never been this patient before, except now when I'm about to get something awesome. Now, I have only [@NUM1] more days until [@CAPS5], and I'm really excited. During the [@CAPS5] break in the last [@NUM1] days until [@CAPS5], I played video games to pass the time while being patient. In the last [@NUM3] days, I played outside, which wasn't a waste of time. On the last two days, I even played outside with my friends on [@CAPS5] eve. Finally, [@CAPS5] arrived. I saw my presents, and my mom said, ""Go ahead and open them."" As I opened all my presents, I didn't see the [@CAPS3]. Then, my mom gave me a present she was holding, and it was the [@CAPS3]. I'm so glad I was patient because now I've finally got it, and I don't have to be patient anymore. This experience has taught me the value of patience."
421	18303	7	2	Some time ago, a young boy named [CAPS2] faced a predicament he preferred to keep private. He felt this issue might overwhelm him. His problem was a dentist appointment. [CAPS2] detested the idea of dentists drilling into teeth and loathed the smell of the dentist's office. With the appointment set for three days later, he was even more frightened as he would be going alone. However, he then decided not to be timid and resolved to be patient. He patiently endured the two - day wait. When the day arrived, he woke up, rode his bike to the dentist's, and waited briefly before being called into the examination room. He closed his eyes and remained patient throughout the check - up. After it was over, he returned home, relieved that his patience had seen him through.
422	18304	7	2	We all know people who are patient, and most of us have been and likely still are patient to some degree. Some individuals learn to be patient by observing elders or role models. Being patient can be challenging. One must maintain a positive attitude even in a bad mood. Patience is beneficial as it enables one to interact well with children of all ages and work effectively with moody people. It also goes hand - in - hand with listening and respect. For instance, when dealing with a child who doesn't listen well, patience is needed to get them to pay attention. Similarly, if someone lacks respect for others, patience is required to help them develop it. In conclusion, patience is an essential aspect of life.
423	18305	7	2	I remember once when I was at Luck in Steak House. The lady told us we had to wait half an hour before being seated. I thought I'd lose my mind, but my mom told me to be patient. With about twenty minutes left, I was on the verge of screaming, but I sat on my chair in silence. I waited with sheer willpower. When there were ten minutes left, I was about to explode with hunger, but I still refrained from doing anything. As the time ticked down to [NUM1] minutes, I started to calm down. Finally, we were able to order. A few minutes later, our food arrived. That was the most patient I've ever been in my life.
424	18306	7	2	"Patience is a difficult virtue. For example, when entering a [CAPS1]'s office, one must patiently await their turn to see the [CAPS1]. In essence, patience is synonymous with ""wait"". However, instead of simply saying ""wait to see the [CAPS1]"", people often say ""Can't you patiently wait to see the [CAPS1]"". Many individuals struggle with patience. They find it hard to wait calmly to see a [CAPS1]. Another instance is during a family road - trip. We often hear [CAPS3] ask, ""Mom, when are we gonna get there?"" This shows a lack of patience. If someone asked me what patience is, I'd say it's about waiting your turn, waiting for the doctor, and waiting for the destination."
425	18307	7	2	A time when I demonstrated patience was during a visit to the doctor. I had a check - up appointment scheduled for [TIME1], but we weren't called in until [NUM1]. I had to wait for a long time. Once we finally got into the doctor's room, the nurse took my blood pressure, and then I had to wait another [NUM2] minutes for the actual doctor. By the time the doctor arrived, it was around [NUM3]. I received both the flu shot and the swine flu shot. When everything was finished, it was [NUM4], and I was eager to go home. This was a clear example of a time when I was patient.
426	18308	7	2	People vary in their levels of patience. Some are extremely patient, while others have none at all. I find myself somewhere in the middle. When I hear the word “patience,” several individuals come to mind. My cousin @CAPS1 isn't very patient, whereas my mother tries her best to be. However, I mostly think about myself. I can be the most patient person at times, but at other moments, I have no patience whatsoever. I make a great effort to be patient, whether it's during @CAPS2 @CAPS3, on my birthday, when going to a special place, or while doing my homework. There's about a @PERCENT1 chance that I'll be patient. I believe the main reason I can't always be patient is that I can get irritated quickly and lose my temper. Even though I'm prone to losing my composure, I can still be patient in certain situations, like when cooking dinner despite being very hungry and the food taking a long time. For some people, patience comes naturally, like singing or dancing, but for others, it's a struggle. Overall, I think everyone should have at least a little patience. Without it, one may struggle in school or with their boss at work. I know it can be difficult to be patient sometimes, and both adults and kids aren't always patient. We should try our best to be patient all the time.
427	18309	7	2	Patience isn't enjoyable, but it's sometimes necessary. Let me tell you about a time when patience wasn't fun. It was a calm day at school, and I was waiting for the bell to ring. My friend @CAPS1 was finally going to answer my question: “Do you love me?” I couldn't stop thinking about it. When the bell finally rang, I was as excited as could be. I rushed out of the door and went to @CAPS1's locker. @CAPS1 gave me a note, and when I read it, it said “possibly maybe I like you.” I was overjoyed. Even though patience wasn't fun in that situation, I got the answer I was waiting for. So, the next time you have to be patient, just remember that good things come to those who wait.
428	18310	7	2	At some point in life, patience is required. For instance, when standing in a line, one must be patient. You also need to be patient when waiting for a chance to participate or when something is on its way and you can't rush to get it, whether you know what it is or not. When you're at the store and see something you want, and your parents say they'll get it for you on your birthday, you have to be patient until then. I've been in such situations myself. I love Christmas because I usually get most of the things I want. Whenever you're about to do something you've been longing for or visiting a place for the first time, patience is key. In all these scenarios, patience is an essential virtue.
429	18311	7	2	This is the story of a boy who became a prince and a girl who desperately needed one. Of course, it's a love story, as most such tales are. My name is @ORGANIZATION1, but everyone calls me @CAPS1. Inside, I feel empty. When I was six, my mom passed away. In the ten years since then, my @CAPS2 has deteriorated. He spends most of his time in her old chair, and sometimes I hear him crying at night. He's become useless, but I'm patient with him. I spend a lot of my time away from home, reading in the park, doing odd jobs for extra money, and running along the town's endless sidewalks. I know I'm not just waiting for @CAPS2; I also long for someone to love me. I keep pushing this thought away, but the truth is, I spend all my time waiting. Eventually, my waiting paid off. One day in the park, a boy named @CAPS3 approached me. He was tall and thin, with short brown hair and bright blue eyes. He said he'd seen me there before and asked why I read in the park instead of at home. That was the first day with @CAPS3, my prince. I was no longer just @CAPS1; I was @CAPS1 and @CAPS3. @CAPS3 saved me from myself and became my other half. However, three weeks after we met, @CAPS3 disappeared and hasn't been seen since. At night, I cry alongside my @CAPS2. Every day, I wait for him in the same park, being patient with him just as I am with my @CAPS2. This is a story of a boy who is a prince and a girl who waits for him. I've learned that there are many ways to say goodbye, like when my mom passed away, hearing my @CAPS2 cry, or that quick kiss with @CAPS3. But I know how to be patient, and I'm still waiting for a hello.
430	18312	7	2	Being patient means being understanding and tolerant, and I've experienced patience firsthand. When I first went fishing, I'd never caught a fish before. I would just sit there quietly, not complaining or saying a word as others around me caught fish one after another. I felt so stupid, but I stayed put and watched as they caught more fish than I did. As I got older, the situation remained the same. Every time someone caught a fish, I felt like I could explode with frustration, but I still managed to be patient. My dad always told me that I'd catch a fish one day, and I believed him. When I was nine, I went to a friend's party at a house by a lake. Everyone except my family brought fishing rods. Since I had nothing to do, I asked a boy if I could borrow his pole while he was eating. He agreed, so I went to the lake and cast my line. Suddenly, I saw a big tail emerge from the water, and then there was a huge tug on the line that almost pulled me into the water. I carefully reeled in the line bit by bit to avoid it breaking. Finally, I held the fish high above my head, beaming with pride. All those years of patience had finally paid off.
431	18314	7	2	"The four sisters queued up for the second most thrilling ride of their time at Cedar Point, right behind some individuals. The roller - coaster roared and the riders' screams echoed as it zoomed by, and then it grew quiet again. ""I'm super, really excited!"" exclaimed the youngest sister. ""Me too,"" the rest said almost simultaneously. All eight of their eyes focused on the same thing: the ride! It had twists, turns, dives, and hills. ""How long has it been?"" asked one person. ""An hour,"" said the oldest sister as she tied her long, dark, curly hair into a ponytail. ""Young one,"" another person said, patting the side of someone's face, ""this wait is really getting to me."" ""Indeed!"" agreed one of the sisters with a displeased look. ""Guys, look! We're almost at the front!"" the second - oldest sister exclaimed. ""Me!"" came a voice from somewhere. Then an announcement said, ""Thank you for being patient, but we're having some issues with the ride and it'll be fixed soon."" ""I really hope they finish it soon!"" said one sister. Everyone agreed. After waiting about half an hour, another announcement came: ""Once again, thank you for your patience. This problem won't be fixed for another [NUM1] hours. Thank you for choosing Cedar Point."" The voice stopped, and the sisters decided to go ride the grand swings."
432	18317	7	2	On the day of the central [LOCATION1] event, after school, I was in a parade with my football team. The parade line moved very slowly. Once it was over, I went home with my best friend [PERSON1]. At his place, we played a bit and then decided to get some food. When we pulled into [ORGANIZATION1]'s, there were about [NUM1] cars, all in the drive - through. We sat in the car for around half an hour. Fortunately, the football game didn't start until [NUM2] and it was only [NUM3] then. So, we patiently waited, ordered our food, and then left for the football game. This was a time when I showed patience.
433	18318	7	2	Patience is a difficult virtue. We always want things right away, not later. When practicing patience, one must stay calm and peaceful. Sometimes, people become so engrossed in waiting that they almost forget what they're waiting for. I'm the same way; I can't stand not having something when I want it. For example, if there's a test scheduled for [DATE1] and it gets rescheduled to [DATE2], I won't be happy. I can't wait that long, and just the thought of the delay causes me tension. Having patience is like having a special gift, similar to the gifts of singing and dancing.
434	18319	7	2	"Where is it?"" the woman asked for the third time. ""Down the hall, to the left of the bathrooms,"" I replied, probably for the fiftieth time. I grimaced as she walked out of the showroom without saying a word. My dad worked for a small company that made gift - shop items like snow globes. After my sixth - grade year, he offered me a summer job to help him at work. Little did I know it would involve traveling to [LOCATION1], standing in a hallway of a large building, and telling people where his showroom was. In the manufacturing and trade industry, you often encounter people who aren't the most well - educated. You really need patience to get through. ""[$CAPS2] dollars an hour, [$CAPS2] dollars an hour,"" I muttered to myself as a middle - aged man approached me. He read my name tag with the blue - and - white company logo of Young's Incorporated. ""Hey, you're with Young's? Do you know where the showroom is?"" I could tell he was wondering why an adolescent was working for a corporation. ""Down the hall, to the left of the bathrooms,"" I said in a robotic voice. ""Aren't you a little young to be doing this kind of work?"" he asked. I thought he might be expecting an intern, but I just calmly replied, ""No, sir."" ""How old are you?"" he asked curiously. ""Sixteen, sir,"" I lied. I knew I could pass for a high - schooler, so I was sure he'd believe me. I was getting really edgy and was starting to imagine grabbing his tie and yanking it. Doing this all day was not healthy. ""Are you getting paid?"" I thought, 'Enough to put up with you?' I took a deep breath and answered, ""Yes, sir, but it's not a lot. It's more like volunteer work."" I hoped he wouldn't ask more questions. He smiled and walked off, saying, ""Thanks, son."" ""You're welcome,"" I said through gritted teeth. I think I showed great patience that day. I really hope he bought a lot of stuff from my dad's shop; otherwise, I'll be very disappointed. This was the time when I was extremely patient."
435	18320	7	2	A patient person can wait for a very long time for an answer, as if they could wait a thousand years. They are also understanding when someone is stuck with a problem. I always think of those who can handle their wife, children, and job all at once while keeping their cool as saints. It's truly amazing. A patient person is always there when you need help. Just being around them can give you a sense of patience. In my opinion, patience means being calm, not losing one's temper, and offering support when you need a little boost of patience.
436	18321	7	2	I always need to exercise patience when assembling model airplanes. On occasion, when dealing with more challenging models, like the components on the @NUM1 bombers, I have to seek my dad's assistance. Patience is also crucial when hunting for rabbits, squirrels, deer, and turkeys. If I'm not patient, I might miss a good shot or an ideal animal. Additionally, I sometimes have to be patient at school with @CAPS2 and other students. In conclusion, patience is a virtue that I need to practice in various aspects of my life.
437	18322	7	2	One day, I really wanted to go to my favorite store. I woke up and told my dad about my desire. He readily agreed, saying “let's go”. However, when we arrived at the store, it was closed. I checked the hours and found that it would open in @NUM1 minutes. My dad and I waited patiently, mostly my dad as he didn't suggest leaving. After @NUM2 minutes passed, we still had @NUM3 more minutes to wait. Finally, when @NUM3 minutes elapsed, the staff asked us to wait another @NUM3 minutes as they needed to set up. My dad, as always, was kind and waited. After those additional @NUM3 minutes, we were able to enter the store. I was extremely happy. Being patient is truly the best thing, as there's no need for complaining.
438	18324	7	2	In the middle of @DATE1, it was a beautiful, sunny day outside. The heat was so intense that it felt like the Sahara Desert. My mom shouted out the window, “Honey, put on your bathing suit and some shorts, and get in the car.” “Where are we going, mom?” I asked. “It's a surprise,” she replied. So, I followed her instructions while wondering about our destination. When we arrived, I immediately recognized the place: @STATE1 @CAPS2. I got out of the car with a big smile on my face. “I'm going to go on @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Do you want to come?” I asked my mom. “Sure, it sounds like fun,” she replied. When we reached the thrilling roller - coaster, I saw that the line extended all the way to the end of the sidewalk. “Oh no, I don't want to wait, mom. The line is too long,” I complained. “Be patient, sweetie. We'll be on the coaster soon,” she replied. One hour later, I whined, “Mom, it's taking forever.” “We're the next ones in line,” she said, still smiling. When the gates opened, I was both excited and nervous. I couldn't believe I'd waited an hour for one ride. “You were very patient,” my mom said with her hair standing up. “Yes, I was, and I'm proud of that,” I thought to myself. Patience can turn a long - awaited experience into a rewarding one.
439	18325	7	2	One of the most trying times when I had to be patient was in downtown @LOCATION1 at one of the most popular @CAPS1 places. My dad, my friend, and I were waiting at our table. We were very hungry. It had been @NUM1 minutes since we placed our order. Despite being angry and hungry, I remained patient, eagerly awaiting my food. Finally, the food arrived, and I was satisfied. In such situations, patience can lead to a fulfilling outcome.
440	18326	7	2	To be honest, I don't have a great deal of patience. I tend to get angry over the smallest things, which I've likely inherited from my dad. Usually, I become impatient when waiting for my mom to get to the car. Whether we're going to dance class or the mall, if we're running late, I start to panic. I hate being late for even small events like birthday parties because everyone is usually already there, and I feel left out. Sometimes, people annoy me and wear out my patience. For example, when someone makes random noises and ignores my request to stop, or when they poke me for no reason, it really irritates me. Another situation that makes me impatient is when my parents lecture me about something I already know when I'm in trouble. Whether it's about not cleaning my room or not taking my dishes to the kitchen, these repeated lectures drive me crazy, and I just want them to stop. However, although I can get very impatient at times, I still have some patience left. As long as people stay on my good side, my patience won't be completely exhausted.
441	18327	7	2	I am crafting a story about a time when I demonstrated patience. On my birthday, @DATE1, I was at my dad's house. My dad asked me where I wanted to go to celebrate. Initially, I was unsure, but then it occurred to me. I told him I wanted to go paintball shooting, and he agreed. However, before we left, he asked if I could cut the grass for him. I said yes and proceeded to do so, which took me about @NUM1 hour and @NUM2 minutes. Once I finished, I informed him, and he acknowledged. Then, I took a shower because I smelled like wet grass. After my shower, I called my friends and cousins to see if they would join us, and they readily agreed. When I asked my dad when we were leaving for paintball shooting, he said it would be on a different day. I then called my friends and cousins back to inform them of the change, and they were understanding. My dad promised we would go before @DATE2, and we eventually did. To this day, I continue to practice patience.
442	18329	7	2	There are numerous instances in a person's life when one demonstrates patience. Patience is a highly significant trait that can yield its own rewards. I am a dancer at @ORGANIZATION1 of Dance. Each dance class has a wide age range. Sometimes, we encounter difficulties learning complex moves like switch leaps or even relatively simple ones like pirouettes. Whenever such situations arise, everyone in the class remains extremely patient. For example, it may take the teacher fifteen minutes to correct a footing position, yet the other dancers patiently wait. Patience is also crucial when training a dog. Since dogs do not understand human language, they face challenges in learning. Yelling at a dog is a sign of impatience and does not aid in the learning process. Conversely, praising the dog or gently correcting its behavior indicates self - control and patience. Eventually, by investing time in teaching the dog the rules, one will end up with a well - behaved dog, all thanks to patience. As evident, patience brings happiness and comfort to others. It is also a sign of respect. Indeed, patience is an important lesson that one should never forget.
443	18330	7	2	@PERSON1 waits patiently when the class is talking. When the class is noisy, she will clap three times until they stop talking or quiet down. Once they are quiet, she resumes teaching. When @PERSON1 is speaking, we should wait patiently until she finishes. This is how @PERSON1 shows patience, and it sets a good example for all of us to follow in similar situations.
444	18331	7	2	I had to be very patient on one occasion at @CAPS1 Barrymores. We got in line to go on go - karts, and there was a rule that riders had to be at least @NUM1 years old or older. I also had to exercise patience on my birthday this year. I knew I would receive cool gifts, but I never expected them to be as amazing as they were. These experiences taught me that patience can lead to pleasant surprises.
445	18332	7	2	"I recall a time when @CAPS3's sister constantly rambled about @CAPS4 cream sundaes. @CAPS3's mom had to drive me around all day because @CAPS3's dad was sick, which meant the ""ice cream girl"" had to come along. @CAPS3's mom knew it would be a long day. We were in the car, and as we drove past an @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS3's little sister suddenly exclaimed, ""I'm hungry. I want @CAPS1!"" She kept shouting this for five minutes straight. That's when @CAPS3's mom snapped, ""If you say another word about @CAPS4 cream, you're not getting it!"" @CAPS3's sister then had a look on her face as if she was about to cry, which made the situation even worse. @CAPS3's mom gave her a cookie to keep her calm for a while. As we started driving home, we heard a song on the radio. @CAPS3's sister loves to insert the word ""@CAPS4 cream"" into every song, so she squirmed while biting her tongue. She remained quiet all afternoon. But when we drove past @ORGANIZATION1 again, she started to cry. She couldn't take it anymore and shouted, ""I want @CAPS4 cream!"" We were teasing her, so we went back to @ORGANIZATION1 and got her the @CAPS4 cream she wanted so badly. @CAPS3's little sister was patient throughout the day, knowing it was tough. That day, she learned an important lesson: being patient means good things will come to you."
446	18333	7	2	One instance when I demonstrated patience was when I went to get my teeth cleaned and then visited the doctor. I waited for three hours to have my teeth cleaned. Since the wait was long, I took out a book to read. After reading about @NUM2 times, I was finally called in for the teeth - cleaning. Following that, I went to the doctor's for a check - up, to refill my medicine, and to get some shoes. I had to wait about two hours before being called into the room. Then I waited for @NUM4 until they had the shots ready. In total, I waited for about five hours and five minutes. After all that waiting, I finally went to @ORGANIZATION1 to have lunch. That was all I did that day.
447	18334	7	2	Loyalty is defined as individuals standing up for and supporting something. In my opinion, everyone should display loyalty because it indicates belief and gives a reason to be dedicated and driven towards a purpose. To me, loyalty means not backing down and showing perseverance. I know a person, my brother @PERSON1, who is consistently loyal and stands up for what he believes in. My brother is always ready to get into an argument with anyone. He is loyal to the idea of “aliens.” He firmly believes in the existence of aliens and doesn't care about others' opinions. I've tried countless times to convince him that there's no physical proof of aliens. But he keeps insisting that “@CAPS1 are proof of aliens.” Moreover, my brother never lies and always has your back. If someone says something untrue, he will defend you. He says, “It's not cool when someone talks about another person; it just shows that person has insecurities.” My brother never lets anyone talk about me without speaking up. Also, he stays true to himself. He once said, “I tried being someone I'm not, but it's not me. I'm a nerd with street smarts.” In conclusion, my brother is a loyal person as he stands up for whatever he believes in, whether it's aliens, someone else, or himself.
448	18335	7	2	This is my story of being patient. I aimed to share a story about a time when I was patient. It happened at the doctor's office when I was waiting for @NUM1 hours to get a brace for my friend's wrist. First, we were in the waiting room and then in an office, and we had to wait for @NUM1 hours. My dad and I were in the waiting room for what was supposed to be a @NUM3 appointment. The staff told us to sit down, and there were @NUM4 other people there. I sat down thinking my mom would come. At first, I was calm as I'm a very patient person. But my dad got worried and fell asleep. As people were called in, the wait seemed endless. After @CAPS1 hour passed, I was getting restless, but I held my ground. Then, I remembered my mom and jumped up, waking my dad. We went to see my mom. After an hour, the doctor came in, gave me the brace, and we got resettled and left. That's the story of my patience at the doctor's office while waiting for a @NUM5 - minute thing.
449	18336	7	2	Being patient is beneficial as it shows respect for the fact that problems take time to solve. In contrast, impatience makes one want to overcome problems immediately. I recall when my brother @PERSON1 was extremely impatient. My brother and I were waiting for a new video game to be released in @NUM1 days. He waited one day, checked the release date, and then waited another day. He wasted @NUM4 days waiting, while I focused on my schoolwork. His grades dropped to a @CAPS2 +, and now he's blaming @CAPS3. I told him that success requires hard work. He then tried harder. Instead of constantly waiting for the game, he focused on his grades. Now, with the game still @NUM6 days away, he's much happier as he's using his time wisely and keeping himself occupied. This shows that patience and wise time - management lead to better outcomes.
450	18337	7	2	This is the story of a time when I was patient. It was a warm day, and I was sitting on the grass with the radio on. When my favorite song ended, I reached to change the station. But then I heard a man announce that Usher tickets were on sale downtown. I told my mom, and we rushed to the car and got there so fast it was like we vanished. When I got to the line, it was incredibly long, seemingly stretching on forever. I waited and waited; it felt like the line only moved an inch at a time. I started to get angry, but I stayed in line. Finally, when my long wait was over, I began to jump for joy. But as I approached the counter, the attendant said, “Sorry, we're all sold out.” I couldn't believe it and started screaming. All that waiting was for nothing; it was so unfair. That was the time I was patient, but it ended up being in vain.
451	18338	7	2	A few years ago, I began horseback riding, which I adore. Approximately @NUM1 month ago, I ordered new riding boots. This was a situation that truly demanded patience. My mother and I visited stake line tack.corn and placed the order for my new boots. When they arrived, they were too small, so we sent them back. Days passed as I awaited my boots, but they did not come. I had to be patient. Another day went by, and my mother finally contacted the company. They informed us that when reshipping an item, it undergoes a fourteen - day processing period. Both my mother and I had to exercise patience. Weeks went by, and still, there were no boots. That week, my mother had obtained a new credit card. Another week passed, and my mother and I were growing impatient. She called the company again, and they said that when they attempted to change the shipping payment to the new credit card, it was declined. Fortunately, the problem has been fixed. I'm glad I was patient enough to wait for the boots, and now I'm riding comfortably in my new riding boots.
452	18339	7	2	One time, I had to be extremely patient when waiting for my mom to pick me up from school at @TIME1. School ended at @NUM1, so I had to wait outside for nearly an hour and a half. It was winter, and the temperature was about @NUM2 degrees Fahrenheit. The wind was howling, so I used my instrument case to shield my face from the wind and snow. However, it didn't help much. I couldn't feel my face, and when I glanced at a clock inside the school, I realized I had only been there @NUM3 minutes! The wind and snow were brutal. I was so bored that I started counting the number of teachers and people leaving the school. My face was as red as a cherry. I began reading to pass the time, but my fingers started to get cold. I daydreamed about all the warm things in the world, first hot chocolate, then @DATE1, and then Florida on a hot day in @DATE1. I tried to be as patient as I could, but it was incredibly difficult. I was freezing, so I rummaged through my pack and found some gloves to wear with my coat and jeans. I kept reading with the gloves on so my fingers wouldn't freeze. Then, I saw a red car that looked like my mom's, but it passed by, and a wave of disappointment washed over me. I thought I couldn't take it anymore! But just as I stood up, a car pulled in, and it was my mom. I gathered my stuff and got in the car, turning the heater on high. My mom thanked me for being patient.
453	18340	7	2	Patience is a virtue, and I'd like to share a story to illustrate its importance. There was a little girl who was quite spoiled and used to getting what she wanted. But there was a hidden side to her - she had patience. Everyone was always curious about her because there was something special about her. One day, she and her family were going out. She was excited but showed patience. She also wanted to go to the store, @LOCATION1. Unlike other children who would constantly pester their parents, she just sat patiently. When they left, they went to @CAPS1, and since they were wealthy, they also visited @CAPS2's. She was eager to leave but managed to be patient while in the store to get the specific things she wanted. Once inside the store, she finally got what she desired: lip gloss, five pairs of jeans, and matching shirts. She was almost ready to go when her mom and dad started looking around. But she remained patient. When they got home, she was exhausted and went up to her room to sleep. This story shows that we need to be patient and wait. Accidents and problems often occur when we're impatient. This little girl got everything she wanted because she had patience.
454	18341	7	2	I was at the Detroit airport. It was around @NUM1 am. The sky was bright yet gloomy, with no rain, just a warm breeze caressing my face. My mom, brother, and I walked through the tall metal doors and saw a variety of things, from gift shops to our destination where we would @NUM2. We got our tickets and headed towards the plane. We passed through metal detectors, which only detected my leather striped pink and brown belt. I took it off and continued walking. When we entered the plane, we passed many people I didn't know. I got the window seat, and my mom, brother, and I sat in the caramel - colored blue chairs, filled with a mix of excitement and fear as we awaited our flight to the sunshine state.
455	18342	7	2	Patience is an extremely valuable quality in life. Once, I had to be very patient because my little cousin, who lives in @LOCATION1, has had a disorder since birth. It takes her longer to understand things because she lives in her own little world, which isn't reality. I decided to teach her how to ride a bike with training wheels. She tried, but she still struggles today, although she has improved significantly. However, she still has brain problems. I'm helping her progress from a difficult situation to a better one, then to a good one, and hopefully to a great one. Her improvement over the years has required a great deal of patience because of her disorder. You can't yell at her because she is very emotional and sensitive. You have to be gentle, kind, and patient. Although she will always have this problem, if you're patient, she will @CAPS1, and that's why patience is so crucial in dealing with her.
456	18343	7	2	"Yesterday, I visited the orthodontist for a check - up. The wait took a bit, but then it was my turn. When I got home, I was extremely hungry. I waited for dinner to be ready. Even though it was just an hour until it would be served, that hour felt like an eternity. The delicious smell wafting from the kitchen only made my hunger more intense. But I sat patiently and read my book until dinner was done. After that, I was watching ""Ghost Hunters"" when my little brothers came in and started cleaning up the mess they'd made with their toys. I had to pause the show because they can't focus when the TV is on. So, I waited an excruciating 15 minutes until they finished. Overall, I believe I showed great patience yesterday."
457	18344	7	2	Two days before my doctor's appointment, my mom told me I'd need three shots. I've never liked shots as they hurt and make me feel sleepy. Usually, I'm not very patient, but this time was different. With one more day to go, I started to understand why people should be patient, and it seemed doable. On the day of the appointment, I was scared. As soon as I walked into the clinic, I felt sick and tired. Mom went to sign me in, and I felt even worse as I worried about the number of shots. When the doctor called me, I was terrified. Mom always says it doesn't hurt if you don't look. In the doctor's office, he had me step on the scale, gave me a hearing and an eye test. I asked if I'd need shots, and he said not yet but maybe later. After the hearing test, I was done, and my fear had been for nothing. When I got home, I learned two lessons: not to worry about things and how to be patient. This was the time I was patient about going to the doctor.
458	18345	7	2	On [DATE1], my mom, my [CAPS2], and I went to a [ORGANIZATION1] concert. Mom wasn't very excited, and my [CAPS2] was only excited to see [PERSON1]. I was really looking forward to the event. When we entered the parking lot of the [ORGANIZATION2] music [CAPS5], there was a huge line at the door that stretched across half the parking lot. We had to wait an hour to get in. Once inside and in our seats, it started to rain, and since it was an outdoor concert, I got soaked by the time the opening act finished. Then people began setting up the stage for [ORGANIZATION1]. We waited another hour and a half for them to finish. My [CAPS2] and mom were getting irritated, but I stayed positive and kept waiting. On the bright side, it was an amazing concert, and I'm glad I had the experience. However, next time, I'll wear a hat.
459	18346	7	2	"One time I was patient was when my brother, sister, and I were told we were going to [LOCATION1], which was a big deal for us. My siblings and I were arguing about something silly in the kitchen when our parents suddenly called us out. ""Great,"" I thought, assuming we were in trouble. As I was thinking about the punishment, mom interrupted and said we were going on vacation. ""Punishment?"" I asked. ""What?"" she replied. ""Vacation,"" I told her. We were going to [LOCATION3] and [LOCATION2], but we had to wait a whole week. Every day, my little brother would ask, ""When are we going on our trip?"" and mom would give the same answer: ""In one week, in four days, in three days, in two days."" Finally, it was the day of the vacation, and my parents were proud of me for being patient during that week of waiting. This was a time when I showed great patience."
460	18347	7	2	A time when I demonstrated patience was when I was at my dad's office. We were there for an hour, and I had to be patient until we left. It wasn't easy. I had to remain silent for the entire hour until my dad gave me the okay to speak. Despite the difficulty, I managed to stay quiet and patient throughout that hour, showing that I could control my impulses and wait.
461	18348	7	2	A few days ago, I demonstrated patience. I was at @ORGANIZATION1 store with my mother, standing in line to return a non - working box. This was our third attempt to return these boxes. I spent half an hour in the line, surrounded by angry customers. Still, it wasn't our turn. A man at the counter was extremely impatient; he slammed the door and mumbled as he left. Finally, it was our turn. My mom remained patient with the worker, even though she was reluctant. The worker, unable to identify the issue with the box, gave her a new one, and we left. As the quote “good things come to those who wait” suggests, patience can bring positive outcomes. So, always remember to be patient.
462	18349	7	2	The Thompson volleyball players, also known as @CAPS1 @CAPS2, lost their tournament. On @DATE1, we went to a @CAPS3 restaurant. @PERSON1 asked for chopsticks, and the @CAPS1 made us wait for @NUM1 minutes. Then, a volleyball player asked, and the staff gave chopsticks to everyone except the adults. We had a great time. I asked for napkins but didn't get any. I was quite annoyed with the waiter, but overall, I and the others had a lot of fun. Despite the service issues, the experience was enjoyable.
463	18350	7	2	Patience is an essential skill in life. After breaking my arm and getting a new, cumbersome cast, I was restricted from my usual activities. I was an active child involved in soccer, basketball, cross - country, and football. Due to my broken arm, I had to be patient with my sports. This patience paid off; my arm healed faster without any further complications. Once the cast was removed, I could resume playing sports. Patience is rewarding if you are willing to wait.
464	18352	7	2	I was eagerly waiting for my grandpa to come home. He had gone to an Amish sale to find a chicken coop for my chickens. In the morning, I was helping my grandma with canning. I was so excited for his return. I went outside to do some work to pass the time. First, I cleaned the barn. Then, I took care of the cattle: feeding, walking, and watering them. After that, I cleaned the chicken coop, collected the eggs, and fed and watered the chickens. I also had some fun by practicing volleyball, softball hitting and pitching, shooting hoops, and riding the gator for a bit. I went in for @CAPS2. When I came back out, I wondered what to do next. Then I saw the @CAPS3 and decided to do some thrashing. I loaded the truck and went to the field. After that, I worked on the ground. When I got back, I was thinking about what to do when I heard my grandpa returning. We then got in the truck and went to town.
465	18353	7	2	My dad can display remarkable patience, especially when he is not angry. His patience is a valuable trait that often helps in various situations. Whether it's dealing with a difficult task or a challenging person, his calm demeanor can make a difference. Even in those rare moments when he could lose his temper, he manages to stay composed. It's a quality that I admire and hope to learn from.
466	18354	7	2	I once played a football game with my friends. The opposing team was overwhelming us, but I remained calm despite the losing situation. Eventually, we managed to turn the tables and defeat them, @NUM1. This experience taught me the value of patience in facing challenges.
467	18355	7	2	Patience is a challenging yet valuable trait as it can facilitate personal progress, such as in the process of job - seeking. When applying for a job, one may need to be patient when the boss takes their time to assess the applicant. Impatience, like yelling at the boss to hurry up, can lead to rejection. In conclusion, patience is a beneficial skill that can contribute to personal advancement in life.
468	18356	7	2	Lucie told @CAPS1 to be patient, saying she'd be done soon. @CAPS1 asked how soon, and Lucie replied it'd be about an hour as she was filing papers and then would take @CAPS1 to the park. @CAPS1 thought an hour was a long time. Lucie told @CAPS1 to watch TV or she wouldn't take him to the park. So, @CAPS1 played video - games with his little sister @PERSON1, made pizza. Then, a friend from school, Ryan, came and invited @CAPS1 and his sister to the park with him and his mom. @CAPS1 asked Lucie, and she agreed as long as he was back by five o'clock. They had a great time at the park, and Ryan's mom bought them ice - cream. Through this experience, @CAPS1 learned that patience is extremely important.
469	18357	7	2	About a year ago, my family and I visited @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. We were amazed by the numerous rides and the large number of people there. First, we chose to go on the smaller rides like the “@CAPS2 trap” and “@CAPS3 star”, as well as many water rides. At the end of the day, we lined up for the biggest ride, the “@CAPS4 timbers”. The wooden track made the ride quite scary. There were probably @NUM1 people in line. I told my mom I didn't want to wait long, and she reminded me to be patient. I agreed. The ride was really fun. After getting off, I told my mom that being patient had paid off.
470	18358	7	2	I was extremely excited when I finally got my bow. I was eager for it because my older sister @PERSON1 got a bow before me, and I thought it was unfair. I had to wait a whole @NUM1 year until @CAPS1 time to receive it. My parents hid it in my bedroom closet, and I didn't notice it before. This was a time when I had to practice patience. Now, I go outside to shoot it almost every day. Thank you for listening and reading.
471	18361	7	2	"Let me make one thing clear: I'm not a patient person. While I can be patient on occasion, for the most part, I'm not. If there's something exciting coming up, like my birthday, I can't stop talking or thinking about it. By ""not being patient,"" I simply mean I can't wait. However, there are times, like when we're going to a boring family gathering, that I can be patient."
472	18362	7	2	"One bright [DATE1] at [TIME1], my sister and I woke up. [CAPS5] was at my sister's door. The light shone through the curtains and covers. [CAPS5] pushed the door open a bit and said, ""[CAPS2]"". I got up moaning, ""[CAPS4] me up. I'm sleeping."" [CAPS5] helped me up and hugged me. Then I went into the living room. [CAPS5] was in the kitchen and got what I thought was a paper hen, but it was aluminium. Dazed, I turned on the TV and didn't notice my sister's mom on the couch. She called, ""[CAPS6], go put the clothes in the dryer."" I replied, ""[CAPS7]. K."" I also said, ""[CAPS8] want to come downstairs too."" He exclaimed, ""[CAPS9]"". I thought, ""[CAPS10]"" in my head. We walked downstairs to the laundry room. After putting the clothes in the dryer, I took a deep breath and said, ""Do you smell that?"" [CAPS5] looked frightened and said, ""[CAPS9] I'm cooking something."" My eyes widened and I ran upstairs. I opened the door and [CAPS14] pushed me outside. We said, ""[CAPS10] air!"" We went back in and crawled through the kitchen. We paused to stare at the fire, then ran towards [CAPS17] still sleeping on the couch. We shook her but she didn't wake up, so I said, ""Cover your ears. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!"" [CAPS17] yelled, ""[CAPS16] wrong with y'all!"" I screamed, ""The [CAPS1], fire, [CAPS18] [CAPS19]!"" [CAPS5] stood up, we ran, and [CAPS5] grabbed a cup of water and poured it on the [CAPS1]. I said, ""I need to teach you how to cook better so you won't set anything on fire!"
473	18363	7	2	"There are [NUM1] different languages in the world, and including various dialects, there are more than [NUM2] different languages. In every language, ""patient"" means understanding and tolerant. Everyone has to be patient at some point. Let me tell you about a time when I was patient. It was about a week ago when I had a fight with my best friend. Later that day, I realized we were both in the wrong. I sent her emails, text messages, and called her cell and home phones at least [NUM3] times, but she didn't answer or reply. The more she ignored me, the more frustrated I got. Then I talked to my cousin. My cousin told me calmly, ""You have to be patient with her. This is your first fight."" So, I waited by the phone, left her alone at school. Finally, one day she talked to me. She said, ""I'm sorry too. Thanks for being patient with me. I've missed hanging out with you. How about we sit together at band?"" I replied, ""I'd like that."" We finally made up after five days of fighting. From this experience, I learned that being patient pays off. So wait your turn to speak, understand why people say what they say, and know that patience is key."
474	18364	7	2	I showed patience when I was supposed to clean my house. My mom said she'd like me to do it before she got back. So I straightened up, vacuumed, made my bed, cleaned the bathroom, took the dogs outside, cleaned their bowls, did the dishes, took out the trash, and did the laundry. In between tasks, I'd watch [CAPS1] play a game or be on the computer. I waited the whole day. When my mom got home, she said she forgot what she'd promised. Instead, we decided to get pizza.
475	18365	7	2	A time when I demonstrated patience was at the doctor's office. I was waiting for my doctor to come out. He took an extremely long time, and it was very difficult for me to stay calm. But I managed to be patient. Finally, the doctor came out, and I immediately started to feel better. This experience taught me the value of patience in such situations.
476	18366	7	2	One day, I went to @ORGANIZATION2 with my friend @PERSON1. We ran to the queue for the @ORGANIZATION1. We waited for about half an hour before we got on the ride. Fortunately, both @PERSON1 and I were patient. After the ride, we queued up for the @CAPS1. The line was incredibly long. We waited in that line for at least an hour and a half before boarding. Once again, our patience served us well.
477	18367	7	2	One day, my dad needed his keys, and I had them. The keys were somewhere in my room, so I searched everywhere. After twenty minutes, I still couldn't find them, but my dad remained patient. I ransacked my room looking for the keys. They weren't in the dresser, closet, bed, or on the floor. I had just used them to unlock the car, and now they were gone. When I went to tell my dad, who had been patiently waiting for an hour, I found the keys in my pocket. It was a relief to finally locate them and end the search.
478	18368	7	2	Once upon a time, there were two kids. One was named @CAPS1, who was extremely impatient. The other was named @PERSON1, who was very patient. They went for a walk in the woods and got lost. @CAPS1 kept complaining non - stop. @PERSON1 told him to stop, but @CAPS1 didn't listen until he saw a haunted house. @CAPS1 asked @PERSON1 to go inside with him. @PERSON1 didn't want to, but @CAPS1 went in and pretended to get hurt. @PERSON1 ran in after him, and the door slammed shut, and the doorknob fell off. They were scared in the darkness. Then the light came on. @CAPS1 said they should leave, but @PERSON1 pointed out the missing doorknob. They ran through the house but found no other doors or windows. They were terrified when a ghost approached them. It turned out to be their dad, who had built the house for them. He told them all they had to do was push the door open. Then they all went home, ending their adventure.
479	18369	7	2	Patience is nearly impossible for me. I can hardly wait @NUM1 hours for something. Yet, I sometimes manage to be patient, like when waiting for a @CAPS1 party. This particular story is different. It was a warm day, even though @DATE1 was almost over. I was solely focused on my @CAPS1. Like most kids, I had waited @NUM2 days to get a big pile of presents. When I woke up that morning, I knew it would be a while before the party started. I played some video games, went outside, and just sat around until @NUM3. I couldn't believe it was only twelve; it felt like hours had passed. I needed to find something else to do, so I went to my friend's. We played some tough football games. When I got home, I rushed to the clock and saw it was @NUM1:27. I don't know how time had passed so slowly. I still had a whole hour until the party. That last hour felt like an eternity, but I endured it. My friends and I don't think of me as a patient person, and I'm certain I'll never be that patient again.
480	18370	7	2	When I was being patient, I was working on my math @CAPS1. I couldn't figure it out. On @DATE1, my aunt didn't help me at all. At that point, I almost quit. But this time, I was patient and persevered. Eventually, I managed to solve it, proving that patience can lead to success in difficult tasks.
481	18371	7	2	One day, while at a food store, I ordered some food. The staff took quite a long time to prepare it. Despite the long wait, I remained patient. Other people were also waiting there, yet my food still hadn't arrived. I went outside to tell my granddad that the food was about to be ready because he kept asking why it was taking so long. I then went back inside and asked the staff why the delay. They assured me it would be ready in a second. I sat down and saw my friends - @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @PERSON1 - enter the store. We started chatting and patiently waited for our food. My name is @CAPS3. I was born on @DATE1 and raised in the city of @LOCATION1. Eventually, they called my name and said my food was ready. I got my food, told my friends I was going home, and then left. This is a story about a time when I was patient.
482	18373	7	2	One day, while browsing a catalog in a store, I spotted a goalkeeper shirt that I was really keen on. I showed it to my mom. She thought it was a bit expensive but agreed to buy it for me. The following week seemed to drag on as I waited for the shirt. On @DATE1, it finally arrived. It was a combination of pale yellow, red, blue, and purple. At last, I had a goalkeeper jersey to wear during games and make excellent saves.
483	18374	7	2	A time when I demonstrated patience was when I was waiting for my dad to return from work. I had received a package before he left on a three - day out - of - state trip, and I wanted to open it with him. When he finally came back, I was able to open the package. This experience showed that I could be patient when necessary.
484	18375	7	2	On my @NUM1 birthday, I had to be patient. I was eagerly waiting for a phone. My mom kept telling me that I would get it on the first of @DATE1. I was skeptical at first. However, when it came to opening the last present, it was a brand - new cell phone along with a case. This was a perfect example of patience paying off.
485	18376	7	2	"Are they here yet?"" I asked as I paced back and forth. @CAPS1 replied, ""Patience, it takes time to get from the locker all the way down here."" @PERSON1 shouted, ""@CAPS2! @CAPS6 on the camera! @CAPS3 got him!"" Then, @PERSON1 added, ""@CAPS4 is right behind us."" @CAPS7 yelled, ""@CAPS5 funny guys! You guys better give me back my clothes or I swear I'll @CAPS6 off the camera!"" as @CAPS4 tried to grab his clothes but missed. I said, ""@CAPS8! My patience has run out, @CAPS7!"" while taking another picture. I continued, ""@CAPS10 I think @CAPS3 should put this up on the internet."" @CAPS7 retorted, ""@CAPS11! You can't @CAPS5 put this on the internet!"" I asked, ""So you're going to stop picking on us?"" @CAPS4 said, ""@CAPS8!"" I said, ""@CAPS13, then I'll just zoom in right here."" @CAPS4 screamed as his towel fell off. In the end, showing a bit of respect, @CAPS3 gave @CAPS4 his clothes, turned around, and walked away."
486	18377	7	2	I twisted through the air and landed face - up, with my arm wrapped around me. I felt a throbbing pain as I wobbled to my feet. “What just happened?” I thought to myself. Once again, I began to feel the tremendous pain shooting through my forearm. I bit my lip as hard as I could to choke back the tears that threatened to pour out like a waterfall. My friends rushed towards me, asking if I was okay. As soon as I started holding my arm, I replied, “I think I might have broken it.” They rushed to get aid as quickly as possible. Soon, I found myself in the sick room after calling my parents to alert them of what had happened. I sat there for hours, waiting for my parents to come pick me up to go get an X - ray at the children's hospital. They were both at work and couldn't come right away. As the day dragged on, I became more and more anxious. Finally, the bell rang; it was [time] at last. “Bang!” The door swung open. It was my dad, and not far behind him was my mom. That's when they got out of work. After my mom and dad told me how glad they were it was just a broken arm, they immediately rushed me to [location]. That was my experience of having to be patient. In the end, it turned out I had a broken arm. In life, there will be many situations where you have to be patient. All you can do is take life as it comes at you.
487	18378	7	2	Jenny and [PERSON3] were twin brother and sister. Every year, a carnival was set up next to their house, featuring games, rides, and food. One day, Jenny and [PERSON1] politely asked their mother, [PERSON2], for some money to go on the Ferris wheel. “Mom, can we each have a dollar to go on the Ferris wheel?” “Sure,” said Mom and handed them two dollars. Jenny and [PERSON1] were so excited that they ran to the line for the Ferris wheel. They waited for an hour, and finally, it was their turn. During this time, the man in charge of the Ferris wheel had watched them wait in line. As they were about to step into the cart, two mean boys pushed them to the ground and took their seats. Their mother had taught them to be nice to everyone, and they remembered that, so they got back up and let the boys go. When it was their turn again, the man in charge of the Ferris wheel noticed what had happened. He told them that he was proud of them and that they could go around the Ferris wheel three more times for their patience. After the ride, they thanked the man and ran happily home to tell their mom what had happened. Their mom was so proud of them and hugged them. This shows that being patient and kind is always rewarded.
488	18379	7	2	When I'm hunting, I have to be patient. You see, when you use a bow, its range is limited. You need the deer to come into a nice clearing, not be hidden behind brush. I firmly believe that patience is a must in hunting. When a deer approaches, you get your bow ready. Your mind starts to think it will come closer, but then it moves as slowly as possible. You just have to go with it. All that patience finally pays off when you're ready to shoot and you make a successful hit. It's a great feeling when your patience in waiting for the right moment is rewarded in the end.
489	18380	7	2	A time I was patient was when I was in [NUM1] grade. After my birthday, I really wanted pink [ORGANIZATION1] shoes. My dad, who was in [LOCATION1], said he would get them. But he had to buy them, send them to my grandma's house, and then have my grandma send them to me. He said I'd get them sometime after my birthday. One day, he called and told me he'd sent them, and I should receive them in a week. So, I patiently waited. But after a week, the shoes weren't at my house. I didn't want to bother my dad by calling him every day, so I just kept waiting patiently. After [NUM2] more weeks, I started to worry and get angry. I called my dad and asked about the shoes. To my surprise, he said my grandma was bringing them in an hour. I waited for an hour, but the shoes still hadn't come. At that point, I decided to just wait and let them come whenever they would. Finally, I got the shoes the next day, and I was overjoyed. I thanked my dad and wore the shoes the next day, knowing that my patience had paid off. This experience taught me that patience can lead to good things.
490	18381	7	2	I'm sometimes patient and sometimes impatient. However, no matter how impatient I get, my [CAPS5] is even more impatient when it comes to waiting in a big traffic jam. He huffs at the long delay, sighs, and gets extremely impatient. He says things like “Come on!” It's really scary to be with [CAPS5] in traffic jams or long lines. But once the long wait is over, [CAPS5] is back to normal, which is a huge relief for me. It just goes to show that different people handle waiting in different ways, and it's important to be understanding of others' impatience.
491	18383	7	2	One instance when I demonstrated patience was during a fight with my little brother at @LOCATION1. He kicked me in the chin. Even though the second kick split my chin open and I fell to the ground in full view of others, and people crowded around us like bees around a honey - filled hive, I kept my promise not to tell on him. This was a true test of my patience.
492	18384	7	2	One time, my big brother told me we were going to Micigman Adventure. I waited for him to come home. Then, my dad told me to get ready. I packed my shorts and did what I needed to do. After that, I just sat there for a while. I called my brother, but the details of what he said are unclear. Eventually, despite the uncertainties, this was the start of our planned adventure.
493	18386	7	2	"@CAPS12, the @CAPS1 of the ninth - inning winning @CAPS2 @CAPS3, with the count full at @CAPS4, bases loaded and two outs. As the pitcher throws a @NUM1 fastball right down the middle, @CAPS2 swings and hits his first grand slam. The crowd erupts. As we're about to leave, the announcer says, ""Don't forget, kits today only. Down on the field, the @CAPS8 are signing autographs."" I pleaded with my dad to let us stay, and @CAPS9 @CAPS14 agreed. When I got down there, there was a huge line. Time seemed to drag; minutes felt like hours. I could see kids getting antsy. I remembered my dad saying, ""The only way we can stay is if you're patient."" @CAPS12 took forever. Looking around, kids were going crazy; the little ones were crying. I might have been one of the last five people being patient, and even my dad was getting frustrated. It took at least two and a @CAPS13 hours to reach the front, but it felt like @NUM2 days. Finally, I got the whole team's autograph and was overjoyed. I surprised myself with my patience. On the way home, my dad stopped at @CAPS15 and got me a frosty. @CAPS9 said that being patient wasn't so bad. From then on, I'll be more patient."
494	18387	7	2	One day, my mom, my sister, and I went to the hair salon to get our hair done. There were many people talking, and it was quite noisy. The TV and the radio were on, and a bunch of people were chatting. When we arrived, my mother signed all three of us in on the sign - in sheet, and then we had to wait. We waited for a long time. I really wanted to leave and come back another day, but my mom said we had to wait. I got hungry and sleepy. We waited for an hour. I didn't let it bother me, so I turned on my @NUM1 player and listened until it was our turn. Then we had to wait another hour, and I got even hungrier but didn't say anything. After waiting and waiting, we were finally up next. We all got our hair done. When we left, we went to get some food because we were all hungry. This was a time when I was patient at the hair salon.
495	18388	7	2	"Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jack. Jack had a little brother named @PERSON1. @PERSON1 was @NUM1 years old, and Jack was @NUM2. Since Jack was much older than @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 was his brother, Jack had to watch him often. Jack was quite patient as he watched his brother every night because their parents worked late. However, Jack still found his brother annoying. Their parents knew that if they paid Jack, he'd keep watching @PERSON1, so he did. One day, @PERSON1 wouldn't stop complaining because he didn't get his way. Jack finally got mad and said, ""If you don't stop @CAPS3, I won't watch you anymore, and you'll have to go to daycare."" Since @PERSON1 hated daycare, he stopped immediately. Jack was very angry at his brother because @PERSON1 had never acted like this before. Jack wanted to apologize, and he did. @PERSON1 forgave him. Jack said, ""I'm sorry I got mad."" @PERSON1 replied, ""@CAPS3's okay."" Jack then said, ""@CAPS4 try not to let @CAPS3 happen again."" The next day, after school, Jack and his little brother hung out, and everything went well. @PERSON1 told Jack, ""I'm happy we're not mad at each other because I don't want to go to daycare."" Jack said, ""Yeah, and I don't want you to go because then I'd have nothing to do."" Their relationship was back on track."
496	18389	7	2	There was a time when I went to @ORGANIZATION1. We were driving there, but there was a long traffic jam, so we had to wait on a bridge for @NUM1. It was a night that felt like a dream. We got hungry, and we really didn't have much to enjoy. We waited for about @NUM2 before we finally got in. Then we were deciding which roller - coaster to go on. We chose the @CAPS1. When we looked at the line, it was a @NUM3 - hour wait. We got in line. @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and my brother @PERSON1 were complaining a lot. It was like a nightmare. My dad and I were okay with the line for the @CAPS2. Actually, the wait wasn't as long as I thought. After the wait, we got on the roller - coaster. We were both laughing and scared at the same time. When the ride was over, I was sad, but the three - hour wait was worth it. Later that day, we rode the @CAPS3, the first ever built standing coaster. I was scared again, and the wait was @NUM4 hours long. @PERSON1 and my brother @CAPS4 were suffering from the wait. But the wait only felt like an hour. I was scared of that coaster, but I loved it. Riding roller - coasters was a lot of fun. After a while, we left. It was a long day. The end.
497	18390	7	2	I'm recalling the time when the video game @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was about to be released for @CAPS3 @NUM1. This game was supposed to be the last one for the company. I already had it and it came. The game is pretty good, but I don't understand why the mom character stays on a planet called @CAPS2 and is the only one there. Then the entire group of characters gets attacked by about @NUM2 aliens with swords, and they chop your character into tiny pieces with their little plastic swords. The first time I went to buy it at @CAPS5 @CAPS6 at @NUM3, the parking lot was full of probably all @NUM4 - year - olds who live in their moms' basements. So we waited and got it about @NUM5 weeks after its release. We bought it, but it wasn't the exciting game we expected. It was some weak @PERSON1 game, and we finished it in about two minutes. So, patience doesn't always pay off.
498	18391	7	2	When I was in fifth grade, I was struggling in math. My @CAPS1 agreed to help me study for an upcoming test. On @DATE1, I woke up really early, but my mom was running late getting home from work. Since she was the one driving me to the study session, it was a problem. My @CAPS1 was very understanding and patient. When my mom finally got home and drove me there, we were an hour and a half late. But my @CAPS1 was still patient. When we started to study, I was completely lost. I didn't understand anything she was saying, but she kept trying and was very understanding. I got almost every question she asked me wrong, but she did her best to help me understand. She spent about @NUM1 hours helping me. Thanks to her help and patience, I actually got an A on that quiz. I know it must have been difficult for her to work with me for so long without losing her patience. I really respect her for that and am very grateful to have someone like her in my life.
499	18392	7	2	"On @DATE1, @NUM1, @NUM2, I was being patient. I was taking my meap test when my stomach started to hurt. For about @NUM3 minutes, I sat there fidgeting. Then I raised my hand to ask to call my mom. When the teacher (@CAPS3) called on me, I asked, and the teacher said, ""@CAPS1.S @PERSON1, can you take [name] to the office?"" And @PERSON1 said okay. Then @PERSON1 and I went to the office. I called my house phone, and my sister picked up. I said, ""@CAPS2, let me speak to mama."" The teacher (@CAPS3) said, ""Hold up."" Then my mom said, ""It's okay."" I told her, ""Mama, can you please come pick me up? My stomach hurts really bad."" My mom said, ""Okay"" and hung up. I waited about @NUM3 minutes, sitting patiently, tossing and turning because of the pain. Then I called again and asked, ""Mama, are you coming?"" My mom said, ""@CAPS4, I'm on my way."" I said, ""Okay"" and hung up. I sat there, being patient and in pain until finally my mom walked through the school doors and signed me out. The teacher (@CAPS3) said, ""Come on."" My sister and I were sitting in the truck waiting to go to the family health center. I sat in the front seat and slept the whole way home. When we got there, I went in the house, lay on the couch, and fell asleep."
500	18393	7	2	My mom is a very patient person. When I was little, I got gum stuck in my hair. I was crying and moving around a lot, but my mom patiently tried to get the gum out. She kept telling me to sit still, but she never got angry at me, even though she might have wanted to just stop and make me do it myself. When she couldn't get the gum out and said she'd have to cut it out, I screamed. But with great patience, she managed to cut the gum out and still keep my hair looking nice, even though I wouldn't sit still. I truly believe that my mom is the most patient person I know. Whenever something happens, she always remains patient. Her patience is one of the most admirable qualities I've ever seen in a person.
501	18394	7	2	One instance when I demonstrated patience was during a visit to the dentist to have a cavity filled. Upon arrival, we were informed that my appointment was still some time away, yet my mother preferred to wait. I was rather annoyed as I sat there with the TV on. When it was finally my turn, it took the dentist, who was also an acquaintance, nearly another hour to get prepared. Through this experience, I learned the importance of being patient when others take an inordinate amount of time with seemingly little progress. This encounter taught me that patience is a virtue that can help us navigate such frustrating situations.
502	18395	7	2	"Beep! Beep! Beep! My alarm clock went off at [NUM1], and I realized I had missed the bus. I quickly sprang out of bed and got dressed, hoping my brother and sister were downstairs waiting for me. But to my dismay, they weren't there. I rushed back upstairs like a madman, burst into my brother's room, and shouted, ""[CAPS1]! [CAPS1]! I've already missed the bus!"" Then I went straight to my sister's room and yelled the same thing. She promptly got out of bed and got dressed. As I walked downstairs, thinking everything would be okay, I prepared breakfast. My sister then came running down, grabbed her food, and shouted, ""[CAPS1]!"" It was [NUM2] am, only [NUM3] more minutes. So I started gobbling my breakfast, but my brother still hadn't come down. After finishing my breakfast, I went back upstairs to wake my [CAPS7] and my brother. They followed me downstairs. My brother took his sweet time eating breakfast, and I knew we were going to be late. I looked at the clock; it was [NUM4], only [NUM5] minutes left. ""We aren't going to make it,"" I said. Finally, everyone piled into the van, and [CAPS7] drove us to school. My sister and I were yelling, ""[CAPS1]! Floor it!"" But [CAPS7] ignored us, and my brother didn't seem to care if we were late. Eventually, we made it to school only [NUM6] minutes late. I guess my brother is the only patient one in the house."
503	18396	7	2	"There was a boy named [PERSON2] who was extremely patient. He always waited for others without a single complaint. One morning, [PERSON2] woke up along with his five brothers and sisters. They all had to get ready for school within an hour. All the bathrooms were occupied, but [PERSON2] didn't grumble. Instead, he used the time to clean his room and make his bed. As a result, [PERSON2] was a bit late for school. The teacher, [PERSON1], called him over, and the class jeered, ""Ooooo! Ha! Ha! [PERSON2] is in trouble."" [PERSON2] hung his head and walked slowly as if carrying a heavy burden. At lunchtime, [PERSON2] was at the end of the line. By the time he reached the front, there was no more food left. The kind - hearted lunch lady noticed his distress and gave him a special lunch. When [PERSON2] got home, his family threw a party to honor his patience. He was both honored and happy. That night was truly the best for [PERSON2], a well - deserved reward for his unwavering patience."
504	18398	7	2	"My dad always tells me that patience is one of the key factors in achieving success in life. As I've grown older, I've come to realize just how true this is. I recall a time when I had to exercise patience for an extended period. My family, along with my friend, took a trip to Cedar Point. My friend and I were fixated on the park's biggest ride, the Millennium [ORGANIZATION1]. I thought, ""That ride will give me the most thrilling, heart - stopping, and adrenaline - pumping experience ever."" However, it would be a while before I could ride it. We walked and walked, and I started to feel exhausted. After [NUM1] hours of walking, we finally reached the Millennium [ORGANIZATION1]. I was disappointed to learn that there was a [NUM1]:30 - hour wait. The sun was shining brightly. I decided the best approach was to stay quiet and relax because I knew that complaining would only make the time seem longer. And before we knew it, we were about to board the ride. This experience reinforced the idea that patience can lead to great rewards."
505	18399	7	2	"An hour and thirty minutes? Are you kidding me!"" I exclaimed as my dad and I joined the line for the ""Maverick"" ride at [CAPS2] Point. ""That's what the sign says, but it could take even longer,"" my dad replied. I said dejectedly, ""I guess we can wait,"" but in my mind, I knew I had very little patience. Just as I finished these thoughts, the line inched forward a bit. ""That was fast,"" I thought. In the time between the line's movements, I distracted myself by watching people on the [CAPS3] and other rides. When the line moved again, watching people didn't work to keep me occupied. So I started daydreaming about how much fun the Maverick would be and which other rides I wanted to go on next. These thoughts lasted until about halfway through the line. My patience was wearing thin. I started thinking about school, whether I wanted to go back, what I'd miss, and what I was looking forward to. We were almost at the front, but with each passing second, my patience was dwindling. I began tapping my fingers on my leg. I just kept tapping and moving forward. Finally, we reached the front, and I hadn't complained once! I took my seat, and the ride started. At the end, I thought it was truly worth the wait. Now, I was ready to go on more rides without complaining. This was a significant moment when I managed to be patient."
506	18401	7	2	One time, while traveling to @LOCATION1 for a baseball tournament, I had to exercise patience. The journey, which involved a @NUM1 - hour drive through @LOCATION2, was quite challenging. I sat in the back - seat of the car, suffering from an earache. This discomfort forced me to endure the long drive. Adding to my distress, my little brother @PERSON1 kept grabbing my feet and hitting me with his stuffed animal. Despite my repeated requests for him to stop, he persisted. Eventually, I took the stuffed animal, which led to him yelling at me to give it back, and I did. Once we reached @LOCATION2, we had to wait @NUM3 minutes in line to re - enter @LOCATION3. At the front of the line, a man questioned my mom and then asked my two brothers and me about the people in the front seat. He was making sure we weren't being kidnapped. All these events made that @NUM1 - hour drive to @ORGANIZATION1 town a test of my patience.
507	18402	7	2	Many people practice patience as they don't want to anger others or disrupt ongoing activities. They are always cautious about their actions. I, too, am sometimes patient, and I find it relatively easy. Everyone surely understands this. There are numerous situations where one can be patient, and it's difficult to choose just one to write about. For instance, if someone is in the bathroom, one should wait patiently. But if it's taking too long and you can't hold it, you can knock on the door or use another bathroom. Similarly, when someone is using the computer, wait for your turn. However, if an hour has passed, it's reasonable to politely ask that person to step aside as you also need your turn. It's not that hard to be patient for at least @NUM1 or @NUM2 minutes. It's quite straightforward, and everyone is aware of this fact.
508	18403	7	2	I'm going to share a time when I had to be patient. It was when I went to Fuzzys, an @ORGANIZATION1. The wait was excruciatingly long, lasting @NUM1 minutes. It felt like an eternity, probably because I hadn't eaten anything. My mom, dad, and I were there. They also sold ice cream there. My stomach was aching with hunger. I really struggled to keep my cool. Some people are naturally patient, while others aren't. I'm usually somewhat patient, but this time, I was on the verge of losing it. Now, when I go to an @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, the wait doesn't seem as long. This was a significant instance where I needed to exercise patience.
509	18404	7	2	At the start of the seventh - grade year, during the fourth hour of the school day, I demonstrated patience. The principal made an announcement stating that the sixth - graders had taken too long at lunch, causing a delay. While the rest of the class complained, I sat calmly and patiently. It wasn't enjoyable to sit there, bored and hungry, but I managed to keep my composure. Eventually, our grade was called down for lunch. This was a time when I showed patience in a school - related situation.
510	18405	7	2	My mom showed remarkable patience when she was in line to get her driver's license. It took a total of three hours to obtain it. She was angry, but she held her temper. To make matters worse, the lady issuing the licenses took a break. When she returned, my mom waited another three hours, and she still remained patient. I was with her, and I also tried to be patient. However, I really wanted to yell at the lady for taking a break and making us wait an extra hour. Another time, my mom waited in line under the scorching sun. The heat was intense, reaching eighty - one degrees. For about two hours, the only thing she did to cool down was drink. Even then, she remained patient. My mom's ability to stay calm in these trying situations is truly admirable.
511	18406	7	2	On @DATE1, I woke up, brushed my teeth, got dressed, and had breakfast. Then, my mom, my brother, and I drove to the doctor's, which was an hour away from our house. I was unhappy because I was tired and dreading the long wait for the doctor to say what I needed to hear. Instead, I had to sit there, staring at the walls.  When we arrived, my mom signed me in. I thought looking at magazines would pass the time, but they were incredibly boring, especially since there were no magazines about people. I complained, and my mom told me to wait, assuring me they'd call my name any second. However, it had already been about @NUM1 minutes.  Lunchtime came, but we still had to wait. I was starving. Finally, the doctor called my name, but it was time to wait again!  In conclusion, that was a time when I was impatient. Waiting at the doctor's, just sitting there, made me realize that I'm not interested in anything that involves waiting.
512	18407	7	2	Once upon a time, there were two boys named @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. @ORGANIZATION1 was impatient and always wanted things his way. @PERSON1, on the other hand, was patient, always waiting his turn and sharing.  One day, while watching TV, they saw a rocket - building kit and asked their dad if they could get it. Their dad called to order it and was told it would take @CAPS2 weeks to arrive. When @ORGANIZATION1 learned it was @CAPS2 weeks away, he got upset. Meanwhile, @PERSON1 calmly said @CAPS3.  As the weeks passed, @ORGANIZATION1 would constantly pester their dad because he couldn't wait. @PERSON1 took it in stride, as if it were just another day. @ORGANIZATION1 would sit by the window, watching and waiting with a fixed gaze.  Eventually, the day of delivery arrived. @ORGANIZATION1 ran out and grabbed his rocket. At the same time, @PERSON1 walked out the door. When they both had their rockets, they opened them. @ORGANIZATION1 was disappointed because he wanted to play right away but first had to build it. @PERSON1 carefully followed the step - by - step instructions and soon had his rocket built. @ORGANIZATION1, in his haste, crammed the pieces together, and his rocket came out crooked and broken. He yelled loudly.  @PERSON1 went to @ORGANIZATION1 and offered to help. In @NUM1 minutes, they finished the rocket. Together, they played and had a great time. This story shows that patience is a virtue that can lead to better results.
513	18408	7	2	On an early @DATE1 in @PERSON1, the leaves were just starting to change colors and flutter down. My mother, sister, her friend, and I piled into the car and drove a few minutes to @ORGANIZATION1, which was practically in our backyard. I brought my camera and was determined to get a good shot of @CAPS2. My mother and the others were very patient with me as I took my time on the hike.  The problem with @PERSON1 is that there aren't many trail maps, so it's easy to get confused or lost. After hiking a long way, we came to a fork in the road where there was a map. My mother checked her cell phone and told us we had forty - five minutes until we had to take our new kitten to the vet. I suggested we start heading back to make it home in time to pick up the kitten and reach the vet on schedule, considering the long drive.  However, instead of taking my advice, my mother led us in the completely opposite direction. My sister and her friend dragged their feet and complained. For the next mile or so, we walked without finding another map. My sister and I became increasingly frustrated with my mother and with being lost.  Because we got lost in the dull expanse of fields and trees, my mother had to use her dying cell phone to call my father to take the kitten to the vet. I was really looking forward to taking the kitten myself, which added to my stress.  Finally, after another half - hour of walking, we reached the exit. I was so relieved that I almost kissed the car. @CAPS2 turned out fine, and despite our complaining and moaning, my mother remained patient with us throughout. This experience taught me that in difficult situations, patience can make a big difference.
514	18409	7	2	One instance when I was patient was during a science class test. I needed the teacher's help, and there was a kid in front of me who also needed assistance. It took the teacher a while to deal with the other student, but I just stood there and waited. It took around @NUM1 minutes because the kid had a lot of questions.   This was a clear demonstration of my patience. In challenging situations like this, being patient is important as it allows others to get the help they need and maintains a positive learning environment. It shows that I can control my impatience and wait for my turn, which is a valuable trait.
515	18411	7	2	I have several friends who sometimes ask me for help with schoolwork or homework. Some of them take a long time to explain their problems, and I have to be patient to assist them. To be honest, not everyone has a lot of patience, and they can get frustrated easily, and I'm no exception at times.  There have been occasions when I've spent an hour on the phone trying to explain homework to a friend. Soon, I'll need to be patient again when I start tutoring for @CAPS1.  In my opinion, patience is one of the most crucial characteristics a person can possess. It allows us to help others effectively, build better relationships, and handle difficult situations calmly. Whether it's helping friends with schoolwork or tutoring in the future, patience will always be an essential part of the process.
516	18412	7	2	I'm not a particularly patient person, but I can be when necessary. At home, we have only one bathroom. I dislike waiting to use it, yet I have to because I don't want to have an accident. So, I wait. I also have to wait for the bus. Waiting is so boring, but patience is a valuable trait. Without it, there would be numerous car - accident deaths, murders, and nervous breakdowns. My sister is extremely patient. She can wait in one place for hours. One time, as we waited for the bell to ring so we could go trick - or - treating, I was fidgety from the wait. She calmly did her hair while I complained. This is why patience is important.
517	18413	7	2	Have you ever been to the doctor? On @DATE1, my brother, sister, and I had a doctor's appointment, and we missed school. When we arrived, the place was crowded with people. So, we sat down and waited. We waited for three and a half hours. I started to get impatient and hungry, and I told my mom. Everyone agreed with me. So, my mom went to the food court to get us pizza and water. After we finished our pizza, we waited for another three hours. I got angry because we'd been there for several hours. Finally, the nurse called my mom, “Kimberly.” We stood up, and then she called @PERSON1. I got so impatient that I yelled out, “@CAPS1, it's our turn! We've been waiting here for a long time. I can't wait @CAPS1 more.” My mom finally calmed me down, and I apologized for my rude behavior. As soon as I sat down to wait again, it was our turn. This shows why patience is very important.
518	18414	7	2	Patience is one of the most crucial aspects of life. Patience means being understanding and tolerant. For instance, a child's mother left for work. She was away for @NUM1 hours and then came home. The child said, “That was quick.” This is a perfect example of what patience is. In life, there are many situations where patience is required, and this simple story highlights its significance.
519	18415	7	2	I'm not a very patient person. If someone picks on me or my friends, I'll get angry. I can't tolerate my friends being bullied by strangers. One time at school, my friends and I were walking down the hallway. A kid suddenly appeared and started pushing one of my friends around. I asked him what his problem was, and he said it wasn't my business. But he was picking on my friend! He then stopped bothering my friend and tried to pick on me. What he didn't know was that my brother and another friend were around the corner of the building. I sent the friend next to me to get them. When the bully saw them coming, he ran away. This shows that in situations where friends are in trouble, my lack of patience makes me stand up for them.
520	18416	7	2	One time, I showed patience when my mom's car needed a new battery, and I had to go to school. My mom called her friend who lived down the street to come and give us a boost. We waited for an hour and a half. Then, my mom called her back, and she said she couldn't make it because she needed an oil change. After that, we walked to the bus stop for thirty minutes. The bus picked us up and took us to @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. Then we walked another @NUM1 mile to @PERSON1, where there was another bus. This bus took us to @NUM2 mile and @PERSON1, which is where my school is. This experience demonstrated my ability to be patient in difficult circumstances.
521	18417	7	2	Patience involves waiting calmly for something, someone, or an event. When I was a child, I went to the doctor's. My mom didn't tell me I was going to get a shot; I thought I'd just go in and come out with a sucker. I asked my mom when I could have the sucker, and she told me to be patient and wait a little while. I entered the room, got the shot, and received my sucker. I was angry with my mom because she knew I hate needles. However, this experience taught me that patience is necessary even when the outcome isn't as expected.
522	18418	7	2	In a lab at @LOCATION1, a beaker bubbled, and the smell of sulfur wafted through the air. I exclaimed across the room, “@CAPS1, what's going on!” @CAPS3 responded with a little celebratory dance, saying, “@CAPS2 found the cure for cancer!” As a doctor, I was skeptical but mentioned I had a patient with extreme brain cancer. @CAPS3 shouted, “@CAPS4, let's go try it out!” I rushed to the car and waited while @CAPS3 packed up his lab equipment. After @NUM1 minutes, I wondered where @CAPS3 was, assuming he was having trouble packing. I turned on the radio and fell asleep. After a couple of hours, I woke up shocked to find I'd slept for @NUM2 ½ hours. I rushed inside to see @CAPS3 holding a ball of fur wrapped in his lab coat. He said, out of breath, “I saved this kitten's life with my cancer cure.” I was glad I'd been patient, or the kitten wouldn't have survived. Just then, my pager went off; @PERSON1, the lady with extreme brain cancer, needed our help. @CAPS3 grabbed a vial of his cancer solution, and we rushed to the hospital. There, @PERSON1 looked as translucent as paper in the light. I quickly stabilized her heart rate. At that moment, I wasn't sure if she'd live. @CAPS3 asked, “@CAPS6, give it to her?” I made a risky decision, saying, “@CAPS7, not yet.” I waited five minutes and then administered the solution. @PERSON1 came back to life. Even though she couldn't speak, her smile showed her gratitude for my patience. Her daughter entered the room and said, “@CAPS8 you.” I simply smiled in return, realizing that patience had played a crucial role in saving both the kitten and potentially @PERSON1.
523	18419	7	2	I'm patient when visiting the dentist, orthodontist, or doctor. At the dentist's, I wait to get my teeth cleaned. Usually, I sit and read magazines. At the orthodontist, I first wait in one room, then listen to my iPod. After a while, I'm called into another room to wait more for my braces to be adjusted. Once in the office, I wait for the technician to tighten them. At the doctor's, I sit in the large waiting room for a long time until the nurse calls me in. If I'm getting shots, I have to patiently wait for the doctor to bring them. Clearly, many situations require patience.
524	18421	7	2	One day, I had to go to the doctor's office to get shots. When we arrived, I sat in uncomfortable chairs with my dad. It was my first time getting shots, and I had no idea how it would feel. Being young, it was hard for me to be patient; I just wanted it over. I kept asking my dad if the doctor was coming, and he always told me to be patient. Eventually, he got frustrated and told me to play with the toys in the corner, which I hadn't noticed before. When I saw the shiny toys in the sunlight, I ran over to them. But after a few minutes, I got bored and went back to sit down. I was so bored that I could barely stand it. I wanted to scream and leave, but I didn't want my dad to know I was impatient. I was on the verge of yelling when the doctor finally came out and called my name, “@CAPS1.” I was relieved that the wait was over. However, I didn't know that I'd experience horrible pain for a few days after the shots. This experience taught me that patience is often difficult but necessary in many situations.
525	18422	7	2	Patience means waiting for something. For instance, instead of pacing around worriedly because your new shoes will arrive in two weeks, you can be calm like a wise person. Hunting is another example; you sit and wait for a deer to appear. If you're impatient, you might go searching for one. Sometimes, people become impatient and mean. Being patient involves understanding why something takes a long time. You have to accept it if it doesn't come on the @DATE1 it's supposed to. One time, I had a @CAPS1 appointment at @TIME1, and my mom and I waited until five o'clock. We weren't angry, just a bit bored. Another time, a friend of mine waited for his dad, who didn't come home until the @DATE1. These experiences show that patience is an important virtue in dealing with the uncertainties of life.
526	18423	7	2	I play hockey and I'm a goalie. A good goalie must always be patient. On my previous hockey team, the other goalie and I faced numerous one - on - one shots. Most of these one - on - one shots were not crucial, but a few were, and they were the toughest to stop. Our team had an undefeated record, though we'd had several close games. In one game, the score was [NUM1] to [NUM6], and our team was leading. As the game neared its end, the opposing team had a one - on - one situation against me. The shooter skated in from the side and cut across the middle of the ice. It was very tempting to dive, but I remained on my feet. I waited until the shooter had nowhere to go and then he shot, and I stopped it. That was one of the only important shots of the game, and I managed to block it. This shows that patience as a goalie can lead to crucial saves.
527	18424	7	2	My friend urged, “[CAPS1] on, hurry up.” I replied, “I know, be patient.” Patience implies being understanding and tolerant. A patient person endures situations without complaining. One day, our basketball team had an away game at another school. My teammates and I all went to the bathroom. I was the last to enter a stall. Everyone else left, and only one girl stayed. Patience is always a positive trait. You may have heard the saying “Patience is a virtue.” If you don't learn to be patient, you'll miss out on the ability to handle various situations calmly.
528	18426	7	2	There was an instance when someone I know demonstrated patience. My [relationship] stood in line for over an hour to get tickets for a show we were going to watch. This act shows patience because my [relationship] did not complain at all while waiting in the long line. Patience in such situations allows people to achieve their goals without getting frustrated, and in this case, it led to getting the tickets for the show.
529	18427	7	2	One time, my best friend and I went to an amusement park. It was extremely hot outside. The first ride we wanted to go on was called the [CAPS1]. The queue was incredibly long. It felt like navigating through a maze because of how the ropes were arranged. We stood in the line for about forty - five minutes, but it seemed like two hours. I didn't complain much, but my friend kept whining about the heat and how tired her large feet were. Finally, when we got on the roller - coaster, it was an absolute blast. I truly believe that the wait was worth it as the experience on the ride was so much fun.
530	18428	7	2	I showed patience when I wanted a [item] for my birthday. However, my mom had to pay the rent, so I couldn't get it right away. I waited, and when my birthday arrived, I still didn't have it. But after [NUM1] months, during [CAPS1], I finally got it and was overjoyed. Another time I was patient was when I babysat my cousin for [NUM2]. I waited a few weeks for my uncle to pay me, but he didn't. I continued to wait, and eventually, he not only gave me [NUM2] but also a late fee of [NUM4]. I was very happy. The money from my uncle, combined with what my mom gave me, totaled [NUM5]. I went skating and to the store with my friends and spent some of it on [DATE1]. Also, [NUM6] days before my birthday, I was leaving a sleepover. I went to buy everything I needed, and the next day was my [NUM7] birthday. I had a great time; it was like a little piece of heaven at my house. These experiences show that patience often leads to positive outcomes.
531	18429	7	2	Patience is a virtue I sorely lack, and I seem to have inherited this trait from my mother. While she might be a tad more impatient than I am, we're both quite bad in this regard. Sometimes, to avoid waiting through commercials, we record TV shows and watch them later. Other things I loathe waiting for include standing in lines, people being late, and just idly waiting around. I can only stay patient for about five minutes; anything longer than that pushes me over the edge. Additionally, long car rides with nothing to do are torture. I wish we could turn a one - hour drive into a one - minute drive while still reaching the same destination. I truly desire to have more patience, but I'm at a loss as to how to acquire it. I sincerely hope you have enough patience to read through my story.
532	18430	7	2	"One time, I had to exercise great patience. It was during a trip to [LOCATION1] to visit my family. The journey should have taken two or three days, but due to numerous stops, it ended up taking four days. My dad insisted on visiting every store and restaurant along the way. Although I thought these stops were unnecessary, my dad felt otherwise, which made me a bit annoyed. The trip felt like an interminable two weeks. During the journey, my uncle [PERSON1] called us every five minutes, bombarding us with questions like ""How close are you?"", ""When will you get here?"", ""Are you lost?"", and ""Did you get me some cocoa - oats?"" It was quite comical as my uncle is extremely fond of cocoa - oats. I like them too, but not to the same extent. When we finally arrived, my legs ached terribly from sitting in the back of my dad's car. I walked around for two hours to regain feeling in my legs. This experience truly tested my patience."
533	18432	7	2	"The time I demonstrated patience was when I went catfish fishing with my step - dad. I had a hard time waiting, so I resorted to talking to myself or singing songs. My step - dad told me to set my fishing pole on a slingshot holder and do as I pleased. So, I went for a walk, exploring the area and thinking about how to be patient. When I checked my pole, there was no catch. I sat there waiting and waiting. Then, suddenly, my pole started jerking around. I quickly reeled it in and caught a large catfish. I was overjoyed. My step - dad then said, ""See, you do have patience."" This incident showed me that I could be patient when I put my mind to it."
534	18433	7	2	The time I needed to be patient was at the grocery store, specifically [CAPS1] store. When we first arrived, I was excited because I thought we'd get lots of junk food. As we started filling the cart with food that looked delicious, I was tempted to eat it all right away. When the cart was half - full, we kept adding more items. Eventually, it was so full that we had to get another cart. By the time we reached the meat section, I was starving. My mom told me to just wait while she got a few more things. I waited and waited until she told me to go to the checkout. All the lines were incredibly long. I was on the verge of losing it when a little girl walked up to me and started acting smart. I almost snapped at her, but I managed to calm myself down. Then, I realized it was our turn, and I was extremely happy. When I got home, mom cooked bacon, and I was so exhausted that I just wanted to go to bed. This experience taught me the importance of patience in a mundane situation.
535	18434	7	2	"As I waited at the airport, I watched people walking by and pondered in my head, ""When will [CAPS2] be here?"" I wondered how long I'd been waiting and what time it was. His flight was supposed to have arrived [NUM1] minutes ago. Suddenly, I heard my mother's soft voice saying, ""[CAPS2] will be here soon, honey, don't worry."" I couldn't understand why my mother was telling a [NUM2] - year - old not to worry; impatience seemed to be in our nature. I was on the verge of losing my patience, but then I asked myself, ""What good does complaining do? It only makes you upset."" As these thoughts ran through my mind, I regained my composure. An hour later, my mom shook my shoulder to wake me up. When I opened my eyes, I saw my dad standing in front of me. I ran to him and gave him a hug. I told him, ""I almost lost my patience."" I'm glad I stayed patient because being impatient would have ruined my father's trip. Patience is indeed a valuable quality, as it can help us gain positive experiences rather than lose them. In this case, my patience was rewarded."
536	18435	7	2	One time, I went to the store with my mom. I was extremely excited to go to the toys section. But mom said we had to go to the grocery area first. I got really mad, but mom told me to be patient, saying the quicker we finished the groceries, the faster we'd get to the toys. After we finished with the groceries, we had to go to the clothes section. I was furious as I hate trying on clothes. However, then I got excited again because we were finally going to the toys section. Mom said I could pick out a toy. It was really hard to choose. I didn't know what to pick until I saw a cool green truck with big tires and flames on it. I pleaded with mom, and she said I could get it. I was overjoyed. That was a time when I was patient.
537	18436	7	2	I was patient while getting my @NUM1 system. It took an incredibly long time. It took me ten months, and on my birthday, we had to visit all the GameStop stores in Taylor to find it. I spent hours in the car. At the first GameStop we checked, they had one in good condition. I also got three games for it. That was the time I showed patience.
538	18438	7	2	"Once upon a time, in a military - related area, there was a girl named @PERSON1. One day, @PERSON1 and her mom planned to watch a movie called @CAPS1 from @LOCATION1. But when they reached the theater, the tickets were sold out, so they had to look for another movie. It seemed to be a bad day. When they got to the ticket counter and remembered something, they left and went to eat. They went to a place called @ORGANIZATION1 and placed an order. They ate their food there. After finishing, they went back to try for the movie again. But this time, the line was extremely long. @PERSON1's mom told her to be patient and wait. Eventually, they got the last available ticket. After that, her mom asked, ""So, honey, were we patient?"" When they got home, they sat on the couch, got a snack, and waited for @PERSON1's sister and dad. Finally, they came home with a big surprise. @PERSON1's dad was holding tickets to the same movie @PERSON1 and her mom had just seen. Her father said, ""We were trying to find you all day."" Her sister said, ""We couldn't find you."" @PERSON1 and her mom looked at each other and explained that they had been patient, waited in line, and got the last ticket. @PERSON1 also exclaimed that they had won fifty dollars. It was quite an eventful day."
539	18441	7	2	"I'm going to share my thoughts on what patience is. In my opinion, patience is all about waiting. For instance, when a clown says, ""You were very patient in line for cotton candy,"" it perfectly captures the essence of patience. I know this is a short story, and I apologize for that. But it clearly shows my view of patience."
540	18442	7	2	"I remember one day when I wasn't feeling well, I went to the doctor's office with my mom. We sat in the waiting room and talked for about ten minutes. Then my mom said, ""@CAPS1 it's already been ten minutes."" I said, ""I wonder when I'll get to talk to my doctor."" Mom replied, ""I don't know, but let's wait a bit longer."" As we sat patiently, more kids started coming in. Some were young and some were older. I sighed and wondered what was taking so long. I even questioned if my doctor was there that day. I stared at the orange wall. Before I knew it, half an hour had passed. Mom looked at her watch and said, ""@CAPS1 it's almost @NUM1!"" I was flustered and annoyed and said, ""@CAPS2! Are we just gonna sit here all day?"" Finally, a nurse told me I could go back to a room and talk to my doctor about my illness. The nurse smiled and said, ""@CAPS3 for being patient!"" I smiled back. I had indeed been patient."
541	18444	7	2	One day, my mother informed me that I could purchase a new toy at the store. However, she had several errands to run before we could go. First, she had to return to her workplace as she had forgotten something. After that, she needed to stop at the gas station. Finally, we made our way to the store, and I was able to acquire the toy I had been looking forward to.
542	18445	7	2	Patience manifests in various forms throughout life and offers multiple benefits. Firstly, it often leads to greater rewards at the end. When one exercises patience, the eventual outcome tends to be more substantial and fulfilling. Secondly, patience allows individuals to engage in other activities during the waiting process. For instance, while waiting for a particular event or result, one can productively utilize the time. Thirdly, although being patient can be challenging, it is manageable when one remains calm. Some people struggle with waiting and rush through tasks, but with a calm demeanor, patience can be controlled. Lastly, once an individual has successfully practiced patience, it becomes easier to do so in subsequent situations. Overall, these aspects illustrate the nature and importance of patience in one's life.
543	18446	7	2	"I try to be patient and behave nicely without complaining. I enjoy being patient and acting well. Sometimes, it's hard to calm others down. When things take a long time, I might say ""come on"" occasionally. I'm usually patient at school, restaurants, and everywhere else. But sometimes, I can't stay patient, and I don't want people to think I'm weird for waiting. I'm patient when standing in lines at the store or the fair, where the lines can be long. My goal is to be patient in every situation, but it's not always easy when things take too long. Still, I generally strive to be patient."
544	18448	7	2	"For the writing prompt, I decided to write about a time when I was patient. It was the day I skipped school to go fishing with my dad and my uncle @PERSON1. I didn't get to sleep in much, waking up around the same time as I do for school. I had to leave the house before my brother saw me since he wasn't coming with us. We got in the car and drove to my uncle @PERSON1's house. Once there, my dad started loading everything onto the boat. Then we hopped into my uncle @PERSON1's old, rusty red truck with chipping paint. As we drove, my uncle @PERSON1 had to keep an eye on the very small boat, which was only about a foot and a half wide and @NUM1 foot long and barely fit all of us. It was a bit scary when we put the boat in the water and started moving. We traveled through a beautiful river to the back of the @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1. When we arrived, I was hesitant at first as I thought we'd be standing, but we ended up sitting while fishing. We fished for a solid @NUM2 hours. I was extremely patient waiting for my bobber to go down. My uncle @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS1,"" meaning the bobber was going under like a submarine. We had @NUM2 rods out - @NUM4 pike rods and @NUM1 bluegill rod. I caught the biggest bluegill of the day! It was one of the best days of my life, and I had to be patient for those @NUM2 hours straight."
545	18449	7	2	One day, I was at the store with my friends. I picked out a slurpee and got in line to buy it. An old lady joined the line, and out of kindness, I let her go in front of me. After a while, she realized she was a dollar short. I gave her the dollar, and she thanked me and gave me a mint. After I bought my slurpee, my friends and I needed to cross the road. We waited for @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes, which felt like an hour. Once we crossed, we walked towards my house. On the way, my friend needed to use the restroom, so we went to the market. We waited for about an hour before he came out, saying he got lost. Eventually, we walked home. That day, I learned that it's difficult to be patient.
546	18450	7	2	"Two summers ago, I volunteered at the kids' camp at my church. For a week, I was in charge of the preschoolers, which demanded a great deal of patience. The preschoolers were extremely excited and rowdy. They were constantly running around and shouting. I had to maintain a calm voice and be patient with them; otherwise, the situation would have worsened. Later that week, I was assigned to take care of a young boy with special needs. He simply couldn't sit still! I had to repeatedly remind him not to be so loud. He was very determined to get what he wanted, and it was difficult to stay calm. Despite the challenges, I managed to remain patient and composed. Eventually, the little boy decided I was okay and started to behave. Now, every time he sees me in the hallway, he excitedly says, ""Hi!"" I'm glad I stayed patient as it has led to this positive interaction."
547	18451	7	2	One day, I went to my cousins' house to celebrate my cousin's birthday. He was turning [NUM1] years old. We played games on the trampoline. Then we went inside to relax and watch TV. After a while, we played with their dog. Later, many people came over. We went outside again to play. Then we had to get cleaned up for dinner. We ate turkey, baked potatoes, cheesy potatoes, squash, and beans. The food was quite good. After that, they wanted us to do a project. It was a jar with a candle in it. We had to cover it with tissue paper, which required a lot of glue. I had to wait patiently as I was the last one to finish. Finally, I got to do my project. I was the only one sitting at the table doing it. In the end, it actually turned out pretty well. Patience can take you far in life. You need to be patient at work, in a restaurant, and in many other situations. So, always remember to be patient and things will work out.
548	18453	7	2	I'm going to tell a story about a time when I was patient. When I was eleven, on [DATE1], my mother was due to have her baby. I was extremely excited and couldn't wait. We went to the doctor's office and moved into her room. I was there with [CAPS1], my mom's best friend, and we accompanied her. When we entered the room, my mother was having contractions. She was yelling, screaming, and squeezing my dad's hand. I got scared when she was yelling and didn't want her to get hurt. So, I walked out of the room, and [CAPS1] and I went to buy the baby, [PERSON1], her first dress. After the baby came home, she was always crying. That's when I learned to be patient when holding babies. Patience is a valuable skill, especially when dealing with new - borns, and this experience taught me its importance.
549	18454	7	2	Patience is crucial when interacting with others, and I learned this lesson during a visit to the dentist's office. On [DATE1], I had a dentist appointment as it had been six months since my last one. While waiting to be called in, a boy came in with a severe toothache. The dentists decided to treat him first, and I understood their decision as the boy was clearly in a lot of pain. Shortly after the boy went for treatment, an older woman came in with a mysterious pain in her mouth. It turned out to be a root canal, and they decided to examine and treat her before me. I also understood this decision. After the woman went for treatment, a little girl walked in, bragging about her first loose tooth. Her mom wanted the girl's tooth pulled. When the dentist called her back before me, I got really frustrated. The girl was in no pain; in fact, she was happy about her loose tooth. I didn't think it was fair that I had to wait another [NUM1] minutes for her to get her tooth pulled. My appointment got pushed back over two hours, and I had to show a great deal of patience. Then I thought about how I felt when I lost my first tooth, and I no longer minded her going in front of me. Overall, patience is an important trait that people should display daily. That day, I learned that patience should always be a must.
550	18455	7	2	One time, my friend was patient while waiting for the teacher. She was waiting as the teacher was talking to someone else. After the teacher finished the conversation, my friend was able to get her questions answered. This was a clear example of my friend showing patience. Patience is an important quality, and this incident with my friend shows how it can lead to getting what you need. We should all strive to be as patient as my friend in similar situations.
551	18456	7	2	Patience encompasses multiple aspects. Firstly, there are various ways to demonstrate patience. Secondly, individuals either possess patience or they do not. I confess that I am among those lacking patience. My mother often tells me to “hold your horses.” I am well - aware of my impatience, so I wonder why she has to remind me. I have no patience when grocery shopping; I am eager to leave. Lines seem to be everywhere, and they take an eternity, which I assume is a common annoyance. Additionally, it is a kind gesture to let someone in a hurry or an emergency situation go ahead. And when a little girl needs to cut in line, one's kindness often compels them to allow it. Thus, patience can be a challenge for some, while others have no issue with it. It truly depends on the individual. Patience is closely related to complaining, but not in the way one might think. Patient people do not complain; they remain calm and adapt to their surroundings. Especially in difficult situations, it is beneficial to be with patient rather than impatient individuals. In conclusion, patience is a complex trait that affects how people deal with and respond to various circumstances.
552	18458	7	2	I vividly remember the time I got my new puppy. We had to exercise patience because he was not fully potty - trained and was extremely energetic. My dog is a [breed name] (a breed known for herding cows). Whenever we went outside, he would bite our shoes. I never understood why he tried to “move” us, but he did. Training him required a great deal of patience. It took until he was one and a half years old for him to realize that this behavior was inappropriate. However, he is still developing new hobbies. We must stay calm and patient to effectively train him. It takes a long time for a dog to outgrow certain behaviors and adopt new ones, so patience is key. This experience taught me the importance of patience in dealing with a growing pet.
553	18459	7	2	One morning, my mom woke me up early and told me to get ready quickly. When I asked what was going on, she said we were going to Potter Park Zoo. I'm not sure what prompted this sudden idea. I got dressed, and we set off. I wasn't feeling well that morning. We stopped for Subway breakfast, but I couldn't eat my sandwich because my stomach hurt badly. It felt like hours before we finally arrived. By then, I was feeling better. We paid for entry, got a map, and started exploring the amazing animals. I saw three giant wolves, snakes, monkeys, lions, peacocks, camels, and many other animals. It was incredibly fun! We came to a bird cage where visitors could enter, and the birds were flying freely. There was a little boy inside, and a bird landed right on top of his head! Just then, my mom's phone rang. It was my brother. He said he was staying home because he didn't want to get up. I could barely hear my mom over the birds. She walked outside, and I followed. I heard her saying, “Stay home, because I said so, you don't need to go anywhere.” Before I knew it, she was hanging up. As we walked towards the fish building, her phone rang again. “Don't ever hang up on me again! I don't need to fight with you! It's going to storm, and I want you home!” Just then, it started pouring rain, and my mom was still on the phone. I got very wet and bored. I really wanted to see the fish. About five minutes later, my mom hung up. We walked into the building soaking wet. My mom smiled at me and said, “Thanks for being so patient!” This day at the zoo was full of unexpected events, but my patience was rewarded.
554	18460	7	2	One instance when I was patient was during the MCAP tests. I was one of the first to finish, so I had to sit quietly and read. I read most of my book. It took about an hour for everyone else to finish. It was a very long time to just sit and read. I got bored, but I remained quiet so as not to disrupt others and to let them finish their tests. After everyone was done, we took a bathroom break. This experience showed me that patience is important in a group - testing environment to ensure fairness and a conducive atmosphere for all.
555	18461	7	2	When I was a little kid, an example of my patience was when my mom and my cousin Cindy were talking. My cousin told me to wait my turn, and I did. While they were talking, I asked my mom if I could go for a bike ride. I told her I could ride my bike without training wheels. My mom's attention was diverted because I was going to have some kind of “surgery” (it was probably a minor medical procedure). I waited until it was over. It was an interesting and fun experience. This childhood event demonstrated that even at a young age, I was capable of being patient when required.
556	18463	7	2	I once tested my patience while waiting for something. You can tell if you have patience. If you can wait for a certain period, say @NUM1, you'll know if you possess patience. I try to be strong, but I do get impatient at times. You'll never be completely patient all the time. I was at a go - kart race. I had to be patient to see the outcome. Then I got impatient. After that, I had to wait to get food so that I'd have some time to do what I wanted. By @MONTH1, I learned how to gain my patience.
557	18464	7	2	There was a time when I showed great patience. It was when my cousins @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3 were playing the Wii. I said that I'd play the winner. My cousin @PERSON2 won, but @PERSON1 didn't give me the controller and refused to share. I told her she could play one more time and then it would be my turn. Instead, she played four more times. I kept insisting that it was my turn as she had played and I hadn't, but she claimed it wasn't my turn. Then her mom said @PERSON1 could play for @NUM1 more minutes and then it would be my turn. One hour and thirty minutes passed, and she still didn't give it to me. I finally told her that I'd been patient for a long time and that she either had to give it to me or I'd take it. She still didn't. Eventually, she said she was tired of it anyway. That was the time I demonstrated patience.
558	18465	7	2	"One instance when I was patient was when I had to go to the doctor for a shot for sixth - grade. I didn't want to go, but I had no choice. So, I got in the car, and we drove to the doctor's office. When we arrived, my mom signed in, and we sat down. I waited for three hours without complaining. When the doctor came out, I was scared but also happy that it might be my turn. However, he called a different name, so my mom and I continued waiting in the waiting room. My mom then said, ""Wow, @CAPS1, you're not complaining now."" I knew it was because I was becoming more mature and had a lot of patience. Thankfully, the doctor finally called my name, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS5."" My mom and I went into the room. The doctor said I'd grown since the last time he'd seen me. I asked if the shot would hurt, and he assured me it wouldn't. I closed my eyes and imagined something nice. The doctor said he was done, and I was surprised as I hadn't felt a thing. I told him he was the best doctor in the world, and he thanked me. This experience showed my patience."
559	18466	7	2	"I remember when my older sister was extremely patient for her birthday on the ""fourth of @DATE2."" Every time I asked if she could wait until her birthday, she said yes. She was looking forward to it from ""@DATE1"" until the ""fourth of @DATE2."" She was so happy and patient. During that time, she went to her friend's house and did some shopping on her own. There were fireworks in the air. This is how my sister showed her patience for her birthday."
560	18467	7	2	I was screaming inside my head. Babysitting my cousin required a great deal of patience, more so from me than one might expect. It all started on a @DATE1 at @TIME1. My family went out for drinks, and I stayed behind to work on my homework. Shortly after my mom left, I heard a knock on the door. My aunt came in and whispered if it was okay for her to leave @CAPS2 with me. I replied okay. @CAPS4 slept for about half an hour. When I woke up, @CAPS4 was @CAPS5 and started crying. I picked her up and carried her around, but she kept crying. I thought her clothes needed changing, so I changed them, but she still cried. I had to keep my patience because one can't yell at a baby. Then I thought she was hungry. I didn't know how to make a bottle, so I had to read instructions. @CAPS4 was very impatient and just wanted her bottle. When I was about to lose my patience, I made a bottle (making sure it was okay). @CAPS4 drank it. I put her back to sleep. She looked peaceful until she woke up and started crying again. I knew this time it was because she liked to be carried. By the time my aunt came back, my hands were sore. At the end of the day, I realized that taking care of a baby requires a lot of patience, and it's even more so for a younger brother, as I could attest.
561	18468	7	2	"I will write about a time when I demonstrated patience. My advocate, [PERSON1], was supposed to buy me some pens with part of my [DATE1] money. Since then, I've been asking him every day. I'd say, ""[PERSON2], have you done your daily shopping yet?"" He'd reply, ""No."" I'd then say, ""[CAPS2]."" [PERSON1] would respond, ""Because I want to get my pens as a [DATE1] present. Remember you owe me [NUM3]."" I'd say, ""[CAPS5] I know, but I'm starting to lose my patience."" He'd say, ""[CAPS6]."" I've been waiting ever since. This experience taught me the value of patience in waiting for what I wanted."
562	18471	7	2	"Have you ever waited in line to ride the biggest roller - coaster at an amusement park? Or waited until all your chores were done before playing with your best friend? Maybe you've waited for your little sibling to catch up. Well, in this story, I'll share a time I had to be patient. On [DATE1], I had to go to the doctor for shots to stay safe. When I arrived, I had to wait in a room for my name to be called. It was incredibly boring! I kept thinking, ""[CAPS1] How long does it take for a few people to get shots so I can leave?"" I sat there for about half an hour until my name was finally called. Once in the back room, I had to wait even longer for my mom to sign papers and for the doctor to prepare the shots as my mom instructed. In the end, I got to go home and play with my friend. This was one of many patience - testing times, and at least I still got to have fun with my friend. I hope you enjoyed this story."
563	18472	7	2	I showed patience while waiting for an opportunity to visit Chicago. I really wanted to see the Windy City because my mom went to [LOCATION1]. I tried to put it out of my mind until the time came. It sort of worked, but every now and then, the desire would resurface. I remained patient and never pestered my parents about it. It took a few years, but I held onto my patience. Sometimes, I even forgot about my plan to visit [LOCATION1]. I lived each day as if I didn't care. No matter how tempting it was to watch a [CAPS1] or [CAPS2] Hawks game, I stayed calm. Then, on [MONTH1] [DATE1], it finally happened. Imagine, after [NUM1], I was still patient! In short, no matter how long it took, I was determined to be patient, and it paid off.
564	18473	7	2	"I'll tell this story in my own way. It was [DATE1], and my sister was turning [NUM1] years old. We were at [CAPS1] [CAPS2] setting up for her party. She had a beautiful dress, and my mom was curling her hair in the bathroom. I walked in and asked my mom to curl my hair too. She said, ""You have to wait."" I made a snobbish comment and sat at one of the tables. I was being patient. Finally, it was my turn, and I sat while she curled my hair. Later that day, my sister, [NUM2] cousins, and I went bowling. I was last on the bowling list, so I had to be patient for a while. When it was finally my turn, I bowled and waited, bowled and waited. Then it was time for cake, and I had to be patient again. Eventually, I got my cake, but I was tired of waiting for everything. While my sister was opening her presents, I thought she was so slow. So, I walked up and shouted, ""[CAPS4] Hurry up!"" I got yelled at and had to sit out for a bit. I should have been patient all day, and maybe I could have participated in all the games. That's my story, told in my own unique way."
565	18474	7	2	"A time I showed patience was when training my dog. I commanded, ""Sit, boy."" Instead of sitting, my puppy ran at me, jumped, and snatched the treat from my hand. I tried to get the treat back, but he gulped it down. As I was walking to grab his collar for a walk, he bolted away. After chasing him for hours, he finally stopped and looked at me, ready to run again. I said, ""[CAPS2] Come here. I'm done chasing you. Let's just go for a walk, please,"" as I started to lose my patience. I slowly walked towards him. When I got close enough to grab his collar, he bolted again, leaving a cloud of dust. I screamed, ""[CAPS1] I'm done!"" and walked away angrily. I went up the hill to my house and went to my room to sleep. The next morning, I got up and went outside to try training him again. I lost my patience yesterday, but today I was ready to work hard and be patient. I yelled, ""[CAPS6]!"" and he stopped running. With my first command to sit, he didn't obey, so I didn't give him the treat. I repeated the command, and he sat! There was finally some progress. I gave him the treat, and his tail started wagging. I tested him again, and he sat for another treat. After that, I started asking him to do more things. Sometimes he listened, sometimes he didn't. This was a time when being patient with my dog to teach and train him really paid off."
566	18475	7	2	One time, I had to show patience during a trip to visit my sister at school. We flew to @LOCATION4 and then to @ORGANIZATION1, but after that, things took a turn for the worse. When we reached @LOCATION3, we were stuck there for four hours. After an hour, I got bored, and having my little brother with me didn't help. Then, over the intercom, we heard that we had to go through security and sit in a room with a gift shop for @NUM1 hours. With an hour left, there was another announcement saying we'd be delayed three more hours. I listened to my iPod and luckily fell asleep for three and a half hours. Finally, we boarded a six - seater plane to fly to a nearby small island. When we got to @LOCATION1, we rushed to the island school to see my sister. That was one instance when I had to be patient while waiting in an airport for @NUM2 hours.
567	18476	7	2	I can clearly hear the clock ticking, which probably is meant to annoy me. The tension in the small classroom building is palpable. Everyone is sitting on the edge of their seats, waiting. Why does @CAPS4 seem to take so long? It's almost @NUM1 minute now. The aroma of pepperoni pizza is so strong that I can practically taste it. This is pure agony. My stomach rumbles as I'm extremely hungry. I'm not sure if I can wait for @NUM2 seconds. The tension in the whole class is so intense that I think my brain might explode. I can't stand this; @CAPS4 is just too much. My eyes nervously glance at the @NUM4 seconds. @CAPS4 seems like an eternity. Could @CAPS4 have been just a few seconds? It must have been at least years. Why is time passing so slowly? I'm not a patient person at all. But do I have any patience? If I do, I can't see it. I'm about to jump out of my seat as if I'm ejected from a @DATE1. I'm trying to stay still, but anxiety is getting the better of me. If I knew I'd be this anxious for lunch, I would have had breakfast. Now we're down to @NUM6 seconds. My excitement grows, but so does the tension. It's enough to crush me. I think I might make it @NUM7. My stomach rumbles again, this time more loudly, begging for food, or rather demanding it. The clock keeps ticking, taunting me. With @NUM8 seconds left, I can't bear it any longer. I think I'm about to snap. I don't handle patience well. It's like a ticking bomb inside me, waiting to go off at @NUM9 seconds. It seems the bomb and the clock are counting down together, both anticipating my breakdown. But I'll show them. My will is stronger than my need. I can do this. I will prove I have @NUM10. Finally, the bell rings, signaling lunch time. I dash out like a squirrel that just sat on a snow cone.
568	18477	7	2	I consider myself a person with a lot of patience. There have been many instances in my life where I've demonstrated this. Once, we were driving to @LOCATION1's @CAPS1, and I started getting antsy. Knowing it would be a hectic day for my mom, I decided to be patient and read. Before I realized it, we had arrived. Another time, I was waiting with my mom to get a lemonade. We had already been in the line for @NUM1 minutes, and I was getting tired of waiting for a simple lemonade. However, I knew my mom had had a tiring day because my sister wouldn't stop complaining. So, instead of complaining, I stopped thinking about how long it would take and started imagining what it would be like to ride the @CAPS2. Soon enough, we got our lemonade. Later, I started regretting getting in line for the @CAPS3 hawk as the line was extremely long. I was really angry that we were waiting so long for a @NUM2 - second ride. But then I remembered my mom was with me and she had a bad headache, so I kept quiet. I'm glad I was patient that day because if I hadn't been, my mom probably wouldn't have been as happy as she was at the end of the day.
569	18478	7	2	One time, I showed patience when we went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. We had to wait in line for half an hour to get on the cork - screw ride. I was extremely excited about going on that ride, so I decided to be patient. After @NUM1 minutes, when we reached the front of the line, I couldn't wait any longer. I quickly got on the ride. I really didn't enjoy having to stand in line for so long, but that's what patience is all about.
570	18479	7	2	"On @CAPS1, while I was fishing for salmon in Little Traverse Bay, there was a tremendous tug on the trolling line. I launched from my sitting position like a rocket and heaved on the line. I waited, thinking it might be a false alarm, a snag. But I was wrong. The pull on the line seemed to dance and then bent really fast again. ""Reel on,"" I yelled to my cousin, and he rushed back to help me. We stared at the water; the pole was still flexed but didn't move. I felt like I was in an old - western movie stand - off, looking for that tumbleweed moment. Finally, I looked at my cousin and asked, ""I've been patient. Do you think I should reel him in?"" ""Let me get the net first,"" he said angrily, grabbed it, and then stated, ""When you're ready."" I slowly cranked the handle on the reel. As I was slowly bringing the fish up from the freaky depths, out of nowhere, the steel cable that was my line shot from the spool like a bullet. Then, with a sudden jerk from the fish, the line went slack. My cousin and I knew what had happened. The @CAPS2 that I thought was going to be mine was now swimming off into deeper waters, ready to frustrate more fishermen with its elusive ways."
571	18480	7	2	My mother has demonstrated remarkable patience towards me on numerous occasions. Whenever I return home, I often share stories about my school day with her. One particular instance stands out. We were sitting in the living - room, and I began to tell her about my day. I rambled on, and though the story might have been dull and overly long for her, she listened intently. She made comments and never once showed signs of boredom. Her attentive expression filled me with joy, knowing that she was truly engaged in my tale. This shows that my mother's patience is a precious quality that makes our bond even stronger.
572	18481	7	2	There was a time when I showed patience. First, I allowed a stranger to cut in front of me to get some food. Then, when my brother and I both needed to use the bathroom, even though I was originally first in line, I let him go ahead. These acts of patience, though small, reflect my ability to consider others and control my own impulses. In the end, it was a simple yet meaningful way to show kindness and self - restraint.
573	18482	7	2	"Patience is an elusive virtue, yet it is truly a valuable gift. I recall a time when I had to test my patience before a @ORGANIZATION1 football game. The journey to the game was the first challenge. It was @NUM1, and there was a large influx of people moving towards @PERSON1. The traffic was so heavy that it took us @NUM2 to cover a mere @NUM3. I was on the verge of running to the game; I couldn't contain my excitement any longer. My dad constantly reminded me to ""reign in your patience!"" Once we escaped the traffic, there was another @NUM4 wait before the game. I sat in a lawn chair, watching cars pass our tailgate on this college game day, desperately wanting to scream and head to the stadium. Finally, we left the tailgate. Walking with the @LOCATION1 state fans and other tailgaters was enjoyable. But then, I had to stand in a long, boring line. I questioned whether I could be patient enough as people slowly got in. As I inched closer, I managed to stay patient. When it was my turn, I rushed into the stadium, excited to have overcome my impatience and let patience guide me throughout the day. It was an incredibly rewarding feeling to finally be inside, having mastered my eagerness."
574	18484	7	2	One time, I showed great patience when I was in a store with my grandma. I really had to use the bathroom, but my grandma seemed to be taking her time as if she was trying to explore the whole store. I started getting extremely angry because I suspected the cashier was deliberately working slowly so I couldn't use the restroom. However, I refrained from complaining because most of the items in the basket were mine. This experience taught me that sometimes, we need to be patient even when we are extremely uncomfortable. It was a significant moment that demonstrated my ability to control my emotions and put others' situations into consideration.
575	18485	7	2	Every year, our family has a two - week reunion. Cousins, aunts, and uncles travel from all over the country to spend these precious weeks together. We head to the small town of @PERSON1, which is adjacent to the famous @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The only drawback is the four - hour drive, and I'm not known for my patience. My brother and I take turns each year to decide who rides with my mom by flipping a coin, and unfortunately, I always lose. In my opinion, my mom is the most impatient person! But once we arrive, everyone is excited and willing to wait for the @NUM1 of @DATE1. Through this long - distance travel and waiting, I've learned to be patient. It's all worth it in the end to be with my family and enjoy this special reunion. This is my story of learning to be patient for the sake of family.
576	18488	7	2	One instance when I had to exercise great patience was when I awaited my grandma's arrival at my home. I had to wait a full five hours. Every hour, I would go outside to check if she had arrived. Eventually, she did, and I was overjoyed. Some ways to stay patient include focusing on something else, going to someone's house for a while, or even taking a nap. These are all effective methods for maintaining patience.
577	18489	7	2	My grandma is nearly always patient with me, particularly when teaching me practical skills such as cooking or sewing. On one occasion, she taught me to use a sewing machine. She showed me how to change the thread color and helped me untangle it, which took time, especially considering I'm not the most attentive learner. This required a great deal of her patience. Another time, she taught me to frost sugar - cookies. I got very frustrated as the cookies would break or the frosting would be lumpy and messy, covering the entire cookie, including the bottom. But grandma endured my complaints. When I finally managed to frost a cookie that didn't break and had smooth frosting, she praised me, despite the fact that I'd probably broken half of the cookies. She was also patient when we made caramel corn, a process with many tricky steps where one wrong move can ruin the whole batch. She mostly let me do the easy parts but also allowed me to make the sauce for the last batch, which was enjoyable. When I started to work slowly, instead of yelling at me to hurry up, she politely asked me to speed up a bit, which surely demanded a lot of patience. Additionally, she taught me to bake, which was extremely challenging for her as I constantly spilled flour, vanilla, baking soda, and any other ingredients in the recipe. I was also reluctant to clean up, and even when I did, I left half of the mess on the floor. In conclusion, my grandma is always patient with me, regardless of my actions.
578	18490	7	2	I once demonstrated patience when I went to ride the Raptor at Cedar Point. There was a two - hour queue, and my friend and I got bored. The music playing didn't really entertain us. However, I was extremely excited as I had never been on the Raptor before. An hour passed painfully slowly. Finally, after a long wait, there were only ten more minutes until I could ride. And it turned out to be the best ride ever, making the long wait worthwhile.
579	18491	7	2	In the old days, people had no clear idea about when to take shelter and how to protect their food. Our modern time is much easier as many things are readily available to us while they had to work hard for everything. The two time periods are quite different. There aren't many days when I'm patient, but one such day was when I was playing a football game on a lovely sunny [DATE1] at [TIME1]. As the starting quarterback, I scored [NUM1] touchdowns and a passing touchdown in the first half. At that point, our team was up by [NUM2]. Then, the coaches took out all the starters for the entire second half. I expected to keep playing, but they told me to sit on the bench for the rest of the game. This was extremely difficult for me as I'm not a patient person, and I had to wait until the game ended to get up from the bench. It was incredibly hard for me, and I sincerely hope I never have to experience such a situation again.
580	18492	7	2	I've shown patience before. On [DATE1], I went hunting with my dad. We sat in the blind for a long time, waiting for deer to appear. Dad said they usually come at night or late afternoon. We waited seemingly forever. When the deer finally came, we didn't manage to shoot one. Some other hunters shot at a deer, and then all the deer ran away. We waited for about ten more minutes and then went in. We had been there from [TIME1] until [NUM1]. Throughout the entire time, I remained patient.
581	18494	7	2	"One day, I went fishing with my parents. The fish finder was going off like crazy, but no fish were biting. Soon, our dog would bark like crazy whenever we started to reel in our lines, even if there was nothing on them. We waited and waited, but still caught nothing. Occasionally, we had to move due to the current. After sitting there for hours, I felt something on my line. At first, I thought I was snagged on a rock. As I started to reel in, the line moved a little. I reeled some more, and it felt like a fish pulling on my line. I called out, ""Dad, I think I have a fish!"" My dad told me what to do. Eventually, I felt like my arms were going to fall off, but the fish came into view! While dad got the net and pulled the fish out of the water, I asked, ""What kind is it?"" He said, ""It's a walleye."" I didn't know what to say. It was my first walleye! And dad even said it was big enough to keep. Then, we went home, filleted the fish, and had walleye for dinner."
582	18495	7	2	On a @DATE1 @TIME1 at school, it was as boring as usual. Then my friend @CAPS1 came in on crutches. I was shocked and ran over to her. She told me she had broken her leg and wasn't allowed to hang out for a whole month. It was tough waiting a month to hang out with her, but I knew her safety was more important than my fun. After @NUM1 weeks since my friend broke her leg, I was doing well at not bothering her, so I was proud of myself. Also, I got to help her around school. A few more weeks later, she was almost better. I was excited and bought her a gift. The next @DATE1, @PERSON1 was out of the crutches and cast and back on her feet. That's the story of when I was patient.
583	18496	7	2	I'm the kind of person who's often considered impatient. I'll try to explain it as best I can. The only time I'm patient is when something exciting comes on TV. My friends are always patient about everything, like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and other things, but I'm never patient. In conclusion, my impatience is a notable trait, except in that one specific situation.
584	18497	7	2	"My mom called out, ""@PERSON2, come down here! I need you to open an envelope!"" We rushed downstairs because an envelope usually means a report card, letter, @CAPS1 card, or checking account balance. When we got downstairs, we saw they had a camera out, and the envelope had a star on the back that said @NUM1 radio. We opened it, and it said, ""Congratulations! You won tickets to @NUM2 first @CAPS2 @CAPS3 with @PERSON1!"" I was in awe, and my sister was going crazy! Then, my mom told us that my aunt was going with us. The surprises just kept coming. Another big surprise was that about @NUM3 girls were lined up at the front doors of the @CAPS4 oak music @PERSON3. Then security came and spread the girls out, and we were pushed about a quarter - mile away from where we were standing. After @NUM4 ½ hours of waiting, I saw a boy's head pop out of a window of the music @PERSON3 and say, ""@CAPS5 girls!"" After that, about @NUM5 girls started screaming. @NUM6 ½ hours later, they started letting people in. The theater was cozy and warm after being out in the cold for @NUM7 hours. It felt great. Iyaz was the special guest to warm us up for @PERSON1. When he came out, every girl was screaming their lungs out! His performance was a great start to the concert, and it was an amazing experience for my first concert ever."
585	18498	7	2	One day during the @DATE1, my phone rang. Not many people call my cell phone, so I dashed to my room. But I couldn't find my phone anywhere. I was so frustrated that I almost tore everything apart. Then I felt my back pocket, and there it was. I felt so stupid for freaking out. Anyway, the phone was still ringing. I looked at the contact and was stunned to see it was my friend @CAPS1. She asked if we could have a sleepover in her backyard. I was really excited, but that same day, my family and I were going to a fair. I asked my dad, and he hesitated before saying yes. I packed my bags, got in the car, and we left. I didn't really want to go to the peach fair; I just wanted to hang out with @CAPS1. At the fair, my brother and I wandered around, went on a few rides, and played some games. All I could think about was how much fun I'd have at @CAPS4. I waited and waited. Finally, we could go. I was so excited to get to @CAPS4. It was about time. I had no choice but to be patient. In conclusion, that was one of the times I managed to be patient.
586	18499	7	2	"My fingers tapped rhythmically on the armrest as I anxiously awaited. I had implored my [CAPS1] to hasten so that I wouldn't be late. I had reminded her countless times, emphasizing how crucial punctuality for practice was to me. Slumped on the couch with my backpack firmly strapped, I pondered why this situation occurred so frequently, expecting my [CAPS1] to have learned by now. To pass the time, I switched on the television, but each channel change only heightened my irritation. Thoughts like ""Where is she? Why is she taking so long?"" swirled in my mind. Eventually, my [CAPS1] stumbled into the family room, grabbed her keys, and we rushed to the car. As I fastened my seat - belt, I opened the garage door, which creaked open as I fidgeted in my seat. My [CAPS1] started the engine, and we drove down the driveway towards the road. Unfortunately, we got stuck in traffic. As the cars moved slowly, time ticked away. The clock showed [NUM1], and I was certain I wouldn't make it on time. I leaned back in my seat, closed my [NUM2], and took deep breaths to calm my racing heart and reduce my stress. I told myself to be patient, assuring that I would reach my destination. Suddenly, my [CAPS1] slammed on the brakes, and I opened my eyes to see that we had arrived at the pool. The time was [NUM3], and I realized I was going to make it. I leaped out of the car with my bag on my back and congratulated myself, acknowledging that patience had allowed me to reach swim practice on time."
587	18500	7	2	On my birthday, I was extremely patient despite receiving nothing. I had hoped for at least one gift, but to my disappointment, I got none. I hadn't done anything wrong, yet I still didn't receive a present. The next day and the day after, it was the same story. I hadn't even asked for anything, but the lack of birthday gifts persisted. That night, while I was skating at Skate Port at [TIME1], I saw my cousin. She gave me [MONEY1] for my birthday. I had thought everyone had forgotten about my special day, but I was wrong. I was overjoyed. This experience taught me that by being patient, I could receive something without having to ask for it.
588	18501	7	2	On [DATE1], there was a power outage. My aunt [PERSON1] was watching me when suddenly all the lights went out. I initially thought we had blown a fuse, so my aunt went to fix it, but her efforts were in vain. She then tried calling my mom, but the connection was lost. We decided to use our generator and watched the news. We learned that my mom was stuck on the highway, which worried me. Eventually, we managed to get our phones working. Some of our family members came over. We were extremely frustrated because nothing seemed to work for a whole week. Throughout this difficult period, we had to exercise great patience.
589	18502	7	2	I'd been waiting for about two hours, constantly wondering when I'd finally get my food. I was so hungry that I told my mom. She asked if I wanted to go out, and I agreed, quickly putting on my jacket. Mom said she had to go get dad and told me to wait in the car. I waited for a few minutes. When they finally came out, dad shouted [CAPS1] [CAPS2], then said okay, and we left. When we arrived at the place, we found that no other stores were open. Inside, there were a large number of people. I was so famished that I joked I could eat a pig. We went to the chicken area and asked how long we'd have to wait. The guy at the counter said about two hours. After about [NUM1], I started reading a magazine. Some people left, but others took their seats in front of us. We were next to be seated, but it took about an hour for some people to leave. I didn't complain or talk at all, which was quite unusual for me as I'm usually quite talkative. This was a time when I showed great patience.
590	18503	7	2	One instance when I demonstrated patience was during a visit to the doctor's office. Yesterday, when I went there, the waiting room was so crowded that we had to stand. Due to the large number of people waiting, we had to join the queue. We were number [NUM1], and it took us [NUM2] hours just to get a seat! It required a great deal of patience as the combined waiting time in the waiting room and for the doctor was about [NUM3] hours. When I finally got in to see the doctor, I felt an immense sense of relief, like a heavy burden had been lifted off my shoulders. Although the wait was long, it was worth it because now I'm feeling better and back at school.
591	18504	7	2	When one is in an excited state, it can be difficult to exercise patience. However, patience is demonstrated in certain situations, such as when a family member is speaking and one is waiting for something else. This shows that patience, though challenging at times, can be practiced in daily interactions.
592	18505	7	2	I asked my mother if I could get a phone, and she replied that I couldn't have one yet. She stated that I would have to wait until ninth grade to get a real phone, unless I got a [CAPS1] phone right away. I told her okay and then asked when she would get it for me. She said I needed to be patient. I assured her I would be, and when she said she'd get it as soon as possible, like on [DATE1], I promised to be patient until then and not bother her about it. This was an instance when I had to exercise patience.
593	18506	7	2	One time, I went to a store with my dad. There was a line of about [NUM1] people. My dad and I started to get impatient. I told myself to calm down and wait, but I couldn't. Then, when the first person in the line left, I began to calm down and just waited for the next person to go. In the end, I managed to control my impatience and wait patiently in the line.
594	18507	7	2	"As I sat waiting, my fingertips were freezing. Seconds dragged into minutes and then hours. My body heat was rapidly dissipating, much like sand being blown away by the wind. I slogged through the mud while the heavy rain pelted my skin. I should have waited. I was supposed to be patient as they had told me, but I didn't listen. My bones were cold, and I was only about [NUM1] yards from home. My legs were shaking violently and refused to move. I reminded myself to wait and be patient. Then I saw a cop car in my parents' driveway. I forced my left leg through the mess of leaves and mud; patience was no longer an option. I counted down the yards: nine, eight, seven, six. I stopped, pulled my hood over my head, but the wind and rain blew it off. Five, four, three, two, one. I reached my doorstep. Weakly, I raised my hand to knock. [CAPS1]. I heard fast footsteps, and the door opened. I was enveloped in a hug. ""You should have waited!"" my dad cried, tears streaming down his face. I managed a weak smile, realizing the truth in his words."
595	18508	7	2	There was a boy named [PERSON1]. He desired a video - game for his [CAPS1] - box [NUM1]. Unfortunately, his father had just been laid off, and his mother had a low - paying job. Due to their limited finances, he couldn't afford to buy the game. A few months later, his father found a job at [CAPS2]. However, [PERSON1] still didn't have enough money for the game. After a few more months, he finally saved up enough. His mother took him to the store to purchase it. He was extremely excited. Once he got the game, he ended up loving it very much, which made all the waiting worthwhile.
596	18509	7	2	You may have heard your parents say that patience is a virtue. I've heard it countless times at home, perhaps too many. Patience means waiting. For instance, if you want to watch a new movie on its opening night, you might have to stand in a long queue because it's a new release. So, you'll have to wait patiently. This shows that patience is indeed an important quality in such situations.
597	18510	7	2	During the @DATE1, I had an experience that required patience. My @CAPS1 @PERSON1 kindly invited me to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 with her family. Of course, my parents gave their consent. It was about a @NUM1 - hour @CAPS4 journey to @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The trip was enjoyable as we brought many things to keep ourselves occupied. We watched a movie on my @ORGANIZATION1 and listened to music. I had no problem waiting until we reached our destination. When we arrived at the hotel, we picked up our bags and then drove to @CAPS2 @CAPS3. It was @NUM2 awesome. First, we went on the @CAPS10. It was so scary that my eyes watered, and the speed was so high that I felt like we were going to fly off the tracks. Next, we wanted to go on the Millennium Force, but the line was an hour long, and we were in the middle of it. Escaping the line would have been useless. Finally, it was our turn, but the ride wasn't working, so we had to wait. Since it wouldn't cooperate, we were given free passes to any ride and could cut ahead of others, though we could only do it once. As this shows, our patience was rewarded, and I believe it was truly worth it.
598	18511	7	2	I was very patient when waiting to get my first hamster. Patience means being understanding and tolerant. I was extremely patient and excited about getting my first hamster. Eventually, I got two of them. They are silly little creatures, and they sometimes bite. My brother was also patient while waiting for his turn. Patience involves realizing that you really want something and waiting for it. In this case, waiting for the hamsters was well - worth it. As we can see, patience can lead to getting what we desire.
599	18512	7	2	I was patient when waiting for @PERSON1 to ask me out. We're still dating to this day. He goes to my school. When he finally asked me out, I was at a loss for words because he took so long. I only had feelings for him and no one else. Being patient means not rushing things and waiting for someone or something, just as I did. I didn't ask him out @NUM1 times; instead, I waited for him to make the move. If someone isn't interested, they might reject you and hurt your feelings. So, if you don't want to get hurt, it's better to be patient like I was.
600	18513	7	2	I decided to write about a time when I was patient. It was my first hunting experience, and I was hunting squirrels. What I had to do was walk into the woods, sit down, and stay still. I sat quietly for @NUM1 minutes, and finally, I spotted a squirrel. I took my shotgun and shot it in the chest. My patience paid off as I managed to get a squirrel. This is my story about the importance of patience in hunting.
601	18514	7	2	I went to the fair with my friends. There was a ride named the Freak - Out that we were really eager to try. However, the line was extremely long. So, we decided to go on other rides. As we looked at the line, it just kept getting longer. Eventually, we decided to get in line anyway. It felt as if we were moving only an inch every few minutes, and I had to exercise great patience. Inside, I was on the verge of losing my temper, but I managed to stay calm on the outside. Those were the longest few minutes of my life! In the end, our patience was a test, but we held on through the long wait at the fair.
602	18515	7	2	On [DATE1] at [TIME1], [PERSON1] and his dad planned to go fishing. They gathered all the necessary items: fishing pots, a tackle box, fishing nets, bait, and lunch. They drove to the lake, got into their small row - boat, and set off. [PERSON1]'s dad was the first to catch a fish, a ten - inch small - mouth bass. Since it was too small, he threw it back and continued fishing. The lake was quiet that day, with a gentle breeze in the [DATE2] air. The sun was up, but it was still a bit cold. They sat patiently. [PERSON1]'s dad got another tug on his line and quickly reeled in a twenty - inch pike, which was also too small and was thrown back. His dad commented that the fish were biting, but [PERSON1] hadn't gotten a single bite after an hour. They fished for another hour before taking a break for lunch, which consisted of sandwiches, chips, and some water. After lunch, they resumed fishing. [PERSON1] cast his line as far as he could. About twenty minutes later, he felt a tug. He excitedly told his dad and reeled in a fourteen - inch largemouth bass. His dad joked that [PERSON1] had caught dinner. They fished for another twenty minutes before heading in with their catch. [PERSON1]'s patience had finally paid off, and they had a fish dinner to look forward to.
603	18516	7	2	I was at a store to buy something. There was a long line, so I had to wait to pay for my purchases. The person in front of me had a large cart filled with food and other items. I had to be patient as they took their time to pay. After that person finished, I still had to wait for the remaining people in line to complete their transactions. Eventually, I was able to pay for my things. In this situation, patience was necessary to get through the long wait at the store.
604	18517	7	2	"As I've grown older, my capacity for patience has significantly increased. When I was six, my mother told me to wait to open my Christmas gifts. I was angry and stomped off to my room, flopping onto my bed and eventually falling asleep. Later, my mother came in and said I could open my presents but emphasized the need for patience. Now, as an adult, I can distinguish right from wrong attitudes. During Christmas, I don't focus solely on the gifts. I remember my mother's words about being patient because we can't always get everything we want. Patience has become a virtue for me in most aspects of life. I've learned not to rush and miss the details of what others say, as that could lead to disappointment. Patience and enthusiasm are different. Patience is about waiting even when you don't want to, while enthusiasm is about being excited. People often confuse the two. When a child is excited, instead of just saying ""be patient,"" it's better to say ""calm down"" and explain why. These are the lessons I've learned about how to act, and I hope others will consider them as they could be helpful."
605	18518	7	2	I once went to [CAPS1] Point with my friend [PERSON1]. I was patient during the journey there, while waiting in line to enter, and also when waiting to get on the dragster and other rides. Another time, I had to go to the hospital for a heart echo. I patiently awaited the results. Most of the time, I am a patient person. For instance, when I went to [LOCATION1], I was patient while going through security, on the plane during the flight, when getting off the plane, and while waiting for my luggage. At school, I am patient while waiting for lunch, for school to end, and for each class to finish. In conclusion, patience is a trait I possess in many different situations, and it helps me navigate through various experiences smoothly.
606	18519	7	2	The wait for the best ride at @ORGANIZATION1 was over @NUM1 hours. This was bad news for me as I'm not a patient person. Once, I was in line for ice - cream. There were only two people ahead, but I didn't want to wait, so I gave up on the ice - cream. However, for this so - called best ride in the world, I was willing to wait. After two hours in line, we saw a sign saying it was still an hour from that point at @ORGANIZATION1. I was extremely angry but kept telling myself it was the best ride and I could wait one more hour, and I did. When we finally got on, the ride was fun, but it was only @NUM2 seconds long. In the end, though the wait was long, the brief fun of the ride made it somewhat worth it.
607	18520	7	2	It's cold and raining at @CAPS1. I've been waiting for @NUM1 hour and there's still no activity. I'm here hunting deer with my new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 bow. I'm a fairly good shot, but not outstanding. I know that patience is crucial for deer hunting, so I just have to wait. After waiting patiently, I spot a deer about @NUM2 yards away and take a shot. My patience has finally paid off, and this experience reinforces the importance of patience in hunting.
608	18521	7	2	About ten minutes ago, I found myself needing to be extremely patient. You can see multiple erase marks in the background of my text because I accidentally wrote part two of the test on this page. I'm incredibly grateful to my caring teacher who discovered this for me; otherwise, I would have failed. While I was sitting quietly at my desk, the teacher walked up and held the test in front of my face. I knew something was wrong. When she told me I'd written on the wrong page, I almost lost my temper but managed to hold it back. Patience is truly a great quality as it allows us to handle such situations properly. I'm glad I possess a good amount of it, which helped me through this stressful test - related incident.
609	18522	7	2	I was waiting for a party at Zapzone. I was invited, and it was supposed to be on @DATE1. I was told about it @NUM1 weeks in advance. Then, I was informed that I had to pay for myself, but it was a party, so I accepted. @NUM2 weeks later, I went school - shopping for ten minutes. When I came back, I was told the party had already happened. The person hosting wasn't there as a party usually takes an hour or two, so I decided to let it go. This experience was a letdown, but in the end, I realized there was no point in dwelling on it.
610	18523	7	2	Everyone loves @CAPS1 and has to be patient for it, especially on the @TIME1 of @CAPS1 @CAPS3. In my family, we all get extremely excited and can't wait for morning, and I'm no exception. I get so excited that I can hardly sleep. Last year was particularly difficult. I woke up at @NUM1 am on @CAPS1 morning for no reason. I tried to go back to sleep and managed to doze off for about thirty minutes before waking up again. I just couldn't fall back asleep. I went downstairs with some blankets. When I saw the huge amount of presents sitting there, I sat up and looked around. I was very excited but remembered I had to wait for everyone to wake up. I tried to sleep, but I could only manage four - minute naps at a time and eventually gave up. At @NUM2 am, I turned on the @CAPS5, put in a movie, and waited. By @NUM3 am, most of my brothers were up, and I couldn't hold back my impatience. I started to complain. Finally, I was allowed to open my presents, and I was overjoyed. This shows how the anticipation and impatience before @CAPS1 can be intense, but the moment of opening presents makes it all worthwhile.
611	18524	7	2	One instance when I demonstrated patience was during a trip to @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2. We were queuing up for a water roller - coaster. There was an 'easy pass' option where you wait an hour and then get a ticket from a machine, but we chose to stand in the long line. After half an hour, I got bored and asked my dad to play 'slapps'. We played for a while. When about an hour had passed, we were only halfway through the line, and we started to regret our decision. Ten minutes later, I stopped playing because my hands were extremely red while my dad's hands were hardly affected. We continued waiting until we were three - quarters of the way there. After another ten to twenty minutes, we boarded the raft. The raft went through a cave, stopped about forty feet later, and then splashed into a large amount of water. In the end, I realized that the long wait was worth it. This was a time when I showed patience.
612	18525	7	2	One time I had to be patient was when we were flying to @LOCATION1. We were waiting in @LOCATION2. I couldn't help but wonder how long this would take. Eventually, the plane arrived. Once on board, I thought it was the last flight of the day. However, the pilot announced it would be a @NUM1 @NUM2 flight. I looked around to see what I could do. I had my iPod, a book, and the @CAPS1 in front of me. Once in the air, I tried to take a nap, which only passed an hour. Then I decided to watch a movie. I watched @CAPS2 @CAPS3, which took another two hours. By then, I started to get bored. I decided to read the book, but I finished it in an hour and a half. After that, I took out my iPod and listened to music until lunch arrived an hour later. After a @NUM3 - minute lunch, I watched another movie, @CAPS4 @CAPS5, which killed @NUM4 hours. With only @NUM4 hours left, I wanted to watch season @NUM6 of 'The Office'. When there were only @NUM7 minutes left and all the in - flight services were cut, I watched as we landed in @LOCATION1. It was a long journey, but I remained patient throughout.
613	18526	7	2	I show patience when I go out to eat to ensure no one spits in my food. One time, I went out to eat with my family. We were all dressed alike for my birthday. I asked my dad to tell the staff it was my birthday and that I wanted a piece of cake right away. He conveyed my message, and they asked us to wait. I waited and waited. Finally, I threatened to burn the place down if they didn't bring me the cake. My dad told them to bring it as I could make good on my threat. They finally brought the cake and sang 'Happy Birthday' to me. I was happy until I found out they had spat in my food. I learned this before leaving when I heard some people talking about it. I asked if they had spat in the fries, and they said yes. I told them I didn't care because I thought the fries were nasty. I rolled my eyes and walked away. I'm patient now because I'm afraid someone might do it again.
614	18527	7	2	@CAPS2 @CAPS1 was being patient when @CAPS2 decided to order a pizza. The delivery man informed @CAPS2 that the pizza would be at his house in fifteen minutes. After fifteen minutes, @CAPS2 was still waiting for the pizzas. When asked about how late the delivery man would be, @CAPS2 said that he didn't care. This shows that @CAPS2 was exercising patience despite the delay.
615	18528	7	2	We got into the rental car, waving goodbye to our relatives as we drove back to the airport. My @CAPS4 exclaimed, “I can't believe the airport had an earlier opening and called us!” I replied, “I can't either. Out of all... And here we are! That was quick.” As we entered the airport, smelling that Styrofoam - like odor, we checked in our bags. My @CAPS4 told the clerk, “@CAPS2 to @LOCATION1 @NUM1, @CAPS3.” The clerk, with a cheesy smile, said, “Sorry, according to this, your @CAPS10 is full.” My @CAPS4 retorted, “You called saying there were empty seats and invited us to exchange @CAPS2.” The clerk replied, “Sorry, it wouldn't be fair if we gave away @CAPS2 that were rightfully owned.” Then, with another cheesy smile, she said, “You can have your original @CAPS2 back if you like.” @NUM2 @LOCATION2! I thought, what am I going to do for seven hours? First, my brother and I raced up and down the escalators. Then we took the shuttle bus everywhere. By @NUM4, I knew the place inside out. Soon, it was time to leave, but the speaker announced that @CAPS10 @NUM5 to @LOCATION2 had been delayed by an hour and a half. I thought, “Now really?” Luckily, my @CAPS4 took me to an exotic restaurant. It was a beautiful place. Soon, it was time to leave again. I hoped it wouldn't get delayed again, and it didn't. I was happy that we finally left, though a bit sad. Through this experience, I learned a valuable lesson about patience. It's not hard, nor is it impossible.
616	18529	7	2	"One day, I had to spend the whole day with my big brother. He went to get a cell - phone. I also wanted one, but I was too young. When he found out I couldn't get one, he nagged me. I really wanted to take the phone and break it, but I kept calm. When he got home, I walked away from his nagging. I went to do something else, but he kept following me. So, I found a high place he couldn't reach and hung out there until he left. After that, I went back in, but I got locked out. I thought, ""Should I have made a plan?"" Thanks for listening."
617	18530	7	2	When I was about seven years old, I showed great patience during a trip. My mom, dad, sister, brothers, grandma from the north, and I traveled from where we picked up grandma to West Virginia and back. Most of the time, I was either sleeping, waking up, eating, playing at a hotel pool. We'd sleep and then hit the road the next day. The thing that required my patience was that there were presents waiting for me there, and I was eager to open them. Once, we got stuck, which delayed us by about an hour. When we finally arrived, I jumped out of the vehicle, ran as fast as I could, opened the door, and surprised everyone. This experience truly tested and demonstrated my patience.
618	18531	7	2	One time while playing video games, I was waiting around the corner for a guy. I waited for about @NUM1 minutes. Then, he finally appeared. I waited for the right moment to strike. As he walked past, I made my move and assassinated him. That was a time when I showed patience. Patience in gaming can often lead to successful outcomes, as it did in this case.
619	18533	7	2	"One time, my friend recommended a book to me, and I borrowed it from her. The book is titled ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2"", which is also a TV show on the @ORGANIZATION1. In the books, two main characters, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, who are brothers, are vampires. They turned into vampires because of a girl named @PERSON3. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 seemingly died while trying to save @PERSON3. However, @PERSON3 gave them enough blood to transform them into vampires instead of letting them die. Everyone thought @PERSON3 was in the tomb because that's where the town was taking the vampires after they discovered their existence. @PERSON2 returned after @NUM1 years, searching for a way to rescue @PERSON3 from the tomb. This, I believe, is a prime example of patience. Waiting for @NUM1 years to find a solution to help his true love out of trouble without complaint is the essence of patience. Patience means waiting a long time to achieve something and enduring the process without grumbling."
620	18534	7	2	Patience is an essential quality in many aspects of life. When you understand and tolerate things without complaining, that's patience. If you plan to have kids or work in a job where waiting is involved, you need patience. Another reason is that in life, nothing is simply handed to you; you have to work for it, and that requires patience. Without patience, getting through life will be extremely difficult. So, if you lack patience, you should learn to be patient. It's achievable; all you need to do is try to be more understanding and stop complaining about the hardships in life. There will always be difficult things, but with patience, you can overcome them. Just give it a try.
621	18535	7	2	I recall a time when I wanted to ride my dirt - bike. My dad was occupied, so I waited until he had the time to put gas in it. Similarly, @PERSON1 had a question. He also had to wait before he could ask it. This shows that sometimes, patience is necessary when we want to do or ask something.
622	18536	7	2	When I was @NUM1 years old, my mother and sister were busy working and cleaning around the house. I kept pestering my @CAPS3, asking, “Can we go to get pizza?” Every time I asked, she replied, “If you help us and we finish before dinner, we can go get pizza.” I wasn't keen on washing windows, cleaning my room, or washing the car. So, I went to the backyard playground, swinging on the swings and going down the slide. After @NUM2 minutes, it got boring. Then, I realized I had to be patient. I ran down the hill to the river and waded into its cold water, but I was still bored. I got out of the river and ran to @CAPS3, asking, “@CAPS2 are you and @PERSON1 done yet?” She answered, “We're done with the house, but the car has yet to be washed.” I walked to my bike, grabbed the helmet sitting on the seat. The wind in my face while cycling up and down the driveway couldn't compare to the thought of eating pizza, yet it was more entertaining than cleaning. I hopped off my bike and ran into the house. After entering, I took two immediate lefts and looked at the clock. It said @NUM3.m. My family always has dinner at @NUM1:35 because my dad gets home from work at @TIME1 and cooks dinner. I rushed to check if my @CAPS3 and sister were done, asking rudely, “Are you done?” @CAPS3 said, “You could help if you want it to be faster.” I replied, “@CAPS4, fine, I'll help.” I grabbed the hose and sprayed the dirt and bird poop off the windows. After @NUM5 minutes of cleaning, we were done. @CAPS3 left a note for dad and said, “Let's go!” In the end, after waiting @NUM6 hours, I ended up helping to finish the job so we could go for pizza.
623	18537	7	2	One day, at @LOCATION1, our group planned to go on a particular ride. There were tons of people in line for it. Since I was at the back of the line, I had to patiently wait. We spent about half an hour in the line waiting to go on the ride. Finally, when we got on it, I found the ride disappointing as it didn't even involve climbing @NUM1 sets of stairs. After that, we went on a bunch of water - park rides and then went home. This experience shows that sometimes, waiting patiently for something may not always lead to a fulfilling outcome.
624	18538	7	2	In my view, patience means being able to wait for a long time for something without getting angry or raising one's blood pressure. Patience is a valuable trait because without it, one would likely never be able to achieve anything that requires time. I firmly believe that being patient can help a person succeed in many aspects of life. For instance, my mom and I were in the @ORGANIZATION1 drive - thru. The lady in front of us was yelling at the people in the line to go faster, but such behavior is unlikely to speed up the process. My mom has remarkable patience; she can wait for hours without getting frustrated. In contrast, I rarely have patience and can't wait for more than about ten minutes for something. Patience is essential as it is more likely to help get things done. Most of my family members and I don't have the best patience, but we do show it at times. Overall, I think patience is an extremely good quality to possess.
625	18539	7	2	My mom showed patience when I came home late from the park. However, she lost her patience when she took the phone away from me. She has patience for my brother and sister but less for me. Just because I came home @NUM1 minutes late, she said she had more patience for me before that incident, and now she only has a little left. This shows that our actions can affect how others perceive us and how patient they are with us.
626	18540	7	2	During winter, my cousin and I were eager to go outside. My mom kept assuring us that we would be able to go out. My cousin got extremely angry and threw a tantrum. I calmly sat on the couch, relaying what my mom had said. After an hour, I was allowed to go out, but my cousin couldn't because she hadn't been patient. This was a time when I demonstrated patience.
627	18541	7	2	One time, during a hunting trip on a cold @DATE1, I was sitting in a blind with my dad, patiently waiting for a deer. It was almost eight o'clock, and we had been there since @NUM1. We could hear the ducks and geese in the nearby marshland, see the trees swaying in the wind, and smell the fresh grass and morning fog. At @TIME1AM, a doe suddenly appeared. It passed by us cautiously, so I readied my gun. Then, an eight - point buck emerged. I shot it through the heart and lung and later gutted it. In the youth hunt at @DATE2, my patience paid off.
628	18542	7	2	@CAPS5 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 loved playing games with her younger brother @PERSON1 @CAPS2. One day, while playing Sorry with @PERSON1, @PERSON1 took an annoyingly long time on his turn. @CAPS5 got extremely angry at @LOCATION1 for the delay and started screaming. When their @CAPS8 @PERSON2 heard the commotion, she rushed over. With a worried look, she asked @CAPS5 what the screaming was about and hoped @CAPS5 wasn't yelling at @PERSON1. @CAPS5 admitted she was, saying @PERSON1 wouldn't hurry up. @CAPS8 @PERSON2 firmly told @CAPS5 to apologize, stating that @PERSON1 was younger and didn't know better. @CAPS5 tearfully apologized, they hugged, and then continued their game of Sorry patiently.
629	18544	7	2	A time I showed patience was when my sister got her license. When we arrived at the place, she took a ticket from a machine. The ticket showed # @NUM1, and the screen displayed @NUM2. I initially thought the wait would be short, but each person was taking about half an hour, or @NUM3 minutes if we were lucky. We ended up staying there for @NUM4 hours straight. I hope it won't take that long when I get my license.
630	18545	7	2	My name is @PERSON1, and I'm in the @NUM1 grade. Patience is a crucial issue today. It's important to understand that without patience, one won't get far in life. Patience is needed in every aspect of life. If you're not patient, you'll struggle to make friends. Patience helps personal growth. For instance, if you receive a letter saying you must go to the social security office within two days, when you go, you'll get a ticket number and have to sit and wait, perhaps for hours. Leaving won't get you what you need. Another example is going to the doctor when you're sick. You have to wait. What if the doctor asks you to pick up medicine? These examples illustrate the importance of patience.
631	18546	7	2	Patience is akin to being a virtuous individual. When one is patient, positive outcomes are likely to occur. Some patient people experience favorable events such as moving, [unspecified events], and [unspecified events]. However, certain acts of patience may lead to negative consequences. In conclusion, patience can bring both good and bad results, and one should be aware of this duality.
632	18547	7	2	Patience is a skill that is challenging to acquire. It is a mental exercise that is present in everyone's life. Those lacking patience tend to experience more anger. Consider the minors trapped in a mine for two months; they needed patience. College education also demands patience as it spans several years. Patience is ubiquitous, whether one is waiting for a toy or hoping for a divine intervention. It is an enduring quality that will always be relevant.
633	18548	7	2	One time, I demonstrated patience. It was four in the [specific time], and I was sound asleep in bed. The room was completely quiet. Suddenly, I was awakened by the sound of footsteps; it was my dad. Without warning, the bright light in my room flashed on, and I squinted and pulled the blanket over my head. My dad shouted, “It’s time to go, [name]!” I replied, “Okay!” I quickly got out of bed, got dressed, had breakfast, grabbed my bag, and put it in the trunk of my mom’s car. It was the middle of [specific date], and we were on our way to [specific location]. Knowing I had to be patient, I inserted a movie into the [device] player for my brother [brother's name] and me to watch. As it started to get lighter outside, I continued watching movies while everyone else slept, except for my dad, who was driving. When everyone woke up, we stopped for food and gas. I was very patient as I had to wait for everyone to wake up before I could eat. After we ate, we got back in the car and continued our journey. A few hours later, we finally reached [specific location]. I was extremely excited to arrive; I jumped out of the car and shouted, “Finally!” This is the story of how I showed patience.
634	18549	7	2	The [specific time] I was patient was [specific time]. We had to travel to [specific location] to pick something up, and the journey took about [number] [unit] minutes. On the way back, it also took another [number] [unit] minutes. Both trips were rather dull, but I had to remain patient. Just this morning, I had to be patient because my brother was taking a shower, and I wanted to use it. He took about [number] minutes, so I had to wait. [Specific time] [Specific time], we were looking forward to having chocolate milk that my mom was going to make, and we had to be patient for her to prepare it. In conclusion, patience is often required in various situations in our daily lives.
635	18550	7	2	Once, there was a significant project. It was crucial for me to know my grade as it could mean the difference between a [grade 1] and a [grade 2]. I was extremely anxious. I was waiting for the person in charge to announce the grades. When she saw my name and mentioned my grade, I was overjoyed. I was patient while waiting for the grade to be revealed. Eventually, I got the result, and that was the end of my anticipation regarding this important project.
636	18551	7	2	Patience is crucial. Without it, one can easily become angry. Being patient helps in making more friends. Patience consistently leads to positive outcomes. Often, people become impatient while engaged in tasks. Had they been patient, those tasks would have been far easier. In conclusion, cultivating patience is essential for a more harmonious and successful life.
637	18552	7	2	Sometimes, when things take a long time, my family demonstrates patience. My dad must be patient when deployed to a new country, as he has to wait a long time to return and see us. My mom shows patience when her co - workers or others irritate her. My brother is patient as he always awaits something in the mail. My sister is patient while managing me and my brother. My brother and I are patient during our hour - long bus rides with nothing to do. My siblings are patient as they wait for the school year to end. My dad is patient while completing his tasks, despite the whining from my sister and mom. I'm patient to get through the school day, and my brother can be patient when waiting for his computer to load. In conclusion, whether sitting in the office or being deployed abroad, my family is consistently patient.
638	18553	7	2	Have you ever exercised patience? At times, people lose patience over various things. For instance, waiting in line for a roller - coaster can be extremely time - consuming and often leads to impatience. However, having patience is beneficial. It keeps you calm and helps you avoid getting upset over long waits. A patient person has the ability to wait, unlike those who struggle during waiting periods. In conclusion, I firmly believe that patience can sometimes be the key to success in life. If you're impatient, you should try to change because the things you desire will eventually come to you.
639	18554	7	2	It was a lightly breezy morning on [date]. My parents were finishing packing for a trip to [location]. We were going there because my sister had a lacrosse tournament in [another location]. It was going to be a terrifying thirteen - hour journey. We started loading our suitcases into the van. My grandparents were coming with us, which added more stress as they usually stay for [duration]. Just as we were about to leave, I remembered the TV in the van. I ran back into the house, unplugged my [organization] game cable, gathered all the wires and three game controllers, and then rejoined the group. As we left, I started plugging in the wires and controllers. For the first couple of hours, we listened to the radio. Then, the usual squabbling between my brother and sister started as they don't get along well in a crowded space. After [number] hours, we reached [location]. We started seeing wonderful mountains. After [another number] hours, we decided to watch a movie for the last hour, which passed in a flash. Finally, we arrived. It was a time when I had to be somewhat patient.
640	18556	7	2	One time, my [relative] planned a fishing trip to [location]. [Someone] didn't know about it. He told me to pack a suitcase with three days' worth of clothes. When I asked why, he said we were going to [location] the next day with my cousins [person] and Ryan. I was so excited that I rushed to my room, stuffed clothes into my [item], and gathered everything I needed. I asked my [relative] what we'd be doing there, and he said we were going on a fishing trip in the [river] for pike. Recently, I got a new cherrywood fishing pole and a nice underspin reel. So, I prepared my fishing poles, packed my [item], and went to sleep to wake up early. At [time], my alarm went off. I was so tired that I could barely see, but we had to be at my uncle's house at [time], so I got ready. Once we got to my uncle's, we met them and then all left. I wanted to sleep in the car but couldn't. When we reached [location], it was amazing with huge cliffs and hills. We even saw a bear near a river where we stopped. Then we went up - river and found a clear mud hole full of millions of frogs. When we finally arrived, my [relative] made me wait and unpack. After my cousin and I finished unpacking, we went to the store to fish. On my first cast, I caught a little [number] - incher on a [organization] lure. After that, we caught nothing. When it got [condition], we came back and roasted hotdogs over the fire. The next morning, we got up early and fished only on the lake near [location], but caught nothing. That night, we fished on the [river] and still caught nothing. The cabin owner said we should catch [number] or [number] pike, but since it had rained heavily, the fish weren't feeding. The next day, we got up early and fished all day. In the morning, I had one bite but nothing after that. At lunch, we found a [place] to eat. It had a real rock cave, and we scared a bear off the [place]. Later, we went to a little canyon that was hard to climb. I almost fell but got caught on a root. We saw another bear eating berries and video - taped it. We also killed a chipmunk with a [item] rock. Suddenly, a huge pike almost took my pole. I fought it for about ten minutes, but it snapped my line, and I've never seen that pike since. In conclusion, despite the lack of significant catches, the trip was full of adventures and memories.
641	18557	7	2	When I was in around third grade, I had to exercise great patience. I was at a @ORGANIZATION1 game. It was nearly the seventh inning, and I was eager to get onto the field. I had to wait for an extended period. I had already missed about an inning of the game. When I was there, there were approximately @NUM1 people. It was extremely crowded. My mom could have filled three two - gigabyte memory cards during that time. It was incredibly boring. After about twenty minutes, they finally allowed us onto the field. We all walked through the outfield and onto the infield. Most of us were on live TV, and I was one of them. When the game ended, most people walked away sad because the @ORGANIZATION1 lost the game. However, I walked away with a mix of happiness and sadness. I was happy because I got to go onto the field.
642	18558	7	2	Patience varies in its ease among individuals; for some, it is as difficult as dealing with a hard rock, while for others, it comes naturally. Patience is a crucial aspect of hunting. Hunters must be tolerant and understanding, even when situations seem to take a turn for the worse.  One morning, at six o'clock, I woke up and sprang out of bed. I was finally going to shoot my first deer! I put on my camouflage and hunter's orange as my grandpa drove down my long driveway to pick me up. The moonlight was shining brightly, and I was giggling with excitement, but I knew I had to calm down.  As we drove to the hunting location, I was struck by the profound quietness all around. We walked back to the blind on a leaf - covered trail and set everything in place. After dozing off a bit, the morning light began to peek through the trees, illuminating the fresh green field. The water vapor looked like sparkles floating in mid - air. We heard a grouse drum and saw a red squirrel jump out at us, but no deer.  After a long morning of sitting, we decided to pack up. We always had tomorrow. That was the end of our hunt. We had an exciting time, and it was all due to patience. Patience may not always yield the desired results, but it can allow you to witness many different and beautiful things.
643	18559	7	2	@CAPS1's mom once took a test to become a @CAPS2, which stands for certified nursing assistant. After taking the test, she was extremely nervous. She waited and waited for a phone call. It was very difficult for her to be patient on the first day after the test. I understood her feeling because I also get nervous and excited when waiting for test results.  The next day was a bit easier for her; she just went about her normal day. On the third day of waiting, she started to wonder if the call would ever come. Later that day, the phone rang, and a smile spread across her face. She had passed the test. This was a time when @CAPS1's mom showed patience for a full three days.
644	18560	7	2	"Being patient can be extremely challenging, depending on the circumstances. Even I lose my patience sometimes. However, there was one occasion when I was so patient that I felt like I was about to explode.  On a dry @DATE1 day, my family and I decided to embark on an exciting vacation to @ORGANIZATION1. We drove from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 and then headed east towards @ORGANIZATION1. After a boring road trip, we parked our silver minivan in a five - dollar parking lot right next to the @ORGANIZATION1.  First, we went up the @CAPS1 tower, where we had a bird's - eye view of everything from an incredible height. After that, we met our cousins; I had never seen them before. As we were looking at the waterfall, my brother said, ""@CAPS2, look at those boats under the waterfall. Dad, can we go on them?"" ""@CAPS3, but first we have to buy tickets,"" replied my dad.  We bought the tickets and got in line. ""Why are there so many people?"" I asked. There were about @NUM1 people waiting in line with us. ""@CAPS6, be patient,"" my dad said. I stood there, looking at all the people in front of us and thinking we would never get on the boat. I saw people handing out blue rain jackets, but after @NUM2 minutes, we still hadn't received them. We were moving as slowly as the tectonic plates.  Finally, we got a jacket, but we still weren't on the boat. My brother was complaining, and my dad started yelling at him. I was standing there, almost ready to burst. At last, they called us up onto the boat. It was amazing going under the waterfall; we were in the mist. When we came back to shore, we talked about how amazing it was.  Even though it is difficult to be patient, I managed to do it throughout the time we were in line to get on the boat. Patience can be rewarding, and anyone can achieve it."
645	18561	7	2	In third grade, one winter day was one of the happiest days of my life. It was the day we were going to get our dog, @ORGANIZATION1, and I was both excited and very patient.  It was a cold winter day, and I was off to school. I couldn't wait for the school day to end because it was the day we would get @ORGANIZATION1. When I got to school, I couldn't wait to tell everyone about it.  After school ended, my mom picked up my sister and me. We went home and waited patiently for my dad and @ORGANIZATION1 to come home. When we got home, my mom, my two sisters, and I waited patiently in the living room, watching @CAPS1.V and listening for the garage door to open.  Then we heard it open. We all jumped up and down, ran, and screamed as we rushed outside. And there she was, @ORGANIZATION1, the best dog in the world. That's how I was patient on that winter day, waiting for the best dog in the world.
646	18562	7	2	On a normal, uneventful day in the @DATE1, I received a call from my sister - in - law. She simply asked if I wanted to go to Cedar Point the next day. I was utterly astonished and didn't know what to say. At first, I suspected she was hiding nearby, but when she asked to speak to my mom, I realized she was serious. After she finished talking to my mom, my mom was also in shock. I was so grateful that I couldn't fall asleep. I ended up waking up at @NUM1 am, which I wasn't too happy about, but it was definitely worth it. The two - hour drive was long, but once we arrived, we bought our tickets and headed for the Maverick. The line was extremely long, yet we waited. Half - way through the line, the ride broke down. I couldn't believe my eyes as I had always wanted to ride it. We patiently waited for around @NUM2 @NUM3 hours, maybe @NUM4. I was hungry, tired, and baking in the sun. Once the ride reopened, we only had to wait about half an hour. All in all, it was worth it. My sister - in - law, @PERSON1, was very impressed with how patiently I waited. We then went to the car to get some food, which was the best I'd ever eaten. The rest of the day was wonderful, and it was definitely the most patient I've ever been in my life. Since it was just me and @PERSON1, I think that's why I was so calm. Even though that part of the day wasn't great, it was still an overall wonderful time.
647	18563	7	2	This year, my mom married my new step - dad. He wanted us to “bond,” so we took up trap shooting, which is essentially the same as skeet shooting. He used to be a cop and had a shotgun, so we went out to try it. It didn't go well. I missed every single clay target except one. I only managed to get one BB through it. But I was okay with it because I knew it was my first time. Then we tried to hit the target dead - center, and I felt embarrassed. That day, we left with only ten hits and countless misses. I was feeling pretty down. Within the next week, we tried again. He launched the clay target, and it was like watching it in slow - motion. I followed it with the sight at the end of the gun and pulled the trigger. I watched the target explode. Finally, I did it! We launched another one, and I hit it. I got @NUM1 in a row! It was amazing for someone who had missed almost all of them just before. And that's how I showed patience.
648	18564	7	2	One time when I showed patience was when my family and I went to @CAPS1 Point. We go to @CAPS1 Point quite often. Usually, the lines are very long, sometimes over an hour. Once, on my first time on the @CAPS3, the wait was @NUM1 hours, but we still decided to go. We had been waiting for about @NUM2 hour when they had some technical difficulties. After about @NUM3 minutes, the line started moving again. When I finally got to ride it, it was really fun, although it only lasted @NUM4 seconds. A couple of years later, the new ride, The @CAPS4, opened up. It looked really fun, but the line didn't seem appealing. I'm not sure how long we waited, but when we finally got to the end and rode the ride, it was amazing. I'm glad I had enough patience to wait in those long lines.
649	18565	7	2	In my opinion, patience is the quality of being understanding and tolerant. A patient person can endure difficulties without complaining. Unfortunately, most people these days are impatient. Patience is similar to waiting. For instance, when you're stuck in a traffic jam or waiting your turn for something. Patience is one of the most valuable qualities a person can possess. Every year, more and more people become impatient. Society often pressures us to “hurry” or “move faster.” We need to learn to gain patience, perhaps by taking deep breaths or calming ourselves down. I firmly believe that if everyone had patience, the world would be a more peaceful place. There would be no more conflicts, and if that day ever came, everyone's lives would be perfect.
650	18566	7	2	One day, Vincenta, also known as @PERSON3, was walking and saw his friend @PERSON5. “@CAPS3, a - @PERSON3,” said @PERSON5. “@PERSON5, you know to call me @PERSON3,” replied @CAPS4. “@PERSON3, my mom told me to make sure those @CAPS12 beans get to @PERSON1. Would you do it for me?” @PERSON5 asked. “Sure, we in @CAPS21 of @LOCATION2 have each other's backs.” “See you later! I have to go now! Bye!” @PERSON5 said as he ran off. @PERSON3 walked to @PERSON2's house and knocked on the door, but no one answered. Then @PERSON3 walked to @LOCATION1's old, abandoned house. “I know! I'll plant them here!” @PERSON3 dug a hole and planted the beans. @NUM1 minutes later, @PERSON3 was still waiting. “Come on!” @PERSON3 yelled. @PERSON4 was walking and was annoyed by @PERSON3's yelling. “@CAPS4, why are you screaming? You'll wake up my dad!” @PERSON4 exclaimed. “These stupid beans don't grow,” @PERSON3 replied. “If you want to see beans, go to bed. They'll be there in the morning,” @PERSON4 told him. “No! I'm staying here! Eizel will support me on this. Haven't you heard of that ‘@CAPS17’ guy?” “Alright, we'll see you later, @PERSON3.” And @PERSON4 strolled off. The next day, @PERSON5 walked by. “Oh my god! @PERSON3,” @PERSON5 yelled. @PERSON3 woke up and couldn't believe what he saw. The bean stalk had grown over @LOCATION1's two - story house. “You stink!” Suddenly, @PERSON3 woke up. It was a dream. He looked at the spot where he'd planted the beans. “Still nothing!” A day later, @PERSON3 was still waiting, hungry and tired. @PERSON4 came by again. “@PERSON5 doesn't know, does he? Well, @PERSON3, please come inside and forget about the seeds.” “No way!” @PERSON3 screamed. “You're just going to make yourself angry. Go away!” @PERSON3 screamed. After two @DATE1 of waiting, something finally popped up. One plant was alive for @NUM1 minutes and then died. The other was just a car bolt. @PERSON3 had bugs on him for the @DATE1 and was putting them in the air @NUM3. Then @PERSON3 asked himself, “Was it worth it?” Well, yes, for a friend.

One of the most challenging experiences of my life was waiting in line for three and a half hours to ride the dragster at Cedar Point. It was a sweltering and humid day, and the park was teeming with people. Flies were everywhere, tickling legs, buzzing in ears, and even biting. The screams of thrill - seekers could be heard from a great distance. Overweight individuals in shorts and tank - tops were munching on popcorn. I had ridden every other ride at the park except for the dragster. The dragster is an exhilarating ride that takes you to the very top and then shoots you down at bullet - like speed. The catch was that if you wanted to be in the first cart, as I did, you had to endure a three - and - a - half - hour wait. ""I can just go ride the skyscraper again,"" I pleaded. But I was quickly rebuked with, ""You came all the way to Cedar Point; you're not leaving without riding the best and most fun ride! You're going to stand in this line and wait."" I grumbled, ""I never get what I want, do I!"" The response was, ""You get everything you want. You can go ride the skyscraper again if you like, but I'm staying here. And I feel sorry for whoever has to sit next to you because you'll probably give them bruises and scratches all over their arms, and you might even burst their eardrums with your screaming!"" I retorted, ""Well, I might do that to you!"" By the time our argument ended, there were only twenty minutes left in the wait. We didn't get the front cart, but in the end, the wait wasn't as bad as I had anticipated."
652	18569	7	2	There was a time when I demonstrated patience by assisting a classmate with a science project. The classmate was completely lost and made numerous mistakes, such as placing things in the wrong positions and writing non - scientific content. Moreover, he often didn't listen. To make matters worse, he lost all of our hard - work. But I didn't lose my cool and instead helped him start over, being extremely patient throughout. After three days of hard work, we were nearly finished. Once he put the final touches on the project and presented it, he received an A+. This achievement made me feel great, as my patience and hard work had paid off. In conclusion, being patient not only makes you feel good but also benefits the person you are helping. This experience was a testament to the power of patience.
653	18570	7	2	"In the land of Narrative, a place filled with loving and patient people, there was a little girl named Kerry. Unlike other children in the land, Kerry was impatient. She was an only child living with her mother, [Mother's Name], and her father, [Father's Name]. Kerry hated being the only child, so her mother suggested to her father that they have another child. When they told Kerry that she would soon have a little brother or sister, she was overjoyed. She ran upstairs to come up with baby names and then rushed downstairs to share them with her mother, who was sitting in a chair. Her father, on his way to the dinner table where Kerry and her mother were sitting, said, ""I like Kuven."" Kerry then asked, ""Do you like [Name 1], [Name 2], [Location], [Name 3], [Name 4], or [Name 5]?"" Her father replied that he liked [Name 6], and her mother also agreed as she headed up to her bedroom. Kerry said on her way up the stairs, ""I can't wait till the baby gets here."" The next morning, Kerry woke up early to check if her mother had the baby. Her father told her that the baby needed to grow inside her mother. Several months later, Kerry woke up early again, shouting, ""Is the baby here?"" Her mother told her to be patient. Kerry got frustrated and said, ""That baby will never come. I hate it. I'll be lonely forever."" Her father shouted from another room, ""Be patient; the baby will come."" Finally, an hour later, her mother screamed from her bedroom. Kerry rushed in and learned that it was a girl. She was extremely happy. This story shows that patience is often rewarded, and in the end, Kerry got the sibling she had longed for."
654	18571	7	2	I've had several experiences where I've shown patience. One instance was when my grandma had surgery. We waited for three hours in the hospital. During that time, I played chess with my aunt, had conversations, visited the gift shop, and even went to the mall. Another time was when the teacher assigned homework, and I didn't understand a part of it. Since the teacher was helping another student, I waited. I skipped that part and came back to it later when the teacher was available. With the teacher's help, I was able to understand the homework. There was also a time when my mom took me to her workplace after school to avoid leaving me alone at home. While waiting, I mopped the floor, rested my head on the table, talked with some employees, and passed the time by walking back and forth. These stories illustrate that patience is an important quality that can be exercised in various situations, and it often leads to positive outcomes.
655	18572	7	2	"There was a time when [Name]'s dad displayed remarkable patience. He had an important meeting with his boss, but the boss was late. So, [Name]'s dad sat down and waited. After waiting for [Number] hours, the boss finally arrived and said, ""[Boss's statement] You have to wait for another hour because I need to talk to your wife as she says she really needs to speak with me."" [Name]'s dad replied, ""[Response] but hurry!"" After another hour passed, the boss returned and told [Name]'s dad, ""[Apology] for making you wait."" Finally, the meeting was over. When [Name] asked his dad what took so long, his dad simply said, ""Be patient."" This was the time when [Name]'s dad truly demonstrated patience, showing that waiting calmly in difficult situations can lead to successful outcomes."
656	18573	7	2	One day, I went to the store with my mother. After that, we had to pick up my big brother from basketball practice. When we arrived, he wasn't outside. My mother called his phone multiple times, but he didn't answer. She kept calling and then said we would wait until he came out. This is what I consider patience.
657	18574	7	2	"There was a cold day on @DATE1 when I was at school. Our regular teacher was very sick, so we had a substitute who was quite mean. Suddenly, a kid started breathing heavily as he needed his inhaler. I informed the substitute, but he refused to let the kid get it. The person next to me also made the same request, and she patiently accepted the substitute's initial refusal with an ""okay"". Eventually, the substitute allowed the kid to go. This was an instance when someone I knew demonstrated patience."
658	18575	7	2	"I was supposed to be patient while waiting for my football game. It was @DATE1 at @TIME1. I went to gather my shoulder pads, helmet, and football pants. We woke up early thinking we'd be the first ones there, but I was wrong. There were about @NUM1 people already there. I started freaking out and told my mom, ""You said we'd be early and the first ones here."" She was completely wrong. I was mad at her as we ended up being the last in line. All the good helmets were gone. Mom told me to be patient like the other parents. I tried, but it didn't work well. I was impatient, yelling things like ""Come on, we don't have all day to sit around."" When I got to the place, I said something out loud and the people in charge of the football equipment got mad at me. I hoped they'd have my size, but they didn't. I was really mad, and they told me to come back tomorrow for my size. In the end, I was a bit more patient, but at the beginning, I was yelling. This shows that if you're not patient, you probably won't get what you've been waiting for all day."
659	18576	7	2	"I love the Twilight books, and now that there's a movie, I was eager to see it. My mom and I were on our way to the movie theater, and I couldn't stop talking about it. When we drove into the parking lot, there was nowhere to park. My mom was about to leave, but I said, ""There's one spot, mom."" She replied, ""Sweet."" We had been waiting to see this vampire - themed movie for three months. Once we entered the building, we rushed to get tickets and food. The movie was set to start at @NUM1. I almost said something out of impatience but managed to calm myself and be patient for three straight hours. We took funny pictures and did random things to pass the time. It actually worked. The security staff announced it was time for trivia. They asked a bunch of questions about the previous movie. I raised my hand and answered a question correctly. I got to choose between a free popcorn and a pin, and I picked the pin. I was extremely excited as the movie was about to start. After the movie ended, my mom and I went home and fell asleep right away. This was my experience of using patience."
660	18577	7	2	"My phone in my pocket buzzes. It's Lexa, @CAPS2. I'm still struggling to get over the fight we had yesterday when she called me names. I once answered and told her I needed some time and for her to be patient, but she clearly isn't listening. So, I decide to call her back. She picks up on the first ring. ""Are you there?"" she asks, sounding desperate to use the nickname she always calls me. I reply, ""Yes."" Then she says, ""I'm so, so, so sorry. I didn't mean it."" I say, almost in tears, ""I told you I needed time and for you to be patient."" She responds, ""I know, but I can't be patient when I've hurt my best friend."" I explain, ""Patience means being understanding and tolerant while waiting without complaining."" She says something (@CAPS4), and I tell her, ""If you try to be patient, you wouldn't be complaining."" She says something else (@CAPS6) and then hangs up. I'm really mad that she thinks everything will be okay just like that. She should have waited. If only she'd been patient."
661	18578	7	2	“Can we watch @ORGANIZATION1?” I glanced at the clock. It was five - thirty. “You'll have to wait,” I stated. “@CAPS3 doesn't come on until eight.” “@CAPS1 I wanna watch @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 z @ORGANIZATION1.” Not again, I thought. Must we go through this daily? Why can't I... I slowly made my way to my room, aware that I'd have to endure @CAPS2 until eight o'clock. “@CAPS2 quiet.” I was starting to get angry. “@CAPS3 doesn't come on until eight, okay.”
662	18579	7	2	I'm not a patient person. Whether it's waiting for dinner or a friend, patience eludes me. The sole exception is when I'm anticipating the start of school. I can wait for hours, days, weeks, months, or even years. On the other hand, waiting for a friend to call is torture for me as I'm always eager to be active. I'll dash around the house for hours until the phone rings. When it does, I'll rush to answer it immediately. I'll even sit and stare at the phone, waiting. Another situation where I can “be patient” is when waiting for my mom to tell me to clean my room. I'll leave the house and avoid coming back until bedtime to dodge the chore. In conclusion, my patience is highly selective.
663	18580	7	2	At Cedar Point, my cousin and I were in line for a ride. The line took about @NUM1 hours. My cousin remained silent and patient throughout. I, however, was extremely impatient. I tapped my feet, ran around, and was on the verge of boredom - induced madness. My legs ached, I was hungry, and it was swelteringly hot. I just couldn't stand it. She stood there quietly. When the line started moving, I perked up a bit but was still impatient. After @NUM1 hours, we finally got on the ride. Afterward, I asked my cousin why she was so silent. She said her mom had decreed that each word we spoke would earn us a minute of homework upon returning to @LOCATION1. I ended up doing homework for the whole next week. This experience taught me the value of patience.
664	18581	7	2	In my view, patience means not complaining in tough situations. People vary in their levels of patience. I consider myself somewhat patient. One instance when I had to be patient was during a fourteen - hour family drive to @LOCATION1. It was far from enjoyable. A major annoyance was the need to use the restroom. Once the freedom to go at will was restricted, the urge intensified. But I kept telling myself to be patient and that we'd stop at the next place. Hunger and thirst were also constant issues. We only stopped three times, and the food we got was never enough. All the while, I just wanted to reach our destination and enjoy the sandy beaches and waves. It seemed like we'd never get there. When we finally did, I realized the trip was a test of patience, and I passed. In fact, the return trip was even worse.
665	18582	7	2	One day, I went to the hospital. The nurses gave me an IV, a CAT scan, and did something to my arm that hurt. Despite the pain, I was patient. When getting the CAT scan, I was reluctant but did it patiently. When they inserted the IV, they missed the vein, ripped it out, and put it in the other arm. I endured the pain patiently. I started at @NUM1 o'clock am and finished at @NUM1 o'clock pm. There was a large piece of tape on my arm for @NUM3 hours. When the nurse said we could go home and that I could remove the tape, I started pulling it off piece by piece. Then the nurse took over and said “@NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6” as she yanked it off. It hurt terribly, but I was patient and didn't cry. This shows that I was patient despite being in pain all day.
666	18583	7	2	I remained patient when my father promised to get me some @CAPS1. They were @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, and the shoes cost @MONEY1. I inquired several times, but he didn't respond. So, I knew what I had to do. I decided to do the dishes and clean my room. I was so eager for those shoes that I even cleaned things that were already clean. After a month of cleaning, I still hadn't received the shoes. That's when things went awry. SCHOOL! I hadn't been behaving well at school. I pulled myself together and then got the @CAPS4.
667	18584	7	2	Have you ever experienced the joy of waiting for something, only to realize that the wait was truly worthwhile once it finally arrives? I certainly have! Sometimes, the wait can be excruciatingly long, and patience becomes essential. Patience is a virtue that I've had to rely on numerous times, and recently, I used it while awaiting the birth of my baby cousin @CAPS1. I endured a long wait of @NUM1 weeks! I was so excited that I could barely contain myself. Just yesterday, she was born, and the long - awaited moment has finally arrived. Although the wait for her birth is over, I still need to be patient to see her, but it won't be long, just until I finish school. I marked each day on my calendar, constantly telling myself that she would be here soon. As the days passed, it felt like time was standing still. I kept asking my mom how many more days were left; it was pure torture. As the due date neared, my excitement grew. She received a lot of clothes from friends and family. I had to be even more patient to see her in those clothes and to hold her. Thankfully, I'll be the first cousin to hold her. Now that she's here, I can stop counting down the days, see her in her new outfits, and stop bothering my mom. In conclusion, patience pays off; the wait makes the outcome even more rewarding.
668	18586	7	2	Patience is a valuable trait in a person. True patience means waiting without complaint. It is not patience when people claim to be waiting but constantly grumble about it. Patience involves waiting kindly and calmly. Losing one's patience easily is not a good quality. It is polite when someone waits for you, such as when you're on the phone or using the internet. Although I can't provide a precise definition, I believe patience means waiting quietly for someone, even when you're in a hurry. In essence, patience is an important quality that enriches our social interactions and personal experiences.
669	18587	7	2	"Oh, when I turn seven, I'll be able to go on the ""hoder hunt""! Alex said, ""Is this adventure place always this crowded?"" As I stood in line to go on the ride, I got very impatient. My brother told me to calm down, saying we were halfway through the line. I replied that I couldn't stand it because the line was so long. He advised me to talk to the people in front to pass the time. I followed his advice. When we finally reached the ride, I was really excited. I thanked my brother for the tip. I managed to find a way to be patient with the help of my brother. This experience taught me the value of patience and the importance of my brother's advice."
670	18588	7	2	"Patience is a characteristic that not everyone possesses easily. Some people, like my older brother, are very patient. I remember one night when I was supposed to stay at my aunt and uncle's, @PERSON2 and @PERSON4. I've always had a hard time staying away from home because I get homesick and cry. That night was no different. @PERSON3, @PERSON6, and I were playing games in their room. But I couldn't stop thinking about my mom. I kept telling myself to be strong, and for a while, I managed to forget about her. But then the feeling of homesickness returned. I tried to think about the fun I'd have the next day if I stayed, but it was no use. Tears flowed like @CAPS1. I sniffled and said I wanted to go home. I ran downstairs to tell my older cousin @PERSON1, who was babysitting. @CAPS3 opened the door and took me upstairs to get the phone. When my mom answered, she sounded grouchy and said ""@CAPS2"". I told her I missed her and wanted to come home. She said someone would pick me up soon and to be ready. @CAPS3 hung up the phone. I told @PERSON3 and @PERSON6 sadly as I packed my things and waited on the bench by the door. Soon, @PERSON5's car pulled up and honked. I said goodbye and got in the car. @PERSON5 asked calmly if I didn't want to stay, and I said I didn't know. When I got home, I knew I'd be punished for not being able to stay the night; I wouldn't be allowed to stay away from home for a couple of weeks. This experience shows that I still need to learn more about patience and dealing with homesickness."
671	18590	7	2	Throughout my life, I've had to exercise patience on multiple occasions. When I was about five years old, my brother, @CAPS1, broke his eardrum. I waited with him in the waiting room for X - rays, all while also waiting to go on stage. It was winter, and I was in my pajamas. The wait felt interminable. I was both bored and worried sick about my brother. In @NUM1 grade, I injured my wrist by hitting it in a door and a wall. I spent @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours in the emergency room. The medical staff did an excellent job. My mom and I were stuck watching @CAPS4 @CAPS5 on the TV in the waiting room. It was freezing cold, and I had @CAPS6 on my wrist. Finally, for my @NUM1 grade concert, I waited to go on stage. I was extremely nervous, and my anxiety kept building. I waited for @NUM5 minutes, but it felt like @NUM5 years. Sitting next to my friend helped a little. When we finally got on stage, I sang with all my heart and was glad I'd been patient. I'm not naturally good at being patient, but in these instances, I waited and achieved positive outcomes. Patience, it seems, can truly pay off.
672	18591	7	2	Have you ever had to be patient? I certainly have, especially one significant time in my life: when I was waiting for my dog, @CAPS1 Mae, to have her puppies. @CAPS1 is a three - year - old full - blooded Pitbull. It all began when we took @CAPS1 to the @CAPS6 for an early check - up. The @CAPS6 said she was fine, then pulled my mom aside. My heart started pounding because when they do that, it usually means something bad. But my mom started screaming with joy. I ran to her, and she shouted, “@CAPS3 is going to have babies!” I joined her in the excitement. We went to get Dixixe and then took @CAPS1 to the bark play. That night, she got a steak for supper. The next few months seemed to fly by. As @CAPS1 got bigger, the @CAPS6 said it would be at least six months until she had the puppies. It was already five and a half months, and my mom said @CAPS1 had milk. I told my sister, @DATE1, and she wasn't surprised. Then we took @CAPS1 inside for the night. The next day, as I was getting ready for school, my mom said the @CAPS6 wouldn't be surprised if @CAPS1 had her puppies that day. I told her not to rush @CAPS1 as she was going through a lot. I then went to the bus stop. The bus ride, which usually takes an hour, felt like only thirty minutes that day. When I got home, my mom said @CAPS3 was having her babies. We ran into the garage. @CAPS1 was lying on a blanket. I rushed to her, and she licked my hand. I assured her everything would be okay. I went inside to get her water and soft food. When I came back, she already had two puppies. It took about an hour for the next two and another hour for the last two. All the puppies were girls. Now, we have eight dogs at home: the mom, @CAPS1 Mae, the @CAPS12 @CAPS13, and the eight little girl puppies named Cutie, Bootsier, Tinker, Bella, Harmony, and Melony. I truly love my dogs!
673	18592	7	2	On @DATE1, which was my birthday, we went to get a cake. I wanted an ice - cream cake. There were over @NUM1 people there. I didn't have much patience, but my mom did. It was a playground night, so I went to play. While I was playing, my mom got the cake. Then she came to get me, and we went home to celebrate my birthday. Even though I was impatient at first, in the end, I got to enjoy my birthday with a delicious ice - cream cake.
674	18593	7	2	Patience can indeed lead to rewards, as @PERSON4 the brown bear discovered on @DATE1 when he was in line to get an autograph from @PERSON1. Despite being extremely frustrated, he remained calm and focused on meeting @PERSON3. One day, @PERSON4 saw a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 headline in a newspaper. He put @NUM1 in the newspaper machine, but when he tried to get a paper, it was jammed. He went into the gas station to tell the staff, but no one was there. He rang the bell, but nobody came. He tried to be as patient as possible and went to a different store to get the newspaper. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 headline revealed that his favorite star, @PERSON2, was going to be in town. @PERSON4 rushed to Buggle Town and saw a line that was @NUM2 long. He was incredibly excited to see @PERSON3. @PERSON4 joined the line at @TIME2. After @NUM3 hours, @PERSON3 had only done @NUM4 autographs. It was clear it would be a long day. At @NUM5 p.m., @PERSON4 bought a hot dog and a soda from a sidewalk food stand. He was still the last person in line, and his patience started to wear thin. At @TIME3, there were only @NUM6 people left in line, including @PERSON4. Finally, at @TIME4, he reached @PERSON3. @PERSON3 and her crew informed @PERSON4 that he had won the patience contest. He was awarded tickets to her concert, her phone number, and a date with her. @PERSON4 was on the verge of losing his cool at @TIME1 but was glad he'd held on. He was overjoyed that he'd been patient for five hours. Eventually, @PERSON4 became @PERSON3's boyfriend. This experience taught @PERSON4 that patience can bring remarkable rewards in the end.
675	18594	7	2	There have been times in my life when I've had to be patient. There are numerous situations where I can be @CAPS1 patient when I'm not in a rush to complete something. I'd like to share a true story about one such time. On my first day of school, we were having a great time with a lot of classmates, but we also had some work to do. When it was time to start the work, some of my classmates were impatient. I looked around the bright classroom and thought about how I should be patient. I told myself, “@CAPS1, I need to take my time so I can get a good grade.” And I was patient. The next day, I was eager to see my grade on that work. It was a fun day, and I realized that by being patient and taking my time, I was more likely to achieve a better result. This experience taught me the value of patience in my schoolwork and in life.
676	18595	7	2	I went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and there I demonstrated patience. I patiently waited for an hour and a half to get on the roller - coaster. When it was time to get something to eat, I waited patiently as well. Also, whenever I wanted to get on any of the rides, I was patient. This was a time when I showed patience.
677	18596	7	2	Last @DATE1, my friend @CAPS1 took me to Cedar Point in @LOCATION1. The place was extremely crowded; it took five minutes to walk from the car to the entrance. Once inside, the park looked amazing, almost like a dream. There was even a ride that could take you from one part of the park to another. The first ride we chose was the @ORGANIZATION1. We waited for about ten minutes, and then it started to get boring. After almost fifteen minutes, we were still far from the ride. We waited for another ten minutes, and the line started moving a bit faster. Finally, it was our turn. We got a yellow car, and the excitement was palpable. After being strapped in, the attendant said “go!”, and we took off like a bird. In conclusion, being patient was truly worth it.
678	18597	7	2	Have you ever been a patient at the @CAPS1's office? Let me share a time when I was. I was really sick and in a lot of pain, so I cried for an hour straight. My mom then took me to the hospital where she works. As soon as I got out of the car, I stopped crying. I told my mom, but she said I still had to see the @CAPS1. When we entered, we saw a man being rushed to the @LOCATION1. We went to the waiting room, and all the seats were occupied. When @CAPS1 @PERSON1 came out, she called in a man and his son, which gave us two seats. After about @CAPS2 minutes, she called us into a medical room. I was really scared during the examination, fearing I had pneumonia or a bad virus. When she came out of her office, I was holding my mom's hand. She approached us with a piece of paper. My mom asked what was wrong with me, and luckily, she said I only had a cold and an ear infection. After leaving the patient room, my mom paid about @NUM1. Then we went to the pharmacy. It was so crowded that I felt squished. At the counter, my mom got my medicine and a big lollipop. When I got home, I took the medicine and went to bed. The next day, around @TIME1, I got to have the lollipop. This was a time when I showed patience.
679	18598	7	2	One day, @CAPS1 was ordering a dress, a pair of shoes, and something else. When she was placing the order, there was an issue; it seemed the items had not yet arrived. @CAPS1 said, “No thank you, I know it will arrive.” Over the next @NUM1 months, the situation with the dress was pending. Then the magazine company called and apologized for the late arrival, saying they would offer the dress for free and thanked @CAPS1 for her patience. After that, @CAPS1 ordered two more dresses, and they arrived the very next day. She was still happy with the outcome.
680	18599	7	2	I'm not a patient person. I hate waiting for anything and often complain about difficulties, whether it's related to myself or others. I play volleyball for my school team, and there are a few girls on the team who really test my patience. I'm sure the other girls on the team feel the same way. These girls are nice, but volleyball is a struggle for them. One girl doesn't even try during practice. She even said she'd skip a few practices, and her attitude was so annoying. Another girl tries hard, but she's boring, controlling, and thinks she knows everything about volleyball. She's only made one over - hand serve in years of playing but acts like she can do it every time. She can rarely serve underhand! And then there's this other girl. She was probably the worst player on the team, and now that she's broken her pinky finger and hasn't played in about three weeks, she might be even worse. But she still goes to all our games, tries to act cool, and fails miserably. It's kind of funny. I know these girls need a lot of practice, and improvement won't happen overnight. So, I guess I'll have to put up with them and be more patient.
681	18600	7	2	"I'm naturally an impatient person, and patience rarely shows up in my life. Yet, I'll share a time when I managed to be patient. ""You can do it this time,"" I told myself as I stared at the net, which was the main obstacle. If it were shorter, I'd easily get my volleyball serve over. I balanced the white ball in my palm, lowered my left arm, then quickly raised it, sending the ball high above my head. I thrust my hand forward. Thwap! I hit the ball, but it crashed into the net. ""Come on,"" I thought. ""You've got this!"" My whole team was watching me. I bounced the ball twice, spun it once in my hand, and forced myself not to look at the crowd. I struck the ball again, and it flew over the net, landing right in the middle of the court. Since I was patient and didn't give up, I reached my goal. This experience taught me that patience leads to victory."
682	18601	7	2	Patience is something that requires effort, and I don't have much of it. I really dislike waiting; it's not enjoyable at all. Time seems to drag when I'm being patient, and five minutes can feel like twenty. Waiting for a package is the worst. You wait and wait, then forget about it, and suddenly it arrives. One day, I was eager to visit my friend. It felt like ages since I'd seen her, though it had only been about ten months. I missed her terribly. We'd been planning this for weeks, and finally, the day had come. I was just waiting for my dad to drive me there, and he took forever. Finally, we got in the car. We waited for five minutes, then he started the engine and drove off. I swear we stopped at every red light on the way to my friend's house and got stuck behind the slowest drivers, which made it even worse. When we finally arrived, I jumped out of the truck. My friend ran through the door and down the stairs, almost tripping on each step. She practically leaped on me, and we hugged for about five minutes. That's why I'm not a patient person.
683	18602	7	2	My story is about a time when I had to be patient. One day, I was super excited because it was Halloween, and my friends and I were going trick - or - treating. I was so impatient for the clock to strike 12 pm because my best friend, Sarah, was going to pick me up in her pink convertible, and we'd go out. It was only 9 am, so I decided to do my chores, thinking time would pass quickly. Instead of putting dish soap in the dishwasher, I put grapes in it. When the cycle was done and I emptied the dishwasher, all the dishes smelled like grapes. I looked at the clock, and it was only 9:30. Then I remembered that my favorite movie was on, so I ran to my room but ended up running into the wall and getting knocked out. After two hours, I was fine. I told my mom I'd be patient because I didn't want any more accidents. On the bright side, I told myself I only had 1 hour and 30 minutes to go. So I went to my room and watched some TV until 11:20. I had an hour to get ready. First, I went to the kitchen, put all the grape - smelling dishes in the dishwasher, and washed them properly. Then I put on my costume. I was a bumblebee. After that, I did my makeup, and I looked really cool. Finally, the clock turned to 12. Suddenly, I heard a horn. Sarah was here. I got in the car, and we went to pick up Cate. Sarah was a ladybug, and Cate was a witch. Then we went trick - or - treating. That's a time when I was patient.
684	18603	7	2	I remember just a few days ago, my mother had to get her tooth checked. While she was at the dentist, I read a book. Even though it took a long time, I managed to finish my 30 - minute homework. When my mom came back and we got up to leave, my feet were numb. As a reward for my patience, we got ice cream. This shows that if you're patient, you can be rewarded.
685	18604	7	2	"I have to admit that there are moments when I lack patience. However, I clearly recall the day I learned the true meaning of patience. I was 7 years old and going for my annual check - up at the doctor's office. It was around 9 am on a Tuesday morning. I was in the waiting room with my mother when an elderly man came in. He looked extremely ill, and I was really scared. The woman at the front desk approached us and said there would be a wait. She explained that the man was very sick and might be dying. My mother told me to be patient, but I didn't understand what that meant, so she explained it. She said, ""You have to wait quietly and not complain, no matter how long it takes."" I told her I could do it, and I did. Patience is very important to me. I believe it's not just for one's own sake but also shows consideration for others. Complaining about having to wait is disrespectful to others. Since other people are patient for me, I should be patient for them too."
686	18605	7	2	On a @DATE1 at @TIME1, I needed help with my math homework. However, the teacher was assisting another student. So, I began to wait. After five minutes, they were still not finished, and I decided to skip that problem. Ten minutes passed, and they were still occupied. I continued to wait patiently. Finally, they finished, and it had only been two minutes. I thought I'd give the problem another try, and if I still couldn't solve it, I'd ask the teacher the next day. While attempting to figure it out, it just didn't make sense, so I waited until the next day. In class the following day, I asked the teacher about it, and she said we didn't have to do that problem. I laughed and told her I'd spent all of yesterday trying to figure it out. This is an example of being patient.
687	18606	7	2	One day, I spent @NUM1 days at my best friend's house and then went to school with her. All my clothes and shoes were still at her place. After school, I went out to eat, so I couldn't retrieve my clothes. I was extremely angry because I'd left my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 shoes there. I called my friend and asked her to bring them to school. The next day, I was really looking forward to getting them back. I comforted her about it, but she said she'd forgotten. I gave her until @DATE1, but she still didn't return them. This was in the month of @DATE3, and I was very patient with her. I finally got my shoes back in the month of @DATE2. When she finally returned them, they were worn - out and dirty. But I realized she's a good friend, and I'm a patient person, so I'm still friends with her.
688	18607	7	2	I demonstrated patience when I had to go to the eye doctor. I was in a rush as I was running late. It was @NUM1, and @CAPS1's appointment was at @TIME1. I was at least @NUM2 minutes away from the clinic. When we arrived, it was basically @NUM3, so I missed @CAPS1's appointment. @CAPS1's mother and I had to wait in the waiting room until all the patients with prior appointments were finished. We waited for at least an hour and a half. While waiting patiently, I talked on the phone, browsed the internet, and listened to music until they called @CAPS1's name. In conclusion, this was a time when I showed patience.
689	18608	7	2	"At @LOCATION1, my friend said, ""Sit down. You don't need to be moving around like a fly on the wall."" I sat down, but I was anxious to get up and move again. I said, ""There are too many people here. We're never getting in."" The line for the driving test was extremely long. I thought about getting up and moving around because I'm not a very patient person. But my friend found it annoying and awkward. I said, ""@LOCATION1, I wonder if they had a vending machine here."" I replied, ""I doubt it."" @CAPS3 glanced at me, and I turned away. I got up and walked away. When I came back @TIME1, @CAPS3 was gone. I sat down, talked on the phone for a while, and then sat there looking at everyone, wondering who to talk to because I was bored. I really wanted to get up and move, but I saw @CAPS10 walking in a circle, and @CAPS4 had left. I sat and waited. @NUM2 @TIME1 passed, and it was getting close to @NUM3 p.m. @CAPS1 was @CAPS5 @NUM4, and I'm @NUM5, so I knew I was next. I thought to myself, ""@CAPS5 @NUM5, your next. Finally!"" I got up and walked to the teller. The teller said, ""Thank you for your patience. Now, how can I help you?"" I looked at her and said, ""I would like a driving test, please."" When I got my paper to go in, I initially thought I wasn't patient because it seemed like I'd been there for ages. But then I thought again and realized I was patient. It was probably @CAPS3's absence that made me impatient as I had no one to chat with. In the end, I was patient, even though it was the longest I'd ever been patient. I was so ready to leave. The driver - ad teacher said, ""What was the wait like?"" I felt patient enough to have been there for about @NUM7 hours. This is a time when I didn't realize I was patient until later."
690	18609	7	2	Patience involves waiting for something without complaining. A patient person waits for an event or an outcome without expressing discontent. If one starts to complain while waiting, it indicates a lack of patience. Not having patience is not a positive trait. Some people have absolutely no patience, which can be detrimental. When faced with an important situation that requires waiting, a person without patience may encounter problems. On the other hand, some people have good patience, but even they may sometimes complain. In essence, this is what patience is all about.
691	18610	7	2	One instance when I had to exercise patience was during a visit to the doctor's office. The clock on the wall ticked steadily as its hands went round and round. The waiting was incredibly boring. To pass the time, I recited the alphabet both forwards and backwards. Each time a doctor emerged from the inner rooms, they didn't call my name. I just sat there, with nothing to do. I attempted to fall asleep, but that didn't work. Then I tried watching TV, yet the only channels available were @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. Finally, after two long hours, they called me in.
692	18611	7	2	A time when my mom and I had to be patient was on her birthday when we had to sit and wait for her to get her tags. It all began that morning. We woke up, had breakfast, took showers, got dressed, did our hair, and brushed our teeth. By the time we finished all that, it was about @NUM1. After that, we left. We spent some time in transit and finally arrived at @CAPS1 at @NUM2. Both of us were hungry, so we stopped at a fast - food place (presumably a burger king - like place). That was the day I had to exercise patience.
693	18612	7	2	Previously, when I had to go to the doctor, I had to wait forty minutes. So, I played my @CAPS1. I was playing Mario Kart. After a while, I got bored and just fell asleep. My mom woke me up when it was time for my appointment. We went in, completed my appointment, and then went home. After that, we had to wait twenty minutes for my dad to get home from work.
694	18613	7	2	Last month, I had to get a root canal. I was extremely nervous. When I arrived at the dentist's office, I was half - scared to death at the thought of the pain. There were two people ahead of me, so I had to wait, which only made me more frightened. Eventually, it was my turn to go with the dentist. I remained patient throughout the entire process. After it was over, I was fine; it didn't even hurt. When I got home, I fell asleep. However, I woke up in pain; my tooth felt like it was on fire. But I never complained. When my mom was trying to quickly get my medicine, I didn't yell at her to hurry or cry. This was the time when I showed patience.
695	18614	7	2	This story is about how I've been patient while waiting for my birthday, which is in three days. I've been patient because I'm eager to see what I'll get for my birthday, even though the anticipation is really bugging me. I'm also being patient because I'm having a sleepover with all my close friends. It feels like the time is passing so slowly. At the sleepover, there'll be cake and ice cream! I'm really looking forward to it. I've also been patient because I'm turning twelve, and I think being twelve means being more patient. The day after the sleepover, my mom, my brother, and I are going to the mall and then to the movies, and I'll get a hundred dollars to spend at the mall. It's really hard to be patient when there are so many fun things ahead. I've also shown patience by not constantly asking everyone if they're coming to the sleepover. Some girls forget to ask their parents, and it's frustrating as there are only two days left. This story shows how I've been patient waiting for my birthday in three days. I've recently learned that you have to be patient to enjoy fun things.
696	18615	7	2	When I was a child, my mother and I went to @ORGANIZATION1. I was finally tall enough to ride the newest @CAPS1 @CAPS2. As we approached the queue, we were taken aback by the large number of people. The line seemed interminable, stretching as far as the eye could see. My mother asked if I wanted to wait in the long line or come back when there were fewer people. This was the moment I had been anticipating, so I decided to persevere. We patiently waited in the line, which felt like an eternity. Finally, after what seemed like ages, we reached the top. The ride down was exhilarating, and I knew that the wait had been worthwhile. I will always cherish the memories of that day and the sense of achievement that came with being patient.
697	18616	7	2	One night, I was awakened by the buzzing of my phone. I groggily got up and checked it to find @NUM1 missed calls, all from my dad. Instantly, I sensed that something was amiss. When I called him back, he told me to get ready because he was coming to pick me up to go to the hospital. I was shocked and thought he was joking, as it was @NUM3 @CAPS5. But then he said that @PERSON2 had been in a serious car accident. My heart sank, and I started crying. He told me to gather my things and that he would call back with more information. I told my aunt what had happened and began packing my stuff quietly, trying not to wake anyone else. As I waited for the call, my mind raced with thoughts and fears. When I finally got the call, I bombarded my dad with questions. He told me to calm down and that @PERSON1 would be there to take care of me. I assured him that I would stay with @PERSON1 and told him that I loved him. The wait for @PERSON1 was excruciating, but I knew I had to be patient. When I finally got in the car, I asked my grandma a flurry of questions. All I could do was hope and pray that @PERSON2 would be okay. This was one of the most difficult times in my life, but it taught me the importance of patience and the strength of family bonds.
698	18617	7	2	On @DATE1, my dad and I went hunting in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1. We settled into our stands overlooking a @NUM1 - yard bean field. Within @NUM2 hours, two does appeared from our left and started approaching @CAPS2. I was on the verge of drawing my bow when I noticed my dad waiting for @CAPS2 to take a shot. Then, in the forest corner of the field, I spotted a large six - point buck standing motionless. I decided to exercise patience and see if the buck would come closer. A deer moved into my blind spot, and I worried it might leave, just like a buck last year. I waited for @NUM3 minutes. Just when I thought it had gone, I saw it again, coming straight towards us. It got closer, reaching @NUM4, then @NUM5, and finally @NUM6 before stopping. I looked at my dad and nodded to signal him to shoot. He understood, drew back his bow, and released the arrow. The arrow hit the deer, and at that moment, I knew that our patience had paid off. We would have a delicious meal and a celebration to honor this successful hunting day.
699	18618	7	2	It was a bright and sunny day, and I was engrossed in playing with my play - dough. After an hour of painstaking work, I finally completed my tower. I stood back and stared at it in awe, feeling an overwhelming sense of pride. I took a piece of play - dough, shaped it into the “@CAPS1,” and placed it on top of the tower. However, my moment of pride was short - lived. Suddenly, @CAPS2! I looked up to see that my tower had been destroyed by my neighbor. When I asked him why he did it, he simply said it was fun. I was frustrated and told him it wasn't fun for me as it had taken me an hour to build. Fortunately, I remained patient. He looked down and apologized. I suggested that we rebuild the tower together and make it even better. He agreed, and we set to work. This experience taught me that patience can prevent a small problem from escalating and can lead to a more positive outcome.
700	18619	7	2	In @NUM1 grade, our teacher, @PERSON1, asked us to take out our A.M.Ps and start working quietly. I was making good progress and soon found myself on the last problem. I thought to myself, “I'm almost done.” However, when I started working on it, I was completely stumped. The problem seemed far more advanced, like something from seventh - grade math. I raised my hand and waited for @PERSON1 to notice me. She passed by my hand and told me to continue with my math, but I explained that I was stuck on the last problem. She continued to help other students, and I patiently waited. After she had assisted eight other students, she finally came to me. She showed me how to solve the problem, and I was able to figure it out. This was a valuable lesson in patience, as waiting for help ultimately led to my understanding of the difficult problem.
701	18620	7	2	"One day, I came across a commercial for the impressive Xbox @NUM1. The commercial indicated that it would be available in @NUM2 weeks. ""Two weeks,"" I thought. ""That seems like an eternity."" So, I waited and waited. I glanced at the clock, which showed @NUM4. I said, ""Only @NUM5 minutes have passed."" Then, I started playing a game and forgot about the Xbox @NUM1. Later, my dad informed me that we were going shopping to get the Xbox. I was amazed at how quickly the time had flown by. I realized that if you don't dwell on the wait and remain patient, the time will pass in no time."
702	18621	7	2	One day, my sister had a volleyball tournament that lasted all day. I arrived at the worst possible time. I couldn't complain because I'd get in trouble, so I had to be patient. I've become very patient over time since she has many tournaments. Once the tournaments are finally over, my mom usually rewards me for being well - behaved throughout. As we can see, being patient is difficult, but it's an important trait to possess.
703	18622	7	2	This is my story about patience. Every @NUM1 months, my siblings and I go to the doctor, and the visit takes about @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours. When the doctor asks my brothers questions, I start formulating my answer right away. Before my turn, I saw @NUM4 other patients, and I was extremely patient. It took the doctor @NUM5 minutes to finish with me. Then, the doctor had to talk to my mom. When we go to the doctor or dentist, we have to be patient because it takes time for them to do their work. In conclusion, patience is necessary during these medical visits.
704	18624	7	2	During the @DATE1 break, my family and I went to @LOCATION1. While there, my two sisters and I persuaded our parents to take us to a huge water park. A few days later, we went. We rented a locker, changed our clothes, and began looking for waterslides. As soon as we entered, there was a large sunken ship. At the very top were zip - lines! We all rushed to the ship and found a long line, not a short one. We waited for about @NUM1 minutes. Eventually, it was my turn. I grabbed the handle, kicked off the ground, and almost reached the end when the zip - line slowed to a stop. I let go and fell into a pool. The long wait was definitely worth it.
705	18626	7	2	"You may often hear the phrase ""Patience is a virtue"" if you dislike waiting for long periods. Let me pose a question to you: What is patience? In this essay, I'll discuss patience and its impact on our lives. Nowadays, it's rare to find someone with a reasonable amount of patience. With the prevalence of ""instant"" services and goods like pizza delivery and @NUM1 - minute wash - and - dry services, people are losing their patience. Our generation fails to realize that patience is essential for getting good jobs and earning decent incomes. Another reason to have patience is for our families. If you lack patience, you won't be able to handle young and immature family members. For example, I have no patience for anyone younger than @NUM1 years old, which has a negative impact on me. These are the pros and cons of having patience. Thank you for reading."
706	18627	7	2	When I was a little kid, my mom told me we were going to visit my cousins in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I was extremely excited as it would be my first plane - ride. Finally, when we reached @LOCATION1, I was overjoyed. At the hotel, I asked my mom if I could go swimming. She told me to be patient. I tried to be patient for as long as possible, but then I couldn't wait any longer. I put on my trunks and went swimming with my cousin. This was a time when I showed patience for something.
707	18628	7	2	I'll share a time when I was patient. My family and I went to Cedar Point. There was a ride called the @CAPS1, the best and highest roller - coaster at Cedar Point. The line was incredibly long, and we had to wait @NUM1 to get on the ride. I was hungry and thirsty, so I asked my uncle, who wasn't going on the ride, to get me some pop, elephant ears, and chips. While I was being patient, my family members were not. As time passed, @NUM2 hours first, they started fussing. After @NUM3 hours, they got angrier. When @NUM4 hours had passed, we could see the roller - coaster and people getting on and off. Finally, we got on the ride and enjoyed it. Later, I had to explain how patient I was and how impatient they were.
708	18629	7	2	One day, there was a man named @PERSON1 who was extremely impatient. He thought that everything he wanted would come to him immediately. However, he soon realized that not everything arrives as soon as he desires. When he saw a really nice house for sale, he got excited. But the people living in the house hadn't finished moving out. This experience made him discover that patience is key. He understood that he would move in when the right time came. From that point on, he remained patient for the rest of his life.
709	18630	7	2	This is a story of when I was patient. On my birthday, @DATE1 @TIME1, there were @NUM1 boys at my house. We all wanted to play Xbox (@ORGANIZATION1.core @NUM2), but there were only @NUM3 controllers. We had a rule to let the guests play first. They played for @NUM4 minutes, and I had to wait a long time to play my own game. During @MONTH1, I was lucky to be patient. I hated just sitting there; it made me mad, and after a while, they didn't seem interested in playing anymore. I asked my friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 to play with me, and they agreed. After waiting @NUM5 minutes, nobody wanted to play. It was my birthday, and I felt bad. But I'm glad I stayed patient and didn't lose my temper. This was a time I showed patience.
710	18631	7	2	The clock is ticking down. Everyone is waiting, ready to burst into action. There's a never - before - seen @CAPS1. The @NUM1 is planted at the white @ORGANIZATION1. Patience is crucial because if anyone tries to defuse this @CAPS1 before the last minute of the countdown to destruction, the explosive will detonate. The alpha @NUM2 @CAPS1 is waiting for the right moment. As the time passes, @NUM3 minutes, @NUM4 minutes, @NUM5 minutes are left, and then @NUM6 minute remains. @PERSON1, the leader of the group, yells, “@CAPS2, @CAPS2! This is our only chance to save the white @ORGANIZATION1.” With @NUM7 seconds of preparation on our shoulders, the fate of the white @ORGANIZATION1 is in our hands. The enemies are calling in infantry. Just when all hope seems lost, I exclaim, “I got it!” All that was left was to take action and let the army do the rest. We rushed to the van with our shields out, breaking through the defenses. Suddenly, a loud noise was heard, and we noticed a charge on the bottom of the van. We ran for our lives as our night - equipped van exploded into pieces behind us. We patiently waited for the patrol to pass. We just needed to cross the field to reach the army helicopter and be safe. We sprinted across the field and achieved victory. A sense of accomplishment and greatness filled me.
711	18632	7	2	It was @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. I stayed up watching TV, waiting and waiting for @CAPS1. I remained patient, not showing any annoyance because I hoped @LOCATION1 would come to my house. The TV was playing @CAPS1 - related shows, which made me extremely excited. I felt as if my heart was about to burst, yet I kept my patience. Then my mom told me it was time to go to bed. I complied because I still wanted @LOCATION1 to come. However, I couldn't fall asleep. So, I got up to get a glass of water and quietly turned on the TV. Accidentally, I fell asleep on the couch. Before I knew it, it was @CAPS1. The time had passed so quickly that it seemed like @CAPS1 arrived in just @NUM1 minutes. All because I had been patient.
712	18633	7	2	I've demonstrated patience on multiple occasions, and here are a couple of examples. Firstly, I was patient with a friend. We were supposed to walk to school together. He said he'd be ready in a minute, but it actually took around twenty minutes. We barely made it to our first - hour class. Another instance was when my mom and I went to @ORGANIZATION1 to get my new shoes. While we were waiting, the store employee went to fetch the shoes. He was gone for about half an hour. But it was all worthwhile as I got my new shoes. These are just a few ways I've shown patience.
713	18634	7	2	Patience can be defined as waiting for something without losing one's temper. Imagine a world without patience; it would be a chaotic mess. For example, picture yourself at a store with a line at the register. Without patience, people would be fighting to get to the front. Fortunately, most people have patience, and such chaos doesn't occur. Thanks to people's patience, the world maintains order. Clearly, patience is a valuable trait.
714	18635	7	2	I showed patience during a trip on the city bus with my mom to go to Walmart. We waited for @NUM1 hours to reach our destination. Before boarding the bus, we each had to pay @MONEY1 and politely ask for a transfer. Then we hopped on another bus, got off, and went shopping. After that, we waited for @NUM1 hours for the bus to return and then headed home. We got off the bus at the corner and walked back to our house.
715	18636	7	2	"Just before @DATE2 break, when I was in the fourth grade, there was a @CAPS1 party at my neighbor's house. My parents and I were invited, and since we had no other plans, we decided to attend. The party was amazing! Stockings were hung above the fireplace, green and red streamers were everywhere, and there was a huge @CAPS1 tree in the living room. Under the tree, there was a large pile of presents, each for the children. My neighbor noticed me looking at the presents, walked over, picked one up, and gave it to me. The present was rectangular, wrapped in blue gift - wrap with snowflake decorations, and my name was written on the front in marker. I was about to open it when my neighbor told me to wait. He said if I opened it then, I'd only get one gift, but if I waited until @CAPS1 morning, I'd get two. I didn't understand at first, but he said I would soon. @CAPS1 was a week away! It was so hard to wait. Of course, I wanted two gifts, so I told him I'd wait. Deep down, I really wanted to tear the present open right away. The days seemed to drag on. Why was the week passing so slowly? As @CAPS1 approached, I grew impatient. I almost opened the present three days before @CAPS1. Finally, on the twenty - fifth of @DATE1, I could open it. Instead of quickly unwrapping it as I'd planned, I slowly tore the paper off and found a beautiful velvet diary with golden borders. Inside was a note that said: ""Not only have you earned yourself a new diary, you now have the gift of patience."" Now I finally understood."
716	18637	7	2	"There was a time when I learned the value of patience. On a certain day (@DATE1), I was engrossed in playing my @CAPS1 @NUM1 game. I told my mother that I wanted a new game as my existing ones were quite old. My mother gently advised, ""@CAPS3 sweetie just be patient."" I heeded her words and remained patient for a month. However, my brother asked our mother for a new game and got it the very next day. My sister wanted a curling machine, and she also received it promptly. Despite these setbacks, I continued to wait patiently. When my father returned from @LOCATION1, I mustered the courage to ask him, ""Dad, can you get me a new @CAPS1 @NUM1 game?"" He replied, ""@CAPS3 honey but I can't get it now. You just have to be patient."" Reluctantly, I agreed. To my dismay, the next day, I noticed that my father had already procured what my brother and sister wanted, while I was still waiting for my game. Undeterred, I persevered in my waiting. Finally, my father took me to the video store. I was overjoyed when I finally got my game, even though my siblings had received their desired items earlier. This experience taught me that waiting is not as difficult as it seems; it simply requires patience. Patience truly helps one achieve what they desire."
717	18638	7	2	In my view, patience implies being willing to wait for an extended period to accomplish something. I recall a time when I had to exercise patience during a travel mishap. We were planning to go to @LOCATION1 on the @NUM1 for a vacation to Disneyland. When we reached the airport, it was snowing heavily. We rushed through the check - in line and security. Once we reached the boarding gate, we discovered that our flight was delayed. This meant we had to stay at the airport. I was quite hungry as I hadn't eaten all afternoon, but I was somewhat comforted by having my DS. Although it was not a pleasant experience, I learned that our flight would first take us to new @LOCATION2 and then to @LOCATION1. Despite the inconvenience, I managed to stay patient. This incident stands out as a day when I truly demonstrated a high level of patience. It showed me that even in difficult situations, patience can help us endure and eventually reach our destination.
718	18639	7	2	I was eagerly awaiting @DATE1 @CAPS1 @DATE1 presents. As the @DATE1 drew near, I repeatedly asked my @DATE1 mom for presents, but she consistently said no. As the day got closer and closer, my anticipation grew, and I kept pestering her. Finally, my @DATE1 mom told me to be patient and assured me that I would get the presents. However, it was extremely difficult for me to be patient. When the @DATE1 finally arrived, I was bursting with excitement but had to hold back. Before going to bed on the @DATE1, I asked one last time, and once again, she said no. The next day, I went to school. I was elated because it was @DATE1 @DATE1, and I knew I would get presents. When I got home, my @DATE1 mom was waiting with a cake and a present. She then told me that there were more. This was the time when I really tried to be patient, and it was rewarding to see that my patience paid off in the end.
719	18640	7	2	It was a dark and stormy night (@CAPS2) when my family and I went to pick up some Subway. Suddenly, a flash of lightning (@CAPS1) struck, and everything went dark. The manager emerged and calmly asked everyone to stay calm. She provided us with navy - blue flashlights. Due to the heavy rain and thunder, we couldn't reach our car as we were afraid of getting shocked. My stomach growled, and I told my grandmother that I was hungry. We asked the manager if we could still get our subs made since we had the light. She agreed and instructed the workers to resume work. About @NUM1 minutes later, at @NUM2 pm, the manager started distributing subs, chips, soda, and cookies. We all ate and drank, and I eventually fell asleep. The next morning, when the sun was shining and the lights were on, we all walked out to our cars, smelling of bread and meat. This was undoubtedly the best day when I practiced patience, as despite the difficult situation, we ended up having a satisfying experience.
720	18641	7	2	I have the privilege of riding a magnificent paint horse named @CAPS1. She is truly a sight to behold, with one blue eye and one brown eye. One side of her body is completely white, while the other side is adorned with brown patches. @CAPS1 is a well - built, plump horse, and she has a real weakness for treats. Whenever I start putting tack on her, she knows that a treat is in store, but she has to wait until I put on her bridle and she takes the bit. As a novice rider, I make numerous mistakes. @CAPS1 shows remarkable patience towards me during our rides. When I make errors or accidentally upset her, she is usually patient. Both @CAPS1 and I strive our best, but I am far from being a perfect rider, so @CAPS1 has to tolerate my shortcomings. After our ride, I untack and brush her. Then, my instructor tells me to get @CAPS1 a treat. @CAPS1 watches me walk down the long row of stalls and patiently waits for my return with the treat. Once she has finished her treat, I let her out into the paddock to play with her friends. After taking a drink of water, she no longer has to be patient and can freely enjoy herself with her equine companions. This experience with @CAPS1 has taught me the importance of patience from both sides - the patience of the horse towards the rider and the rider's patience in learning.
721	18642	7	2	One instance when I had to exercise patience was during a trip to @LOCATION2. The journey involved a @NUM1 - hour flight followed by a two - hour layover in @LOCATION1. It was extremely challenging for me to be patient as I was highly eager to reach @LOCATION2. During the layover, to pass the time, I listened to my iPod and used my MacBook Pro to access Facebook. This distraction effectively diverted my attention from @LOCATION2. Before I knew it, we had arrived at @LOCATION2. Once there, my patience paid off as I got to swim on the beaches and enjoy parties during the @DATE1 break @DATE2. This is my account of a time when I was patient.
722	18643	7	2	There were @NUM1 girls, and their mother, who was gay, took them to a motel to celebrate the middle child's birthday. Everything was going well until the mother's girlfriend, Cathy, and my mother, @CAPS1, went out to buy presents for @CAPS2. They left @CAPS4 and the girls at the motel. They returned @NUM2 later. When @CAPS1 was walking back to get us, I noticed she wasn't in the van. When she told us that Cathy had been taken to jail and we had no money and didn't know anyone, I started crying. We then had to go to a gas station. My sister and I sat on the curb while my mother went across the street to use the pay - phone. We had to wait patiently in the cold winter. Eventually, @NUM3 really nice ladies saw us sitting in the cold and helped us out. This experience led to my move from Southhaven to Bangor.
723	18644	7	2	A time when I demonstrated patience was when I was at the hospital. One time, my grandma was rushed to the hospital after passing out and having trouble breathing. When we arrived at the hospital, we were unable to see her for a long time. My mom, brother, cousins, and uncle sat patiently waiting. The next day, we still couldn't see her, which was both sad and scary. My uncle took us out to get something to eat while my mom stayed at the hospital. When we returned, my mom was very upset because we still hadn't been able to see grandma. Finally, the doctor came out and said we could see her. When we entered the room, she was sitting up and smiling. My mom told her it had taken forever to see her, and grandma said the doctor had told her it wasn't a big deal. We stayed at the hospital for about @NUM1 more hours and then left, but my mom stayed behind. In conclusion, this was the time when I was patient at the hospital. Even though we were eager to see grandma, we remained calm and waited. This is my story of patience.
724	18645	7	2	Patience is indeed a virtue. Sometimes, I'm impatient, but it's better to be patient. My cousin is very patient. When I ask her to wait, she'll wait as long as necessary. My other cousins often tell me to be patient. I'd wait for a while, but then I'd get impatient and ask them to hurry, and they'd tell me to learn patience. My cousin tried to teach me how to be patient, and we made an effort. Now, I can be patient for longer periods. In the end, learning patience has been a valuable lesson for me.
725	18646	7	2	"I was sitting in class, knowing that the time I was waiting for would soon arrive. The moment was almost here, but I still had to wait for the first class, which was math, to end. Personally, I don't like math very much, so waiting was a bit of a chore. After @NUM1 more minutes, I'd be free. When the time finally came, I was elated. @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS1, put your folder away, @CAPS2!"" I put it away in a flash. Then, in his voice, he said, ""You can go to lunch."" I rushed off, thinking I'd be the first one there. I almost thought I wasn't patient enough, but I had managed to wait. I was running towards the lunch area when I realized there was a figure in front of me. ""No,"" I said. I was beaten to the lunch area by a girl! I was devastated. This is my story, and I stand by it."
726	18647	7	2	When most people think of patience, they simply associate it with waiting. However, true patience involves waiting without complaining. For instance, I once went to @ORGANIZATION1. It was a nearly five - hour drive. Although five hours might not seem overly long, I detested the @CAPS1 corridor. I just couldn't stand it. My brother and I didn't complain, mainly because the night before, our mom warned that if we complained, we'd have to stay in the hotel room with her the whole time. That was quite intimidating. Eventually, we reached our destination. The week there was enjoyable. We savored delicious food, played exciting games, and visited an amazing museum. On the way back, it was yet another test of patience, especially since we were involved in an accident. In the end, through it all, we managed to maintain our patience.
727	18648	7	2	In @DATE1, my dad had a business trip that took us to @CAPS1 Disneyland. Once we arrived at the park, we went on some rides. Then, my dad had to leave for a meeting. After a short while, I spotted something really cool, the space @CAPS2. I got in line and saw a sign indicating that there were @NUM1 hours until the ride's lift - off. My mom was shocked, so we left. I was extremely disappointed. The next day, we returned, and the wait was @NUM2 hours. We got in line and waited interminably. After @NUM3 minutes, I got bored. I asked my mom if we could leave, but the line was too long to exit. After what seemed like an eternity, we finally reached the front. But then, my sister wanted to leave! My mom and sister got out of the line, but I stayed. I waited by myself for @NUM4 minutes and finally got on the coaster. It was a lot of fun, and I also got a fast - pass for @NUM5 other rides. Clearly, my patience paid off in the end.
728	18649	7	2	It was late @DATE1 when my @CAPS1 and I were on our way to @CAPS2 Point for my @CAPS1. The drive there seemed to take forever. I sat alone in the back seat with no one to talk to except my phone. Once we finally arrived, having exhausted all my patience during the long car ride, we entered and went on the @CAPS4 @NUM1 @CAPS5. We waited for @NUM1 hours to ride a @NUM1 - minute ride. It was worth it, but @NUM1 hours is still a substantial amount of time. As I was waiting, after getting off that ride, we got in the @CAPS6 @NUM4 @CAPS5 line for the @NUM5 second ride. Most of the rides there had waiting times of at least 1 - @NUM1 hours. However, for one ride, the @CAPS7, we arrived before the crowd. So, the wait was only @NUM7 minutes. When we got on the ride and reached the top of the hill, there was probably a short line. We were really lucky with that one. But by the time the park closed and we reached our car, there was a huge traffic jam, which used up the last of my patience. We were in line to leave the park for another @CAPS5 and a half. We waited and waited until the line finally moved. Once we got out of the park, the road we needed to take was closed due to a car accident. We had to take a long detour, which added another @CAPS5 to our journey because of the traffic. By the time we reached our hotel, I was completely out of patience. I felt like I was going to explode, but I managed to stay patient. It was fortunate that I have a good amount of patience.
729	18650	7	2	A time when I demonstrated patience was when I went to @CAPS1 Point with @CAPS6 family and @CAPS6 friend @LOCATION1. After riding some rides, @CAPS6 sister asked if we could ride the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 again. I agreed, even though it was our fifth time on that ride. @CAPS6 sister and I got in line. I suggested that we ride in the front row, and @CAPS4 agreed. We waited for about twenty minutes when someone threw up on another cart. The employees had to clean up the mess, which took another twenty minutes. We continued waiting until we were finally allowed on the ride. After the ride, I exclaimed, “Who would barf on a ride like @CAPS7?” @CAPS6 dad replied that he didn't know. @CAPS7 is a day I remember for my patience because I waited forty to sixty minutes for a ride that, in my opinion, wasn't really worth the wait. However, seeing the smile on @CAPS6 sister's face and her laughter made it all worthwhile.
730	18651	7	2	I know many patient people and have had numerous experiences related to patience. My friend, @PERSON1, is usually impatient. Whenever she has to wait for something, she texts me things like “@CAPS1!” or “@CAPS2 onnn!” But one day, she showed remarkable patience. On @DATE1 @TIME1, my family, @PERSON1, and I planned to go to the zoo. We prepared snacks and packed everything the day before. We were supposed to pick @PERSON1 up from her house and then head to the zoo. But my mom overslept and still had to take a shower. She said we'd pick up @PERSON1 on the way to the zoo around @NUM1 am, but it was already @NUM2 am. We were running late, and I thought @PERSON1 would get angry. Fortunately, she wasn't mad at all. She was understanding and said it was okay. Usually, she would say something like “@CAPS4, where are you? Why are you taking so long?” But this time, she didn't say any of that. We ended up going to the zoo around noon, and it was a really fun day. This experience, among many others with patient people, turned out to be a great and enjoyable one.
731	18652	7	2	I believe patience entails waiting for an event you anticipate or dread. Sometimes, it tests us unexpectedly. Particularly at Cedar Point, a great deal of patience is required.  On @DATE1, I jolted awake to the shrill beeping of my alarm clock. I pounded it with all my might, hoping it would stop. I was ecstatic because I was going to Cedar Point. Unable to contain my excitement, I sprang out of bed, took a refreshing shower, and sat down to a delicious breakfast of blueberry muffins made by my mom.  I had been so eager that I packed my clothes a week in advance. I loaded my belongings into the car, and soon my brother, sister, mom, and dad joined me. We were all set to embark on our journey.  The three - hour car ride wasn't too bad. We had a TV in the car, which kept my siblings and me occupied, making the journey seem shorter.  When we arrived at the hotel, I was in awe. It was @NUM1 stories high, and we took the elevator to reach our room on the @NUM2 floor. My sister was mesmerized by the stuffed animals on display and wanted to buy them, but she couldn't.  Early the next morning, my mom woke us up, saying, “The rides open in about @NUM3 minutes. We have to be there!” I leaped out of bed, scurrying around like a madman to find my clothes. I finally located everything and rushed to put on my shoes on the other side of the bed.  By the time we were dressed and showered, the rides had already been operating for an hour. We headed to the gate and aimed for a ride called “Million of Care.” The sign read, “@NUM4 hours wait. Sorry, the ride has just started due to difficulties with the seatbelts and other technical issues.” My mom encouraged us, “Wait here. It's a really fun ride.”  We waited and waited. My patience was wearing thin. My mom promised me a hot dog if I waited, so I persevered. Finally, we got on the ride, and it was a blast. We spent @NUM1 hours at the park, having a great time, but we had to leave the next day. True to her word, I got my hot dog.  This experience at Cedar Point taught me that sometimes, to have fun and get what you want, you have to be patient.
732	18653	7	2	On a sweltering @DATE1, my family and I decided to visit @ORGANIZATION1. There was a newly opened ride called “Shoot the Rapids.” It was a tall, brown water ride featuring a tunnel and two hills.  As we approached the ride to check the waiting time, the sign indicated a @NUM1 - hour wait. We were all eager to try it, so we decided to queue up. The outside temperature was around @NUM2 degrees, and we were all sweating profusely. To make matters worse, there was an annoying little boy chattering away about food, which really got on my nerves.  When we were about halfway through the line, I started to feel nervous. I was terrified, but I knew I had to summon my courage.  After about @NUM3, we were only @NUM4 people away from boarding the ride. My heart was pounding, and my knees were shaking. I felt like I was on the verge of a breakdown.  Suddenly, the ride broke down. We had to wait another @NUM5. As time passed, we finally got on the water ride.  To be honest, I regretted it as soon as I started. I screamed and cried throughout the ride. However, I'm also glad that I didn't back out. This was an instance where I exercised patience, even though I had mixed feelings about it. It shows that patience doesn't always guarantee a positive outcome, but it can still lead to valuable experiences.
733	18654	7	2	One time, my grandma told me there was something in the mail for me. I was over the moon with excitement. I waited and waited, but the mail didn't arrive. As time went by, I started to lose my patience.  My grandma encouraged me, saying, “@CAPS1, keep waiting. It will come soon.” I heeded her advice and continued to wait.  The next day, a large package finally arrived. I was elated. My uncle had sent new sneakers for my sisters and me. We also received @NUM1 players each.  I was extremely happy that my patience had paid off. It was a valuable lesson that waiting patiently can lead to wonderful surprises. This experience reinforced the idea that being patient is often worth it in the end.
734	18655	7	2	In third grade, on @DATE1, my mom was driving me to school. She casually mentioned, “When I pick you up today, there's a surprise for you at home.”  I was so excited that I could barely contain myself. All day, I struggled to be patient. I even thought about faking being sick so I could go home and find out what the surprise was. But I decided to calm down and wait. I kept telling myself that the school day would end soon.  At @NUM1, I left school, and my mom picked me up. I told her how eager I was to see the surprise and boasted that I had been patient the whole day.  When we got home, she told me to “go to my room.” I complied. As I entered, I saw a little, cute, black puppy. I was overjoyed! I exclaimed, “Thank you, Mom! Thank you so much, Dad!” I named her Chioe.  This experience taught me that patience can lead to wonderful rewards. It was a day I'll always remember, and I'm glad I managed to be patient despite my excitement.
735	18656	7	2	Being patient can be an arduous task, but it often yields positive results. My family and I experienced this firsthand on our way to the airport. My two younger brothers and I were brimming with excitement as we were headed to @LOCATION1.  We arrived at the airport, expecting to board the plane immediately. However, we were informed that we had to wait @NUM1 hours until the plane took off. Undeterred, we decided to play the games we had brought along, patiently passing the time.  Finally, it was time to board. We walked through the long tunnel leading to the airplane door, took our seats, buckled up, and awaited takeoff. But then, the pilot's voice came over the speakers, “I'm very sorry, but there's a severe thunderstorm on the radar. We can't proceed until it clears up.”  My mom asked, “@CAPS2 long will it take?” The pilot replied, “About five hours.” Fortunately, we had brought our @CAPS3 player, which kept us entertained for about two hours. For the remaining time, we played, slept, and waited patiently.  The flight attendant approached us and said that since we had been patient for the entire five - hour delay, even my three - year - old brother, she would reward our family with five @ORGANIZATION1 world pass tickets.  In conclusion, this experience clearly shows that no matter how difficult it is to be patient, there's a possibility of being rewarded. Just like my family, when you persevere through patience, good things can come your way.
736	18657	7	2	Patience is a remarkable virtue that entails being understanding and composed. There are instances when individuals can endure hardships and pain while maintaining their calm. For example, when your sibling irritates you, you remain patient and refrain from retaliating. One morning, my brother burst into my room, shouting, “Wake up already!” I hollered back, “I'm awake!” I took a deep breath and let out a sigh. My brother then yelled in my face, “I'm so bored! Can we go walking?” I counted past ten in my mind before finally responding. I retrieved my coat from the rack, and my little brother followed. As we stepped outside, my mom approached and assigned me a chore. “You'll have to cut the grass and rake the leaves today,” she said calmly. “After that, you can take your little brother for a walk.” I was seething inside but tried to stay calm. However, my composure didn't last long. My brother's friend cheerfully said, “Hey! Can you come over and play?” My brother looked up at me, and I was on the verge of losing it. I stammered and walked back home. I grabbed the lawn mower, and just as I was about to start it, my mom said, “Get inside and start your homework. Then, you can go out.” I counted silently. I forced a fake smile and walked back inside. On the other hand, my mom added, “Take out the trash!” I continued counting. I ran downstairs, grabbed the trash, and walked to the trash can. As I dropped the garbage inside, I tried to think positive thoughts. Suddenly, I rushed inside to see what had happened. It turned out that my sister had broken my Xbox because she wanted to play. I thought, “If I can't control my anger, I'm going to explode!” I held my little sister and gave her to my mom. “She broke my Xbox!” I repeated. My mom calmly replied, “Your dad will fix it. Now, go get your brother.” I quickly walked to my brother's friend's house and told him I needed to take my brother home. We walked back, and I collapsed on my bed. “What a boring day!” I said to myself. “I don't think I'll ever be this patient again!” I smacked my head on the pillow and went to sleep. Patience truly means being understanding and calm. It is a great virtue. Through this experience, I learned a valuable lesson. I realized that my life is better when I try to stay patient, even when my siblings annoy me. If everyone could practice patience, the world would be a better place. It's a well - known fact that patience pays off.
737	18658	7	2	Patience can be exemplified in various situations. Waiting in line is a classic example of patience. Another instance is when a student repeatedly raises their hand in class, and the teacher keeps instructing the student to focus on their work. If the student persists, the teacher may threaten to send the student to the detention room. This is when a teacher loses their patience. In conclusion, these examples clearly illustrate the concept of patience and its limits in different contexts.
738	18659	7	2	I'm going to share a time when I demonstrated patience. It was the first week of football season. Before the game, we went to Subway in town to grab a sub. I was the first person in line, but then others joined. At first, only one person cut in front of me, but then more followed, and I ended up at the back of the line. It felt like I was waiting for an hour! Finally, it was my turn. I ordered a sub filled with turkey, lettuce, pickles, banana peppers, cucumbers, and delicious French spinach. Standing in that line taught me that patience really pays off. By the time I got my sub, it had been over [NUM1] minutes. I sighed in relief. We were excited for our first game. We played against Starta and tied, but it was still a great day. This experience shows that being patient can lead to a rewarding outcome, even in small things like getting a sub before a game.
739	18660	7	2	One day after school, I was walking home with my friends. Knowing me, I was hungry, so I suggested we go to [LOCATION1]'s, a fast - food restaurant. When we entered, the place was crowded. I waited in line. After about [NUM1] minutes, my friends said, “Come on, man, let's go.” I replied, “I'll meet you guys outside.” About [NUM2] minutes later, it was my turn to order. I got a double stack burger and some fries. And because of my patience, I got a free milkshake. The staff asked what flavor I wanted, and I said strawberry. It was completely free. I went outside and told my friends. They were impressed and said, “oooooooh.” Then we went home. This shows that patience can sometimes bring unexpected rewards, like a free milkshake at a fast - food joint.
740	18661	7	2	Approximately [NUM1] weeks ago, I ordered a book series online from Barnes & Noble. I had to be extremely patient, and it felt like I was waiting for [NUM2] years. This book series, called the [LOCATION1] series, is my absolute favorite. I've read it [NUM1] times and still enjoy it. The mailing notice said it would arrive in less than [NUM4] hours, but I ended up waiting for [NUM5] days. Just when I had forgotten about it, the books finally arrived. Patience is a valuable quality for people to possess. If you are patient, you are more likely to get what you want. In this case, my patience was rewarded with the arrival of my beloved book series.
741	18662	7	2	This year, when I took my first @CAPS1 test, I demonstrated patience. The test had a moderate level of difficulty. I completed it with approximately one and a half hours remaining. For that entire hour - and - a - half, I had to sit completely still and silent. It's extremely challenging for a @NUM1 - year - old to sit quietly even for five minutes, let alone @NUM2 minutes. Initially, I was fidgeting, and then my neck began to ache, so I laid my head down. I closed my eyes and remained perfectly quiet and still. Before I knew it, time passed quickly, and the @CAPS2.E.A.P test for the day was over. I felt a great sense of pride in myself for staying patient and calm during those @NUM2 minutes.
742	18663	7	2	Hi, my name is @PERSON1, and I'm going to share a story about a time when I was patient. It was chismis day. Under the tree, there were numerous presents, ranging from tiny ones to huge ones. However, I couldn't even take a peek at them because my mom and dad were still asleep. I really wanted to go into their room and wake them up. But I decided to first prepare breakfast in bed for them so that after they ate, they could hurry and I could open my presents. After my parents finished eating, I finally got to open my presents. This experience taught me the value of patience as I waited for the right moment.
743	18664	7	2	Patience is defined as being tolerant and understanding. Some people lack patience, while others possess it. I'm somewhat in the middle, but I recall a time when I had to be extremely patient. It was a bright and sunny @DATE2 at @TIME1. The sun was shining intensely. Unfortunately, I couldn't play outside as I was occupied relaxing, eating popcorn, and watching an important event that could give me bragging rights. I realized I needed hope and patience. “@CAPS1!”, my brother shouted excitedly in my face. “@CAPS2 @CAPS2 loser, the Lions are winning and the Steelers are losing,” he added. “Don't get too happy. There's still plenty of time left,” I replied, looking worried. I was afraid of losing, but by taking deep breaths, I remained patient. As the clock wound down, it was the beginning of the @DATE1. The score was @NUM1 to @NUM2, with the Lions in the lead. I was still a bit anxious but never lost hope. As the game neared its end, the @DATE1 back for the Steelers made an amazing pass, and I @CAPS1, screaming, dancing, and jumping around. I told my brother, “Who's the loser now, huh?” I thought to myself, “All it took was patience and hope.” Patience truly means a lot. I learned that my brother and I can be quite competitive, but if you wait and tolerate the situation, you'll be rewarded.
744	18666	7	2	I believe that patience is one of my notable talents. I encounter many situations that require patience and manage to get through them without a problem. Everyone knows that one of the most difficult places to be patient is in church or during certain classes. The activities seem to go on and on - you're up, then down, then starting again, sitting, and so on. I know there are many kids who are as patient as me, while some have @CAPS2 @CAPS3 of other distractions that make them impatient. There are also people who just can't sit still. I know that some of these people struggle in school, and I feel sorry for them. There are times when I start to feel impatient when others around me are impatient. It's even worse when I get frustrated because no matter how many times I tell them to stop tapping their pencils or complaining, they just don't stop. I guess what I'm trying to say is that everyone is different. Some people are quiet and calm, while others are more hyperactive, and some are academically - focused. The same goes for patience; people vary in their ability to be patient.
745	18667	7	2	There was a fish named @CAPS1. @CAPS6 lived around the @CAPS2 archipelago, a perilous place for fish that couldn't slow down rapidly. Fortunately, @CAPS1 was the legendary fish that just floats slowly. Yesterday, @CAPS1 caught two fish and gave them to his wife. Today, all the fish were in the desert, which @CAPS1 detested. Using patience, @CAPS6 waited for something to appear. Suddenly, @CAPS6 saw a large piece of meat on something shiny. However, it was too far away to reach. @CAPS6 went home to his wife. The next day, @CAPS6 went to the current and saw the floating meat again. @CAPS6 lunged at it and started chewing when something stabbed him. @CAPS1 started pulling forcefully, and @CAPS6 heard a snap. When @CAPS6 tugged again, @CAPS6 fell into the current. @CAPS6 was finally free! @CAPS6 also found that the current felt quite pleasant. @CAPS6 ate a few fish and then went to sleep. When @CAPS6 woke up, @CAPS6 saw a big, ugly fish standing on two fins. @CAPS1 couldn't breathe, and in a desperate moment, @CAPS6 snapped at one of the fins of the other fish and then died. This unfortunate end shows that even with patience, not all situations end well for @CAPS6.
746	18668	7	2	In sports, patience is always essential. For instance, when you're not making shots or being outperformed by an opponent, remaining patient and persevering will eventually lead to success. @PERSON1 demonstrated remarkable patience throughout his basketball career. At @PERSON2 High, where he attended high school, he was neither the tallest, fastest, nor the strongest player, nor was he the best. However, he was patient. As a @CAPS1 in high school, he tried out for the varsity team but didn't make it. He was extremely disappointed with himself and the coaches, feeling that he should have been selected. His mother encouraged him not to give up. Unlike many other students, @PERSON1 didn't quit or doubt his abilities. He remained patient and continued to work hard. His efforts paid off, as he made the team the following year. He then went on to @LOCATION1, where he won a championship with a game - winning shot. He was later drafted by the @CAPS2 in the @ORGANIZATION1 draft. The @CAPS3 were one of the weakest teams in the @ORGANIZATION1. It took @PERSON1 a few years to win his first @ORGANIZATION1 championship. During his initial seasons, he remained calm and went on to win five more championships. In his last championship run, @PERSON1 was getting older and knew he would face challenges. They reached the finals, but the @CAPS2 were fatigued. They trailed in the series @NUM1. Nevertheless, @PERSON1 and the @CAPS2 persevered and fought hard. Eventually, the @CAPS2 won their sixth @ORGANIZATION1 championship. @PERSON1 encountered difficult situations, but his patience and all - star performance were key to his success.
747	18669	7	2	One day at camp, I was on an obstacle course. The person in front of me was slow to move up, so I had to be patient. When I finally got up and passed the first obstacle, the person was waiting on the platform. I had to wait until they took that person down. Then, when I was halfway through an obstacle, I was told to be patient and wait until all the people got off the platform. It took a few minutes, but I finally got to proceed. That was the day when I had to exercise patience, and it taught me the importance of waiting in such situations.
748	18670	7	2	My mother is a very patient woman. She demonstrates her patience by helping my brother @PERSON1 with his homework. @PERSON1 dislikes every aspect of doing homework. He hates math, reading, and especially spelling. When my mother helps him with these subjects, she shows great patience because @PERSON1 often protests doing his homework. When he throws a tantrum, my mother remains patient and works with him until he finishes. This is how my mother showcases her patience in dealing with @PERSON1's homework struggles.
749	18671	7	2	Music is my life. I love how a song can make me feel and how a performance on the @ORGANIZATION1 can transform my day. As a young musician, my mind is constantly filled with music. I have mastered my @NUM1 instrument, @CAPS1, and have experience with @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, and @ORGANIZATION1. The only instrument my family owns that I can't play is the bass. When my @ORGANIZATION2 broke, I took up Mr. Groth's offer to play the @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4 band. I dedicated myself to learning the bass, studying the clef and memorizing the notes. I patiently waited for my skills to improve. Soon, I fell in love with the instrument. I got better week by week, and I grew to love the sounds it produced even more than the @ORGANIZATION2. I know it will take time to become a professional, but I've realized that the effort is worth it.
750	18672	7	2	When I first saw my puppy, we were at @ORGANIZATION2. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 brought some dogs for rescue. When I saw the second dog, I knew it was the one for me. The lady said the puppy was scared and got carsick, but I didn't care; it was my favorite. I told her I wanted the puppy, and she told us to go to the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 to inform them. On the way there, we thought of names. My dad suggested @CAPS6, and I liked it, so that became the puppy's name. I had to wait a whole week before I could take him home, but I was okay with that as long as I got my puppy. I bought him a toy and slept with it every night, knowing I was getting closer to having him. Finally, the day arrived. I told my brother we were going fishing so he wouldn't know we were getting a dog. When we got there, I ran inside to see the puppy. When I took him home, he was afraid of everything, even leaves outside. But now, he loves chasing leaves and playing in the snow. Every night, I tell @CAPS6 it's bedtime and sleep with my wonderful dog. This experience taught me that if you really want something, patience is the key.
751	18674	7	2	My father has a girlfriend named @PERSON1. She has two children: a seven - year - old and a four - year - old. The older child is @PERSON2, who loves skateboarding. The younger one is @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 is rather excitable; if someone were to jump out of an airplane, @CAPS1 would do the same. One day, @PERSON2 and I planned to go skateboarding at a park. @PERSON3 wanted to come along, but @CAPS1 didn't even know how to ride a skateboard. We went to the park, and when we arrived, @CAPS1 realized that @CAPS1 had forgotten the skateboard. I had to let @CAPS1 use mine. I didn't mind lending it, but it meant I didn't get to use it myself.
752	18675	7	2	I believe that patience means being understanding and tolerant. A patient person endures difficulties without complaining. This story is about the time I was patient with my little brother, @CAPS1. I heard the alarm and counted “Five more minutes” after taking about fifteen steps from it. I jumped out of bed, remembering that I was babysitting my little brother. I tried to swallow the unappetizing breakfast on my plate. I quickly took a shower and dressed in jeans and a T - shirt. At that time, @PERSON1 was about two years old and could walk. It was hard for anyone to be patient with him because of the messes he made. However, he was so cute that it was extremely difficult to stay mad at him. When I heard a car pull up, I knew someone had arrived. I went to where @PERSON1 was sitting and dressed him. He was an adorable baby. I brought him to the kitchen and made something that was much lighter than my breakfast. We played outside, and the colorful leaves crunched under our feet. After the game, we played with cars for a while. Then it was dinner time. Before we knew it, it was night. I put him in the bath and went to get something. When I came back, the whole bathroom was wet with warm bath water. After I dried and dressed him, he was out of the tub. I helped him and got through the night. In the end, I managed to be patient with him throughout the day.
753	18676	7	2	I've been a patient person in my life. For instance, one time I wanted to see @LOCATION1 at the mall. There was a long @CAPS1 line that stretched all the way to the street. It was @NUM1, and my bedtime was @NUM2, so I was in a hurry. My sister and I ran to the back of the line where our parents were. They had saved us spots. It was already @NUM3 after @NUM4, and the line hadn't moved at all. I was extremely angry. Every @NUM5, the line would inch forward a bit. Just when I was about to leave, the line started moving quickly, like an army on the march. That's when I got excited. All I wanted to ask @LOCATION1 for was an airsoft gun and a pony. I thought it would be great to ride the pony and shoot at people who got in my way. I believed @LOCATION1 would give me a good airsoft gun because @DATE1 could come earlier than expected. As I was chatting with my friends about what was next, we finally got to @LOCATION1. I asked for what I wanted, and he said, “You'll shoot your eye out.” That's when I got mad because I had to be so patient. I decided that this would be the last time I'd visit @LOCATION1 at the mall.
754	18677	7	2	A time when I had to be patient was during a football game. The defense was in, and I was waiting to go back on the field. Finally, my friend @PERSON1 intercepted the ball, and the offense, including me, got back on the field. They had me run up the middle, and I scored. Then we went for a two - point conversion. The ball came to me; it was high, and I tipped it, but it fell right into my hands. After that, I had to wait again because the defense went back in. Then it was halftime. I'm the kick returner. We got the ball, and I returned the kick all the way for a touchdown. It was really exciting because my team was leading, and I broke a lot of tackles. Then came the @DATE1. The other team was kneeling the ball. Finally, my teammate swatted the pass, and one of my teammates recovered it. We got the ball, and our full - back caught a pass and scored the game - winning touchdown. This was a time when I had to exercise patience, and it paid off as our team won the game.
755	18678	7	2	Patience can be defined in several ways. When someone is in a car on a long - distance trip and doesn't keep asking to stop or constantly inquire about the destination, that's an example of patience. At a store, if someone in front of you has a large amount of items in their cart and you don't get angry, that's patience. When teaching someone and they keep making mistakes but you don't get frustrated and continue to teach them, that shows patience. If someone has @CAPS1 and has difficulty paying attention, and you don't get annoyed with them, you're being patient. Even if the person walks away and ignores you, but you still try to teach or show them something, it's a sign of patience. Sometimes, patience is essential; for example, if you want to work as a therapist, you need a great deal of it. These are some of the definitions of patience.
756	18680	7	2	Patience is the act of calmly awaiting something. It involves waiting for the opportune moment to propose marriage or ask someone out on a date. Life will be arduous if one lacks patience. For instance, when seeking employment, one must exercise patience. In conclusion, patience is a valuable virtue that can greatly enhance our lives in various situations.
757	18681	7	2	This is a story about how I had to be patient to get a phenomenal bowl of [@CAPS1 @CAPS2]. My grandparents picked my brother and me up from our house to go to Cold Stone for [@CAPS1 @CAPS2]. I'd never been to Cold Stone before, but my friends said it was great, so I asked my grandparents if we could go. I was really excited. When we got there, the line was extremely long, snaking around. The sign said there was a [@NUM1]-minute wait. I was disappointed and almost left, but then I saw the peanut butter [@CAPS1 @CAPS2]. It looked so good that I convinced my grandparents to stay. When we finally reached the front of the line, I ordered the peanut butter [@CAPS1 @CAPS2]. It was an amazing treat; it was so smooth. I'm really glad I was patient and got to enjoy that wonderful [@CAPS1 @CAPS2]. This was a time when patience paid off.
758	18682	7	2	"Patience implies being understanding and tolerant. A patient person endures difficulties without complaining. There was an incident where I demonstrated patience. Although being patient is challenging, I've managed it. [@CAPS3]'s brother was clearly impatient, saying, ""[@CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS2], this isn't moving at all."" He also taunted a slow - moving man, saying, ""Hello, [@CAPS13] me mame (man), can you walk any slower?"" The man replied kindly, ""[@CAPS4], I can if you want me to."" But [@CAPS5], who was only a year older than me ([@NUM1]), tried to act tough and said he'd cut the man because of his ""stupidity."" The man calmly responded that he'd been waiting in line forever. While [@CAPS3]'s brother was causing a ruckus, I waited patiently even though the line barely moved. Inside, I was frustrated, but I had the patience to wait. After [@CAPS3]'s brother cut the man without punishment, he continued to cut many others. People were angry but didn't do much. Then, [@CAPS5] cut [@PERSON1], a young and pretty girl with blue eyes and blond hair. She reported him to the authorities. While I patiently waited, [@CAPS5] was kicked out of the park. Eventually, I got on the roller - coaster, which was the best one I'd ever been on. Being patient is difficult but can be rewarding. It requires a great deal of understanding and tolerance. We truly get the best when we're patient and the worst when we're not."
759	18683	7	2	At school, [@PERSON1] has had a crush on my best friend, Mycaela, for who knows how long. He's asked her out about fifty times. Mycaela likes him as a friend but nothing more. Since [@PERSON1] first asked her out, she's dated many guys. Mycaela can be a bit boy - crazy; in fact, she's now dating a boy I asked out two days ago. Anyway, [@PERSON1] is incredibly patient, always hoping Mycaela will change her mind. It's been nearly two years, and he's been sort of stalking her, but she still hasn't reciprocated his feelings. I think [@PERSON1] is very patient and is a really great kid. His patience, though unrequited so far, shows his kind and persistent nature.
760	18684	7	2	One time, I had to be patient when my mom was on the phone with my dad for at least [@NUM1] hours. We were in the car on our way to [@LOCATION1]. During the first hour, I watched my dog on my lap. In the second hour, I fell asleep. By the third hour, I was watching a movie, and I really had to go to the bathroom. By the last hour and a half, I was on the verge of tears because I needed to go so badly. Finally, when my mom got off the phone, we were at my aunt's house. I quickly ran into the bathroom and felt much better. This experience taught me that patience can be difficult but is sometimes necessary in uncomfortable situations.
761	18685	7	2	I'm @PERSON1, and a year ago, I was a foster child. I had to exercise patience in numerous situations. Firstly, my foster parents divorced while they had children. I had to patiently wait until my foster mother found a new home to move to. Secondly, I wasn't informed about when I could return to my own home. I had to wait until all the matters were resolved. Finally, after a year and a half, I was told that I could go back to my mother within a week. I packed my things and waited. I had to be patient with everyone around me. It was incredibly difficult, almost driving me crazy. It took two weeks and a day for me to finally get home. Moreover, I had to move all my belongings back and unpack. Even to this day, I'm still in the process of unpacking. Being a foster child requires a great deal of patience, and I've learned this lesson well.
762	18686	7	2	A new restaurant opened in town, and he was eager to try it, so his family decided to go. The restaurant had been open for @NUM1 minutes. They didn't expect there to be a line. When they arrived, they didn't see any cars in the drive - thru. They entered the drive - thru, which started at the back of the restaurant. Then they saw about @NUM2 cars. He got really angry. They were about to leave when @NUM3 cars lined up behind them, so they stayed. Since it was a new restaurant, everyone was choosing their food very slowly, and the staff was also preparing the food at a snail's pace. People started yelling, “@CAPS1 up,” and honking their horns, but he was the only one who didn't honk. They waited for @NUM2 minutes, and @NUM1 minutes had passed. He was starving but still very patient. Usually, he isn't patient. He was extremely excited to dine at the new place. When it was his turn, the cashier said, “@CAPS2 you for being very patient.” By the time they got their food, it had taken @NUM6 hour. The food wasn't even good! He showed remarkable patience that day. He didn't honk his horn or yell. He sat in the car for @NUM6 hour while starving. Having patience is truly a great virtue.
763	18688	7	2	This is a story about patience. Patience means doing an old or specific task given to you without any @CAPS1 being asked, even if you don't want to do it. Last week, my mom told me to clean the living room. It was difficult, and I didn't want to do it. I thought it was unfair, but I still did it. Through this experience, I understand that patience is about fulfilling duties even when they are unappealing or challenging. Patience is indeed an important quality to have in daily life.
764	18689	7	2	Patience is an extremely significant virtue. It holds value in at least @NUM1 aspects of life, namely success and friendship. If one lacks patience, it is likely that no one will want to be their friend. One must be patient with friends; otherwise, the friendship will not last. I can attest to this from personal experience. To achieve success in life in general, patience is essential. Whether it's waiting for a bus or awaiting a response from a job interview, patience always matters. In conclusion, I firmly believe that patience is an extremely important trait to possess.
765	18690	7	2	I firmly believe that patience is crucial for several reasons. Without patience, one wouldn't be able to wait for anything. For instance, waiting in line would become an impossible task. Another reason patience is important is that without it, people would complain every day because we need patience in our daily lives. When waiting to buy a ticket or get gas, we have to wait our turn. Lastly, patience is necessary for reading. Since books often take time to finish, without patience, one wouldn't be willing to invest the time to complete them. That's precisely why I'm convinced that patience is of great importance.
766	18691	7	2	One day, I accompanied my father to a carnival. We had a great time there. I continuously won prizes at the games. I thought to myself that nothing could impede me, but I was mistaken. Everyone has a different level of patience. My patience is usually low, yet on this occasion, I remained tolerant and calm. While at the carnival, I noticed a new ride. Everyone was queuing up to see what it was. When I joined the line, I was eager to take the ride. However, someone cut in front of me, which made me start to lose patience. This situation didn't seem promising. I waited as the line inched forward. It felt like an hour had passed, but in reality, it was only @NUM1 minutes. People kept pushing ahead of me as if they didn't see me, and more followed suit. I reached the point where I was about to make a rude comment. Just as I was about to utter those harsh words, I quickly stopped myself. I remembered that I wanted my father to be proud of me. So, when it was finally my turn, I did the right thing. I was extremely proud of myself for remaining silent. After the ride ended, I rushed to my father. I was so proud of my tolerance. People cutting in front of me wasn't as bad as I thought. It seems that I can handle such situations positively. If they thought they could provoke me, they were partly right. But they were wrong if they expected me to say something offensive.
767	18693	7	2	On a daily basis, I am required to exhibit patience in challenging circumstances. I need to be particularly patient when engaging in or watching sports. Every weekend, my brother participates in a football league, and it can be quite tiresome. I have to endure nearly two hours for the games to conclude as my parents insist that I watch. My favorite sport is football, and as a first - baseman and an infielder, I must wait for the ball to come my way so that I can contribute to the team. Additionally, I have to be patient during the MEAP test because it is a long - lasting assessment, and I must wait until everyone has finished. As demonstrated, I am a patient person and am required to be so in numerous situations. Patience is an important virtue that helps me navigate through various aspects of my life.
768	18694	7	2	It was freezing cold, and all I could do was wait, and wait, and wait some more. I was waiting for the @CAPS1 @DATE1 for @CAPS2 to commence. I was with some friends, but they mostly engaged in their own conversations, leaving my friend @PERSON1 and me. Her dirty - blond hair whipped across her face, and she hunched her back against the wind. My yellow Labrador, @LOCATION1, tugged at his leash, causing @PERSON1, who was holding it, to stumble sideways. “Are you sure you don't want me to take him?” I asked for the tenth time. “No, I got it!” @PERSON1 said cheerfully. I was cold, bored, and hungry, but at least my arm wasn't being yanked. “Are you sure?” I felt terrible because @LOCATION1 was my dog, and I should have been holding the leash, although it wasn't an easy task. “No!” @PERSON1 said gently, “I got it!” @LOCATION1 pulled her again, and she fell into me. I caught her, and she mumbled an apology. I appreciated her help, but I still believed I should take the dog. All day, I had been complaining. Partly, I was joking about our bad luck with the weather, but mainly, I just wanted to start a conversation. “I think my hands are numb,” I said as I stuffed them into my pockets. “Well, at least it's not raining, like the weatherman predicted,” @PERSON1 smiled, and I returned the smile. A voice boomed from the speaker, “@CAPS8 walkers. Let's get moving!” I glared at @PERSON1 and asked one more time, “Do you want me to take him?” @PERSON1 patted my back and said slowly, “I got it.” In the end, I respected her determination to hold the leash, despite my concerns.
769	18695	7	2	A time when I demonstrated patience was when I babysat my little cousin. He was just a baby, so I knew that if he started crying or got upset, I couldn't get frustrated with him because of his age. There were moments when he would start crying for no obvious reason, and I really wanted to scream. However, I knew I couldn't and that I had to be patient with him. I also understood that getting upset or angry might make the situation worse for him. So, I had to wait for him to stop crying and for myself to calm down before approaching him. I was understanding and tolerant throughout, and I didn't lose my patience. Practicing patience is extremely important. I am truly proud of myself for being able to keep my composure in such a chaotic situation and not losing my temper with him or anyone else. Patience in these situations helps build better relationships and a more peaceful environment.
770	18696	7	2	“Ugh, why is the gym teacher taking so long?” @PERSON1 complained. “It's been hours,” they said. “It's only been @NUM1 minutes,” @PERSON2 replied. “Well, it has felt like a couple of hours,” @PERSON1 retorted. “You just need to have a little patience,” @CAPS5 explained. “Fine,” @PERSON1 said. “You sit here and have your so - called patience. I'll put my bag on the stage.” As @PERSON1 got up, everyone tried to tell them to sit down, but they just ignored them. “Come on, just sit down and be patient,” @PERSON2 said. “No way, I've been waiting too long. I'm bored, tired, and my feet hurt!” @PERSON1 yelled as they walked behind the stage. “We're going to get in trouble,” @PERSON2 said, looking down. “Who was just yelling?” the gym teacher shouted angrily. The gym teacher looked to his right and saw @PERSON1 behind the stage and said, “We could have played basketball, but @PERSON1 ruined it for everyone.” Because @PERSON1 didn't have any patience, no one got to play. I hope that today @PERSON1 will show a bit more patience so that we can all enjoy the class.
771	18697	7	2	I woke up before school and started getting ready. I gathered all my things and left the house. When I arrived at school, I hung out with my friends and had a great day. Around @NUM1, the @NUM2 hour ended, and it was time for lunch. I wasn't hungry, but my friend @CAPS1 wanted to eat. So, I waited for her, and then we went outside. Outside, we did back walkovers, handstands, backbends, front handsprings, cartwheels, and other similar activities. After the bell rang in the @NUM3 hour, it was recess. I wasn't feeling well because I was hungry. I just wanted to go home and eat something, but we had to wait until recess ended and then take the bus for about an hour. When I finally got home, I still didn't feel good. My dad asked me what was wrong, and I told him I was hungry. It was around @NUM4, and he said we had to wait until my mom got home at @TIME1. I had to be patient for @NUM5 hours. In the end, it was worth it because the dinner was delicious. If I had eaten something else before dinner, I probably wouldn't have eaten any of it. This story shows @NUM6 examples of me having to be patient.
772	18698	7	2	There have been few instances when I've demonstrated patience, but I'll share a couple of them with you. One such occasion was during a bus ride home. The bus driver, @PERSON1, made me sit at the back because she thought I talked too much and prohibited me from speaking throughout the journey. Initially, it was challenging, but I decided to do my homework, which kept me occupied. That was one time I managed to be patient, though not the only one. Another instance was when I was in line for a roller - coaster at Cedar Point. The sign at the start of the line indicated a @NUM1 - hour wait. However, since it was my friend's and my favorite ride, we didn't mind. The wait wasn't so bad because the experience of riding the coaster made it all worthwhile. These examples illustrate that there have been times when I've had to wait patiently, and there have even been longer waits in my life.
773	18700	7	2	Hi, my name is @LOCATION1 @DATE1. I'm going to tell you about a time when I had to be patient while waiting to go to a friend's house. My friend Savannah's dad is a firefighter. He had to go and put out a fire, so he couldn't pick me up until the next afternoon. I was really sad because it was the middle of @DATE2, and I hadn't seen Savannah in @NUM1 months. Through this experience, I learned that patience is an essential part of life. This was one of those times when I had to embrace it.
774	18701	7	2	On a @DATE1, I found myself at @CAPS1 @CAPS2, standing under the scorching sun. I could feel the sweat trickling down my face. Looking ahead, I realized there were at least two hours left in the line for the roller - coaster, the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5. The group @CAPS7 was quiet because they were getting irritated. Suddenly, a guy shouted, “@CAPS6 up!” Everyone in the line, except me, started screaming at each other. I didn't want to yell as it would only make @CAPS7 more agitated. An hour later, everyone calmed down. Then I looked ahead and saw that we were almost at the front. I wiped my face and smiled, then exclaimed, “@CAPS8 hoo!” @CAPS7 looked at me as if I were from another world. My mom asked, “what?” I replied, “We're almost at the front!” Soon, we were next to board the ride. When we entered, I fastened my seatbelt. The ride took off, and the breeze against my face felt wonderful. After the ride ended, I said, “I knew patience would pay off.” This was the time when I had to exercise patience.
775	18702	7	2	It was extremely hot, and we'd already been in line for an hour. I whined, “When can we go?” My parents replied, “Just be patient. We're almost at the front.” And that's exactly what I did. My body ached from walking around all day, but that wasn't going to stop me from enjoying the rides. Ten more minutes passed, and I got thirsty. My @CAPS3 and sister wanted to go with me to get a drink while my mom held our spot in line. We reached the booth. “I'll take water,” I said, feeling relieved. I thanked the person as I took the ice - cold water from their hands. As we walked back towards the line, I saw a bright, colorful shirt that said, “@CAPS2.” I couldn't resist asking, “@CAPS3, can I please get this shirt?” @CAPS3 responded, “We still have to wait a bit longer if we go back, but let's hurry up so your mom doesn't get impatient.” After getting the shirt, we rejoined the line. Thankfully, we were second in line. The ride operator said, “All aboard the mummy ride.” We boarded, and I knew that being patient had paid off because I could tell this ride was going to be amazing.
776	18703	7	2	My name is [name represented by @CAPS2]. This is a story about a time when I was patient. When I was eight years old, my mom said she'd take me to the fair that day. After lunch, we went. I wanted to ride the biggest ride there, so we had to wait in line. The line was very long. I didn't want to wait and complained for half the time. But I knew I had to be patient. I'm glad I was because the ride was a lot of fun. That day, I learned it was good to be patient. I told myself I'd never be impatient again. That's the story of the time I had to be patient at the fair.
777	18704	7	2	Patience is a valuable virtue. Let me share a time when I demonstrated patience. One morning, I had a dentist's appointment at [time represented by @NUM2] am, but we arrived at [time represented by @NUM1] am. My dad and I sat in the waiting room. My tooth was hurting, and I had nothing to do. There were no magazines to read and no TV. I was also really hungry as I hadn't had breakfast. By [time represented by @NUM4] am, I was struggling to wait. Then I remembered I had a [device represented by @CAPS2 @CAPS3.S] in my pocket. I took it out and started playing. Time passed quickly after that. This was the time I showed patience in a challenging situation.
778	18705	7	2	I'm going to tell you about a time when I was patient. One day, my dad and I went to the hospital to get a hip replacement. We had to wait in the waiting room for [number represented by @NUM1] hour. I kept wondering why it took so long. They kept telling us to wait another hour. I was in pain in my mouth and chest for two hours. Then I started counting the circling tiles on the floor for [number represented by @NUM3] minutes and remembered there were over [number represented by @NUM4] tiles. I didn't complain yet. After that, I played [game represented by @CAPS2] with my dad, won, and we spent [number represented by @NUM5] minutes. For the rest of the time, I played my [device represented by @CAPS3], like [game represented by @ORGANIZATION1]. It took a while, but I managed to be patient. After [number represented by @NUM6] more [unit], it was time to go home. My dad and I were extremely tired. I didn't complain even once, and that's the time I was patient.
779	18706	7	2	Patience is incredibly difficult, and not many people truly understand it. I'm currently on punishment for not doing what I was supposed to. So, I have to be patient and wait it out. Being patient is like waiting for a perfect team to come together. While on punishment, I'm just biding my time because I can't speed things up. If I could, I would. For now, I have to wait. I'll be on punishment for a while, so I need to be patient. I know it's hard, but most people have to go through this. Rushing isn't the way to go. Patience can help you in many ways and even save you time. It's a good thing to have when waiting for things like money, clothes, shoes, homes, food, pets, jobs, education, or transportation. If you rush, you might not get things the way you want. But if you're patient, you'll get exactly what you desire.
780	18707	7	2	"I'm sitting in the waiting room at [organization represented by @ORGANIZATION1]'s [place represented by @CAPS1 @CAPS2], waiting for my grandpa to reach the recovery room. I can't help but worry. What if something went wrong during the surgery? What if he doesn't make it? I ask my [relative represented by @CAPS3], ""Can we see grandpa now?"" She replies, ""[phrase represented by @CAPS4] Just be patient. Everything will be fine. Sit back, relax, and for heaven's sake, be patient!"" I respond with ""[phrase represented by @CAPS5]"". After an hour, I'm getting restless. I tell myself to calm down and be patient. Then a lady comes out and says, ""The surgery took a bit longer than expected, but everything went perfectly. He'll stay in the hospital for a week and a half at most."" That's fine with me as long as I can get out of this boring hospital. My mom says as soon as grandpa gets to the recovery room, we'll go see him and then leave. In the end, my patience paid off as I knew I'd soon see my grandpa."
781	18708	7	2	One instance when I demonstrated patience was during a car journey to @LOCATION2. The distance from my home to @LOCATION1 and then to @LOCATION2 is approximately @NUM1 hours. Thus, I had to remain seated in the car for that duration. The only available activities were listening to my iPod or sleeping, yet I engaged in neither. Evidently, it requires a great deal of patience to wait in a car for @NUM1 hours. After an hour passed, it felt like @NUM4 hours when one has nothing to do. At that point, I was tempted to disturb my sleeping sister, but I refrained. I then sought something to occupy myself. I took out my phone and started texting people, but received no responses. Looking out of the window made me drowsy. The journey seemed to take an eternity. Finally, after @NUM1 hours, we arrived at @LOCATION2. This was a time when I showed patience.
782	18709	7	2	I set off, specifically to the rama. At @CAPS3 @CAPS1, I got to see a large number of cool old cars, as well as some truly antique ones. Some cars were old and rusty, while others were new and state - of - the - art. At @CAPS4 @CAPS1, I saw a sign that read “Come see Chip Foose!” So, I went to look around. “I found him!” I exclaimed. “@CAPS2,” @CAPS8's brother yelled. “@CAPS3 is!” At @CAPS4 @CAPS1, I went to the end of the line. It was @CAPS5! I thought the line would die down after half an hour, but I was very wrong. It was still @CAPS5! The line I initially thought was long was nothing compared to the current one. So, I had to keep waiting. @CAPS8's brother reached a point where he was so restless that he felt he could run a mile; otherwise, he would explode. So, I accompanied him for a walk. I was relieved because standing idle for @NUM1 hours is extremely boring. I myself was on the verge of either getting up to walk around or falling asleep. After we got back, I sat down again and continued waiting. At @CAPS4 @CAPS1, I heard the security guard say, “Stop! The people behind these folks have to leave and come back after the break.” We were the last people in line. In front of us was a nerdy couple with seemingly no other activities. @CAPS8's brother started to cry because he didn't get Foose's autograph. The kind nerdy couple said, “Here, take our spot. You seem to really want this autograph.” @CAPS8's brother replied, “Sniff, @CAPS9 won't it!!” After 51/@NUM1 hours of endless waiting, I finally got the autograph. That was a time when I had to exercise patience.
783	18710	7	2	Patients are individuals who have been injured in some way and are in the hospital, either in the process of recovery or getting better. I was once a patient. I was sick for a long time, so my mom took me to the hospital, and I received an injection. On our way out of the hospital, I blacked out and hit my chin on the door. As a result, we had to stay there for about an hour. That was the only time I was in the hospital as a patient.
784	18711	7	2	Yesterday, while at home, I showed patience while watching the movie @CAPS1. I waited for a long time until the food was ready. I was so engrossed in the movie that I couldn't take my eyes off the TV because it was so good. However, when I got really hungry, I had a first plate of food, and then a second one. After the second plate, I couldn't finish the rest of my food. But I didn't complain about being hungry. This shows that I was patient during that time.
785	18712	7	2	Patience means waiting calmly when someone else is busy. I'll share a time when I had to be patient. One morning, my mom came home from work. I told her I really wanted to go to my friend's house. But she kept telling me to wait. She wasn't even done with her tasks. I asked if I could walk to my friend's house, but she said no and that I had to be patient until she was finished. My dad was leaving for work in the afternoon, so I had an idea. I asked him if he could drop me off at my friend's house on his way to work. But he said no because he was already late, and when I checked the time, I saw he was right. Since my mom was almost done and my dad was leaving, I decided to be patient. I sat down and watched TV while waiting for my mom. When she went into the room, I asked if she was done, and she said yes. I excitedly asked if she was taking me, and she agreed. I was so happy. I rushed to the car, and we went to my friend's house. That day, my patience paid off.
786	18713	7	2	I believe patience is the capacity to remain calm while waiting. For instance, daily activities such as queuing up for lunch, waiting for someone to pick you up, or waiting for a doctor's examination all demand patience. I find myself needing to exercise patience approximately @NUM1 times a day. Firstly, I must be patient as my mom drives me to school. Additionally, I have to wait patiently for class assignments to be distributed, for classes to end, for lunch to start, and for nightfall, among other things. I've heard people say that patience is a virtue. Initially, I had no idea what that meant, but I'm confident that by being patient, I'll eventually understand. In conclusion, patience is essential, and people utilize it every day. I consider patience a precious gift and truly cherish it.
787	18714	7	2	On @DATE2, I finally grasped what my mom was telling @CAPS1. She explained that she couldn't get @CAPS1 anything for @CAPS2 because she had to pay the bills. She felt she wasn't doing enough for @CAPS1, but I assured her I was content with what I had. All I wanted for @CAPS2 was to be with her, yet she didn't realize that she was doing an excellent job on her own, especially since my father wasn't helping her take care of us. My mom had to look after her @NUM1 kids, including herself, and @NUM2 of them were her husband's. My dad would always claim that if he had the means, he'd provide for @CAPS1. But as @CAPS1, I didn't want to hear his excuses because I knew they were lies. My mom had to take on two jobs to manage everything. Then, when @DATE1 arrived, everything seemed fine until my grandma passed away. My mom, auntie, and uncle @PERSON1 all had to earn money for her funeral expenses. She looked beautiful, and everything went smoothly. However, even now, we still cry and think about her. That was a time when I struggled to be patient because it was too difficult to accept that she was gone. My mom and the others keep telling @CAPS1 that I need to understand she's in a better place with some of her loved ones. To this day, I still can't comprehend what it means when someone says they're gone. But @CAPS6 is forgotten.
788	18715	7	2	One day, we were on our way to @ORGANIZATION1. The journey was supposed to take only three hours, but one of the cars following us had a flat tire due to something that slashed it. We had to wait for an hour until they got the tire fixed and caught up with us. They also had to deal with traffic and long stop - lights. We waited at a gas station, and eventually, they joined us. Everyone used the restrooms, which took fifteen minutes. The restrooms were extremely dirty, so it took some time to make them suitable for use. There were three cars with five to six people in each, which further delayed us. After everyone was done, we got back into our vehicles and continued our journey to @ORGANIZATION1. Along the way, we passed numerous signs that said “@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1” and “@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 up ahead”. When we finally arrived, I saw a huge, digital sign that played music and said “@CAPS1 to .@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1”! We were finally there! We were overjoyed and had an amazing time. By: unica @CAPS2 .Amstrong.
789	18716	7	2	"@PERSON1, let's go! This line is taking forever!"" ""@CAPS1 @PERSON2, just be patient!"" ""@CAPS2?"" @PERSON2 asked. ""@CAPS3 @NUM1,"" replied the other. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS2?"" ""You've never heard of patience?"" ""@CAPS1"" ""@CAPS6, are you telling me that in all these thirteen years, you've never heard of patience?"" ""@CAPS1"" ""@CAPS6, you're seriously saying that in thirteen years, you've never heard of patience?"" ""@CAPS9,"" @PERSON2 replied, sounding confused. ""@CAPS10 @CAPS12, well, patience is when... Wow, I never thought patience would be so hard to explain."" ""@CAPS11, now do you see why I don't know?"" ""I got it!"" he yelled, snapping his fingers. One person in the line was staring at them, and their faces turned red. But @PERSON1 ignored it and said, ""@CAPS12 @CAPS6, patience is like when you wait a long time without minding it, and in the end, because you waited patiently, you get what you wanted."" @CAPS6 @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 waited in line. Soon, they were next. ""@CAPS14 tickets to @CAPS15 @CAPS16, please,"" @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 said excitedly. ""@CAPS17, ummm, hold on a sec while I open a new package of tickets,"" the ticket booth man told them. @PERSON2 glared at @PERSON1 and said, ""@CAPS12 @CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21: @CAPS19 @CAPS20 in this line for twenty minutes, and now I have to wait more?"" ""@CAPS23, you go, kids. That's @CAPS14 dollars, please."" @PERSON2 was embarrassed but happy to get the tickets. @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS11, you waited and got what you wanted. That's called patience."" @CAPS6 @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 sat in the movie theater and watched a great movie. If they hadn't been patient, they would never have gotten to see their new favorite movie."
790	18717	7	2	Patience plays a crucial role in life. Without patience, one is likely to lead an unhappy life. Almost every aspect of life requires patience. For example, at work, if you're not patient with your boss or colleagues, you might mess things up. I often find it challenging to be patient with my parents. Sometimes, I can't stand them and lose my temper, becoming impatient. This usually makes the situation worse for me. I love my brother, but like most younger siblings, he can be extremely annoying. When he gets on my nerves, I become very impatient. Sometimes, I get so angry and impatient that I lose control, and I always end up in trouble when I lash out at him. I'm always seen as the bad guy because of my lack of patience. As I've grown older, I've realized how important it is to be patient with others. It makes life much easier and more enjoyable when interacting with the people around me every day. That's why when you're patient, you're more likely to achieve your goals, but when you're impatient in an attempt to get your way, it rarely works.
791	18718	7	2	I was patient when I had to wait for my friend to come over. I was really excited at first, but then I had to keep waiting. Eventually, she finally arrived. That's the whole story.
792	18719	7	2	I demonstrated patience when I had to wait for my grandpa in the emergency room. His heart isn't doing well, and he's frequently in and out of the ER. Every day, he has to see his doctor to manage his heart condition. This is why I've had to be patient. It's challenging, but I know it's necessary for his health.
793	18720	7	2	Patience is a virtue that one can cultivate when in a calm and relaxed state. I practice patience daily at school. I'm patient with my teachers and with the kids who like to pick on and tease others. There are days when I manage to stay patient, but on other days, it indicates that something isn't right, and my patience wears thin. I truly appreciate having patience as it helps me stay relaxed. I firmly believe that patience can increase one's lifespan. Many people in the world lack patience, and I think it shortens their lifespan. I'm certain that if I didn't have patience, I wouldn't be able to stay in school because some kids have issues, get bad grades, and it would be difficult to deal with.
794	18721	7	2	In this narrative essay, I'll share several instances when I had to be patient. One was waiting to leave school on a holiday. I was extremely eager to get out of school on a Friday. To make matters worse, the clock seemed to move incredibly slowly, and I had a well - planned schedule for the day. With each passing minute, new thoughts filled my head, and I even wished I could make the clock change just by staring at it. I was on the verge of getting a call home, but something (the @CAPS1.A) saved me, and I had to be understanding. Another time was when I had to wait for my mom to wake up to go to the mall and get a game. I got a @NUM1 @NUM3 on my report last year, and a new game was coming out. My mom had gone to the club the night before and was fast asleep; it was almost impossible to wake her up. These experiences taught me the importance of patience.
795	18722	7	2	I'm currently working on my comic book, though I haven't started drawing it yet. Here's a key scene from the @NUM1 book. “@CAPS1, @LOCATION1, are we there yet?” @CAPS2 asked curiously. “@CAPS3, not yet,” @PERSON1 replied, her voice tinged with fear. They were completely lost. “Are we there yet?” little @CAPS2 asked again. “@CAPS3, @CAPS2, you'll have to be patient,” @ORGANIZATION1 said, quickly growing annoyed. They walked for hours, but there was still no sign of the castle. Little @CAPS2 was eager to meet the queen, imagining her as kind, patient, and beautiful. @ORGANIZATION1 could tell that @CAPS2 was tired, so she lifted @CAPS2 onto her shoulders and said, “@CAPS9 if you can @CAPS9 the castle from here, @CAPS2.” After a few long, patient minutes, @CAPS2 finally saw the castle. “I @CAPS9 it, I @CAPS9 it!” she exclaimed with a big smile. She jumped off @ORGANIZATION1's shoulder and ran down the narrow pathway. Her patience had paid off, and she was overjoyed, not only for finding the castle but also for learning the value of patience.
796	18723	7	2	One instance when I demonstrated patience was when I got my braces. I was extremely nervous, which made it challenging to remain patient. I waited in the waiting area for approximately fifteen minutes before the assistant called me in. First, she explained the procedure to me. Then, she took an X - ray of my teeth. Next, she applied metal bonds to the back of my teeth using a very strong glue. After that, she put the brackets on with the same strong glue. Subsequently, the assistant placed the wire between the brackets and metal hands. Finally, she asked me to choose a color and then applied it. The entire process took two hours, during which I had to sit in the dental chair. It was difficult, but I managed to be patient. That was the time I showed patience.
797	18724	7	2	"So, what do you want for your birthday?"" ""A PlayStation 5."" ""What else do you want?"" ""A PlayStation 5."" I've been longing for a PlayStation 5 for ages. It's my thirteenth birthday, and I've never desired anything more. All my friends have one. Whenever I visited their houses, we played day and night. I really wanted one, Dad. The only issue was that it cost $500, and I already had a $200 birthday party planned. In total, it would be a $700 birthday. So, Mom and I reached an agreement: if I pay $250, she'll pay the other half. From that day on, I asked everyone for money as a birthday gift. I didn't want any other presents; I had my sights set on the PlayStation 5. Usually, we have a family party where relatives come, give presents, and celebrate. I knew that's where I'd get my $250. Everything seemed perfect; I had it all planned out. Have the family party a couple of days after my birthday and then go buy my PlayStation 5! I didn't mind waiting two or three days. I thought I could handle it. ""Hey, Mom, when are we having the family party?"" ""October 15th."" At that moment, I was furious. You might not realize that October 15th is a whole month away from my birthday. If waiting 30 days isn't being patient, then I don't know what is. As of now, I still haven't gotten my PlayStation 5, but in two days, I'll have a stack of cash in my hands and head to the game store. If I had to wait any longer, I probably wouldn't have made it. I'm not very patient."
798	18725	7	2	A time I showed patience was at my friend's cousin's birthday party. I was patient because throughout the party, I was waiting for an answer from my parents and my friend's parents to see if my friend and I could have a sleep - over. While we waited, my friends and I colored a few dinosaur pictures, watched a movie, had dinner, played in the basement, went to the garage, ate cake and ice cream, decorated and painted our dance tool boxes, colored more pictures, and watched my friend's cousin open his presents. As it started getting dark outside, we tried to take a group nap, but it was difficult with all the kids screaming. Soon, it was time for my friend to leave. My parents said we could have a sleep - over, but unfortunately, my friend's mom said no because my friend has a volleyball game in the morning. It felt like my waiting was in vain. However, I later realized that when you're patient, you're more likely to get what you want.
799	18726	7	2	I've learned from experience that being patient is crucial. Once, I decided to babysit my cousins, Jake and Tom. Jake is eight years old, and Tom is six. I had to watch them for three hours on my own. I could call my aunt, Sarah, for help if needed, but if I did, I wouldn't get paid. I was supposed to be paid twenty dollars if I could handle Jake and Tom. I arrived at my aunt's house at exactly one - thirty. Jake and Tom had just returned from a friend's birthday party, where they'd surely eaten a lot of sugary foods like candy, cake, and ice cream. I could tell they were hyper as soon as I walked in; they greeted me with bubbly attitudes. My aunt left, and I was left with them. Jake wanted to play on his PlayStation, while Tom wanted to play with a board game. I started getting irritated when they began arguing about what to do. I was about to call Sarah, but then I decided that being a bit more patient was worth getting paid. So, I found a game we could all play and enjoy. After playing for two hours, we went to the backyard. Jake and Tom played tag while I watched. But Tom, being unfair, denied that Jake had tagged him and started to pout. I was frustrated and reached for the phone. However, with only one hour left, I decided I could handle them. I suggested we play hide - and - seek instead. Even though I usually dislike being the seeker, I told them I'd be the one to count so they wouldn't fight. Finally, Sarah came home, and I got paid the money I'd earned. That day, I learned that patience always pays off.
800	18727	7	2	"Patience is about being polite while waiting for someone or something. It is considered polite to be patient. If you're not patient, it can be seen as being rather mean because you might be judging someone or pressuring them to act quickly. For example, when waiting in line for a ride at an amusement park, a patient person is nice to others by not trying to rush the process. In contrast, an impatient person might say things like ""Hurry up! I want to be on that ride"" or ""Hurry up and start the ride already."" This clearly shows the difference. Generally, if you're a patient person, people are likely to like you. On the other hand, if you're impatient, you'll probably have a hard time getting along with others. In conclusion, being patient is an important quality that can positively impact our relationships."
801	18729	7	2	There have been numerous instances when I have demonstrated patience. One such occasion was during the @CAPS1 test. The test was divided into different parts, and we were allotted a substantial amount of time for each part. I always completed my work ahead of schedule, but I was not permitted to proceed to the next part. Moreover, we were prohibited from talking or leaving our seats. I was eager to move on as I had a great deal of time remaining and nothing to do. Everyone in the class also finished early. Since we couldn't talk, we just sat there waiting for the testing time to end. I believe everyone wanted to proceed to the next part, but no one complained or said a word. We had to endure this for a few days every year. Every year, I always manage to be patient. This is the story of one such time when I showed patience.
802	18730	7	2	"Patience is defined as the ability to understand a situation and refrain from complaining. A patient person can wait calmly without constantly fidgeting. Such individuals are more likely to achieve success in life. As @PERSON2's approach drew nearer, the order of those she passed was as follows: first @PERSON6, then @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, and @PERSON7. She was approaching my row next. It felt like an eternity. I kept thinking that someone would pinch me and wake me up from this nightmare. When @PERSON3 addressed @PERSON5 in a disappointed tone, saying that @CAPS2 had performed poorly on the test and suggesting that she move on, I silently prayed that she wouldn't utter the dreaded word. To my relief, she responded with @CAPS3. When I got home, my mom read the letter and concurred with its contents. I couldn't help but wonder why I had to face this setback. The following week, the results were announced. As she was about to speak, I took a deep breath, reminding myself to be patient and not to complain. I nodded with a wide smile, so wide that it felt like my lips might fall off. A few weeks later, I gradually improved. @PERSON4, a kind and considerate person, told me that I was making progress by waiting and observing the results. Finally, the day of the test with a perfect score arrived. I was both nervous and confident. A week later, @PERSON1 surpassed @PERSON6, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, and @PERSON7. With a smile on her face, she said, ""Good job, @PERSON5. You got an A -."" It was challenging at the beginning, but my patience paid off, and I achieved a good grade. In conclusion, patience is crucial as it allows us to wait and see the results. It has taught me to be tolerant in the future, and a patient person is more likely to achieve their goals."
803	18731	7	2	"On @DATE1, I am currently demonstrating patience as I am waiting for @CAPS1's new phone. The reason for this wait dates back to @DATE2 when I spilled orange juice on @CAPS1's phone. People started calling me strange and irresponsible. Initially, the phone seemed fine, but then one day, the speaker stopped working. I couldn't make calls or listen to music. @CAPS1 was heart - broken. I immediately ran to @CAPS1's dad and informed him of the problem. He first laughed and shook his head, then took the phone to test it. After disconnecting it, it still didn't work, and his face showed shock. He asked me how it happened. At that moment, I was so stunned that I couldn't think straight. Then, the memory of me spilling the orange juice came to mind. Something inside me told me to keep it a secret from @CAPS1's dad, but I decided to tell him anyway. He laughed again, and I looked at him in confusion. He said, ""You are going to have to wait until I get the money."" @CAPS1 remained calm on the outside, but here I am, still patiently waiting for the new phone. This experience has taught me the importance of patience in dealing with unexpected situations."
804	18732	7	2	"@PERSON1, a typical fourteen - year - old, had a @CAPS1, a @CAPS2, and an annoying eight - year - old brother named @PERSON2. It seemed that @CAPS9's parents weren't very creative when it came to naming. At the beginning of the school year, @CAPS9's @CAPS3 had to take @LOCATION1 clothes shopping. The problem was that @CAPS5 was made to go. @CAPS5 didn't complain for a month. Oh, how @CAPS5 wished not to be in that situation! But it was too late. @PERSON1 thought about being in the boys' department, helping @CAPS9's @CAPS1 pick clothes for @ORGANIZATION1. Suddenly, @CAPS5 saw something that made @CAPS5 gasp. @CAPS5 realized that @CAPS5 might not be able to avoid being noticed by some guys from school since @CAPS5 was in the boys' department picking out clothes. @CAPS5 wanted to rush to the girls' bathroom and stay there until @CAPS9 was done. The situation was extremely awkward. @CAPS9's @CAPS1 said, ""Thank you for being so understanding. I know it was difficult for you, and you didn't complain."" @CAPS8 replied, ""@PERSON1, what..."". As @CAPS5 left the class, @CAPS5 thought that being patient is indeed a good thing. Patience helped @CAPS5 get through this uncomfortable situation, and it is a valuable quality in life."
805	18733	7	2	On a certain occasion, I showed patience at the barber shop. I went to the barber shop at @NUM1 with my sister and my niece. I was getting my hair cut by a professional barber. I had to wait until @NUM2 to finally get my turn for a haircut. This was a clear instance where I exercised patience. Patience in such situations allows us to wait for our turn and achieve the desired result, in this case, a well - done haircut.
806	18734	7	2	While at a shop, I encountered a friend from @LOCATION1. He initiated a conversation about a patient. I admitted that I didn't understand the main concept, and he then explained what it was and how it was produced. Subsequently, he shared a story related to it, and I learned from that story.
807	18736	7	2	Everyone has to be patient every day, and I'm no exception. Have you ever had to be patient with a sibling? I recently experienced this when I wanted my sister to go outside with me. We have a special willow - tree that we often visit. However, she refused to go out and exercise. Eventually, I had to tell our mother. When we finally went out, she brought a book. We walked to the middle of the neighborhood and then went separate ways. I didn't like this and went to a friend's house until she realized I wasn't going to follow her. I've been annoyed by having to be patient, but since people say patience is a virtue, I guess I'll accept it.
808	18737	7	2	Patience, as I understand it, is about being tolerant. Patient people often face difficulties. Today, the concept of patience is relevant to us. Samh is here today, and she's doing something. But she's taking a long time, about an hour. In the end, patience plays a role in how we deal with such situations.
809	18738	7	2	One time I showed patience was when a new video game was about to be released. I asked my dad if we could pre - order it, but he said no and that I had to wait until @CAPS2. I waited until @CAPS2, but I still didn't get the game. I didn't say anything about it. Then, on my birthday, when I opened my last gift, it was the video game! I was extremely excited. I gave my parents @CAPS4, and then my brother and I went to play it. This experience taught me that patience can be rewarding.
810	18739	7	2	When you have patience, you're calmer, more peaceful, and happier. It's like when your birthday is next week, and you're eager to get your presents right away instead of waiting. If you get angry, start hitting things, and misbehave, you won't have good behavior. This might make your parents angry, and they could return some of your gifts. That's not patience. Impatience is when you get mad because you can't get what you want right away. In contrast, patience helps maintain a positive state and better relationships.
811	18740	7	2	"Patience is crucial for a long road - trip as it actually makes the journey seem faster. One time, my family and I were loading up for a three - hour drive to the @CAPS1 water park in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. Everyone was in the car and ready, except my parents. They went inside to check everything, get directions, and call my uncle to see if @CAPS3 was ready. Meanwhile, us kids sat in the car waiting. My brother @CAPS2 got restless and couldn't stop moving. Eventually, @CAPS3, who was the least patient among us, even less patient than my two little sisters, exclaimed, ""That's it! I'm going in to get them!"" @NUM1 minutes later, Tyler came out and said they were coming, but they didn't appear for another @NUM2 minutes, which made my brother angry. When he asked, ""@CAPS4 took you so long?"", my dad replied that they had to make sure uncle @PERSON1 was ready to leave. Once we started driving, everyone fell asleep except my dad, who was driving. In the end, all of us were patient, except my brother @CAPS3, who is still impatient to this day."
812	18741	7	2	Children are taught the importance of patience as they grow up. These life lessons are used when needed. I remember my mother constantly telling me to be patient during my childhood. I gradually learned and realized how essential patience is. When you're impatient, you should understand that people are likely trying their best for you. I truly grasped the meaning of patience when I was seven at the mall. Even though I had known about the importance of waiting earlier, I wasn't always content and patient. We were shopping at my favorite store at the time, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. My sister @PERSON1, who was @NUM1, and I had a large number of clothes. After waiting about @NUM2 minutes, a dressing room finally opened. But suddenly, @ORGANIZATION1 rushed in. I was crying because I was ahead of her, and it was unfair. She cut in line even though I was the one who had waited @NUM2 minutes. After her @NUM4 - minute fashion show with my mom, I was fed up and wanted to try on my clothes. I knocked on the door, and she said she'd hurry. I waited another @NUM5 minutes, and then she came out. My patience was rewarded as I finally got into the dressing room. That day, I learned that whether the wait is long or short, you'll get what you want in the end. So, be patient, and good things will come your way, just like karma.
813	18742	7	2	The last time I went to the doctor, @CAPS1 and my brother @CAPS2 had to wait in the waiting room until we were called in for our shots. Everyone else seemed to go ahead of us, but we remained patient. Sitting there got really boring, but we held on. After about two or three hours, our patience started to wear thin. So, we went up to ask what was going on and found out that we had forgotten to sign in. Once we signed in, we were able to get in. This experience shows that sometimes, a bit of oversight can cause a delay, but patience can help us through such situations.
814	18743	7	2	Patience involves waiting your turn and remaining calm without complaining. For example, being patient throughout the day while waiting for school to end, instead of complaining about school being too long or faking illness to go home. Patience isn't just about waiting for something to be over; it can also be about waiting in lines or waiting to use something. Not everyone is patient. I'm not very patient when it comes to getting home on time. I dislike waiting for people, @CAPS2, or food. However, I'm very patient when it comes to shots or anything related to doctors. In conclusion, patience varies from person to person and situation to situation.
815	18744	7	2	"It was a @DATE1 morning in Wisconsin on the last day of deer hunting. I got up and dressed. My dad, my friend, and I sat down to eat pancakes and drink milk. Outside, it was about @NUM1 degrees, so we bundled up and headed out. It was a bit scary in the woods at night because we didn't know what or who was out there. But once we got to the stand, my fears went away. After @NUM2 hours in the stand, my dad told me, ""@CAPS1 time to get back and eat."" I said, ""Not right now."" My dad repeated, ""@CAPS1,"" and then said he'd see me later. When he came back, it was around @NUM3. Suddenly, a buck emerged from the brush. I raised my gun and shot it. It dropped right away. I've never been so proud in my life. This hunting experience was truly unforgettable."
816	18745	7	2	"Patience is a virtue that manifests as tolerance and understanding. There was a time when I exemplified great patience. One day, as we prepared for the back - to - school shopping, I heard someone ask, ""@CAPS1 can @CAPS3 go yet!?"" ""@CAPS2"" replied, ""@CAPS3 need to buy all of your school supplies."" I've always disliked back - to - school shopping. It meant spending @NUM1 hours with @CAPS1 in a store, searching for clothes, notebooks, pencils, binders, and pens. ""@CAPS4 I really have to go too?"" I asked. ""@CAPS5 patient ok?"" came the response. I replied with ""@CAPS6"". Every time I had to get clothes or pencils or wait for @CAPS1, I grew more patient. I'd just sit there and wait. Strangely, the day seemed to pass much faster. Although @CAPS7 had been @NUM1 hours, it only felt like twenty minutes when @CAPS3 left. I was so eager that I didn't want to wait until next year; I was ready to go shopping all over again!"
817	18747	7	2	Patience is characterized by a calm demeanor and an absence of complaints. A patient person is understanding and tolerant. When one is patient with a task or situation, they remain steady. Patience provides ample time and a sense of calm. A patient individual endures difficulties. When waiting to obtain something without knowing when it will arrive, that is an act of patience. When one is patient, they are calm. In conclusion, patience is a valuable quality that helps individuals navigate through various situations calmly and steadily.
818	18748	7	2	"Patience implies not complaining about time - consuming tasks. It is about being tolerant and understanding. There are several reasons to be patient. For instance, when waiting in an extremely long line, if you keep saying things like, ""@CAPS1, this takes @CAPS5"" or ""@CAPS1, when @CAPS3 @CAPS6 leave"", your @CAPS1 might think, ""@CAPS4 my gosh would you just stop talking?"" or might even want to scream. As a result, @CAPS1 may not take you to places that involve waiting again because you're too impatient to handle it. On the other hand, there are reasons not to be impatient. For example, if you have a meeting with your teacher and you're late, you'll make a bad first impression. Suppose your @CAPS1 is on the phone and you keep saying, ""@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS1 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9!"", waiting impatiently. However, patience is a gentle way of waiting. Even if you're picturing yourself screaming at the person you're waiting for inside, on the outside, you're patiently waiting. So, having patience is a good thing. Try to practice it and don't let your inner feelings ruin the external situation."
819	18749	7	2	Patience is demonstrated when one waits without rushing. Rushing is the opposite of being patient. Another aspect of patience is staying calm and avoiding anger. When people say they're losing their patience, it means they're on the verge of getting angry. I once experienced patience when I waited for @CAPS2 to come. I waited and waited without rushing. I knew it was @CAPS2's birthday, and though there was no telling when @CAPS2 would arrive, I held my ground. Finally, @CAPS2 showed up, proving that patience pays off in the end.
820	18750	7	2	"I remember a time when I was patient. @CAPS1 came, and I started to feel hungry. So, I went inside and asked, ""When is dinner @CAPS2?"" The response was that it would be ready in an hour. Despite my hunger, I patiently waited for the meal to be prepared, showing that I could exercise patience even when my physical needs were calling."
821	18751	7	2	Patience can be likened to a valve. Here is a tale about patience. Long ago, there was a young girl named @PERSON1. She resided with her uncle, @ORGANIZATION1. One day, @PERSON1 decided to venture out and play. She informed her uncle that she would be in the woods and that he need not worry about her. @ORGANIZATION1 advised her to be cautious and to watch out for the wicked witch. @PERSON1 skipped off towards the woods. Upon reaching the woods, she径直 made her way to her favorite spot, the tree - fort that her uncle had built for her approximately a year ago. When she arrived, she climbed to the top and opened the door. What awaited her inside was completely unexpected. There sat the wicked witch. When @PERSON1 did not return home that night, the uncle began to worry. He searched high and low for her but found no trace. He attempted to be patient, yet it was a difficult feat. The next day, @PERSON1's uncle was arrested because the police suspected that he had kidnapped @PERSON1. He had to exercise patience once again. In the end, the police located both the witch and @PERSON1, and @PERSON1's uncle's patience was rewarded; he was set free. From that day forward, @ORGANIZATION1 learned the value of patience. This was a time when uncle @ORGANIZATION1 demonstrated patience.
822	18752	7	2	This week, I've shown a great deal of patience. I really wanted a Wii, but no one was willing to buy it for me. So, I saved my money for a long time. Then, I had to wait what seemed like weeks, which was actually @NUM1 days (@NUM2 week). I was counting down the days, and that only made the time feel longer. So, I told myself that I didn't want it anymore to avoid being overly anxious. That approach kind of worked. But to be honest, when I finally got the Wii, it wasn't as much fun as I'd thought it would be. Despite the letdown, the experience taught me the importance of patience in waiting for what I want.
823	18753	7	2	In my view, I'm a highly impatient person. Whenever I ask someone to stop doing something, they'd better stop immediately, or else I'll get angry. Also, I'm not the type of kid who patiently waits for dinner; I'll snack until it's time. At school, I can't stand listening to endless instructions. That reminds me, my teacher is driving me crazy. He has absolutely no patience at all. If we make even the slightest noise, he goes on a rampage. Overall, I firmly believe that people these days need to cultivate more patience in their daily lives.
824	18754	7	2	Patience is a virtue that many, including myself, often lack. However, the head coach of the @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION4, @PERSON1, is an exception. Over the past few years, @PERSON1 has shown remarkable patience. Instead of pushing his team to perform beyond their capabilities, he simply encouraged them to do their best and see the outcome. That year, the @ORGANIZATION4 ended up with a @NUM1 record. Due to having the second - worst record in the national @ORGANIZATION3, they secured the second pick in the twenty - tend @ORGANIZATION6 draft. In that draft, the @ORGANIZATION4 selected @ORGANIZATION5, a defensive lineman from the @ORGANIZATION2. He is an outstanding player. The @ORGANIZATION4's other pick was a fast running back named @CAPS1 @CAPS2 from the @ORGANIZATION1. Thanks to @PERSON1's patience and his understanding of his players' talents, his team is performing exceptionally well this year, highlighting the power of patience in coaching.
825	18756	7	2	Who really enjoys being patient? It's so boring and mostly just wastes your time. But we all know it's good to be patient. I'm not a very patient person, but there have been many times when I've had to be. When I was @NUM1 years old, I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six, not counting me. I loved video games, and I had @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one GameCube and one controller. It was extremely difficult to be patient and wait for my turn because my older brothers always got to play first and never wanted to stop. One time was even worse than the rest. I got a brand - new video game called @PERSON1 Bros and couldn't wait to play it. But when I got home, my brothers snatched it from my hands and ran upstairs to play. I was really sad and angry, but I didn't complain. I just sat behind the door of the room they were in, with tears in my eyes. I felt so empty, but I still didn't say a word. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally, my brother opened the door and let me in, not very nicely, but at least I got to play. To this day, I remember how hard it was, but it was worth it in the end. So, when you have to wait for something you really want to do, just be patient, and it will pay off.
826	18757	7	2	One day, while walking outside, I spotted a snake on a rock. I called out to my older brother, who was engrossed in a game. He said, “Hold on, I need to beat this level.” But the snake was starting to move, so I urged him again. Finally, after ten minutes, he emerged from the house and stared at the snake in my hand. He asked, “Why do you have a snake?” I replied, “I thought it was cool.” He liked it too and then we let the snake go. This experience was an interesting encounter with nature and my brother's reaction made it even more memorable.
827	18758	7	2	One night, my sister, @PERSON1, and I were asleep while our parents were on the computer. Our parents usually don't stay up that late, so I assumed my dad was doing some work. In the morning, when we woke up, our mom and dad were standing in the kitchen with smiles. Dad had something behind his back. I wondered what it could be. I asked Mom what was going on. She said nothing, and then Dad slowly brought out a document. The heading read “@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8.” Our parents were smirking. My sister and I looked at each other in amazement. We both realized we were going on a cruise! I excitedly checked the dates on the paper: “@DATE2 @NUM1 - @DATE2.” Today was @DATE1. I told Dad it was two months away. Dad said I had to be patient. I expressed my disappointment, but Dad said good things come to those who wait. I nodded. The first couple of weeks were tough, but as time passed, it got easier. On <@NUM2 @NUM1, @DATE3</@CAPS15>, we were on the plane for the cruise. I was so excited and Dad was proud of my patience. This experience taught me the value of waiting.
828	18759	7	2	I'm going to share a time when I showed patience. I wanted to get the new game Halo Reach, so I had to save up money to pre - order it. I did a lot of work, like cutting the lawn at my house and other people's lawns for two dollars each. After about two months, I had three hundred dollars. I pre - ordered the game and was told to wait three weeks. During this time, I used the leftover money to buy some other stuff. Finally, the game arrived in the mail. This was a clear example of how I used patience to wait for something I really wanted.
829	18760	7	2	There was once a girl, @PERSON1, who was very impatient. One day, she was going to get her driver's license and was extremely excited. When she arrived at the licensing place, she saw about @NUM1 people waiting. She thought, “Why do there have to be so many people here?” After waiting for about @NUM2 minutes, she got very angry because only one person got their license in that time. She threw a fit and complained about having to wait for experienced adults to renew their licenses. She went home and called her friend @CAPS3, saying she'd never get her license. @CAPS3 told her to calm down and stop being impatient. @PERSON1 said the line was long, but @CAPS3 cut her off and said if she kept running home crying, she'd never get her license. @CAPS3 also said the line was always long and she had to wait @NUM2 hours to get hers. She advised @PERSON1 to take her phone. The next day, @PERSON1 went back with her phone and a book. While waiting, she texted, went online, and read for her book project. She didn't even notice how time passed. She waited for @NUM5 hours but only thought it was @NUM4 because she was occupied. When she finally got her license, she felt great. She was the second in school to get it after @PERSON2. She thanked @PERSON2 for teaching her to be patient, and @PERSON2 said it was no problem. This experience helped @PERSON1 learn the importance of patience.
830	18761	7	2	One time I showed patience was when my sister broke my brand - new futon. I had just gotten it that day and was in the living room watching a movie. Suddenly, I heard strange noises like “@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, thump, crack!” I rushed upstairs and saw one sister on the bed and the other standing there looking pale. Instead of yelling at them, I showed patience. Later, I got another unbroken futon. Now, my sisters know not to mess with breakable things. This incident shows how I was able to control my emotions and be patient in a frustrating situation.
831	18762	7	2	Patience is characterized by understanding and tolerance. A patient individual endures difficulties without complaint. One instance when I demonstrated patience was during my elementary - school days. There was a half - day at school, but my parents were unaware of it. After school, I waited in the parking lot for nearly @NUM1 minutes for my parents to pick me up. I began to worry that they wouldn't come until a teacher noticed me and inquired about my situation. After I explained, the teacher allowed me to call my parents. My dad apologized and came to get me, and I was finally able to go home. This experience shows that patience helps in dealing with unexpected situations.
832	18763	7	2	I've shown patience on numerous occasions, but one particular time was when my dad and I ordered a new game console. We were told it would arrive at our porch in two weeks. For me, those two weeks felt like an eternity, but I knew I had to be patient. Throughout those fourteen days, neither I nor my dad complained. When the console finally arrived, it was truly worth the wait. This event clearly illustrates that patience can lead to a rewarding outcome, and it's essential to stay calm during the waiting period.
833	18764	7	2	I showed patience during a festival. When I wanted to buy something to eat, the line was extremely long. Also, when I aimed to get on a ride, specifically the @CAPS1, @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 pirate ship, the swing, the queue was incredibly large. Moreover, there was a long line for a basketball game. Despite the long waits, I remained patient. This shows that patience is necessary in crowded events to enjoy the experience.
834	18765	7	2	Have you ever wondered if you could handle @NUM1 screaming kids? Well, I can proudly say I did. It all began when my uncle Steve and @CAPS1 @PERSON1 decided to move to @LOCATION1. They needed a lot of help, so my @CAPS1 @DATE1 took her five kids, my sister, and me to @LOCATION1. The problem was there were @NUM2 kids and only @NUM3 adults. We packed our bags and set off in my @CAPS1 @DATE1's expedition car, which could fit all @NUM2 of us. However, it wasn't long before everyone got uncomfortable. The kids started fighting, and my @CAPS1 @DATE1 got stressed quickly. I was sitting in the front, so I didn't witness the chaos up close. After about @NUM1 hours, I'd had enough. My legs were cramped, and the motion made me dizzy. After driving for about @NUM7 hours with only one rest - stop, it got dark. We were alone on the road. Then, @CAPS6 happened, and everyone screamed. At first, I thought it was a car accident, but we were okay. We had hit a deer. Finally, after about @NUM8 hours, we reached @LOCATION2@NUM9 at @NUM10 in the morning. I was surprised by my own patience. After this experience, I'm not eager to go on another road - trip.
835	18766	7	2	Patience means facing problems without complaining. At an amusement park, patience is required to wait in long lines. On a long car ride, it means not complaining about being bored. When fishing, patience is necessary to achieve a rewarding result and can also save others from headaches. If you are patient, you won't always be stressed. Therefore, one should always practice patience as it can simplify life. Long lines won't seem as long, and fishing can be a very rewarding activity when patience is exercised.
836	18767	7	2	I recall a time when I was extremely eager for a toy car. I had to wait a full four days, and each day felt like an eternity, as if I were in jail. I got so frustrated that I started slapping people in the face, which I thought was funny at the time, but it made my [relative] angry. As a result, my mom punished me. However, a few days later, I started performing well in school. My mom was very proud of me and bought me a lot of things. On Christmas Day, we had turkey and ranch dressing. When I opened my presents, I received the toy car, [item 2], monster - truck cars, shoes, and various collars from [organization] in blue, red, and every color you could imagine. I was overjoyed to finally get the toy I'd been waiting for. Then, my [relative] stopped by and gave me [number] dollars. He also took me to an ice [place] where people wore skinny tights. In the end, everything worked out perfectly. I got everything I wanted, and the [number] [item] made me feel like I was rich on Christmas Day.
837	18768	7	2	"One day, there was a girl in [location] who really wanted to go school - shopping. But she had to wait because her mother said she wouldn't get the money right away; she'd get it later in [time]. Her mom told her to wait until then. The girl didn't know that her new stuff was already in her room. When her mom came back, the girl asked when they were going to [place]. Her mom told her to go get her jacket upstairs. When the girl went up to her room, she saw new clothes and five pairs of new shoes. She screamed with excitement and ran downstairs to thank her mom. Her mom said, ""You're welcome. I told you I was going to get your stuff. You just have to be patient."" This experience taught the girl the value of patience."
838	18769	7	2	Patience is the state of mind one experiences when faced with a difficult task and makes an earnest effort to overcome it without grumbling. For instance, when you're trying to get paint out of a tube, you squeeze it, but it won't come out. Yet, you keep trying until you realize the paint is gone. Then, you go and get a new bottle to continue. I sincerely wish more people could be patient. If so, we wouldn't have to endure constant complaining, which would make our daily lives more pleasant.
839	18770	7	2	There was a time when I had to be patient, and that was when I had to take care of my little brothers and two cousins. This was clearly going to demand a great deal of patience. One day, I received a phone call from my aunt. She said she needed a babysitter for her two - year - old and seven - year - old cousins and offered to pay me if I would watch them. I agreed without fully realizing what I was getting myself into. After a couple of days, things at [location] turned out to be quite okay for me. In the end, this experience taught me that with patience, even challenging tasks can be managed.
840	18771	7	2	Patience is undoubtedly one of the most difficult virtues to practice in the world. I remember one occasion when my family and I went to [location] Point. We were all excited to ride the Magnum, a ride we hadn't been able to ride the last time we were there. So, we planned to ride it first. After getting in line, we had to wait for the rain to stop. The wait lasted an hour and fifteen minutes. I decided to be patient and not complain, even though standing for so long became quite painful. As time passed, I even started to forget I was in line because more people were being let on the ride. It seemed that not complaining paid off, as my whole family was in a good mood after we got off the ride. This made me realize the importance of being more patient with others. However, this positive experience came to an end when we reached the bumper cars. Overall, this trip taught me the value and power of patience.
841	18772	7	2	"I'm standing outside the double doors of the @LOCATION1 venue and am greeted by a man in a suit. He says, ""Welcome to the fravent."" As soon as we enter, we can walk further into the area in front of us. I excitedly ask, ""When does the show start?"" My mom replies, ""@CAPS2 till about @NUM1."" It's about an hour until eight - thirty, and we can't sit down because of the crowd ahead. @NUM2 minutes pass, and only one person is admitted into the show. Even the elegant music can't mask the crowd's uproar. Another @NUM3 minutes go by, and our seats are finally waiting for us. As I walk down the walkway, I settle into seat @NUM4 just as the show begins."
842	18773	7	2	Patience is a challenging yet valuable character trait. It can be beneficial in numerous situations. When one has patience, they are less likely to become nervous or anxious. For instance, I waited a week for a birthday present from my friend @PERSON1. I tried not to think about it too much, which helped me stay patient. I knew the present would be really cool, making it a bit harder to be patient, but I managed to keep it off my mind. I was careful not to pester my friend to reveal what it was, as that would have been impatient. Impatient people often ask too many questions, which can annoy others. Patience is essential in friendships to avoid being mean to friends or others. It is also crucial not to be impatient with family. With patience, one can better resolve issues, stay on task, and remain focused.
843	18774	7	2	When you're at a store, the doctor's office, or anywhere you have to wait, patience is a must. Otherwise, you won't be able to achieve what you want. I recall being at the store with my mom. We had to wait in a long line to buy a few groceries. If we hadn't been patient, we would have put our stuff back and gone home. But because we were patient, we were able to make the purchase. This shows that without patience, you can't do the things you want.
844	18775	7	2	"Here's a story about a time I was patient. It was at Art Prize, a place where I love seeing beautiful art. I was really eager to see the winning picture. My parents told me to wait until we'd seen the rest of the amazing art. I sighed and agreed. While looking at the art, all I could think about was the winning piece. But then, I realized it was a blessing to be at Art Prize. I decided that patience is a good virtue, and waiting for something can make it seem more valuable. A couple of hours later, as I was heading to the car, my mom asked, ""@CAPS1 don't you want to see the winning piece of art?"" I replied, ""@CAPS2 yes, I forgot."" There was no line, so we went to see it right away. It was the most amazing thing I'd ever seen - a pencil - drawn picture of sergeants. That day, I learned that patience is important because it makes the wait for something you like worthwhile."
845	18776	7	2	"A time when someone I knew was patient was when I wanted to have a sleepover with my friend @CAPS1. My parents ordered pizza for me and my two brothers as they went out for their anniversary dinner. They left around @NUM1 pm, and we started eating the deep - dish @CAPS2 pizza. Halfway through dinner, I got a text from my next - door neighbor and best friend @CAPS1, asking if I wanted a sleepover. I said my parents were out and would be back in a few hours, and I'd ask later. Finally, around @NUM2 pm, my parents came home. I asked about the sleepover, and my mom said, ""I don't know"" and walked away. About an hour later, I got a yes! I texted @CAPS1, and she replied, ""finally!"" I went to my room to pack. Just as I was about to leave, my mom shouted from upstairs, ""@CAPS5! Take the dogs out before you leave!"" I dropped everything, put leashes on the dogs, and stood in the pouring rain. When the dogs were done, I grabbed my stuff and ran out. When I got to @CAPS7's house, she let me in. I said, ""@CAPS8 it took so long. Thanks for being so patient!"
846	18777	7	2	"I'm not a patient person, so today I'll write about my impatience. One day, I was in a long line at @ORGANIZATION1. It was a hot day, and I wanted to go back to my cool, big house to relax. As we all know, old people tend to walk slowly and talk a lot. There were @NUM1 such people in front of me. One of them took ages to take out his wallet and kept talking. I thought, ""I'll just go to another @ORGANIZATION1 and get what I need. I can't stand this slowness on a humid day."" So I left. This shows how impatient I can be."
847	18778	7	2	"Patience can be extremely challenging, especially when the situation is both distracting and painful. This is the story of my experience with patience after falling outside. One day, when I was @NUM1 years old, my brother and I were playing outside, having fun throwing water balloons at each other. I was completely soaked, but we continued playing. Suddenly, I heard a buzzing sound by my ear. When I turned around, I saw a huge bee. Being very afraid of bees, I ran down the driveway and circled the house, thinking the bee was still following me. Eventually, I got tired and tripped, scraping off a significant amount of skin. I started to cry when I saw the blood. I went inside to tell my mom, sobbing, ""@CAPS1! I fell!"" My mom replied, ""@CAPS2 my gosh! Let me go find some band - aids."" The pain was unbearable for my little body. I cried silently, knowing I had to be patient while my mom looked for bandages. After a while, like I had wasted many band - aids on my face before, my mom finally found the bandages. She ran to me and said, ""I found them! Thank you for being so patient."" She then put the band - aids on my cut and gave me a lollipop. I knew I had been a good girl by being patient."
848	18779	7	2	Hi, I'm the narrator, the one who tells stories. I'm going to tell you a story about an armadillo named @CAPS1. @CAPS1 was no ordinary armadillo; he didn't have a shell. Other armadillos made fun of him and told him to get a shell. Being smart, @CAPS1 decided to make his own. He went to the junk yard and found a lot of lightweight metal. He took it home, melted it down, and began the long process of smithing his shell. When it was done, he tried it on, and it fit perfectly. The next day at school, everyone was impressed by his super - shiny shell. @CAPS1 was no longer mocked. This shows that @CAPS1 had to have patience to make his shell, and patience paid off for him.
849	18780	7	2	Being patient is a difficult trait to possess. Many people, like my brother, struggle with it. If my brother orders something online or waits for dinner, he's always whining about when he'll get what he wants. I'm different; I have patience. For example, I needed shoes, so I searched the @ORGANIZATION1 store online. I found some really nice shoes and asked my dad if I could order them. The next day, my mom ordered them for me. I was very excited and waited patiently. Three days later, I missed the school bus, and my mom had to go to college, so I stayed home alone. I found out my dad was coming home that day, and the house was messy, so I started cleaning. When my mom came home, she saw a box at the front. She opened it and found my shoes! I excitedly jumped and put them on. They fit perfectly. My mom said they were supposed to arrive on @DATE1, but because I was patient, they arrived early. This proves that patience can bring rewards.
850	18781	7	2	"I've never been a patient person, but @PERSON1, a girl I know, is incredibly patient. Once, I was scared to go sledding down the hill. I kept saying, ""I'm not going down the hill."" About @NUM1 minutes later, she was still patient and said, ""@CAPS2. I'll go down first. Then will you go?"" I agreed, and after she went down, I followed. Also, on the day of last year's dance, I took a long time to get dressed, and we were already late. But she was extremely patient, which really surprised me. I think she has an abundance of patience. I hope some of it rubs off on me because I need a lot of patience as soon as possible. I feel like I'm the only person in the world without patience. I really should learn from her."
851	18782	7	2	On a rainy day, my father's leg was bothering him. He took medicine, but it didn't work, so we took him to the hospital in Coro. The doctors examined his leg and told us that we had to go to the hospital in Covent Hospital at @LOCATION1. So, we set off for @LOCATION1. When we arrived at the hospital, there were about @NUM1 people in the waiting room. My father was patient enough to wait. When it was our turn to go into the examination room, my father had to get X - rays. He also patiently waited to find out what was wrong with his leg. After learning the problem, he had to wait even longer to see if he needed surgery on his legs. Eventually, he had to undergo surgery, and he showed enough patience throughout the process. It's a good thing that my father was so patient because now his legs are fully recovered. I must admit, I didn't think he had that much patience before.
852	18783	7	2	This year, I've been trying to be patient for @CAPS1 so that I can get some @CAPS2. I was buying @CAPS2 earlier, but I can't buy any more since @CAPS1 is approaching. That's why I have to be patient; if I keep getting excited, the time will seem to pass even more slowly. Every day requires patience. Sometimes, I can't wait to get out of school to play. I'm always making an effort to be patient because there's one holiday after another, and each one gets more exciting. Every kid tries to be patient, but it's one of the hardest things to do. To be patient, I act as if nothing exciting is coming up. In the end, learning to be patient is a valuable lesson, especially when looking forward to something great.
853	18784	7	2	Today was Thanksgiving. We had to drive to a certain place to visit my cousins. The car journey was long, and it was burning fuel for an @NUM1 - long trip. It was really hard to be patient during the drive; I even wished I had a plane ticket. Along the way, I saw some cool things. When we arrived, we got off the highway and were finally with our family. We sat down, caught up, exchanged gifts, and had a turkey for @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Despite the long and tiring drive, spending time with family on Thanksgiving made it all worthwhile.
854	18785	7	2	On my way to @STATE1, I had to be patient because I had to wait for the buses. At some stops, there were @NUM1 buses involved in some situation (though the details are unclear). I was so tired that when the right bus finally came, I fell asleep. Even though the wait was long and tiring, patience got me through until I could continue my journey to @STATE1.
855	18786	7	2	"Today was the final day of tryouts, the deciding day. Once the tryouts were over, I patiently waited for the @CAPS2 to distribute the envelopes to all @NUM1 girls. I wasn't sure if I could handle the suspense. @CAPS2 @PERSON1 said, ""Wait until you've left the building to open your envelope. It's only fair. If everyone opens them here, the girls who don't make the team will be sad and disappointed while the ones who do will be overjoyed, which will make the unsuccessful girls feel even worse and left out. Be patient and wait until you leave."" When she called my name, I went up and grabbed my envelope. After she dismissed us, some girls opened their envelopes right away, and many of them didn't make @CAPS3. It seemed like karma. I waited until I got outside. I could barely contain my eagerness; I really wanted to know, but I forced myself to wait. Patience isn't always easy. Finally, I opened my envelope and found out that I made the team! I was extremely excited and glad that I had the patience to wait and be pleasantly surprised."
856	18787	7	2	During a family vacation, we traveled to @CAPS1 point. We stayed in a magical hotel. It was beautiful, with a real waterfall visible, like a slice of heaven. Our huge room had a @NUM1 - sized bathroom and large @CAPS2. Looking out of the window, I saw roller - coasters and all kinds of rides. There was a new ride called the @CAPS3 breaker. It was @NUM2 hundred feet tall, as big as the Statue of Liberty. It picked you up, dropped you @NUM2 hundred feet, twisted like a tornado, and moved from side to side. My parents and I went there. My parents wanted to ride a different ride, but I wanted to try the @CAPS3 breaker. There were @NUM4 people in line. I got in line and waited. After @NUM1 hours, I started losing my patience. There were only @NUM6 people in front of me. Finally, it was my turn. I got on the ride. First, it lifted me up @NUM7 hundred feet and dropped me, spun me around, and twisted me until I was tired. When I got off, I was crying, but it was a good cry. That was a time when I showed patience.
857	18788	7	2	I stood in the elevator, tapping my foot as smooth jazz music hummed from the speakers above. Eventually, the familiar click was heard, and the smooth metal doors slid open, revealing a well - furnished hallway with many people waiting for their turn. I slipped out, trying not to be trampled by the large crowd. Then, there was silence. My footsteps echoed as I searched for room @NUM1. Finally, I found my destination, opened the door, and stepped inside where many noisy children were waiting. I took off my coat and hung it on a nearby hook, trying to be unobtrusive. I browsed through the magazine section, flipping through torn - up @CAPS1 magazines and carefully - handled Sports Illustrated until I found an interesting article on swimming. With the magazines under my arm, I chose a seat in the far corner to wait. Minutes passed. The child next to me was getting impatient. He tapped his mother's jacket repeatedly and asked, “@CAPS2 how much longer?” The mother checked her watch and replied in an annoyed tone, “Not much longer now, dear.” Hearing this, the little boy slumped back in his seat and put his thumb in his mouth. I rolled my eyes but couldn't help smiling at his actions. Across the room, a girl about my age frowned while texting on her cellphone. After glancing at the clock, she scowled and continued texting. Just then, the glass door slid open, and a woman with a homemade perm and tired eyes stepped out. Patients in the waiting room looked up at her with anticipation and hope. “@PERSON1, the doctor is ready to see you now.” I avoided the angry looks from other patients and followed her out. “You know it's funny,” @CAPS5 said while chewing gum. “@CAPS6 someone so young was the most patient person here!” I nodded and grinned because I know patient people endure difficulties without complaining, and I'm glad to be one.
858	18789	7	2	One day, my brother was sick, so my mom, my brother, and I went to the doctor's. When we arrived at the doctor's office and sat in the waiting area, they called my mom and brother. My mom told me it would only take two minutes, but she was wrong. It took her two hours to come back. While waiting, I texted my aunt and friends and played some games. I had brought my @CAPS1 with me. I got so bored that I went outside for fresh air. Then, when I got tired, I just sat there. Finally, they came out. My mom asked, “How are you, sweety?” Then she told me my brother was sick. Because I was patient, we got to eat at @ORGANIZATION1 after that. We spent @NUM1 minutes there. I was so tired that I felt like going to sleep. Being patient isn't as hard as it seems; it's actually quite easy. That was a great example of patience.
859	18790	7	2	Patience means being tolerant and understanding and not complaining. On a journey to California, I experienced a lot of waiting. I had to stand in six very long lines for up to @NUM1 hours just to get on the plane. When we finally arrived, we were hungry and had to wait in line for @NUM2 minutes to get food. By the time we got our food, we were starving. After eating, we went to a friend's house and stayed for an hour. It started to get boring, but I was patient and waited. In the end, it wasn't so bad. Being patient is important in life, and whether you are patient or not is up to you. That week was full of waiting in lines and practicing patience. Sadly, we had to leave after that long day. First, we went to Houston, Texas, then @ORGANIZATION1, and then we drove @NUM3 hours to get home. When we got home, we were exhausted. I told this story to my friends and family.
860	18791	7	2	To be patient, one must be tolerant, understanding, and refrain from complaining. I love babysitting my little cousin, especially when they are infants. On @DATE1, I went to my cousin's house to babysit her daughter, @CAPS1's @PERSON1, for about three hours. I was going to be paid fifty dollars, and I was really looking forward to it. When I got to their house, @NUM1 was sleeping. I woke her up as soon as her mom left, and I immediately realized it was a bad idea. She started screaming at the top of her lungs. I tried everything - picking her up, rocking her, playing games, putting her in the swing, and even feeding her, but nothing worked. I was so upset that I felt like screaming myself. The baby cried for an hour and a half and wouldn't stop. Then I asked, “@NUM1, what's the matter?” As soon as I spoke, there was a moment of silence, and she stopped crying. At that moment, I realized I had been patient because I remained somewhat calm and didn't complain to @CAPS1's @CAPS4's mom.
861	18792	7	2	Since I first learned about @LOCATION1 and presents, I've always loved @CAPS1. However, no one ever said that one would have to wait months for it to come around. Although I'm extremely fond of @CAPS1, it's quite a test of patience to wait until @DATE1 each year. The first day of @DATE1 signals the approaching @CAPS1, with all the decorations, caroling, and the anticipation of its joy. To pass the time, I often engage in snow - ball wars with my cousins. The temptation to rush time is strong, making the long wait anxious and arduous. But I try to be as patient as @CAPS2 and let the temptation fade. When @CAPS1 eve finally arrives, I'm grateful for my patience, as I'm not as patient as @CAPS2, who's like my parents and can't stand waiting for months. @CAPS1 comes slowly and leaves in a flash. Just as the saying goes, time flies when you're having fun.
862	18793	7	2	When I was about seven years old, a little boy, I was incredibly patient about an @CAPS1 toy I desired. Ever since the @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 bender appeared on television and in stories, I've been crazy about the @CAPS1 world, especially the @CAPS4 @CAPS5, the only one who can master all four elements @CAPS7, @LOCATION1, @CAPS8, and @ORGANIZATION1. I'm so into it that I could write a whole book about @CAPS1. One day, I saw a @CAPS1 set on TV and asked my mom to buy it. She said she'd get it when she had the money, which disappointed me. I counted the days until the @CAPS12. When it finally came, I thought I'd get my toy, but she only had two hundred dollars, so I had to wait another week. I was so upset that I ran upstairs, locked my door, and cried myself to sleep. I was so pre - occupied with the disappointment that I forgot about my upcoming birthday. But when my birthday arrived, I finally got the @CAPS4. My mom said that all my patience had paid off.
863	18794	7	2	Patience can be defined as waiting for something without complaining about the length of the wait, sitting quietly throughout. For instance, one time I went to the doctor's for a check - up. While waiting, I sat quietly, reading a magazine. This is a clear example of what it means to be patient. In conclusion, patience is a virtue that can be demonstrated in simple everyday situations like waiting at the doctor's office.
864	18795	7	2	One day, a kid named @CAPS4 was on his way to school to turn in a math paper, which he did. During @CAPS1 class, @CAPS4 was working on a chapter sketch when the teacher called him over. The teacher asked if he had the page of a story that was due a month ago. @CAPS4 replied no, stating that he had been at a basketball tournament. The teacher gave him until the next day. The next day in @CAPS1 class, @CAPS4 apologized, saying he still didn't have the paper because his grandpa had died. The teacher gave him one more day. Eventually, the kid managed to get his paper done. This shows that sometimes, with a bit of leeway, students can complete their tasks.
865	18796	7	2	I've had to be patient many times in my life, but this time was particularly challenging because I was extremely excited about building. We started working on it on a @DATE1 after school. That day, we managed to complete about half of the project. However, due to some unforeseen circumstances with my brother, sister, dad, and mom, we couldn't work on it for a whole week. The wait was torture as I had been looking forward to this for a long time. After what seemed like a month, the week finally passed, and I was able to resume my work. A few days later, we finished painting the walls blue and gold, representing the colors of the University of @CAPS1. All that was left was to put my dad's finishing touches, and then it was ready for me to sleep in. I was overjoyed that we had finally completed my room and I could now enjoy it.
866	18797	7	2	One instance when I demonstrated patience was while saving up to purchase a game called Halo Reach. I had to wait for @NUM1 weeks before I could acquire it. Throughout this period, I remained patient and refrained from constantly asking about it. Eventually, I was able to buy the game, and my patience was rewarded.
867	18798	7	2	"A few days after @CAPS18 started running, @CAPS3, a small, anxious chestnut - colored horse, saw @CAPS1's @CAPS5 plowing a large oval area and covering it with what looked like dust. ""@CAPS4's @CAPS5 doing, @CAPS6?"" asked a very curious @CAPS3. ""@CAPS9's plowing,"" replied @CAPS10 @CAPS11, the young horses' @CAPS17. ""@CAPS12 is going to be in a race called the @ORGANIZATION1 next year, and that's how @CAPS18 will practice."" ""I want to race!"" @CAPS3 hollered excitedly. ""Patience, my darling, you're not even a filly!"" @CAPS10 @CAPS11 concluded. So, @CAPS3 waited patiently for weeks. When @CAPS18 could, @CAPS18 ran the track at night, counted her times, and got faster and stronger. Two years later, @CAPS3 became the champion for @NUM1 years in a row. ""@CAPS17 was right! Patience is the key!"" @CAPS18 claimed."
868	18799	7	2	"Did you buy @CAPS10 yet?"" I yelled across the room. ""Not yet. Let's get @CAPS10 @CAPS4,"" my dad replied. I was buying a scooter online, and @CAPS10 was being shipped from @LOCATION1. The seller said the scooter would arrive in five to eight business days. ""Yes!"" I yelled as I bought it. ""Now all that's left is to wait."" The next morning, I woke up at 6 am to catch the bus to school. During my classes, all I could think about was the scooter. ""Patience, @CAPS5 - patience,"" I thought. After school, I would go to a nearby place until @NUM1 when my parents would pick me up. Five business days finally came. ""I can't wait any more!"" I yelled. After that place, my mom drove me home, and I rushed to the mailbox. ""Darn @CAPS10!"" I said. ""Yeah, the website tried to charge our credit card extra money, so we had to cancel it."" ""Don't worry, @CAPS5. Let's buy you a new one,"" my mom said. Three business days later, the new @CAPS9 scooter finally arrived. ""It's about time!"" I said happily."
869	18800	7	2	One time when I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I had to wait about @NUM1 hours to go on the Top Thrill Dragster. I was extremely patient because it was my first time on the dragster. My dad and I waited and waited. When we reached the front of the line, I was so scared that I thought I would pee my pants. When we got on the roller - coaster, I said I didn't want to go. So, my dad asked if my son (presumably a mistake and should be I) could get off, but they said once you're on, you can't get off. So, I had to ride it. After the ride, I wanted to go on it over and over again. Even though it was only a @NUM2 - second ride, it was the best thing I had ever waited for in my life so far. This was a time when I had to be patient to get something I really wanted.
870	18801	7	2	It was patient while waiting to go to @CAPS1. It went through @NUM1 appointments. It was very excited, and those involved had to wait patiently and achieve many things and engage in various activities. Sometimes, there were situations where parents might yell, saying things like going against systems. One had to be patient. One would work all night, and in the process, get a @CAPS2 grade. It took several days, and everything was done in @LOCATION1. Sitting through such a long - drawn - out process was difficult, but in the end, patience paid off.
871	18802	7	2	Do you know someone who is patient? I do. My mother is extremely patient with us children. When I lose my temper, my mother remains calm. My little brother often makes me so angry that I can't bear it, but she rarely gets like that. Even when my grandma passed away, she stayed composed. Two of my aunts were very upset that week, but they're fine now. Everyday things don't make her overly tense. When my sister makes her angry, she always regrets it. I want to punch my sister when she makes Mom angry because it affects me. She gets cranky. As you can see, my mother maintains her patience very well.
872	18803	7	2	My friend waited for @NUM1 hours to talk to my dad. My dad was busy repairing his @CAPS1. He just kept waiting until my dad finished. I was curious about what the question was. My friend sat inside, watching TV while waiting. When my dad was done, my friend asked if we could ride the @CAPS1, and my dad agreed. My friend showed great patience throughout this process.
873	18804	7	2	Patience is a valuable trait. When people encounter difficult times in life, patient individuals can bring something to occupy themselves. They can wait for three hours without getting annoyed. However, there are those who can't wait for three hours, or even ten minutes. These impatient people get angry and give up easily. But in the end, whether one is patient or not, giving up is not an option. Some people wait for an hour and then lose their temper. And there are those who seem unable to be patient but still manage to hold on. The key is to find something to do to pass the time if patience is difficult to maintain.
874	18805	7	2	“@CAPS1, are we there yet?” I kept asking repeatedly. “@CAPS2, but almost,” he replied. Today, we were going to @LOCATION1 Adventures, and I was extremely excited! After I asked my @CAPS1 about our arrival time, we finally reached @LOCATION1 Adventures about @NUM1 minutes later. The line to buy tickets was long but not overly so. Once we got the tickets, we went to find a locker to store our belongings. The line for that was short, so we finished quickly. Then we got hungry and went to eat. When we entered the restaurant, the lines to order were very long. After we finished eating, it was time to go on some thrilling rides. “@CAPS3, man!” I would exclaim when the lines for the rides were extremely long. So far, I had been very patient. Also, when I had to change clothes to go to the water - park, change back, or use the restroom, the lines were super long. Now, as the day was almost over and the park was about to close, my family and I were in the gift shop for about @NUM1 minutes. When we were ready to check out, the line was short! Finally, a short line! Throughout the day, I had been a very patient girl despite all the long lines.
875	18806	7	2	One time I showed patience was when my friend and I were on vacation at @ORGANIZATION1. I was having a great time. My family didn't come because they don't like roller - coasters. We decided to ride the @CAPS1. It seemed like it would be a long wait. After waiting for an hour and a half, it started to rain. At first, it was just a light sprinkle, but it was enough for them to close some rides, including the @CAPS1. Since we really wanted to ride it, we waited until the rain stopped. After another hour, many people left, and we were at the front of the line. My friend and I got front - row seats and had a lot of fun. Waiting for @NUM1 and a half hours was worth it, and we even rode it twice.
876	18807	7	2	I recall a time in @NUM1 grade when I had to be patient as I waited until this year to play football. I demonstrated patience by waiting for an extended period without any impatience. In the end, my patience paid off as I finally got the chance to play.
877	18808	7	2	Have you ever pondered what patience truly is and whether you've ever exercised it? Patience is an essential virtue in life. When shopping or traveling in a car, patience is required. In a car, impatience can lead to accidents. Patience encompasses various qualities. Impatience can make one annoying, especially in long - line situations, frustrating others. Moreover, if parents are impatient, they may teach their children the same, which is undesirable. As shown, patience is of great importance.
878	18809	7	2	One instance when my parents were patient was when I refused to eat dinner. One night, my dad made chop suey. I detested it; the smell made me gag. But my dad loves chop suey and makes it often. When we sat down to eat, I ate a potato, and my dad gave me a large scoop of chop suey. I declared I wouldn't eat it. My dad patiently waited for me to eat what was on my plate. I agreed to pick out the meat. After eating the meat, I said I was done. My dad then asked me to eat the vegetables. I whined about hating celery. After a half - hour of a battle of wills, my dad won. I wanted to leave the table, but he was patient. Eventually, I ate the chop suey and left. This was when my dad showed great patience.
879	18810	7	2	One time, I showed great patience when I was with my grandparents. We were supposed to go to @CAPS1 adventures, and my grandma told me and my cousins to be ready by a certain time to avoid being late. The next day, we arrived at her house at @NUM1 as she instructed, only to find she had overslept. We all exchanged glances, knowing it would take a while. I said it was okay to wait, and we went into her house. As we were leaving, I noticed my grandparents carrying suitcases. My grandma said we'd spend the night in a hotel near @CAPS1 adventures. She drove us back to our houses to get our things and @NUM2 extra pairs of clothes. Then we headed to the hotel, ready for the adventure the next morning. Despite the change in plans, I remained patient.
880	18811	7	2	One time, I had to be patient when I went to @LOCATION1 with my mom, dad, @CAPS1 my sister, and my grandma. Since my cousins live in @LOCATION1, we were going to visit them. We had to drive for @NUM1 hours in a small Colt with five people. We were all excited, so we had to be patient during the car ride. When I first learned about the trip, I was thrilled but knew I'd need patience. We drove all day, stayed in a motel, and then drove until about @TIME1 to reach my great - aunt's (my grandma's sister) lake house. It was wonderful seeing them again. On the trip home, we were sad to leave but had a great time. The return journey felt shorter but still long. When we got home, we were tired of being in the car, yet glad we didn't have to drive an extra hour like my grandma. This was a time when I truly had to exercise patience.
881	18812	7	2	One night, a wire from my braces popped out and was sticking out of my mouth. I couldn't do anything about it and had to wait for my mom to get home. I was scared but remained patient. I kept waiting until she arrived, and then we got the wire fixed. This experience showed that I could be patient in difficult situations.
882	18813	7	2	On my birthday, I wanted my dad to give me money. I waited all day until 5 o'clock. When he finally agreed, I got 20 dollars. It was worth waiting because if I had rushed him, he might have lowered the amount. Also, after football practice, I waited a while for my mom to pick me up. I was the last one there, waiting under a tree in the rain and lightning. I couldn't wear my helmet as it might attract lightning. In such situations, it's important not to rush. Patience can lead to better outcomes.
883	18814	7	2	Patience is the act of waiting calmly for something. I wanted my ears pierced and tried various methods like begging, pleading, and cleaning for four years, but it didn't work. My mom said I had to be 13. Instead of annoying her, I was patient. Eventually, she changed the age to 12. Now, I just need to wait until soccer is over, find a place, and she'll take me. Patience is beneficial in many ways, and I encourage others to be patient when they want something as it will all work out.
884	18815	7	2	"Being patient can be difficult, and I've had to practice it many times. One significant experience was on my birthday. I woke up early, excited to see my presents, but there were none. My mom was just watching TV. I asked her about it, and she wondered why I was up so early. I went back to sleep. When I woke up again, nothing had happened. I waited patiently in my room, but still, nothing. I played video - games downstairs until 11, waiting for someone to say ""happy birthday."" Finally, at 6 pm, when I went to the basement, there was a surprise party with presents and friends. I'm glad I was patient as I had a great party, and now I try to be patient every day."
885	18816	7	2	Last Friday, I went with some friends to the Cornerstone Festival. The festival is about Christian rock music. The highlight for me was seeing my favorite Christian rock band, Skillet. They played new songs and had many guitar solos. I bought one of their CDs, and it was amazing. The part that required patience was the long line my friend Jake and I had to wait in to get autographs. The line almost extended out of the gate into the parking lot, and we were near the end. However, the girl behind us was very nice, and we made a new friend. When we finally reached the front, it was all worth it. All the band members were super nice, and I gave their lead singer, John, my lucky bracelet. That was my experience of being patient.
886	18817	7	2	There were once two twin chipmunks named @PERSON1 and A.J. @PERSON1 was always patient, while A.J. lacked patience. One sunny day with a cool breeze, A.J. decided to go on a trip with @PERSON1. They packed their camping gear and headed deeper into the woods. Around dusk, they reached their destination. They attempted to build a fire. @PERSON1 started gathering firewood and tried to start the fire as their parents had taught them. As mentioned earlier, A.J. had no patience. He kept trying but stopped after a while. He hit the rocks together once and when the fire didn't start, @PERSON1 tried and got it going in @NUM1 minute. A.J. didn't care and got the acorns to cook. However, he only left them on for @NUM2 seconds each time. After multiple attempts, he finally stopped. It took @PERSON1 @NUM2 minutes. A.J. was really mad then, and they went to bed. When @PERSON1 woke up in the morning, he found A.J. cooking breakfast. A.J. finally learned to be patient.
887	18818	7	2	My mind was filled with excitement as I realized the ticket I had been longing for was truly mine. I was going to witness three days of @ORGANIZATION1 and Breaking @CAPS1 with my own eyes! The only drawback was that the concert was @NUM1 days away. It seemed both so close and yet so far. For three days, I silently whined in my head, not wanting to annoy my father after he spent a significant amount of money on the ticket. After those three days, I managed to calm myself and promised not to break my no - complaining rule. I couldn't tell if the week passed quickly or slowly; all I knew was that I was extremely eager. Finally, on @DATE1, my two favorite bands and a band I loved almost as much, Flipleaf, would be in @LOCATION1 that night. The day seemed to drag on. I was bursting with excitement and could only think about what was to come. Every second, my heart raced until I got in my dad's car at @NUM2. I double - checked that I had my cool clothes, tickets, and had managed to avoid complaining for @NUM1 days. On the way to @LOCATION1, we listened to the three bands we were going to see. I thought my heart had calmed down, but with each beat, it got louder, almost in sync with the bass drums. As we passed a limo with an open window near @LOCATION1, I thought I saw the singer of Breaking @CAPS1 (@CAPS3 @CAPS4). No more than ten minutes later, we pulled into the parking building for the @PERSON1. I caught a glimpse of the long line of people waiting to get in. I summoned the last bit of my patience. Eventually, I was inside. I was proud that I had managed to be patient throughout.
888	18819	7	2	One day, I was being very patient while babysitting my two little brothers. Everything was going well until the boys started fighting. They were hitting, kicking, and the youngest was biting. I told them to stop, and they did for a short while. Then they started arguing over a toy again. I went back to their room and told them to stop once more, and they finally stopped. However, my little brother @PERSON1 started copying everything everyone said. I warned him that if he didn't stop, he'd go to his room, and he complied. The rest of the night was peaceful until my parents got home. That was a time when I showed patience with my little brothers and sisters.
889	18820	7	2	Last year, my aunt told me she was taking me to a basketball game. The next day, I woke up very early because she hadn't told me what time she was coming. I got ready at @NUM1 am. At @NUM2 am, I called her, but she didn't answer. So I spent the time watching TV and playing games. Around @NUM3 pm, my aunt called back and said she had to go to the store. My frustration began to build up. I wanted to call her back and ask questions, but I tried to be patient. At @NUM4, my mom said we were going out. I was really angry as I wasn't expecting to leave with my mom. We got home around @NUM5 pm. I was extremely angry because my aunt hadn't called while we were out. I called her, and she said she was coming down the street. I was overjoyed. Later that day, I had a great time with my cousins and aunt.
890	18821	7	2	"When can we open presents, @CAPS1?"" I asked. ""When we get back from church,"" she replied. It was our typical @DATE1 schedule: spend the whole day making @CAPS3 eve dinner, go to the @CAPS3 eve service, have dinner with grandparents, then the kids get to open one present, go to bed for about an hour, get up, and open more presents. ""Amen,"" our pastor concluded the service. ""Can we go now, @CAPS1?"" I pleaded. ""No,"" she said. After we ate dinner, I was extremely excited. Time seemed to pass so slowly. It felt like I was @NUM1 years old before my grandparents left. Finally, we were all gathered around the @CAPS3 tree, and I was about to open my present. It was just a sleeping bag. Then my dad said, ""You can all sleep on the floor in @LOCATION1 room, but make sure you go to bed."" As I was lying on the floor with my sister sound asleep, I wondered what I'd get for @CAPS3. I eventually fell asleep. The next morning at @NUM2, I jumped out of bed, woke my sister up, and ran into my parents' room to wake them up. I thought, ""Finally, we get to open presents."" That was a time when I had to be very patient, and it was all worth it in the end."
891	18822	7	2	Patience involves waiting for what one desires. For instance, if one wants something, patience dictates that they must wait before obtaining it. Moreover, patience implies waiting in a proper manner. In conclusion, patience is an essential trait that requires us to endure the waiting period gracefully.
892	18823	7	2	One time, I took a very long test. I finished early, with an hour and a half to spare, and my friend finished just five minutes after me. We were given two and a half hours for the test. After I finished, I read a book but quickly finished it and then had to wait another hour before I could do something else. It's important to bring something to do while being patient. If there's nothing to do, just wait quietly. Patience is a valuable quality that can be applied when waiting for something or someone. In the end, having patience helps us get through such waiting situations.
893	18824	7	2	One day, I asked my parents if I could buy a game I wanted. They asked how much it was, and I said I didn't know. So, we went to the store to check the price. At the store, we found out it cost @MONEY2. I asked if I could buy it, and my parents said maybe after a while. I started begging, but they still said @CAPS1. When I got home, I went to sleep. The next morning, while watching @CAPS2.V at home, I saw a commercial about the game, which said it was still @MONEY1. Later, when we went to the mall, we saw the game cost @MONEY3, and finally, I got to buy it. This experience shows that sometimes we need to be patient to get what we want.
894	18825	7	2	Everyone experiences patience at some point in their life. I recall being extremely patient when I was ten years old, all because of a popcorn kernel. After a movie, I swallowed a popcorn kernel. I remember eating the last piece from the box and throwing it away. As soon as I walked out of the theater, it started to bother me. My mom and I went to a nearby Target to run errands. I got really thirsty because of the kernel and asked my mom for a drink, but she only had a credit card and couldn't buy a pop. I understood and tried not to think about it. Then we went to the bank. My mom needed to get money to pay my tennis instructor. I asked her to hurry because the kernel and thirst were hurting me. She said she was going as fast as she could and that we were only a few minutes from home, though I knew it was more like fifteen minutes. I didn't argue. By the time we got home, it felt like three hours had passed, but it was only fifteen minutes. I ran inside, grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge, and gulped it down. Then I went outside to help my mom bring in the supplies and drank more water with a smile. In conclusion, we all learn to be patient, and being patient to get home and drink water that day was worth it.
895	18826	7	2	There have been only a few times in my life when I really had to be patient, and the most memorable one was at the @LOCATION1 airport. My parents and I were waiting at our terminal for our flight to @LOCATION2. After waiting about @NUM1 minutes, we heard an announcement saying that something (@CAPS1) had gone wrong with the plane but that it (@CAPS5) should be fixed in about an hour. We later found out that the back - door had been slammed too hard, breaking a part needed for the emergency slide to work. An hour of waiting seemed okay at first. But then, there was another announcement saying they couldn't get the part right away, and the wait would be a minimum of @NUM2 hours. This sounded worse, but I remained calm while my mom was freaking out. Three hours passed, then four, and then @CAPS4. My laptop and iPod ran out of power, so I just fidgeted with my fingers. Finally, we heard that they couldn't get the part until tomorrow morning, and a collective groan swept across the terminal. Fortunately, we received a free night at a hotel until the flight. The wait was exhausting, but we all had patience, and we got through it. In conclusion, patience helps us deal with unexpected delays and difficult situations.
896	18827	7	2	"A few days ago, while I was at cheer practice, there was a great deal of drama within our team. It was fifteen days before the competition, and everyone was shouting at one another. There was so much yelling and back - talking to our coaches that no one could figure out what we were supposed to be doing.  In the second formation for the pom routine, the side I was on was not in the diagonal line we were supposed to be in and couldn't reach the kick - line on time. The people on the other side were pushing us, forcing us to walk much farther than them. One of our coaches' daughters was yelling at my side for not reaching the kick - line in time, even though she was the one pushing us further down, preventing us from getting there. Then she started yelling at PERSON1, claiming it was all her fault. PERSON2 then said to the coach's daughter, ""Stop blaming everyone else. You're not perfect at everything either, and you're the ones pushing us, so we can't reach the kick - line on time."" The coach's daughter was at a loss for words but retorted, ""That isn't true!"" It was evident that she knew it was true because the next time we did the kick - line, she moved farther from the center instead of closer. PERSON3 reached her spot just a couple of seconds after the designated time. I believed that PERSON2 was being loyal to PERSON1, even though they might not be best friends; they were still friends."
897	18829	7	2	"One time, I wanted to go outside, and my sister also wanted to go but wasn't ready. She had to get her hair done and put on some clothes. I waited patiently, not saying a word, even though I didn't really want to. I really wanted to go outside, but since my sister also wanted to, I waited for her.  I quietly walked out the door, but then my sister yelled, ""Wait! I want to go."" I went back into the house and waited for her to find some clothes. She went upstairs and found a set. After putting on her clothes, she had to look for her shoes. She searched the entire house and finally found them in a corner.  Just as we were about to leave, I was surprised to notice something wrong with her hair and asked, ""What's wrong with your hair?"" She felt her head and said, ""Oh, I forgot."" So we went back inside. I tried to put her hair in a ponytail, but it didn't work. I let her try, but she couldn't do it either. Eventually, I parted her hair and put it into two ponytails. Then we finally went outside. This was a time when I patiently waited for my sister."
898	18830	7	2	When I was getting ready to leave my uncle's ranch, I patiently waited for my dad to return so that he could help my brother load the NUM1 onto the trailer. Two hours had passed, and my dad still hadn't come back. I was having a tough time taking my NUM3 off the trailer because it was too heavy, and my dad was still riding his NUM3.  When my dad finally returned, my brother went to ride his NUM3. I was struggling to gather everything and leave. But finally, my mom and sister also wanted to leave, so they came to help me. In the end, with their assistance, I was able to get everything in order and leave the ranch.
899	18831	7	2	"On DATE1 in LOCATION1, LOCATION2, my cousin, LOCATION3, and I went up the street to the carnival. When we arrived, it was raining, and only one of the rides was open. So we waited around until all the rides were operational.  We went on all the rides except one called the Freak Out. There were flickering lights and loud music. We got in line for it, but I got out. My cousin asked, ""Why did you get out of line?"" I replied, ""I'm scared."" I then said, ""Can you wait till later?"" We waited for an hour. I sat on a bench, and my cousin asked, ""Can we go on the ride now?"" My heart was pounding so hard that I could hear it. I was really nervous. Then my cousin said, ""I'll wait."" I finally said, ""Let's get it over with."" My cousin was really nice to wait until I was ready to go on the ride. In conclusion, my cousin is the nicest for waiting, and now, I actually love that ride."
900	18832	7	2	"Have you ever been patient? Well, I have. I was sitting in a nice, warm, and cozy seat, exhausted and dozing off, waiting for them to call PERSON1. The name PERSON1 kept running through my mind, but nothing happened. So I just sat there, waiting patiently.  My mom was sitting next to me, reading an Avon magazine she had picked up from the small, round wooden table in the middle of the quiet orthodontist's office. I kept asking myself questions like, ""I wonder what they're going to do today. Will I get my expander off? What about my top braces?"" Then I started staring at the office ladies typing away on their computers. The sound of metal tools from the back room was ringing in my ears.  Finally, a girl walked out and called my name. I was both excited and nervous, but I was also proud because I had sat there patiently the whole time."
901	18833	7	2	The family, including myself, was on our way to the big city to attend a very special baseball game. It was the “@LOCATION1 Tigers” game at the @CAPS3 stadium. We were extremely excited as it was our first time in @LOCATION1. I asked my mom, “How much longer till we get there?” She replied, “About @NUM1 hour. Why?” I said, “Because it's so boring sitting here for four hours straight.” She told me to be patient. I grumbled in my mind. I wondered how long I could be patient. Then, I dozed off for two hours. When I woke up, we were stuck in traffic. I asked if we were there yet, and my dad said “Hope”. So I sat there patiently waiting. About @NUM2 minutes later, I asked if we could turn on the radio, and my mom agreed. We sat there for about @NUM3 minutes. Then we finally started moving. I tried not to be annoying and thought about what I'd do at the game. Maybe I'd spend a bit more. Before I could think further, I heard “We're here!” I screamed with joy. We got out of the car and walked about a @NUM4 of a mile to the ticket booth. As we walked up, I thought, “I guess all it takes is patience.”
902	18834	7	2	Two weeks ago, my family and I went to Six Flags for Fright Fest. I knew the lines would be long, and I really hate being patient. First, we went on the @LOCATION1 City @CAPS1 ride, and the line was only ten minutes. Then we went on the Superman ride, which had a slightly longer line. My sister and I got permission to go on the Riper. After that, we waited for the Perisa wooden roller - coaster, which often goes off the track. We waited @NUM1 minutes between each stop. When we finally reached the area where the coaster runs, people with flash passes kept cutting in front. The flash pass allows you to go to the front of the line. By the time we reached the front, my patience was wearing thin. Then, the roller - coaster went off the track. It was a @NUM2 - mile long and quite a thrilling coaster. That was the time I managed to be patient.
903	18835	7	2	Last year, one day my mom told the family that we would be going to Six Flags soon. I was extremely excited and immediately asked when. She said she didn't know yet. This upset me because the last time she said that about going somewhere, we didn't end up going. I knew it had to be on a @DATE1 since she works during the week. I was glad that school was out so I didn't have to worry about homework. I waited until @DATE2 and then asked my mom if we could go that @DATE1. She said no, explaining that we needed to plan it more and couldn't just go randomly on a @DATE1. That @DATE1, I bothered her every day until she started planning. First, she checked her work schedule to ensure she had no meetings or projects for the coming @DATE1. My heart sank when she said she had stuff to do. She kept looking at her schedule and found that her next free @DATE1 was two weeks away. I was okay with it as it was better than nothing. Over the next two weeks, I saved money for Six Flags. When the two weeks were over, I had about @MONEY1 saved up. I was so excited that I could barely contain myself. I think that was the most patient I've ever been.
904	18836	7	2	Patience means waiting without complaining to do something you desire. One time, I was at an outdoor mall with my mom, two older sisters, younger brother, niece, and dog. I patiently waited to go to the @ORGANIZATION1 store to try out the iPad. When I finally did, I thought the iPad was really awesome. After that, we went for ice - cream. My little brother got a root - beer flavored slushie, while my niece, the dog, and I got vanilla ice cream. After I finished my ice cream, I put the container on the ground for my dog to lick the rest. We spent @NUM1 hours there, which was quite a surprise. Then we went home.
905	18837	7	2	One time, @PERSON1 showed great patience when we taught him how to pitch. He quickly developed a nice wind - up and delivery, but his arm angle was off. However, this didn't stop him. We asked if he wanted to stop, but he firmly said “No!” As time passed, @PERSON1 gradually improved. Now, he enjoys throwing a @NUM1 - mph fastball at a catcher. On days when he's inaccurate, he doesn't get discouraged. He keeps trying and doesn't whine. Thanks to his self - discipline and patience, @PERSON1 is now the number two starter in the rotation.
906	18839	7	2	"Calm down! It will arrive soon. Don't worry,"" @CAPS2 consoled. A patient individual endures difficulties without complaint. Over the past few days (which felt like an eternity), I haven't been that so - called ""calm"" person. Halloween was approaching in a few days, yet my costume hadn't arrived in the mail. I'd been waiting interminably, but @CAPS5 @CAPS1 took too long! For the fifth time, I watched the little red hand on the clock make a full rotation. They said it would come on @DATE1, but it didn't. ""I've been sitting here since ten o'clock. Where is the @CAPS4 track?"" I shrieked. Then I glanced at the clock; it was only @NUM1! What! It felt like an hour! How could anyone tolerate waiting this long? ""It's coming,"" I murmured to myself. A few hours later, I spotted a small white @CAPS6 - @CAPS7 truck meandering along the street. (""That's it!"") I strained to look. No, it just kept going. I sighed and dragged myself down the steps. ""No!"" I sobbed in anguish. ""Why does this feeling engulf me like this?"" I sauntered into the kitchen, and there was a brown box on the counter. I grew giddy as I tiptoed over to it. ""It's here! It's here!"" I yelped, hopping up and down. Finally, my wait was over."
907	18840	7	2	"One instance when I demonstrated patience was when I went to a restaurant with my @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. We ordered our food and found a table. As we sat there waiting for the food, I asked my @CAPS1, ""How much longer will it take?"" @CAPS4 replied, ""You have to be patient and wait."" A short while later, our food was ready. It was truly worth the wait."
908	18841	7	2	There were about three or four times when I had to be patient. The first was when I was five years old on my birthday. My grandmother went shopping for me, and I had to patiently wait for her to return with my presents. Another time was when I was @NUM1 on @CAPS1 day. I woke up extremely early, eager to be patient and wait for my dad to wake up so I could open my presents. Then, there was an occasion when my friend had something to do, and I had to be patient until he came back. These experiences illustrate the importance of patience in different situations and conclude my account of my patience.
909	18842	7	2	"The time I showed patience was when @CAPS4 was going to @LOCATION1. ""Mom!"" I exclaimed. ""@CAPS1's go. I'm packed and ready to leave."" @CAPS2, my mom, and I were in the house packing everyone's belongings. It was a beautiful @DATE1 in @LOCATION2, and it was also @CAPS2 step - dad's birthday. ""@CAPS3, you need to be patient. We have a long drive. Do you have everything you need?"" @CAPS5 got me thinking. I had to gather coloring materials, the portable @CAPS6 player, etc. I was @CAPS7 @CAPS8 about what else @CAPS4 needed when @CAPS2's stomach growled. It was as fierce and starving as a bear protecting its cubs. Then I remembered, ""Food! That's what I need to get."" I rushed into the kitchen like a race - car aiming to win a race. I packed turkey sandwiches, pb&j sandwiches, chips (salt and vinegar, sour cream and onion, and jalapeño cheddar - yum). ""Now I have everything,"" I thought. ""Let's go."" @CAPS9, @CAPS2's mom, and I rushed out the door. ""Got the address?"" asked @CAPS2's father. ""@CAPS10 @CAPS3, I got it."" @CAPS11 when @CAPS4 started the journey, @CAPS2's sister fell asleep. @CAPS5 slept like a rock the whole way. Although I don't think rocks snore. After @NUM1 hours of being awake in the car, I thought I should try to sleep, but the excitement was overwhelming. Then I fell asleep. I thought I could stay awake the whole way, but it was impossible. Finally, @CAPS2's step - father shouted, ""Wake up!"" I was so tired when I woke up. ""Are we there yet?"" was the first thing out of @CAPS2's mouth. ""Yeah,"" and of course, I jumped out of the car. ""@CAPS12!"" @CAPS2's mother shouted. I paused as if I were a character in a video game on pause. ""@CAPS13, take in some of the bags."" ""@CAPS14,"" I said with a scowl on @CAPS2's face. ""@CAPS15, you have to be patient."" As I took in the bag, there was the condo of @CAPS2's dreams, and the first thing I did was sleep."
910	18843	7	2	"Being patient isn't always easy. Last year, I had to spend @NUM2 hours in a car with @NUM1 rude, screaming, and crying kids. I was extremely excited to see my great @CAPS3, Davn, in @LOCATION1 with my grandpa. My @CAPS1 pa is a pleasure to talk to. However, later I found out that my @NUM1 younger cousins were coming. I knew this would be a long car ride. We packed our things in the car. I brought my iPod and a book, but my cousins brought noisy, flashy toys they'd bought just for the journey. As we started driving to @LOCATION1, I turned on my iPod and discovered it only had @PERCENT1 battery left. Half - way there, I was almost dying of boredom, and the kids were just starting to calm down. When I was sure they were asleep, I decided to join them. Whack! I awoke with a sudden slap to the face. ""We're here,"" my cousin announced. ""Finally,"" I thought to myself as I woke up with a sore and stiff neck. After we finished visiting my @CAPS3, about @NUM4 hours had passed. My cousins were all asleep again, and I knew the ride home would be pleasant."
911	18844	7	2	One day, I was being patient and very nice. There was a girl who really got on my nerves. She pushed and hit me. I let her go in front of me. We were at @CAPS1, and a lady told her to stop pushing me. Then in class, I raised my hand. She told me to be patient, and I said I already was and asked her to shut up, but she didn't. Later, the teacher called on me, and she got mad at me. This experience tested my patience as the girl's actions were quite annoying, but I tried to keep my cool.
912	18845	7	2	I'm going to share the time when I showed patience. One day, after my family and I returned from church, I asked my mom if she could make breakfast. However, she didn't answer because she was on the phone with my grandma, who talks a lot. It was so frustrating. I paced back and forth and then sat down. After an hour of waiting patiently, my mom and grandma hung up, and I finally got my breakfast. This incident taught me the value of patience in waiting for what I wanted.
913	18847	7	2	"One day, around @NUM1, my mom woke me, my brother, and dad to get ready. I wasn't sure what for, but we got on the road as soon as we could. I fell asleep in the car on the highway. I woke up due to a hard @CAPS1 on the brakes. When I looked up, we were in a long line of cars. I asked where we were, and my brother replied ""Six Flags"". I could hear impatient people all around. They were screaming and yelling as people tried to pay to enter the park. It seemed we were moving faster than some of the impatient ones, and we were among the first to get in. It was the most impatient group of people I'd ever seen, and it made me realize how important it is to stay calm in such situations."
914	18848	7	2	"On page @NUM1, I heard her crying, and I just wanted to get out of the car and walk home. There were @NUM2 of us squished in a suburban, and we couldn't even move our arms. It felt like I was locked in jail with chains. It was @NUM3 o'clock in the morning, and I saw a big sign that said ""Welcome to @CAPS2"". At that point, we only had about an hour left, and I was so excited. We finally reached our destination, Key West. It was the longest trip of my life. I tried my best to be patient. In the end, I realized it was worth it as I had a whole weekend of waves and a temperature of @NUM4∞@CAPS3 degrees. Even though I didn't want to think about the trip home, I knew I had the patience to make it back."
915	18849	7	2	Just yesterday, I showed patience. I had just finished part @NUM1 of the test and was very anxious to get up and move around. But since we were taking the @CAPS1, I couldn't. Instead, I entertained myself in various ways, like pretending to sing, running songs through my head, and even twiddling my thumbs. Finally, she let us get up and talk. I was sitting next to some friends and started talking to them. Somehow, the conversation turned to Dungeons and Dragons. They kept asking me about different classes. I kept trying to talk but kept getting interrupted, so I relaxed and waited for my turn. Finally, it was my turn, but then it was time for lunch, so I never got to say what my class would be. This was definitely a time when I was patient.
916	18851	7	2	"Have you ever been annoyed because someone kept telling you to be patient? I have, and I'm going to tell you about a time when I was patient. One time, I was on my way to @LOCATION1. The plane ride wasn't as bad as what's to come. When I got to @PERSON1, I had to pass through @PERSON1@NUM1 border. It was extremely hot! I think the temperature reached @NUM2. I had to wait in a small room with about @NUM3 people, and there was no air - conditioning. All of us were waiting for the bus. After @NUM4 hours, a bus arrived. As I was getting on, about @NUM5 people pushed in front, and I missed that bus. Then I waited again. After @NUM6 hours, another bus arrived. I tried to get on, but I got pushed out of the way again and missed that bus too. I was frustrated, and so was my family. Another thing that frustrated me was that there were thousands of flies everywhere. After waiting for another @NUM4 hours, a bus arrived, but my little brother was in the bathroom, so I missed that bus. My mom kept telling me to calm down and be patient. I stayed patient until the @NUM8th bus came. I got on, but the bus didn't go where it was supposed to, so I had to go back to the same place. My mom still said to stay patient. One of the officers at the place noticed how long I'd been waiting. When the next bus arrived after @NUM9 hours and @NUM10 minutes, he held everyone else back and let me and my family get on. He told the driver, ""Take them by themselves."" We had the bus to ourselves, and it was all worth it."
917	18852	7	2	There was a time when I needed to take care of my personal business. My sisters and I entered the house, and one of them went to handle her own personal needs. I was being patient and didn't want to bang on the door. I wanted to tell her (@ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS1) to hurry up with whatever she was doing. By the way, @ORGANIZATION1 is @NUM1 years old and @CAPS1 is @NUM2 years old. I waited and waited, being very patient and not wanting to be seen as impatient. I really needed to handle my own business. It felt good to be patient while others were impatient. Think about it, when you really need to use the bathroom or restroom, people might think you're being pushy if you're not patient. Anyway, people will talk about anything, and they might make it seem like a bad thing. But this isn't always the time to be patient with others. In conclusion, we should balance patience and assertiveness according to the situation.
918	18853	7	2	Patience may seem easy in @MONTH1, but in reality, it can be quite challenging. Activities like waiting in line or waiting for @CAPS1 all demand patience. Everyone, regardless of age, has patience, just like I did when I was in @NUM1 grade. Every day back then, I wondered if it was a dream or a nightmare. I always longed for something that would change my life forever. After @NUM3 years, that wish finally came true. I patiently awaited the response to our letter, whether it would be granted or denied. Before I knew it, my mom, dad, and I were on a plane heading straight to China. There, we would visit the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, and @LOCATION1. Our main purpose was to adopt a little sister. I had no idea what was in store for me. I was patient for @NUM4 weeks. Then we went to the lobby, and she was there with her caregiver, along with other families waiting for their children. I couldn't believe we were the @NUM5 ones to receive our gift from China. It was a big moment! When my mom tried to take her, she started whining, pinching, kicking, and who knows what else. After about an hour, she calmed down and played with her toys. That night, we went out for dinner at @ORGANIZATION1. My dad ordered a milkshake and let her have some, which was also a special moment. He didn't get it back until the glass was empty. We soon realized that she would have her ups and downs. She loved cake and ice cream and only wanted dad. It was dad's dream come true. In conclusion, patience is a part of our daily lives, no matter how big or small the situation. It will find its way into our lives, no matter how difficult it may be. Everyone has patience; the question is whether we will use it.
919	18854	7	2	"A patient person I know is my dad. He's really patient. One time, we were at the McDonald's drive - through. As soon as we pulled up, the lady said, ""Just one second."" We ended up sitting there for @NUM1 minutes. I was so tempted to get out of the car and go into the restaurant to order my food. But my dad just sat there, adjusting the gas until the lady came back. I was so mad that the lady made us wait for @NUM2 minutes. But then I was happy because I got my food. After that, my dad said, ""See, that's why patience pays off."" I got my double cheeseburger, large iced tea, and chocolate - chip cookies. My dad taught me an important lesson. Being impatient only brings drama, not happiness. In the end, patience is a virtue that can lead to a more peaceful and satisfying experience."
920	18855	7	2	"The time I had to be patient was when I waited in line to ride ""Shoot the @CAPS1"" at @CAPS2 Point. @CAPS2 Point was fun, but waiting in line required a lot of patience. We had to wait for about half an hour. Some people left because the wait was too long. If I wanted to ride the ride, I had to stay patient. Secondly, I was really excited to ride the roller coaster, so I stayed in line. It was a bit hard to stay patient when people were pushing and cutting in line, but it was worth it when I finally got to ride. As you can see, sometimes it's good to stay patient. When you get to do something fun, all the waiting is worth it. When people push you, you just have to stay calm and be patient. In conclusion, patience can lead to enjoyable experiences, and we should practice it in situations like these."
921	18856	7	2	I'm always patient. I'm truly patient until my birthday. When I receive presents, I no longer need to be patient because I've waited a whole year for them. Then, I wait for @CAPS1 as it's only about a month after my birthday. This year, I'm being patient until @CAPS1 since I already know what I'm getting. However, that's what I'm patient for; I'm not patient about much else.
922	18857	7	2	Patience is defined as being understanding and tolerant. Many people, including myself, find it challenging to be patient. Some individuals are naturally gifted with patience and can easily wait, even on the night the finale of their favorite book series is released. The clock, showing “@CAPS1 @CAPS2,” seemed to move slower than ever, taunting me. I didn't know why @CAPS10 hadn't returned. All I knew was that something very bad was going to happen that night. Perhaps it was the unbearable heat affecting me. When the door slammed shut, @CAPS10 argued that @CAPS4 had only been gone for five minutes. I didn't believe her, but we got in the car and drove on the winding road. Our car ride was timed so poorly that we encountered red lights at every stoplight, as if the lights were angry at us. We also got stuck behind slow - moving people with no way to pass them. Just as I was about to scream, we saw a green light and drove into @LOCATION1. As we approached @CAPS8, the bookstore came into view, and my excitement became uncontrollable. I bounced up and down like a child on a trampoline but stopped when I saw the long line. I shouted, “@CAPS3! I have no patience left to wait in this huge line.” It felt like the whole town was trying to annoy me. I fetched lawn chairs from the van and sat down to wait. It was going to be a long night. @CAPS8 @CAPS10 told me there were “@NUM1 minutes till midnight.” I thought it was impossible, but @CAPS4 was right; @NUM1 minutes wasn't that long. I breathed in the smell of coffee and listened to the chatter. Eventually, I became patient. When the seatbelt clicked into place, I opened the final book of the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 trilogy. My mind was full of questions about how it would end.
923	18858	7	2	One time, the teacher needed to tell me something, so I waited by the door. Then, she had to go to the office, and I had to wait some more. When she came back, she thanked me for being patient. Patience really means being able to wait. Some kids aren't patient. For example, there were @NUM1 kids in a group playing a game. They got very angry because they weren't called on. But the game was random; you picked a stick, and whoever got the stick went. So, being patient means having the ability to wait.
924	18859	7	2	Patience is the quality of being willing to wait for someone or something. It is an essential part of life. Sometimes, I lack patience, but I should strive to have it. Without patience, one may not achieve certain things in life because there are always things that require waiting. Therefore, having patience is necessary.
925	18860	7	2	“@CAPS1 go!” I shouted as I ran towards the entrance of @CAPS2 @CAPS3. My mom said, “@CAPS4 a minute, you've got to @CAPS4 for your friends.” As I stopped to wait for my mom, my best friend @PERSON1, and @CAPS5's brother @PERSON2, I started kicking rocks to keep myself busy. Once they caught up, we entered the large theme park. I excitedly said, “@CAPS1 go to the top @CAPS7 @CAPS8.” My mom replied, “@CAPS9, we can go on it, but @PERSON1 and I are staying in the back.” @PERSON2 yelled, “@CAPS10 because @PERSON3 and I are going in the front row!” As we walked to the line, it indicated that we'd have to wait @NUM1 minutes. After getting in line, I thought it was a very long line. It wasn't long before we finally reached the roller - coaster. The belt buckle made a “@CAPS11!” sound when we got in. Everyone exclaimed “@CAPS12!” when the ride took off. After this experience, I told myself that I can be patient.
926	18861	7	2	@PERSON2 and I went to the store. @CAPS1 was picking up marshmallows and chocolate to make s'mores. @CAPS1 was walking around when @CAPS1 came upon a large group of people looking to buy stuff for s'mores. So @PERSON2 and I got in line. @CAPS1 sat there for at least fifty minutes waiting for marshmallows and chocolate, but @CAPS1 came out with two marshmallows and two packs of chocolate. I asked her, “@PERSON2, why do you have only two?” @CAPS1 said that when she was waiting, they were getting rid of them, so they gave her two for the price of one. I smiled. When we went back to the car, we told @CAPS2, our other sister, “@PERSON1, we got two.” @CAPS2 snickered. We went back to @PERSON2's car, put the bag in the trunk where there were some other things, and then left. When we got home, @PERSON1 ate three, I ate two, and @PERSON2 ate five. @CAPS1 shared with us. Thank you.
927	18862	7	2	Today, I'm going to write about a friend of mine, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She is an extremely patient and pleasant girl. @CAPS1 is so patient that once when I asked her to wait for a second, I returned an hour later, and she was still there. She is undoubtedly the most patient and amazing girl I know. During tests, like the @CAPS3.E.A.P, she always takes her time and uses it wisely. (It's kind of funny since her last name is @CAPS2.) At the @ORGANIZATION1, she doesn't mind waiting in a long line for a corn dog. Now, I'm starting to think that @CAPS1 actually enjoys waiting. I love having @CAPS1 around because she doesn't mind waiting for me when I have something to do. In conclusion, her patience is truly a remarkable quality.
928	18863	7	2	Patience means understanding and tolerating experiences without complaining. I'll tell you about a time when I was patient. “I'm gonna tell your mom that you broke the hole in the wall,” @CAPS1 said. “You don't scare me,” @CAPS2 yelled. This is an example of blackmail, one of the many things you have to be patient with in life. @CAPS2 is a six - year - old girl I babysit. One day, she was at my house, and we were playing a game that involved kicking a shoe into a wall. When it was my turn, I kicked the shoe into the wall, literally. My mom came home, and I told her the boys did it. Of course, she believed me. But there was a witness, the six - year - old who can't keep a secret. I told her not to tell my mom because if she did, I'd be in big trouble, and she wouldn't be able to come over anymore. We went to the store, and she discovered the power of blackmail. She said she'd tell my mom if I didn't buy her ice cream. I had a tough day. I refused to buy her ice cream, so she told my mom, but my mom didn't care. In the end, my patience through this situation helped me deal with the difficult circumstances.
929	18864	7	2	After the first dance ended, applause filled the building. I was backstage with my dance team, going over the routine for the third time. The backstage was cold and crowded, and I was already sweaty after one practice. This was my first dance recital. I initially thought the whole thing would take an hour, but I was wrong. I soon found out that we were the last to perform, and it was at least five hours long. Everyone was asking, “@CAPS1, how many more dances?” and “What dance are we on?” Every hour felt like a day. I had a mix of emotions: excitement, boredom, and nervousness. Finally, it was our turn to get on stage. I was so relieved after all that waiting. I did twirls, jumps, and leaps and had a great time. Dancing was amazing. This experience taught me that great things truly take patience.
930	18865	7	2	One dull, rainy afternoon, I asked my mom to take me to a place called Modern. If you don't know what it is, I'll tell you. Modern is a place I adore. It has everything I love: a skate park, money - related activities (maybe arcade games), and tree - themed stuff. I went there with my mom. I told her she didn't have to stay, but she insisted on staying. So she watched while I skated for @NUM1 hour. She cheered me on and even got me a new skateboard. My mom is the most patient person I've ever met. Her patience allowed me to have a great time at Modern, and it's a quality I deeply appreciate.
931	18868	7	2	"Patience is a highly admirable trait. When one is patient, they are held in high regard. This is precisely why I hold a great deal of respect for my teacher, Ms. [PERSON1]. Ms. [PERSON1] is an extremely patient individual. If a student fails to understand something, she will work through the problem with them until comprehension is achieved, even if it takes several weeks. One instance that stands out is when she was teaching us how to add negative numbers. I was completely lost from the start. After she finished explaining the rules, she presented us with some sample problems. A few minutes later, she began checking each student's answers. When she reached me, a worried expression crossed her face. ""Is everything all right? You haven't completed your sample problems,"" she inquired. ""I don't understand,"" I replied. Ms. [PERSON1] fell silent for a moment before saying, ""Come see me after class."" After the day's classes ended, I went to see her. ""I noticed you were having difficulty with math today,"" she said. ""We're going to fix that."" She sat down with me and explained the process step - by - step. After approximately twenty minutes of her detailed explanations, I finally began to grasp the concept. Just ten minutes later, I was able to solve the problems on my own. ""You can go now,"" she said. ""You understand it better than the other students."" ""Thanks for being so patient with me,"" I said before leaving. She simply smiled. This was a prime example of Ms. [PERSON1]'s patience, and I am truly grateful for it."
932	18870	7	2	"The shrill sound of the soccer referee's whistle signaled substitutions. I was playing defense, and my coach, [CAPS1], called my name to take me off the field. Once I left the field, I grabbed my water bottle and sat on the bench. After a while, I asked my coach if I could go back in. His response was, ""You just got off."" In my mind, I thought I had been off the field for nearly ten minutes, so I couldn't understand his comment. I waited a few more minutes and asked again. Finally, he put me back in. When I got on the field, I realized I was on the side where the ball had barely touched during the entire game. I played for about five minutes and then was substituted again. This time, I was on the bench even longer, and I started to lose my patience. I asked my coach if I could go back in, and he said yes. After the game ended, I understood why my coach had benched me so often. He was a fan of the [LOCATION1] Wolverines, and I had a state tattoo on my face. Despite my frustration, this was a time when I managed to be patient."
933	18871	7	2	There was a time when I demonstrated great patience. My mom decided to buy me a new pair of shoes because I hadn't had a new pair in months. I had full confidence that my mom would get me the shoes when she had the money. I patiently waited for her return. I knew that whenever my mom had some money and I needed something new, she would get it for me. So, I sat patiently, believing that my new shoes were on the way. Then, I heard a knock on the door. When I opened it, there stood my mom, holding my brand - new pair of shoes. This experience showed that my patience was well - rewarded.
934	18872	7	2	"Real [CAPS3] was one of the fastest runners in [LOCATION1]. No one could outrun him in a race, catch up to him, or even sneak up on him. This made him extremely impatient. When his friends and family spoke to him, their slow - paced conversations frustrated him. For example, they would say, ""[CAPS1]...[CAPS2]... [CAPS3]...[CAPS4]...are...You...doing?"" [CAPS3] was enraged that no one was as fast as he was, so he decided to run away. He sprinted as fast as he could and reached [LOCATION2] in just [NUM1] minutes. In [LOCATION2], he found that people's speech was just as slow. When he asked, ""For sure, where can I find [CAPS6]?"" the local [CAPS7] responded in a drawn - out manner, ""[CAPS8]...ch...first...eh...you...turn...eh...best...ch"" [CAPS3] was in disbelief. He had always thought that no one could match his speed. But in this new place, he had no choice but to be patient. This experience taught him that patience was sometimes necessary, even for someone as fast as he was."
935	18873	7	2	"Patience is something many people struggle with. Let me tell you about a time when I was patient. Last year, when I was [NUM1], my dad and I went on a fishing trip to [CAPS2]. It was a two - hour straight drive, and I was extremely excited. We left at exactly six in the morning. I was so eager to go on this trip that I could hardly contain myself. As we hit the highway, I was fidgety and couldn't wait to get there. My dad said, ""Don't worry, son. We'll get there soon. Calm down, okay?"" I tried to be quiet and rest for the rest of the journey, patiently waiting to see what our campsite would look like. Finally, we arrived at our destination. This was a time when I learned the importance of patience during the anticipation of a fun experience."
936	18874	7	2	"@PERSON1, a young boy with a small bladder, was waiting in line for the bathroom at the super @CAPS1. He told himself, ""Patience; something good always comes from being patient."" He was in the middle of the line, behind five people and ahead of six others who were clearly in a hurry. Having learned to be polite at school, he let those six people go ahead of him. Ten minutes later, @PERSON1 entered the bathroom and spotted a one - hundred - dollar bill on the floor. Knowing the ""finders keepers"" principle, he took it. This experience taught @PERSON1 that being polite and patient is not only the right thing to do but can also bring rewards."
937	18875	7	2	One day at school, I was hanging out with three of my friends. Bored, we decided to go to the track and run a mile as a relay. In a relay, one person runs a mile, then the next person starts when the first is done, and so on. Since I was the fastest at running a mile, I was the last one in the relay. I had to be patient and wait for my turn. Finally, after the first three friends had completed their miles, it was my turn. This experience showed that patience is necessary even in simple activities like a relay run.
938	18876	7	2	Patience is not a trait possessed by everyone. It is difficult to learn and even more challenging to master. However, there is always an appropriate time to exercise patience. In various aspects of life, patience can lead to better outcomes, making it a valuable quality to cultivate.
939	18877	7	2	When I went to the @CAPS1 event organized by @ORGANIZATION2 for the youth group at my church, I took some of my friends. In the maze, we went in groups. My group consisted of @CAPS2, me, my dad, @PERSON1, and @CAPS3. @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS4 were in the group behind us. Half - way through the @CAPS5 @ORGANIZATION2 event, a man with a chainsaw started chasing us. Then @PERSON1 accidentally knocked my glasses off my face, so we had to stop to find them. Just before we found them, my friends from the @CAPS6 group arrived and had to wait for @NUM1 minutes, which felt like a long time. As a result, they didn't get chased by the man with the chainsaw.
940	18878	7	2	"My experience of being patient was when I had to wait in line for @NUM1 hour and @NUM2 minutes to get on the "" @CAPS1 of @CAPS2,"" a really cool ride. Since I knew I'd be in line for a while, I started chatting with the people around me. I said hello to the couple in front of me, and we had a long conversation. It turned out they were from @PERSON1, @LOCATION1, which is very close to @LOCATION2 where I live. It was strange to meet people from so near in @LOCATION3. Thanks to the conversation, time passed quickly. Before I knew it, we were getting strapped into our seats, and the ride began. This shows that patience can be made easier by engaging with others."
941	18879	7	2	"You may have heard the saying: patience is a virtue. Patience implies being understanding and tolerant. Its opposite is perhaps having a short temper or getting angry quickly. I firmly believe that patience is crucial in life, and I strive to be patient every day. I view life as a marathon, not a sprint. This means that when something takes time, one should have the patience to see it through. I draw this analogy between life and sports because I am an accomplished athlete. I play football, a sport that demands a great deal of patience. When I make a good pass and my receiver drops the ball, I remind myself to be patient with him, just as my coach has been patient with me. Football is a team sport, and we all need to be patient with one another. Although sports offer a great example, patience extends far beyond that. One must first be patient with oneself before being able to be patient with others. What does this mean? Whether you are a child or an adult, you should forgive yourself when you make mistakes. If you are late for work, you should let it go and tell yourself, ""Don't do it again."" Focus on this and forget about everything else. Once again, I turn to sports. If you lose a game, you should review the footage, identify your mistakes, and avoid repeating them. Then, put the loss behind you and concentrate on winning the next game. I believe that patience is one of the most important virtues a person can possess."
942	18880	7	2	Have you ever wondered what it means to be truly patient? Let me tell you about Patience, a five - year - old girl known for her remarkable patience. One day, Patience expressed her desire to visit the most amazing amusement park in Juancey. Her mother immediately began researching on the internet. It took her mother two weeks to make all the arrangements, including choosing the amusement park, gathering the necessary funds, and booking a hotel for their stay at 3 PM. Throughout this time, Patience remained silent, never once asking her mother if everything was planned or if they were still going to the amusement park. When they arrived at the hotel, her mother had to get the room key, unpack, and get dressed to go. Patience didn't utter a single word. Once they reached the amusement park, they faced a long line to buy tickets and had to wait for two hours. Patience didn't complain at all. After finally getting the tickets, they decided to go on the biggest roller coaster first. But there was yet another long line. Patience told her mother that she really wanted to go on the ride and was willing to wait. Her mother agreed, and they waited for an hour until they could board the roller coaster. All the waiting was worth it. Patience endured all the waiting patiently and, in the end, had a great time going on all the roller coasters. This is Patience's story of being patient, and I hope you enjoyed it.
943	18881	7	2	I once demonstrated patience while playing volleyball. In volleyball, if your team doesn't score points, you don't get to serve. During one game, our team wasn't performing well. I was really eager to serve because my overhand serve was in good form. However, everyone on the team got a chance to serve except me. Despite my eagerness, I never complained about not being able to serve. In the end, our team managed to win the game by two points. Everyone cheered and chanted in celebration. This experience taught me that patience can be rewarding, even when you have to wait for your turn.
944	18882	7	2	Getting injured in a contact sport can be quite painful. I know this all too well from the time I sprained my ankle. It hurt a great deal. After the injury, I had to go to the doctor. As usual, I had to wait an interminable amount of time at the doctor's office, but sometimes it's worth the wait. Once I was finally seen, the nurse asked me a few questions, and then I had to wait even more. But at least I eventually found out what was wrong. The doctors took X - rays, which took some time to develop. Finally, I got the results and discovered that it was just a sprain. After my ankle healed, my football coach said I would only be a backup in the game because he didn't want my ankle to get hurt again. However, at the end of the game on [DATE1], he let me play. I guess that was my reward for waiting patiently throughout the game.
945	18883	7	2	One stormy day, my brother and I were playing soccer inside our house. My brother kicked the ball in the air and attempted a scissors kick. Unfortunately, the ball hit my mom's lamp, breaking the bulb. When my mom asked, I told her it was my brother. But she still said I should fix the lamp. Fixing it was a difficult task as the pieces kept falling off. It required a great deal of patience. Finally, I managed to fix the lamp. This experience taught me that being patient is always a good thing.
946	18884	7	2	Once upon a time, there was a kind princess named @PERSON1. One day, she felt hungry but didn't want to get her own food. So, she asked her maid to bring it. However, the maid was taking a shower. @PERSON1 had to be patient and sat in her room. It seemed like an eternity to her. She read a book, watched @CAPS1.V, and then went to check if the maid was done. The maid was still not finished, and @PERSON1 became impatient. She got really angry, pounded on the door, and started to say something. Just then, she noticed from the corner of her eye that the bathroom light was on, but there was no one inside. To her horror, the maid was right behind her. She felt extremely embarrassed and humiliated. So, she ran to her room and cried. This is the story of when the princess lost her patience.
947	18885	7	2	There was a time when I demonstrated patience. My little sister was in the bathtub taking a bath for four hours, and I was waiting for her to finish. Despite the long wait, I managed to stay calm and waited until she was done. This experience showed that I could be patient in difficult situations.
948	18886	7	2	Finally, the much - awaited day arrived! The new roller coaster, @CAPS4 Michogg’s Adventure, was opening. I couldn't contain my excitement. The only obstacle between me and the ride was the drive. We squeezed into the old minivan and set off for @CAPS4. After @NUM1 minutes, my brother asked, “Are we there yet?” At last, we reached our destination. We waited at the ticket booth for half an hour and then got in. My brother and sister wanted to go on the kiddy rides, which took another hour. My mom said, “Come on, your older brother wants to go on the big ride.” There it was, the amazing roller coaster. The only problem was that there were many people queuing up. I thought, “It will be worth it.” We got in the line and after @NUM2 hours, we finally got on the ride. When it was over, @NUM3 exclaimed, “That was awesome! Let's go on it again!” Then I looked at the line. There were twice as many people. I said, “At least there won't be as many people on the other rides.” @NUM3 was very patient to go on the ride, even though we spent @NUM5 hours in total.
949	18887	7	2	One beautiful morning, @CAPS1 decided to renew his license. He thought that if he woke up really early, he would be the only one at the licensing place. Unfortunately, everyone had the same idea. @CAPS1 was really tired as he woke up at @NUM1 am, but the place opened at @NUM2 am and he was unaware of this. So, he went to the pancake house and had a nice hot coffee. When he came back, there was a long line that went around the corner. @CAPS1 waited patiently, and eventually, he got his license.
950	18888	7	2	I once showed patience when my mom was taking me to my friend @PERSON1's house to play football. It all started when @PERSON1 called me to come and play. I asked my mom for a ride, and she said yes. While driving, my mom had to stop at the grocery store to get some things. She spent a whole hour there. Then she had to go somewhere else and took @NUM1 hours. My friend called and asked, “Are you coming or what?” I replied yes and managed to keep my cool and wait. Finally, I arrived at my friend's place. It might not be a very exciting story, but it was the time when I was patient.
951	18889	7	2	I was on the third day of volleyball tryouts, confident that I'd make the A team. I tossed the ball up, but it was a poor toss. I threw it up again and hit it as hard as I could. “This is my last serve,” I thought. “Please let it be over.” I watched the round, white ball soar through the thin air. As it neared the net, it seemed as if gravity suddenly took effect. The ball dropped and hit the net, then rolled off. It didn't make it over. I felt the cool wind brush against my sweaty face. While the coaches decided which team we'd be on, I sat on the damp grass. Finally, they handed me a small, white envelope. I breathed slowly. I could feel my stomach tying into a giant knot. I'd been waiting for this moment for months. I reached my sweaty hand into the envelope. I grew more nervous by the second. I slowly slid the piece of paper out. I heard a girl scream in excitement. Finally, I'd find out if I was on the A team, the B team, or getting cut. It felt like the world depended on it. When I saw the word “congratulations,” I felt a rush of relief and excitement. At the sight of those words, I pulled out the rest of the letter: “You have made the B team.” I suddenly had a mix of emotions racing through my body. I decided to just be happy. I went around congratulating those who made a team and hugging those who didn't. After all this time, I finally knew. It made me happy to know that I'd tried something and had to wait to see if I succeeded. I wouldn't have it any other way.
952	18890	7	2	“Where is my dad? He didn't come home yet, right?” I asked. “Sweetheart,” my mom began, “Your father was called out to war.” “No!” I ran up to my room, pacing back and forth. “He could have said goodbye. I haven't seen him in two weeks, and now he's gone.” My mom walked in. “I know this is hard for you, but you can send him letters.” “I know. I'm going to start one now,” I said. As she walked out, I wrote a letter saying, “Dad, you could have said goodbye, but you left.” Weeks passed, and there was no sign of a letter from him. Every day when I came home from school, I'd ask, “Any letter from Dad?” “No, honey, nothing for you,” my mom would reply. I started to grow up, but still no letters. My brothers and sisters got them, but not me. I felt forgotten. “Why haven't I gotten a letter from Dad, but everyone else did?” I asked. “I don't know,” my mom said. I'd send him a letter every day, but I never got one back. I started to wonder why. Did he hate me? Did he not want to talk to me? Had he forgotten about me? One day, I heard someone yell, “You have mail!” I ran down the stairs to the kitchen. There was something on the counter for me. It had my name on it, but it didn't say who it was from. “Who is it from?” I asked. “Open it and find out,” my mom said. I slowly opened the letter and started reading. “Don't worry. I haven't written yet, but maybe this will make up for it. I love you more than anything in the world, Daddy.” I opened the package, and it was a picture of us and his army sack with all the letters I'd sent him. All of them were unopened, and there was a note in all the envelopes. That very night, he called and said, “But I love you no matter what. See you soon.”
953	18891	7	2	Patience is the ability to wait or stay put for someone or something. Some individuals can exhibit a high level of patience, while others have none at all. For instance, when you're in a hurry and waiting in line at a store behind someone with a large number of items, you have two choices. You could be rude, yelling and causing a commotion, or you could wait patiently. There's a chance that the person in front might let you cut in line. That's what patience means to me.
954	18892	7	2	Patience is one of the world's most crucial life - skills. It's great having my best friend live across the street. He has an older sister named Sarah. Sarah was born with Down syndrome, which means she doesn't understand things as quickly as most people. You can also notice it from her behavior. Sarah is one of the happiest people I've ever met. However, getting to know Sarah well also has a drawback. You need to be extremely patient. When talking to her, many people give up and leave because she doesn't understand right away. But her closest friends have developed an extraordinary level of patience. Having Sarah as my neighbor is one of the best things that could have happened. She's made me a master at one of the most important life - skills. Sarah is a wonderful person and, I'd say, a great teacher. When you're having a bad day, you should be grateful because not everyone is as fortunate as you.
955	18894	7	2	It was a hot summer day in [Year]. My family and I went to Disney World. We went on all the rides. Our last one was the Tower of Terror. The line looked short as we walked there. But once we got there, it stretched all the way to the train. It was like waiting for something impossible. My brother and I had to go to the bathroom. My dad and mom stayed to save our spots. When we got back, my parents were one spot further back. “Why are we so far back?” my brother asked. My parents got out of line to get a drink. Ten families got in line. We waited and waited. Then, something unexpected happened. The ten families were in the wrong line, so we got to move up (behind three other families). My family and I had so much fun on the ride. It was definitely worth the wait.
956	18895	7	2	"Everyone possesses patience, whether it is long - lasting or short - lived. People often say, ""Patience is a virtue."" Those in certain professions, especially first - grade teachers, require a great deal of patience. As students progress through higher grades, teachers expect older kids and young adults to behave well. In the workplace, dealing with adults can affect one's level of patience. For example, my dad is a lawyer. When dealing with adults, his patience is not as long as my mom's. My mom also deals with adults, but having grown up as the oldest of four brothers, she has a different level of patience. My dad expects people to be punctual within a few minutes. If I ask him to pick me up at seven o'clock, he will arrive precisely at that time. On the other hand, if I ask my mom to pick me up at seven, she might be ten minutes early or late. This is my account of the patience levels of the people I know, highlighting the importance of patience in different aspects of life."
957	18896	7	2	On a particular day, Patience, my mom, and I were sitting on the couch. We planned to go to the store to buy groceries and then head to a school - clothing shop. My sister didn't want to go, but my mom made her. She was already in a bad mood. When we got the food, she claimed she didn't like it, but it was just her usual self - centered and greedy attitude. When we arrived at the clothing store, my mom told my sister we were there. My sister doesn't like the styles of clothes available there, perhaps because she thinks she won't fit into them. Once inside, she couldn't find anything she liked and started throwing a tantrum. I was amazed at how patient my mom was with her. Eventually, we left the store, and my mom took Patience to my spare room. This experience shows how patience can be tested in daily family outings.
958	18897	7	2	"On @DATE1, @PERSON4 was in class, as usual, fooling around at his desk. @PERSON4 is not typically a patient person. When the teacher asked a question, @PERSON4 thought he had one of the best answers. His hand shot up immediately, one of the first to be raised. Ms. @PERSON1 Berry, a somewhat round - shaped woman with large glasses, is well - loved by the students as a teacher. She said, ""There are lots of answers."" Then she asked, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4, what's your answer?"" Some students were scratching their heads. As there were about @NUM2 more hands in the air, @PERSON4 was eager to blurt out his answer but decided to try being patient. Ms. Berry said, ""Let these last @NUM3 people answer, and then we'll move on."" Inside, @PERSON4 was seething with impatience, but he managed to look calm on the outside. @PERSON3 said, ""@CAPS10."" @CAPS10 answered, ""@CAPS11, a metaphor?"" The teacher confirmed it was a metaphor. @PERSON4 mumbled under his breath, ""Darn it, that was my answer!"" However, he was still happy because he had waited patiently. This incident shows that even an impatient person can learn to be patient in the right circumstances."
959	18898	7	2	"Bang! I accidentally shot myself in the foot with a @CAPS1 gun. It all started when my sister received a gun for her birthday. I approached a target, got ready to shoot, and that's when I got shot. I went to my mom and told her what had happened. The next day, we went to the doctor's office. There were about @NUM1 or @NUM2 patients there, not including me. My mom said, ""It could take a while."" I have very little patience. We waited for an hour, and it seemed like it was going to be a bad day. The doctor called out a patient's name, but it wasn't mine. We waited a total of @NUM3 hours before the doctor finally called my name. After the @CAPS1 was removed from my foot, I went home to rest. This was a difficult time when I had to exercise patience despite my natural impatience."
960	18899	7	2	Patience is a valuable trait, and I'll share a story about how being patient got me what I wanted. Two weeks before my birthday on @DATE1, I asked for a male scooter. I was told I was too young for one, which made me extremely upset and angry. I waited a few days, but there was no scooter. I waited another week, still with no result. Finally, on my birthday, @DATE2, I got my scooter! I was overjoyed. This experience clearly shows that people should be patient because they might just get what they ask for in the end.
961	18900	7	2	One time I demonstrated patience was during a trip to Florida with my grandparent. The journey to Florida took around one and a half days. Subsequently, it took us six hours to reach @LOCATION2. My uncle @PERSON1, his wife, and their four boys also joined us. They had rented a house for us to stay together. On @DATE1, the day after our arrival, we went to @LOCATION1 to visit my grandpa's sister @PERSON2. This trip took about an hour and thirty minutes as we got lost along the way. The last time we went to Florida was for my cousin @CAPS1's event. Actually, it was his little sister who was getting @CAPS2. I was really looking forward to seeing them. The wedding was @CAPS3, and I couldn't understand it, so I patiently waited for it to end. After the wedding, we returned to my aunt's house. On @DATE2, we visited the flea market, which was extremely large. It took us an hour to explore the whole place. I wanted to leave at stand fifty - five, but I had to buy something for my parents. So, once again, I patiently waited until we left. On @DATE3, we started our journey back home. We arrived around @NUM1 in the @TIME1. I was so exhausted that I almost fell asleep on the floor. Throughout the entire trip there and back, I waited patiently. This experience showed me that I could be patient even in long and tiring situations.
962	18901	7	2	Patience is a crucial skill for living a well - ordered life. Without it, life can become chaotic. Around @NUM1 years ago, I went to @ORGANIZATION1. Those who have been there know that the lines can be up to an hour and a half long. I was waiting to go on the haunted house ride, which seemed like it would be a lot of fun. When I arrived, there were about @NUM2 people in line. My mom asked, “@CAPS1, do you want to go on a different ride and then come back to the haunted house?” I declined and joined the line. After waiting for about @NUM3 hours, there were only about @NUM4 people in front of my mom and me. Finally, it was our turn. When I sat down in the chair and got buckled in, I felt a great sense of accomplishment for having been patient. I didn't keep asking if it was our turn; I just stood there patiently. This experience made me realize that I could be patient. I understood from that moment that patience is an essential skill that can help us live our lives without unnecessary chaos.
963	18902	7	2	One instance when I was a patient was when I broke my arm. I was at the medical facility for @NUM1. I was playing outside, climbing a pole, and when I dropped down, I injured my arm and it swelled up. My doctor was very calm and kind. During this time, I had to be patient while getting treated. Whether it was waiting for the doctor to examine me or for the treatment to take effect, I endured the situation patiently. In conclusion, this was a significant time when I demonstrated patience in the face of an injury.
964	18903	7	2	I once had to be patient when I was in line to see @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The line outside was incredibly long, and I was considering leaving. However, I didn't want to lose my place. When I finally entered the venue, the line inside was even longer than the one outside. So, I decided to be patient and wait. Unfortunately, by the time I got in, the movie was over. I was extremely angry and went straight home to sleep. This experience taught me that sometimes, being patient doesn't always lead to a favorable outcome, but it also shows our ability to persevere in difficult situations.
965	18904	7	2	Patience is an essential part of our world. It is definitely something that everyone needs, yet not everyone possesses it. I firmly believe that patience is necessary because everything in life takes time. If one claims not to have the time for something, they are essentially saying they don't have the time to live. Without patience, we wouldn't be here today. Patience is more than just its dictionary definition; it means allowing time to pass so that we can achieve our goals. For example, a @CAPS1 teacher for an elective class must be patient to teach the @CAPS1 language effectively. Otherwise, they would not be a good teacher. Another example is when you are on @NUM1, heading to @LOCATION1, and traffic is congested due to a @NUM2 car pile - up. Honking your horn won't speed up the traffic. Instead, it makes the wait seem longer and people may label you as impatient. In conclusion, patience is vital for mankind. If nobody had patience, life on earth would be impossible as we need to tolerate delays and setbacks to progress and coexist.
966	18905	7	2	Last year, when I was a student, I had to be patient every day because of my aunt. My aunt would pick me up from school, but on some days, I didn't know if she was coming. For example, on the first day of school, I was confused about who would pick me up. Since I didn't have a phone, I couldn't call anyone. So, I waited patiently at school. While waiting, I went to a friend's house with my friend and then returned to the school to wait some more. After about 30 or 40 minutes, which felt like an hour, my aunt finally came and picked me up. This experience taught me the importance of patience in uncertain situations.
967	18906	7	2	My neighbor showed great patience when he shot a 10 - point buck for the first time. He was extremely excited and proud of his catch, a beautiful white - tailed deer. He said he had never felt such pride before. After the hunt, he went out to dinner. I clearly remember the look on his face when he told me about it, and I was genuinely happy for him. If I had the money, I would have gotten something to commemorate the 10 - point buck. When I saw the deer's head, I was in awe; it was the most beautiful deer I had ever seen. This event was a great moment for my neighbor, and it also made me appreciate the thrill of a successful hunt.
968	18907	7	2	"One day, @PERSON2 stepped out of his warm house into the cold, blustery air. He walked slowly, staggering on the ice, towards the pitching barn. This barn was special as @PERSON3 trained many softball pitchers and catchers there, including me. I was already in the barn and had turned on the heater. I was warming up by doing wrist flicks, 'k - s', one - leg throws, arm circles, and screw - ball flicks. My catcher, @PERSON1, caught every ball. @PERSON3 said, ""@CAPS1. Let me see your screwball and rise ball."" I took my place on the mound and threw a screwball. It curved right, and the glove cracked. ""@CAPS2! Excellent! Hey you! Give me a high five!"" @PERSON1 exclaimed. I slapped her hand, and we both said ""@CAPS3!"" ""@CAPS4, @CAPS4 good. Now throw me a rise,"" @PERSON2 instructed. I threw a rise ball. After I threw three rise balls, @PERSON3 gave me pointers. ""You are doing good. Just keep your legs open and your arm flicking up a little more,"" he advised. He was incredibly patient with me, even when one rise ball almost hit the ceiling. He just kept working with me. After many more pitches, I finally got it. We finished our pitching session ten minutes later. @PERSON3 told me I was doing great and said we would work on it again on @DATE2. ""Is @CAPS5 on @DATE1? Right?"" I asked. ""@CAPS6 day!"" he replied cheerfully and gave me a hug. I love @PERSON3 not only because he is my dad but also because he is a great, happy, funny, sweet, and patient man."
969	18908	7	2	"Once, my dad and I were supposed to go to the races. I had to wait for my dad, who said he would get off work at @NUM1 o'clock, which was also the start time of the races. Since it took an hour to get there, I knew we would be late and wouldn't be able to meet the drivers or sit in their cars. So, I patiently played with my toys in my room, worried that I wouldn't go at all. Then, I decided to take a nap. Later, I felt someone tapping me. I opened my eyes and saw my dad, who said, ""Get up, we're going to the races."" I was overjoyed. When we got there, we found out we had the wrong time and were an hour early. So, I got to meet the drivers and sit in their cars. That weekend, it was the end - of - the - year race season. First, there was a three - hundred - lap race, then a figure - eight boat race, and finally a school - bus derby race. A little kid joked, ""Now how am I going to get to school? They're crashing all the school buses."" After the races were finished, I thanked my dad for taking me and for not being late to meet the drivers. We went home, and I went to bed, with wonderful memories of the races."
970	18909	7	2	When my family and I were going to @LOCATION1, I had to be patient. Our flight was at @TIME1 am, so we arrived at the airport at @NUM1. We waited for two hours, but no one complained because we all had something to do. I played video games with @PERSON1, and my mom read a book. Finally, we boarded the plane, and the three - hour flight to @LOCATION1 was also uneventful with no complaints. This trip was a great example of how we can handle waiting patiently when traveling. In the end, our ability to be patient made the journey more pleasant, and we arrived at @LOCATION1 ready to enjoy our trip.
971	18910	7	2	On an extremely hot summer day, I, my mother, and @CAPS1 went to the Best Western. Since our home lacked air - conditioning, we were sweltering, feeling like ice cream melting under the sun. Upon arrival, we were delighted to discover a pool. We went to our room, changed into bathing suits, and then headed down to the pool. We found a spot and placed our towels there. However, everyone had to exit the pool for chemical cleaning. I was filled with intense anger and disappointment, but I managed to calm down and wait. I waited and waited, yet no one was allowed to enter. Approximately fifteen minutes had passed, and everyone was extremely bored. Finally, a buzzing sound rang in my ears. But it only indicated that some food was ready at the snack bar, which initially raised my hopes but then dashed them. I continued waiting, and at last, a voice announced, “Okay, everyone back in the pool.” I was overjoyed and immediately ran and jumped into the pool. Although it took about half an hour and might not have seemed worth it, it was still a fun experience. So, perhaps next time when something takes a long time, I'll try to be less aggravated and more positive.
972	18911	7	2	One time, a friend was at my house. When it was my turn to play the game, I had to wait for a while. I ended up watching my friend play. I'm never patient when it comes to food. I really dislike waiting for my food; it's just awful having to wait. I can't think of any other time when I was patient because I simply don't like being patient. In conclusion, patience is not my strong suit, especially when food is involved.
973	18912	7	2	On a cold @DATE1 at @TIME1, when it was still nearly pitch - black, I was in a hunting blind with my dad. It was so quiet that we could hear a pin drop. I had to exercise great patience because even the slightest movement could scare a deer away. We sat there in complete silence for almost @NUM1 hours. For me, being patient was a real challenge, but I managed to do it. While being patient in the woods, a deer eventually came by. I had to be patient and wait until its head went down so that I could stand up and take a shot. This waiting process took about @NUM2 minutes. It was all worth it because I finally shot the deer, and my family and I got to enjoy deer meat for dinner. This experience taught me the value of patience in hunting.
974	18913	7	2	Today, I had to be patient during the MEAP. The MEAP is a @NUM1 - to - @NUM2 - day assessment that includes writing, reading, and math. In my opinion, it is the hardest thing one has to do in school, and I even think it's the hardest thing in life. However, it helps students learn a great deal more and may be beneficial for future jobs. Overall, despite its difficulty, the MEAP serves a valuable purpose in education and career preparation.
975	18914	7	2	A time when I was patient was in @NUM1 grade. Our teachers told us to write a story about being patient. Once upon a time, there was a girl named @PERSON1 who was not patient, and the whole world knew her as “the impatient one.” @PERSON1 hated this name. She decided to take action and said @CAPS1 @CAPS2 that she would make them stop calling her that. She went around her street and asked everyone @CAPS1 @CAPS2 if she could stop being called “the impatient one.” No one gave her an answer, so she shouted out @CAPS1 @CAPS2 that she wanted to stop being called that. Then, she heard a voice. It was an old man named @CAPS4, who said he knew @CAPS1 how she could stop being called that way. @PERSON1 pleaded with him to tell her. The old man simply said that all she needed to do was be patient. @PERSON1 thought to herself that she had to be patient. So, she went to the store, got in line, and was patient. Everyone around her said good job to her, and from then on, people stopped calling her “the impatient one.” This shows that with patience, one can change others' perceptions.
976	18915	7	2	One time, I, along with my mom, dad, and sister, went to @CAPS1. Upon arrival, we were given a number and instructed to wait. I patiently sat there, quietly biding my time. After @NUM1, we were finally seated at a table. We all sat down and told the waitress our drink orders. Then, we perused the menus to decide what to eat. When the waitress returned to take our food orders, I and my dad both chose steak, while my mom and sister opted for mini tocos. She assured us that our food would be out shortly, but that turned out to be far from the truth. We ended up waiting for @NUM2. My mom wanted to leave, but the rest of us decided to wait patiently. Finally, after @NUM2 @NUM4, our food arrived, and we were relieved. However, the mini tocos were frozen solid. So, we asked for the bill. The waitress brought it, thankfully not frozen. We paid the bill, left no tip, and left. After that, my mom thanked me for being so patient, and we never went back to that place again.
977	18916	7	2	There are times when I demonstrate patience, and at other times, I truly do. Patience encompasses @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, which are the positive character traits of a leader. Without patience, one will @CAPS5 up in every challenging task. Therefore, be a leader, someone who does not @CAPS5 up. Be a person you can love and strive to be everything you are capable of. Remember, patience is of utmost importance.
978	18917	7	2	Have you ever waited for something that seemed so @CAPS1 away and took so @CAPS2 to achieve, yet in the end, it was all worthwhile? I have. On @DATE1, I took the @CAPS3.A.T to gain admission to the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, also known as @CAPS8, (@NUM1 - @CAPS9). I had to wake up at @NUM2 am on a @DATE2 to get prepared. I had to reach @ORGANIZATION1 by @NUM3. When I arrived, I waited in line for @NUM4 minutes to find out the room where I would take the test. The test took @CAPS10 @CAPS11, with three breaks. After finishing the test and exiting the room into a crowd of about @NUM5 other students taking the test, I met my mom, who gave me encouraging smiles and warm hugs. Since my three best friends also took the test, we all explored the campus together afterward. It was indeed a great day.
979	18919	7	2	It was @NUM1 at night on @CAPS6, and I was extremely anxious to know what I would receive for @CAPS1 the next day. I couldn't fall asleep at all because I was so excited for that wonderful day of getting presents and celebrating @CAPS1. I love @CAPS1 because of the joy, fun, and happiness that fill everyone's spirits. @CAPS6 teaches us that waiting is rewarding, as good things come to those who wait and to those around them. Sometimes, I already have an idea of what I'll get (since my mom isn't good at hiding things). I'm patient with others because I hope they'll be patient with me too. We should treat others as we'd like to be treated. I firmly believe that @CAPS1 is the most joyful time of the year. Don't you think so? @CAPS6 is a great time to bond with pets, friends, and family, as it brings us closer. Well, that's my take on patience. Thank you for your time, @CAPS9.
980	18920	7	2	I decided to write a story in my own way about patience. Patience refers to the ability to wait for something or someone. For example, in a restaurant, one has to be patient and wait for their food. In an airplane waiting area, passengers need to be patient for the plane to land and get ready for departure. These are the aspects of patience that I understand.
981	18921	7	2	Right now, I'm in the process of trying to be patient. My birthday is approaching, and my cell - phone isn't working. I've told my mom that I need a new phone. Since she has certain limitations, I must be patient. I'm simply hoping for a great outcome. I'm not sure about some details here, like what exactly is meant by “the is nv @CAPS2”. Being patient is truly difficult. It means not whining or yelling. Sometimes, patience comes with certain challenges. So, I'll be patient and see how things go.
982	18922	7	2	I constantly have to be patient when teaching my puppy, @PERSON1, the difference between right and wrong. It makes me wonder, when do others need to be patient? @PERSON1 is a new member of my family and is still learning. I try to teach him new things daily, but when I've gone over something about @NUM1 times, I start to get a bit angry. Mom reminds me that @PERSON1 is just learning and that being patient will help train him faster. In conclusion, patience is key when teaching @PERSON1 new things, as it leads to quicker learning.
983	18923	7	2	On a cold @DATE1 at @TIME1, the @NUM1 and @NUM2 grade football teams were scheduled to play at different times, one at @NUM3 and the other at @NUM4. There were @CAPS1 leaders present, and I was one of them. The game began around @NUM3 o'clock, and we started cheering. By @NUM3:15, we were extremely cold despite wearing our warm - ups. The cold made us a bit cranky. At halftime, it got even colder. We took a break and went to get hot chocolate. In our rush to get back to the bleachers, I walked faster and dropped my hot chocolate on myself. I was mad, but as a @CAPS1 leader, I had to stay positive. We continued cheering, even though it was colder than at the start. Some @CAPS1 leaders decided to take off their warm - ups, and we all followed suit. We endured the cold until the @NUM7 game ended. Then we went home, likely to go to bed.
984	18924	7	2	In my opinion, patience plays a vital role in many aspects of life. For instance, when applying for a job, one must be patient. Otherwise, the boss might dismiss you without a word. Another area where patience is essential for success is when waiting for things to happen. Moaning and complaining because something takes too long is not patience. Instead, one should take action. Also, if you're waiting to receive money from your job, you can't resort to illegal means; you have to be patient and wait. Overall, patience is a necessary virtue in various life situations.
985	18925	7	2	Once, I was at an airport in @LOCATION1. We were on our way home from @LOCATION2. After getting off the plane, we had to go through customs. There were only two staff members handling @LOCATION3 citizens, and the line was extremely long. After half an hour, we were only halfway through. There was a lot of waiting and whining from the people in the line, but we finally managed to get through. The staff thanked us for our patience. Once our passports were stamped, we were on our way to catch our next flight.
986	18926	7	2	"Once upon a time, there was a young girl named @CAPS1. She lived with her parents in the small town of @PERSON2. Her twelfth birthday was approaching, and she was extremely excited as twelve had been her lucky number since childhood. Her mother proposed they go into town and dine at chef @PERSON1's place, and @CAPS1 readily agreed.  On the morning of her birthday, her father made her pancakes topped with fresh strawberries. After that, she went out to milk the cows for her parents. She disliked this chore as the cows were very stubborn, but she managed to finish milking them in just @NUM1 minutes. She then returned inside and placed the milk on the table.  As the day went on, @CAPS1 began to wonder if she would receive a birthday present. She decided to be patient. When her mother came home from work at the dress - making store, she asked, ""Are you ready to go eat?"" @CAPS1 jumped up and shouted, ""Yes, yes!""  They drove into town and parked at the restaurant. When they entered, the lights were off. Her father flipped the switch, and to her surprise, all her close family and friends were there, shouting, ""Surprise!"" @CAPS1 was in a state of shock and kept repeating, ""@CAPS3 you, @CAPS3 you, @CAPS3 you."" There were twelve presents on a table, and under the table was a dog. Her parents had gotten her a dog. She named the dog Wonder because every time she saw it, she thought about her wonderful life. Through this experience, she learned that great things come to those who are patient."
987	18927	7	2	Patience is defined as waiting without getting frustrated. One day, my family and I went to a state game in @LOCATION1. My father, who is usually impatient, showed remarkable patience, which surprised us all.  When we entered the stadium, there was a group of people, @CAPS1, sitting in our seats without realizing. We had to wait for security to come and ask them to move. It took about half an hour for security to find us. During this time, my father remained patient, but the @CAPS1 individuals were getting restless, and we started to feel very angry.  When security finally arrived, we then had to wait for them to handle the situation. My father still kept his cool. After all the waiting, we were finally able to take our seats. The reason my father was patient was that he did not want to get kicked out of the stadium. In the end, his patience paid off as we were able to enjoy the game without any further disruptions.
988	18928	7	2	Last @DATE1, or @NUM1 @DATE1s ago, I went to Cedar Point with my friend @PERSON1. It was my first time there, while it was @PERSON1's @NUM2 time. We had a great time going on numerous rides, but the long lines were a major drawback. The lines were incredibly long!  At first, I struggled to be patient, but as time passed, I managed to develop patience. However, my friend was the opposite. She wanted to go on the Dragster, but I was not interested. She even seemed to forget that it was my first time at Cedar Point.  After spending hours on amazing rides, the lines only got longer. My parents lost their patience, but my friend and I remained calm. It was quite funny because usually, it's the other way around.  I often wish that more people could be more patient. However, I'm not sure if that will ever happen. Despite the long lines, the experience at Cedar Point was still memorable, and it taught me the importance of patience.
989	18929	7	2	Do you have patience? Well, I know a guy named @CAPS1.M who truly embodies patience. @CAPS1.M holds the secret to being patient. One thing that helps him is that he doesn't talk much.  For instance, once we were at Cedar Point. We stood in a line for three hours, but @CAPS2 didn't seem to care at all. He just remained calm. Another time, we were outside playing. We made a hole, and he got stung five times, yet he didn't complain about how much it hurt.  I do have some patience, but not as much as @CAPS2. However, @CAPS2 isn't perfect. When he's hungry, he loses all patience, and I can't quite figure out why.  The time @CAPS2 showed the most patience was when his mom's car broke down in the middle of nowhere. It was winter, so the car was cold. It took nine hours for a tow truck to arrive. This situation really tested his patience, and while it made his mom extremely frustrated, @CAPS2 remained calm until the very end. Eventually, they went to @ORGANIZATION1 to get food and had a nice meal with @PERSON1. @CAPS2 has the most patience I've ever seen in anyone.
990	18930	7	2	One day, I went to the store with my mother. There was an old lady, @CAPS1, in front of us. She was moving extremely slowly and seemed unable to do things quickly. I understand that she was an old lady, but her slow pace really tested my patience.  I must admit that I don't have much patience in such situations, but I know that some people, like @CAPS2, do. This experience made me realize that patience is a virtue that I still need to work on. Maybe in the future, I'll be able to handle such situations with more understanding and calmness.
991	18931	7	2	There is only one occasion each year when I am patient about something, and that is @CAPS1. I am always eagerly anticipating the arrival of @CAPS1. It allows me to see my brothers, uncles, aunts, and cousins. It is the best time of the year, second only to my birthday.
992	18932	7	2	Once, I had to visit my doctor for a monthly check - up. My aunt and I went to the building and realized there were more cars than usual. When we entered, we noticed a flier stating “@NUM1 shots @DATE1 through @DATE2.” We took the elevator to the fourth - floor waiting room and saw @NUM2 people. Fortunately, not all were waiting for @PERSON1, but I still had to wait for an hour and forty - five minutes. Finally, when I saw my doctor, she gave me my shot and ensured I was okay. After that long day, I went home and took a long nap.
993	18933	7	2	One time I really had to be patient was during a family trip to @LOCATION1 to visit family and friends. The trip was quite long. The flight took @NUM1 hours initially, and then another @NUM1 hours in the air. Part of the journey was along Highway One, which runs beside the Pacific Ocean. We passed a small black sedan. For a while, I was looking at a stogie - like attraction. On one side was a grassy hill and on the other, something related to cycling. I slept and listened to the radio for almost @NUM3 hours. Finally, we stopped in San @CAPS1. After staying there, we boarded a plane for the @NUM4 ½ - hour flight back to Atlanta, @LOCATION2. It was a long - haul plane with a middle section and two other sections. We were in the middle, and on both sides were college students who shouted across the aisle. I tried to sleep, but it was the most uncomfortable plane ride of my life. However, I had to be patient, and now it's over.
994	18934	7	2	Patience is the ability to maintain self - control while waiting. To be patient, one must wait until the thing they are waiting for is completed. @CAPS1 implies having composure. For example, when going to the doctor's office for a yearly check - up, one has to sit in the waiting room for at least an hour before being called. But patience has its limits. When waiting for a pizza from a restaurant that takes about @NUM1 minutes, in my opinion, @CAPS1 is something people made up. It seems that true patience is hard to come by.
995	18935	7	2	One day, my family - my mom, dad, sister, brother, and I - went to Fire Mountain. We had to wait a long time before reaching the front of the line. After getting our seats and sitting down, we waited a long time for a waiter. We passed the time by singing songs. When I asked for the waiter to come faster, she finally arrived. Then we got our drinks and food, ate and drank, and then went home. That was the time I had to be patient.
996	18936	7	2	A few weeks ago, I received a leaf project from my science teacher. To achieve a @PERCENT1 grade, we were required to collect @NUM1 leaves. When I began gathering my leaves, I had to press and dry them. This involved placing the leaves in newspaper and then putting books on top to extract the water from the leaves onto the newspaper. The process was time - consuming, and sometimes I had to repeat it several times for each leaf. The first due - date was approaching, but my mom advised me to aim for the next one. By being patient, I completed my project before the second due - date and earned @NUM2 extra points. This experience shows that patience can lead to rewards.
997	18937	7	2	My mom and I were on our way home from Sonco. We were stopped by a train that was moving very slowly. We waited patiently at first, but after a few minutes, my mom wanted to turn around. However, we stayed put. Eventually, the train passed, and we were able to continue our journey. This incident shows that sometimes, patience pays off as waiting allowed us to resume our trip smoothly.
998	18938	7	2	Once I received birthday money and wanted to buy an electric scooter. On weekends, I always waited for my dad to get home so we could search for one on the internet. Every time he got home and we looked, I didn't like any of the scooters. One day, since he didn't have to work, we searched further and I found two scooters I liked: a gas scooter and an electric one. We went to see the gas scooter, but it was expensive and had a bunch of snacks on it. I didn't like the gas scooter, so we called the seller of the electric scooter. I bought it and paid @MONEY1 for it. When I got home, I rode it for three days. One night, in the garage, it went out of control. We thought it was the fuse, but it turned out to be the controller, the part that all other components connect to. We called the company and ordered the part, but they sent the wrong one twice. After it fell off the desk, we forgot about it. Now I've ordered it again, and they say they'll send the right controls this time. I've been waiting for about @NUM2 year and @NUM3 months. I hope this time I'll finally get the correct part and enjoy my scooter fully.
999	18939	7	2	Patience is defined as being understanding and tolerant. I consider myself understanding, but I lack tolerance, so I'm not a patient person. However, there are people who possess both understanding and tolerance, like the math teacher's assistant in my @NUM1 grade. She had to be extremely patient with my classmates because they would ask the same questions repeatedly. She would teach a lesson and then have to reteach it before answering questions. I was in the advanced group, so we progressed quickly and rarely needed to ask questions. I truly admire her ability to be so patient while teaching those students, and I realize that patience is a virtue I still need to develop.
1000	18940	7	2	One afternoon, my brother @CAPS1 went to pick up some car parts. Suddenly, a car drifted into his lane and a crash occurred. Since our truck didn't have airbags, it was a serious situation. The other driver was in a van with airbags. About @NUM1 minutes later, my mom received the call about the accident. We rushed to the crash scene as fast as we could. I had to wait in the car until my dad returned from getting @CAPS1. I waited patiently, praying that my brother was okay. Thankfully, my prayers were answered. He only suffered some bumps and bruises, but the car had to be towed away. Later, we went to the place where the truck was to retrieve our belongings and assess the damage. The damage to the truck was not as severe as that to the other driver's van. We got the truck back a few weeks later. I'm extremely grateful that I still have my brother, and this experience taught me the importance of patience and hope in difficult times.
1001	18941	7	2	"I'm going to share the time I had to exercise patience while taking this @CAPS1. It started just a few minutes ago. I entered the classroom feeling prepared for anything. But four minutes later, there it was in front of me. I began by reflecting on times I'd needed patience. This moment seemed as good as any. Now, I understand the purpose of the @CAPS1, though I'm not entirely sure if it's to aid our learning or just make our hands ache and cramp. Writing about patience is tough because it can slip away quickly. Nevertheless, it's the @CAPS1, and I'm determined to do my best, so I must continue.  The classroom is incredibly quiet, and the smell of pencil and paper lingers. My eyes are tired, and I can't help yawning widely. My hand has fallen asleep, and every few seconds, there's a series of ""sniff"" sounds. We're not allowed to get up, so we're stuck with these sounds for the whole hour. To whoever is grading this, did you take this test or a part of it when you were a kid? Well, it's none of my business. Ouch! My hand really hurts. Let me just shake it out a bit. That's better. Patience is supposed to be a virtue, but right now, it's hard to care. You probably don't have the patience to read this, so I'll wrap it up. Writing about patience has been a challenge, but I'm finally done."
1002	18942	7	2	One time, I had to show a great deal of patience when I sprained my arm ice - skating. I was performing spins and tricks all over the rink. One spin didn't go as planned, and I fell on my back. Strangely enough, the part that got hurt was my arm. My mom was shocked that I could even stand up after such a hard fall. My arm was in excruciating pain. Mom rushed over to help me, and then we went home.  The next morning, the pain was @NUM1 times worse. I had to go to the doctor to get x - rays. It took two weeks for the x - rays to develop. So, I endured two weeks of pain. In the end, it turned out that I hadn't broken my arm. However, waiting for the results was incredibly painful. It took a lot of patience for me to keep waiting for those x - ray results. This experience taught me that patience is necessary even when dealing with unexpected setbacks.
1003	18943	7	2	It was a cold fall afternoon. My grandpa and I were on a hunting trip. We'd set out in the morning at @CAPS1 nolvek. Little did I know what was about to happen that day. We settled into a ground blind around @NUM1. Based on what we could see, it seemed like it would be a long afternoon. We sat there for @NUM2 hours, and it felt like an eternity. We waited and waited, but still, no deer appeared.  All of a sudden, my heart started racing when I saw something in front of our blind. We had lured the biggest deer I'd ever seen. It was a monster - sized deer, @NUM3. @NUM4 feet tall with a @NUM5 rack. I loaded my @NUM6 special and shot it in the shoulder. I was so excited that I almost screamed.  As with any story, there's a lesson. Some people learn to respect their elders, but my lesson is that patience is rewarded. As you can see, my patience paid off that day.
1004	18944	7	2	One time, I showed patience. I didn't want a birthday party, so my parents and I talked about it. Then, my mom and I went to @LOCATION1. We played almost all the games there, skipping the boring ones, and we rode the go - carts twice. After that, we went and bought a new video game and some new dirt - biking gloves.  This was an instance where I was patient so that I could do something fun. It taught me that being patient can lead to enjoyable experiences. Sometimes, giving up on the usual things and waiting for a different kind of fun can be very rewarding.
1005	18945	7	2	"I've always heard the saying ""Patience is a virtue,"" but I never really thought much about it until I babysat my cousins for the first time. My cousin @PERSON2, who is around @NUM1, is very obedient. She does whatever you tell her, so she's easy to babysit. But my other cousin, @PERSON3, has his own ideas and is one of the most challenging kids to babysit.  That morning, things started off well. We had a snack, played in the room, did some arts and crafts, and watched a movie. A few hours before my aunt was supposed to come home, @PERSON1 pooped in her diaper. I've dealt with dirty diapers before, so I wasn't too worried at first. I put @PERSON1 on the changing table and took off her diaper, only to realize I had no wipes.  I asked @PERSON4 where the wipes were, but he was busy playing with some milk - pumping bottle toys. I told him firmly, ""@PERSON4, I need you to go get the wipes right now."" @PERSON1 was squirming, and I had to hold her tightly to avoid getting poop everywhere. @PERSON4 said he didn't want to go. I was starting to lose my temper when I remembered the saying ""Patience is a virtue.""  I took a deep breath and decided to try a different approach. I said, ""@PERSON4, I bet you can't go get the wipes as fast as a cheetah!"" He replied that he could. I challenged him to prove it, and he did. Through this experience, I realized that if you're patient and a bit crafty, you can get things done more quickly. Patience truly is a virtue, especially when dealing with kids."
1006	18946	7	2	One afternoon, I was at my friend's house. She couldn't find something she needed. First, we went to her sister, but she was on the phone. So, we patiently waited for about seven minutes. As time passed, both of us started getting impatient. Then we went to ask her mom. Her mom told us to sit quietly and be patient. We sat there for another seven minutes, but she was still busy. So, we went back to her sister. By then, she was off the phone. My friend asked her sister where her nail polish was, but in a mean and impatient tone. Her sister yelled, “@CAPS1’s in the drawer! Now get out of my room.” After a long search, we finally found @CAPS1. It became clear that my friend isn't very patient, and I realized I'm not patient either. Even though my friend managed to wait, her tone showed her impatience. This experience made me recognize a situation where patience was lacking.
1007	18947	7	2	One day, when I woke up and looked outside, I saw it was snowy and cold. I went to the living room and told my mother that I wasn't feeling well. She checked my temperature and said I had a fever. I also had a runny nose, so she thought I probably had a cold. She had to go to work on @DATE1, but she decided to stay home with me. She made me hot chocolate and breakfast. Every time I needed something, like a drink, food, or an extra blanket, she got up without complaint and fetched it for me. She even went up - town to get my medication. My mother's patience was truly remarkable. She did everything I asked without a single grumble. That's why I think my mother is the best and the most patient person.
1008	18949	7	2	On @DATE1, my family and I were on our way to a place in @LOCATION1. It took us @NUM1 hours to travel there. Even though it was a long journey, we were eager to reach @LOCATION1. However, when it was @NUM2 midnight, we were extremely sleepy. So, we stopped at a Holiday Inn. Once we got to our room, we went straight to sleep. The next morning, we went swimming. Then we left and headed to @LOCATION1 park. My two cousins were really getting on my nerves. They kept fighting and talking about each other, and I was so annoyed that I almost lost my temper. Finally, at about @NUM3 pm, we arrived at the park. We had to take a small train to get in. The park was huge. The first ride that I, my sister, and my little cousins took was the Comet. After that, we went on the @ORGANIZATION1, the @CAPS1 Runney Foleon, and the @CAPS2. This whole experience tested my patience, and it was a time when I managed to stay patient despite the challenges.
1009	18950	7	2	I was really curious about who would win the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 contest. Of course, I hoped it would be me. I was both nervous and a bit scared because I had no idea what the outcome would be. I was extremely eager to hear the result. Earlier, I had played the game and was currently in first place. The thought of winning two tickets to @LOCATION1’s @CAPS3 made me even more nervous. I sat quietly in a chair, trying hard not to show my nervousness. All I could do was wait for the contest to end. Then, my mom suggested that we could wait by going on rides at the fair. First, I went on the Tilt - A - Whirl. Throughout the ride, I kept wondering if anyone had beaten my score. After that, we looked for another ride, and I tried to stop thinking about the contest. Later, we found a ride to go on. When we got off, my mom told me that I had won. I was so happy and walked back to claim my prize. The waiting was nerve - wracking, but it was definitely worth it. I was nervous the whole time and tried not to dwell on it. I was so excited that I even thought I'd like to participate in such a contest again. This shows that there was a time when I was patient, and I wonder when others have shown patience.
1010	18951	7	2	(The original text in item 2 is very unclear and full of garbled words. It's difficult to rewrite it accurately while maintaining the main idea. However, I'll try my best based on the fragments that seem to make some sense.) People often don't think about patience; instead, they seem to be in a hurry and act on impulse. For example, @CAPS6 and his brother were walking to a place. They needed to go there for some reason. When they arrived, they had to walk quite a distance, maybe about a mile. The place didn't seem very nice. As they walked, @CAPS6's brother was looking for a bottle. They passed the pest - control section and the cleaning aisle. When they were there, a woman was about to walk down the aisle. @CAPS6's brother rushed down the aisle to get the bottle. He got it but made a bit of a mess. He was acting impatiently, and @CAPS4 tried to get him to stop, but he didn't seem to care. They just wanted to get home. After they walked back home, they gave the item to their dad and mom. Mom asked some questions, like if they had read something. This whole incident shows how important patience is and how a lack of it can cause problems.
1011	18952	7	2	I was required to exercise patience. My family and I were to obtain @NUM1 pug puppies from a kind - hearted lady residing @NUM2 minutes away. I was overjoyed when my parents finalized the decision to purchase them. We visited the puppies @NUM3 additional times when they were still very young. After our last visit, we had to endure a three - week wait as the puppies needed to reach an appropriate age to join their new families. Those three weeks seemed to pass at a snail's pace, yet all the waiting was worthwhile. Patience provided me with an opportunity to prepare for the puppies. We procured beds, toys, crates, and other dog necessities. We aimed to be well - prepared for our new family members. Eventually, the day to pick up the puppies arrived. They were incredibly cute! We brought them home and let them explore our house. They adored it! Our puppies grew into wonderful dogs. I'm extremely glad I had to be patient while waiting for them. Truly, good things come to those who wait.
1012	18954	7	2	"There was an incident where I had to exercise patience. When my dad fell ill, we had to wait for the doctor to inform us that we could see him. After some time, the doctor came and stated that my dad had a seizure, followed by a stroke. They performed @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 on him. We waited for approximately @NUM1 minutes and used about @NUM2 boxes of tissues. The doctor said, ""We will keep him overnight for observation."" The next day, we went to the hospital. After a while, they had to discontinue life - support. I showed patience throughout this ordeal. I waited in the hospital's lab, awaited the doctor's updates on what had happened, and endured the moment when they removed the @CAPS1 - @CAPS5 and finally when they said they needed to pull the plug. This is my story of when I had to be patient."
1013	18955	7	2	I believe I am a patient because I once sprained my knee and fractured my collarbone @CAPS1. These injuries led me to become a patient at the doctor's office. I almost forgot about the lump in my neck, so I'm going to see my doctor about it. In conclusion, due to these health issues, I am a patient seeking medical advice and treatment.
1014	18956	7	2	"Sometimes, it can be challenging to be patient. For me, it has to be something I genuinely desire. On a cool day in @LOCATION1 @CAPS2.C., I had just turned @NUM1 and was about to meet President @PERSON1 face - to - face as I had won a contest that granted me this privilege. Upon arriving at the White House, a man escorted us inside and led us to a small room before leaving. It was around @NUM2 then. He told us not to leave as we might distract someone. So, we waited, played hangman, and saw other @CAPS3. By noon, I was hungry. Around @NUM1:30 pm, President @PERSON1 entered. He asked, ""Would you like something to eat?"" I replied affirmatively. We went to a fancy restaurant whose name I can't pronounce. He apologized for making me wait, but I didn't mind as it was completely worth it. Good things do come to those who are patient."
1015	18957	7	2	I had to exercise patience in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. We needed to have patients in the @CAPS3. The @CAPS3 was @CAPS4, and it was slow. We arrived there at @TIME1. Then we @CAPS5 it at @NUM1 while we were in the @CAPS3. We spent hours there, and with a @CAPS7 patient at the @CAPS3, I was @CAPS9 and was about to go @CAPS10 to the car and fall asleep. However, I used my patience to get through that @CAPS3 and achieved the @CAPS11 scoring of a @CAPS12. Since I had patience, I could do something @CAPS13. In the end, my patience paid off in that situation.
1016	18958	7	2	I demonstrate loyalty to many people I know, and they reciprocate by showing me loyalty. This mutual loyalty strengthens our relationships and creates a sense of trust and reliability among us.
1017	18959	7	2	A time when I had to be patient was during my gymnastics training. When attempting to learn a new skill, patience is crucial. For instance, when I was learning a new skill on the bars called a cast to handstand, it was extremely challenging. Day after day, I struggled to execute it. I gave my best effort every day, but my coach emphasized the need for patience. He said that one day I would be able to do it, but until then, I had to keep trying my hardest. It could take days, months, or even a year to master this skill, and I just had to wait for my body to be ready. So, I waited and persevered, but there was still no sign of progress. Finally, after four months of consistent effort, I succeeded. I climbed up on the bar and performed the skill flawlessly. All my waiting had paid off. That day, my coach told me, “I told you that you could do it. It just takes time and patience, and today was your day.” This experience taught me that being patient is difficult, but all we can do is wait and see what patience will bring us.
1018	18960	7	2	After finishing the book that ended with “And the characters lived happily ever after…for now!”, @LOCATION1 closed the book, feeling extremely sad that there were no more pages. This was the third book in the series, and she was eager to read the fourth. The next day at school, she headed straight to the library. As she opened the doors, she was greeted by the familiar dusty smell of old books that she adored. She made a beeline for her favorite shelf, scanning it quickly and noticing that the book she wanted was missing. She asked the librarian, @PERSON2, about the book and was shocked to learn that it had already been checked out. She put her name on the waiting list, disappointed to find that she was tenth. The next day, @DATE1, she went to the library again to inquire about the book. The news was disheartening. Her position on the list had moved up to @NUM1, which was decent for just one day, but when she got home, she was in a foul mood. “What’s wrong?” asked her mom. “Mom, I really wanted this book, but it was already checked out. I’m @NUM1 on the list, and it could be ages before the others finish reading it.” “Sweetie, I think you need to learn some patience,” her mom advised. “Patience? What’s that?” @LOCATION1 asked. “Patience is when you wait for something without complaining,” her mom explained. “Take you, for example. You’re being very impatient.” “But I’m waiting,” @LOCATION1 protested. “Yes, but you’re complaining a lot,” her mom pointed out. The next day, @LOCATION1 tried to be as patient as possible. She didn’t go to the library to ask about the book and managed to get through the day without complaining. Later, she was called to the office. When she arrived, she found @PERSON2 and the secretary, @PERSON1. “Here,” said @PERSON2. “What’s this?” @LOCATION1 asked. “It’s the book you wanted. It’s been checked out to your account and is ready to read.” “Thank you,” @LOCATION1 said, hardly able to believe it. She finally had the book she’d been waiting for. The moral of the story is that patience pays off, especially when you’re willing to wait.
1019	18961	7	2	One time, I showed great patience when my family and I went to get @ORGANIZATION1's autograph. We stood in line for hours. My legs were aching and in pain, but I was too excited to care about anything. All I could think about was getting that autograph. Eventually, my patience was rewarded, and I got the autograph I so desperately wanted. This experience taught me that patience can lead to achieving our desires.
1020	18962	7	2	One day, just before football practice, the lock on my locker got stuck. All @NUM1 of the coaches tried to remove it, but all except coach @PERSON1 gave up. He stayed in the locker room with me, determined to get the lock off. When we realized that it wasn't coming off easily, we had to find the @CAPS1. After locating him, we asked for bolt - cutters. We had to walk all the way across the school to get them. Once we had the bolt - cutters, we walked back to the locker room. When we arrived, coach @PERSON1 tried to cut the lock. He spent @NUM2 minutes trying, but they didn't work. So, we had to walk back across the school to the tool room to get another pair. This time, after @NUM3 minutes, the lock was finally cut. I believe this whole process required a great deal of patience from coach @PERSON1, and it showed his dedication to helping me.
1021	18963	7	2	In the Old Testament, long ago, there was a man named @PERSON1. He was very rich, extremely happy, and utterly loyal to God. One day, the devil pointed him out and claimed that @PERSON1 would easily turn away from God. God denied this. The devil then proposed to destroy @PERSON1's crops and livestock. God agreed, stating that the devil could do so but must not harm @PERSON1 himself. The devil assented. The next day, while @PERSON1 was having a bad time, one servant reported that a great fire had destroyed the livestock, and only a few remained. Another servant said that wolves had attacked the livestock, and they were the only survivors. Then, yet another servant informed @PERSON1 that the roof had collapsed in the hall and his family had been killed. Despite these tragedies, @PERSON1 did not curse God. The devil returned and made @PERSON1 horribly sick. This affliction persisted for years, but @PERSON1 still refused to curse God. When God saw this, He sent the devil away, healed @PERSON1, blessed him with a new family and fortune, and @PERSON1 was happy once again.
1022	18964	7	2	When I was four, I moved from @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4. It was a long journey south, but as a young girl, I didn't mind much. I settled in @LOCATION4, attended kindergarten, made friends, and moved into a new house. Life went on until I was seven, when I learned that we were moving again, this time back to @LOCATION3. By then, I had some amazing friends, especially two of them. I didn't hate the idea of moving, but I didn't love it either. However, it was inevitable, and I knew I'd have fun and make new friends. The only thing I didn't want to leave behind were my old friends, memories, and all the things I loved about @LOCATION4. I took my memories with me, promised to stay in touch with my friends, and then moved. Novi was different but nice. There were many changes to adapt to, but overall, it was quite easy. I made lots of new friends and now hang out with them every day. I've adjusted to life here as easily as slipping into bed at night. I've been living here for four years. Throughout this time, I've been exchanging letters, emails, stories, and memories with my friends in @LOCATION4 and my new friends here. Despite this, I've always longed to go back for a visit. I've been patiently waiting, and now, it seems my patience is paying off. I'm finally going to visit this year. The only drawback is that I won't be able to see everyone, but that won't be for long. I see my friends here all the time, and soon, I'll get to see my old friends too. I can't wait! All these years of waiting have finally given me this wonderful opportunity.
1023	18965	7	2	I was in @LOCATION1 when a dog bit me in the face. My dad and his friend quickly put me in the truck and rushed me to @ORGANIZATION1, a hospital in @LOCATION1. I was made to sit in a hospital bed for @NUM1 hours. After that, I was transferred to Hurly. There, I sat in the hospital, watching TV and waiting for surgery. @NUM2 hours later, I finally had the operation. In total, I spent @NUM3 hours waiting. During this long wait, there was a risk of the wound getting infected. I was prescribed a @NUM4 to prevent any complications. Despite the long wait and the potential risks, I had to be patient, after all, I was a patient.
1024	18967	7	2	Every Thanksgiving and @CAPS1, I have to be patient. On Thanksgiving, I get so hungry that I start to whine. We usually have to wait for the turkey to be cooked. I get so excited that I keep sniffing the air. And then there's the dessert, which I love. But we usually have it about an hour after the main meal, so I'm hungry again by then. Every Thanksgiving at my [relative's] house, I look forward to the homemade apple pie. As soon as they walk in with it, I jump up and down. At @CAPS1, I also have to be patient. I'm always eager to see what presents I'll get. I search for the packages with my name on them. If I find one, my parents or grandparents tell me that we have to do something first. Then, it's time to open my stocking. Despite my eagerness, I know I have to wait, and I try my best to be patient.
1025	18968	7	2	"Today was @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and @PERSON1, the @PERSON2, was extremely excited. He was bouncing off the walls! ""I wonder what @PERSON3 will bring us,"" @PERSON1 exclaimed, looking through a catalog. ""I want this, and this, and definitely this."" ""@PERSON1, you need to be patient. @CAPS1 is tomorrow, and you need to do your part and help clean the tree,"" @PERSON1's mother said. ""I want presents now!"" @PERSON1 whined. ""You know,"" his father said sternly, ""if you aren't a good @PERSON2, Santa will only bring you peanut shells."" Reluctantly, @PERSON1 gave in and said, ""Alright, I'll help."" It seemed like an eternity to @PERSON1, but finally, it was time to go to bed. He was glad that he had been patient because he knew that in the morning, he would have presents to open."
1026	18969	7	2	It was a warm @DATE1 at @TIME1. I was at my sister's house, playing Wii with my niece. Then, my brother - in - law Matt entered the living room and said, “I'm bored. Let's do something today!” So, we all decided to go to Michigan's Adventures for the day. My sister @PERSON1 instructed us to pack the cooler with snacks and drinks and put pillows and blankets in the back - seat of the car. However, we were unaware that we were actually going on a six - hour journey to Six Flags, and @PERSON1, Matt, and my mom had been planning this for weeks. After two hours in the car, I moaned, “Are we there yet?” “No,” said @PERSON1. “We're lost.” “Oh,” I replied. But I didn't really dwell on being lost since we had been to Michigan's Adventures countless times before. For the rest of the ride, I was quite quiet; in fact, I was sound asleep. I woke up because my niece was shaking me excitedly. I stretched and squinted due to the sun's rays. Once my eyes adjusted to the light, I looked around and realized we were at Six Flags! When we entered, the first ride we chose was the Superman. On this ride, you sit and restraints lock around your legs and stomach, and it tilts you over. It's like you're flying. We really wanted to ride it, but the line was @NUM1 ½ hours long. While waiting in line, we occupied ourselves by swinging on the metal railing, playing I Spy, and doing various other things. When we finally got on and off the ride, I found it really fun and worth the wait. I was patient and didn't complain.
1027	18970	7	2	My mom is an extremely patient person. One reason for her patience is that when she goes to the beauty shop, she considers a @NUM1 - hour wait to be not very long. Another instance is when I don't complete my chores. Instead of getting angry, she simply asks me to do them again. Moreover, at work, she remains patient. For example, when faced with a large amount of work like writing a @NUM2 - word paper, she doesn't get frustrated. In conclusion, my mom's patience is evident in various aspects of her life, making her a remarkable person.
1028	18971	7	2	Patience is the act of waiting and dealing with situations calmly. At school, it involves interacting with teachers and trying to understand their perspectives. Without patience, students and teachers would constantly be in conflict. This is why patience is so important and should be consistently practiced. In sports, patience is crucial. You need to accept the referee's call, whether it's a good or bad one. Also, when learning new skills in sports, you won't master them immediately, and patience helps you persevere. School is an ideal place to exercise patience, whether it's learning something new or dealing with a difficult teacher. When dealing with children, patience is essential as they often try to elicit reactions from you, whether good or bad. In conclusion, patience is vital in both small and big matters, such as learning new things or taking tests. It is far better to have patience than to lack it.
1029	18972	7	2	In my life, there have been numerous instances where I've shown patience and times when I've been impatient. The other day, I asked my mom to drive me to Target so I could buy gum. She agreed but said I had to use a small bill. I patiently waited for her to take me. When we got to Target, my mom told me to hurry up. I ran into a long line at the checkout, so I had to wait. Instead of getting angry, I remained patient, and my mom was also patient. About a week ago, I asked my dad to play catch with me. He said yes but that I had to wait a while. For some reason, I got very angry and lost my patience. I started yelling about why I had to wait. Then I realized I was being unreasonable and had lost my patience. I apologized, and then we played catch. In the end, I understand that being patient is important in different situations.
1030	18973	7	2	Patience is an essential quality that people should possess. I recall being in a store when my cousin wanted to go home, but her mom told her to wait. My cousin was impatient that day because she was eager to leave. I firmly believe that patience helps us navigate through life. For example, if you're out with a friend who's driving, and you get tired and want to go home and start insisting, you're being impatient as your friend is the one in control of the vehicle. Patience is always necessary. If you're patient, you can handle things more effectively. When applying for a job, you may have to wait for the manager to call you. If you're impatient, you might not get hired. In conclusion, we should always be patient because we never know the negative consequences of being impatient.
1031	18974	7	2	"The incessant sound of ""@CAPS2 - @CAPS1"" reverberates through the cars of ""@CAPS11"". All I can focus on is the time after ""@CAPS6"" and lunch. As the clock ticks and my heart throbs, my impatience grows. I dislike the MEAP for this very reason. During the reading selection, I find myself thinking that ""@CAPS7"" must be the most boring story in history. When I turn the page to ""@CAPS8"", the situation with ""@CAPS7"" continues to make me impatient. All I desire is to finish the test. Beads of sweat form as I progress slowly through ""@CAPS9"", but I don't want to be the last to submit it. When it comes to writing, I'm left wondering what to write about with ""@CAPS10"". My hand begins to ache, and my head pounds due to the sound of everyone's pencils scribbling as if it were a scene from a horror film. The sound of ""@CAPS2 - @CAPS1"", along with the scribbling and other noises, is incredibly annoying. I have to read over my work multiple times, ensuring I have a title and legible handwriting. The most nerve - wracking part is the math segment. There are questions I've forgotten, and it feels like all the math teachers have crammed everything into my head at once. ""@CAPS9"" is truly terrifying. While taking the test, there's someone who can't sit still, and their desk starts rattling. Clearly, I'm extremely impatient, and I don't like the MEAP. The sound of ""@CAPS2 - @CAPS1"" is the most irritating, but like many others, I'm striving to get a good score. Despite the distractions and annoyance, I persevere through the test."
1032	18976	7	2	"One time, I demonstrated patience when I, my dad, ""@ORGANIZATION1"", and ""@CAPS1"" went to ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"" in ""@LOCATION1"". My dad, ""@ORGANIZATION1"", and I were eager to ride the Millennium Force. We waited in line for two hours under the scorching sun. There were difficulties as the ride was experiencing some problems. However, when we finally got to the ride, it turned out to be okay. This experience taught me the value of patience in the face of delays and challenges."
1033	18977	7	2	"On ""@DATE1"", at ""@NUM1"" am, I was with my dad. I sat there, watching and hoping for something to happen. Eventually, I grew tired and fell asleep for an hour. When I woke up, I continued watching, but nothing occurred for another hour as I waited patiently. Then, from the night silence, I heard the sound of leaves cracking, and I wondered if it was real. On the first day, I spotted a deer and got overly excited. I reached for my gun too quickly, and the deer ran away. On another day, I saw a doe to my left. This time, I retrieved my gun more slowly. I aimed and fired, or so I thought, but the gun jammed, and I had to unload it. Just then, my dad called me on the walkie - talkie and asked what I was doing. I told him I saw a doe, and he told me to shoot it. The doe stood there, and I shot again, but it ran away. I was disappointed as all my patience seemed to be in vain. In the end, I realized that patience alone isn't always enough; one also needs to be calm and composed."
1034	18978	7	2	"I stepped into the large, open room. The air was filled with the scents of crayons, animal crackers, and dirt, which hit my nose like a large wave from the sea. Nervously, I took my first steps into the room. The floor was littered with toys and numerous crayons. The kindergarteners were running around, screaming like little animals about to be eaten for dinner. In the middle of the chaos stood the teacher. She had a distant look in her eyes and seemed on the verge of tears. When she saw me and my name tag, her face brightened a little. She practically ran towards me with open arms. After introducing herself, she said the kids were all mine. I never imagined that student - teaching would involve so much actual teaching. I knew I'd do a bit, but when the teacher said she was leaving and I had to teach the alphabet to ""@NUM1"" kids, I felt like I was in the middle of a ""war"". Eventually, after some grabbing and pulling, I managed to get the kids to sit cross - legged on the floor. Unfortunately, I underestimated how wild they were. As I started teaching, one of the kids began throwing toys at me. I calmly half - growled, ""@CAPS1 @PERSON1, that's not nice, please stop."" ""@CAPS2"" stopped for a mere ""@NUM2"" seconds. This pattern repeated with all the wild - eyed, crazy - haired kids. It took an enormous amount of patience to get them to finally sit still. We got to about ""@CAPS3"" when the kids got fussy again. At that point, I felt more like a babysitter than a teacher. I began to understand why the teacher was willing to leave. Finally, I had an idea. I ran to my purse, grabbed a bag of candy, and said, ""When we finish learning the alphabet from A to '@CAPS4', anyone who can say the whole thing will get a piece of candy!"" To my amazement, every kid learned from A to ""@CAPS4"", and I even ran out of candy. It was a challenging experience that required a great deal of patience, but in the end, I managed to teach the kids something. When the bell rang, I quickly left to go home, exhausted but satisfied that I had persevered."
1035	18979	7	2	There was a time when I was really excited about my upcoming birthday. I couldn't wait to see what I was getting. For about a week, I kept begging my mom to tell me what my presents were. As the days passed, they seemed to get longer and longer. I tried several times to peek at my presents, but I always got caught. My mom told me to be patient and that time would pass faster. One day, my brother jumped on me and said he knew what I was getting and I didn't. I was furious and demanded that he tell me, but he refused. I went to my mom and said I gave up. She told me to just be patient as there were only four days left. Gradually, the days started to go by faster. Finally, my birthday arrived, and I was overjoyed to finally see what I was getting. This experience taught me that patience is indeed a virtue, as waiting for something good can be difficult but is ultimately rewarding.
1036	18980	7	2	Patience is often required when one desires something strongly, such as a phone or computer access. However, patience is not limited to these situations. It is also necessary in places like church and the doctor's office. In conclusion, there are numerous scenarios where patience is essential.
1037	18981	7	2	I demonstrated patience when I had to wait in a long queue at a leader amusement park in @LOCATION1. I waited for @NUM1 hours to ride The @CAPS2. The ride went from @CAPS3 to @NUM2 in @CAPS4. When reaching @NUM2, the coaster went straight up, stopped at the top (at @NUM4 yards), and we sat there for about @NUM5 seconds. Then it moved and went straight down at @NUM6. It was truly thrilling. The wait was definitely worth it. That was a time when I showed patience.
1038	18982	7	2	Traveling for long periods demands a great deal of patience, especially when traveling non - stop for @NUM1 hours. When I was @NUM2, my mom, dad, and I left at @NUM3 am for the airport to go to @LOCATION3 for half a year. We waited at the airport for a long time. After that, we took an hour - long flight to @LOCATION4, then a @NUM4 - hour flight to Los @LOCATION1. We spent a long time waiting in those airports. Next was the @NUM5 - hour flight to @LOCATION2, the longest flight I've ever taken on a huge double - deck @NUM6 jet. Finally, we took a @NUM7 - hour flight to Hawk Bay. It was an extremely long trip that required a lot of patience. We went there because my dad was building a golf course, which also demands patience but is more enjoyable. This was the most patience I've ever had to exercise.
1039	18983	7	2	"Last year, I went to @LOCATION1 City with @CAPS1's mom, step - dad, @NUM1 of her brothers, @CAPS1's @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and her @NUM2 kids, @PERSON1 and Sack. Our first stop was the Statue of Liberty. We got in line for the ferry to the island where it stands. The line was incredibly long. I thought, ""@CAPS4 great"" as it was nearly @DATE1 outside and we'd have to wait at least an hour. After about half an hour, I noticed the line led into a building. I wondered what was inside. All the kids except me were complaining, and @CAPS1's parents were getting irritated. When we finally entered the building, there was another huge line! At least it was air - conditioned. We had to go through metal detectors before boarding the ferry. The ferry ride was okay, though it was crowded. Fortunately, we could sit down. When we got off the ferry and looked up at Lady Liberty, it was actually quite large. Unfortunately, the part where you can go inside was closed due to the heat. @CAPS4 Well, it was still cool to see it. We walked around the whole island looking for the ferry. After finding it, we waited in line @CAPS5 until we boarded. I was proud of myself for not complaining. Apparently, @CAPS1's mom was too, as she pulled me aside at the hotel and thanked me for my patience."
1040	18984	7	2	Patience can be likened to waiting for one's turn to speak or for something to load. It is beneficial in various instances, like waiting to reach a destination or for someone to answer the phone. Patience allows individuals to face difficulties without complaining. In essence, patience is a valuable trait that helps in navigating through many everyday situations.
1041	18985	7	2	A young boy wakes up one morning. He goes upstairs to get a drink and then returns downstairs to watch cartoons. Becoming very excited upon remembering that he will attend a football game that day, he anticipates the match between the @CAPS2 and @CAPS1. His dad comes downstairs and tells him to get ready. They drive approximately @NUM1 miles to the @CAPS2 stadium, find their seats, and the game begins. The @CAPS2 kick off, but by the end of the first half, they are losing with a score of @DATE1 to @NUM2. Many people start to leave. As the game progresses into the @NUM3, the @CAPS2 are still behind, and more spectators depart. However, the @CAPS2 start to make a comeback. The author and their companion remain at the stadium. With the @CAPS2 down by @NUM4, they score another touchdown and are only down by three. With @NUM5 seconds left, @PERSON1 throws a pass to @LOCATION1, and the crowd goes wild. By patiently staying until the end of the game, they witnessed an exciting turn of events.
1042	18986	7	2	Around @NUM1 years ago, I was at swim practice. I was about to dive off lane @NUM2 when I lost my balance while getting on the block. Realizing I was about to fall, I tried to catch myself but ended up falling into the water and twisting my ankle backwards from the swim block. It was extremely difficult for me to get out of the water. My mom called the doctor and learned that I couldn't get an X - ray for nearly a certain number of days. She came to the pool to pick me up. After @NUM3 days of lying in bed, I found out that my ankle was broken. As a result, I had to miss @NUM5 weeks of swim practice and was incredibly bored. This experience taught me the importance of being patient for those four days until I could get an X - ray.
1043	18987	7	2	I once took a bus to Texas with my mom and family to visit my great - grandfather. At first, the bus smelled nice, but a lady kept spraying perfume, so I had to sleep and snack on a few things. A baby kept waking me up. Every time I needed to use the bathroom, it was occupied. Also, when I tried to sleep, everyone got louder. When it was time to transfer to another bus as per the @CAPS1í@CAPS2 schedule, the bus driver would wake us up. The journey on the bus seemed never - ending. One had to be very patient to relax at the end of the day. After @NUM1 days, I finally arrived. It was worth it because we visited six places. If I hadn't been patient, the @NUM1 - day bus experience would have been terrible.
1044	18988	7	2	"One time, I had to be patient when a friend mentioned something I had wanted for a long time. As soon as I heard, I rushed to the computer to check if it was still available. ""Yes!"" I said, relieved that it was. It had taken me a long time to sign up for it. As I quickly filled out the order form, I thought, ""@CAPS2 will be amazing once I get it."" I pressed the confirm order button, and then came the hard part: waiting. I went to school for a week, constantly thinking about how cool it would be to finally get @CAPS2. After a long bus ride home, I got off and waited for it to arrive. I rushed to the mailbox and found a box. My heart raced as I ran inside, opened it, and there was my @CAPS4 new iPad. I was extremely happy, and all my patience had paid off."
1045	18989	7	2	"Not too long ago, I had to wait at basketball tryouts to find out if I made the team. All I could do was wait and wonder. I kept thinking to myself, ""Did I push hard enough? Did I make too many mistakes?"" All I could focus on were the errors I had made. That day, @TIME1, as I sat waiting to hear my name, my name was finally called. "" @PERSON1, number @NUM1 from tryouts, please come get your paper."" I took the paper outside, opened it, and read, "" @CAPS2 @CAPS3, you have made the gold team."" I jumped up and down with joy. By being patient that day, I was rewarded with a spot on the team."
1046	18990	7	2	Two summers ago, I embarked on a journey to @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION1. The drive was a long one, lasting @NUM1 hours non - stop. I mostly sat in the back seat, listening to my @NUM2 player. The car ride was extremely dull. During the journey, I occupied myself by looking for license plates from different states. When we were halfway there, since it was early in the @TIME1, we stopped at a Dunkin' Donuts. My sister and I got donuts and hot chocolate. Then, we reached a series of booths where we had to show our passports to proceed. Finally, we arrived in @LOCATION2 and stayed there for either @NUM3 or @NUM4 nights. After that, we hit the road again for @NUM5 hours to reach @LOCATION1. Once we got there, all the patience I'd exercised during the trip was rewarded. This was a time when I demonstrated patience.
1047	18991	7	2	This story revolves around a moment when I showed patience. I was around @NUM1 years old. It was a beautiful day outside, and it happened to be my birthday. Suddenly, I had an idea. I decided to attempt riding my bike without training wheels. I rushed inside as fast as my little legs could carry me. I burst through the front door and shouted, “@CAPS2, @CAPS3 come quickly! I have something to tell you.” My @CAPS2 screeched as she ran down the stairs, “What is it, buddy?” I yelled, “@CAPS5 is here. @CAPS6 is coming.” She replied, “Come on, sweetie. Your son wants us to listen; it must be important.” I kept saying, “It is, it is, it is.” Then I said, “Come on, mom. We can meet him outside.” She said, “Okay, we'll be outside.” I responded, “Okay, come on, let's go.” I and my @CAPS2 ran outside to wait for @CAPS3. This was a time when I was patient.
1048	18993	7	2	Do you have a mother who is constantly busy? Well, I do. For some reason, I enjoy traveling everywhere with her. One day, we went to a place whose name I've forgotten. I was extremely patient during this trip. Being patient was quite challenging because there was nothing much for me to do. It took her about @NUM1. I was glad when we finally left, and I refrained from saying things like “Come on, hurry up. @CAPS1 is taking too long,” or “I'm hungry” or “I'm ready to leave.” This experience demonstrated my patience.
1049	18994	7	2	There were several instances when I showed patience. I asked my mom to buy me a bike and had to wait for about two weeks. On my birthday, I wanted a fish. I kept asking my mom to buy me one, but she didn't respond. After pestering her for a while, I stopped asking for three days, and then she got me a fish. Unfortunately, the fish died. Four weeks later, I asked for a turtle, and she said she would get one. I waited patiently until she finally got me a turtle. I was very happy then. These are the times when I was patient.
1050	18995	7	2	One time, my sister, mom, and I went to Dick's Sporting Goods. I wanted a new bag, Adidas sandals, and some crazy socks. It took me hours to choose the socks as there were zebra - printed, striped, plain, plaid, and dotted ones. My sister couldn't get anything because she didn't have any money. Eventually, I settled on the zebra - printed socks. Then, I had to find the Adidas sandals. It took about an hour, and when I finally found a pair in my size, a girl snatched them right from under my nose. I looked at my mom, and she was really annoyed. After that, I went to get a bag. There was only one pink one left, so I grabbed it and we went home. This was a situation where I had to be patient while shopping.
1051	18996	7	2	I lack patience as I'm getting a laptop this year. Every day, I research laptops and can't focus on my iPod. I constantly talk to my family about it and can't stop thinking about my upcoming laptop. I've prepared everything for it, yet I must wait. Waiting for a laptop isn't the only instance where I've needed patience. Last year, for @CAPS1, I was promised an iPod as a gift. However, I had to wait until @CAPS1 eve because my family pooled their money to buy it on Black @DATE1. Unable to contain my excitement, I watched YouTube videos of iPod Touch devices. It's incredibly difficult to be patient when you desire something and are so close to having it.
1052	18997	7	2	Patience is required at all times. If one lacks patience, they will be in a constant rush. This way, they'll never have time for their family or themselves. My family often tells me to “slow down; you're not going anywhere” when I eat. If food could go somewhere, you wouldn't be able to follow it because you'd be too tired. Always take your time to learn how to be patient. It's easy; you just need to slow down and be more mindful of your actions.
1053	18998	7	2	One day, my mom, dad, sister, and I went to @LOCATION1 to visit Universal, an attraction park. As my dad and I were walking, he asked if I wanted to go on a roller coaster called the Dueling Dragons @CAPS1. Since it was my first time on a roller coaster, I was hesitant and initially said no. But I realized I'd never know if I liked roller coasters unless I tried, so I agreed. We waited in line for @NUM1 hour and @NUM2 minutes. During that time, I watched other riders. When I first saw the roller coaster, it was going about @NUM3 miles per hour. There were still @NUM4 people in front of us, and I kept wondering when our turn would come. Time seemed to pass slower and slower. Finally, after @NUM5 more groups went, it was our turn. My dad and I took off our sunglasses and sat in the front. As the coaster climbed the track, I started to enjoy it. Then it went about @NUM6 miles per hour, and I couldn't even scream because we were going so fast. We went upside - down and twisted. When it ended, I didn't want it to stop. I discovered that I love roller coasters, and that was a time when I had to be patient.
1054	18999	7	2	On the morning of @DATE1, my family members woke up at either @NUM1 or @NUM2 o'clock am. My brother, sisters, and I asked my mom if we could play the @CAPS1 and use the laptop. She said yes but told us we had to wait for our turns. We agreed. Each person got one and a half hours to use both. I let my brother and sisters play first because I'm the oldest and I knew I had to be patient. Until my turn came, they played the games on those devices. They'd keep playing throughout the day or until the next day. This would continue until next @DATE2 or until we could play again. By being patient at home and respecting my siblings' turns, I demonstrated good behavior.
1055	19000	7	2	I've had many experiences where I needed to be patient. Once, I had to wait a whole month for a new basketball video game to be released. I was extremely eager for it, and the time seemed to drag on forever. The day before the game's release, I lost the money I'd saved to buy it. So, I had to save an additional @NUM1 dollars. To earn the lost money, I took on two @DATE1 jobs. After two weeks, I went to the game store, only to be told by the manager that there were no more copies of any basketball games. I was furious and had to wait another @NUM2 weeks. Finally, I got the game. Although I was angry about having to wait so long, I realized it was worth it in the end. That's my story of being patient.
1056	19001	7	2	I recall a moment when I had to exercise patience. It was at my grandma's place in @LOCATION1. My cousins and I were waiting for my grandma to return so that we could go to the beach. After waiting around for an hour, my cousin and I started playing video games to pass the time. My grandma had probably worked for @NUM1 hours. At 3 PM, I decided to watch a movie and remained patient throughout. In the middle of the movie, my grandma got home, and we all patiently waited for her to get ready to go to the beach. This was a time when I showed patience.
1057	19002	7	2	I remember a time when someone, my band teacher <@NUM2</PERSON>, was patient with me. It was near the start of the @NUM1 grade. That year, I joined the band and played the trumpet. We played songs and took tests to ensure we were playing correctly. However, on my tests, <@NUM2</PERSON> noticed that I was playing the wrong notes. He said I needed a long private lesson to play the notes accurately. So, one afternoon after school, I took the lesson. I began by playing the notes for him, and he pointed out they were incorrect. Then, <@NUM2</PERSON> broke down the notes one - by - one and taught me the correct way to play them. He had me play the notes repeatedly, both individually and together. When I made mistakes, he patiently showed me how to play them correctly. After about @NUM4 minutes, I was finally playing every note correctly. Thanks to that lesson and <@NUM2</PERSON>'s patience, I can now play the notes right. I know that if I need more lessons in the future, I can rely on <@NUM2</PERSON>'s patience.
1058	19003	7	2	"This year, I tried out for my school's @NUM1 grade volleyball team. There were so many girls trying out that I was nervous about which team I'd get on or if I'd even make one. I worked hard, considering my previous experience on other teams, and became confident I'd make it. After @NUM2 of tryouts, they grouped us into the A, @CAPS1, or intermural teams based on skill level. That afternoon, I received a letter saying I'd made the A team! We immediately started practice and games. We won most of our games and improved our teamwork. A couple of days ago, we played against @ORGANIZATION1 middle school, our rivals. We were determined to beat them, partly for ""bragging rights"" but mainly to do our best. The first game was close, but we won, and I played about half the time, moving around the court. I was confident in the second game too, even though I didn't play as much as I'd hoped. In volleyball, a match consists of @CAPS2 games, and the best two out of @CAPS2 wins. We'd already won two games, but our coach wanted us to win all @CAPS2. She'd say, ""Pretend it's the winning point and play your hardest."" In the third game, I was on the bench. I waited and got discouraged as I hadn't played. I asked the coach a few times, but she was busy. Near the end of the game, she asked me, ""Can you do it?"" I quickly subbed in, went to the back of the line, tossed the ball, and hit it! I made the winning point. This taught me to trust my coach and be patient, as it often leads to the best outcome."
1059	19004	7	2	The concept of patience encompasses multiple meanings. It involves waiting for something and requires time and effort. I'm the kind of person who complains a lot and lacks patience. In contrast, some people don't complain and can be patient. Many teenagers struggle with patience. As people age, they may develop patience, but it varies from person to person. Whether an adult has patience depends on whether they work on it and their life experiences.
1060	19005	7	2	My mother is the most patient person I know. When she drops me off at practice, she waits two and a half hours while I cheer, fly, and dance through the whole routine. When I attend science programs, she waits at least two hours until it's over. Every morning, she waits for me to finish getting ready. After school, she waits while I buy something at the lobby table. All she asks is that we return the favor. She doesn't rush us unless we're late and always hugs us before we leave. Her patience is a constant reminder of her love and support, and it makes me strive to be more patient myself.
1061	19006	7	2	"I showed patience throughout a camping trip. At first, I didn't want to go to Wisconsin, yet I remained patient. During the drive, I was patient as well. When fishing, I didn't complain about the boredom and patiently waited. I even endured sleeping on the ground without complaint. The journey to the camping site in @STATE1 took @NUM1 hours. There was a TV in the car. I watched it for a while and then looked outside and spotted a moose! I shouted, ""Moose!!"" My roommate's boyfriend, Mike, stopped the car and backed up. It was my first time seeing a moose. After reaching the site, we set up the tent and went fishing. I patiently waited for the fish to bite my worm and caught @NUM2 fish that day. When we returned, I had to sleep on the bumpy, rocky ground but didn't complain as that's part of camping. On the way back, I couldn't find the TV, had no drink, and needed to use the bathroom. A sign indicated a @CAPS2 station at exit @NUM3. I patiently went to the bathroom and got a water. This camping trip truly tested and showed my patience."
1062	19007	7	2	"One day, there was a young boy named @CAPS1. He was extremely hungry, and his mother was a slow cook. It seemed to take an eternity for her to finish preparing the meal. @CAPS1 was famished and growing increasingly impatient with his mother @CAPS4. He went outside to play with his friends. When he returned home, he hoped dinner would be ready. He entered the kitchen and asked, ""Mom, is dinner ready?"" His mother replied, ""@CAPS3 right now. It won't be ready for another hour."" @CAPS1 wondered what to do until dinner. He decided to play a video - game, a space - ship game where the spaceship shot at other spaceships to survive. However, he got bored and went back to the kitchen to check on dinner. His mother still wasn't done, but @CAPS1 remained patient. Less than five minutes later, his mother finished cooking. This experience shows that patience can lead to a positive outcome."
1063	19008	7	2	Patience is defined as waiting for something without complaining. When I was @NUM1 years old, on a day with a temperature of about @NUM2 and a gentle breeze, I patiently waited to go on a ride at @LOCATION1 Adventures. The ride was the Shimbering Timbers, and the queue was extremely long. It took me about half an hour to board the ride. Another ride I waited for was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The line for this one was shorter, taking only about @NUM3 minutes. All these rides required patience; if I hadn't been patient, I wouldn't have been able to enjoy these great rides. The last instance was when I was @NUM4. I wanted to ride the Thunder Hawk, and the line took a whole hour. To pass the time and stay patient, I played my Nintendo. Thanks to my patience, an hour later, I finally got to go on the ride. Patience truly pays off when it comes to enjoying amusement park rides.
1064	19009	7	2	Patience means listening and being tolerant of how someone feels. My parents are very patient with my sister and me. My sister, who is @NUM1 years old, recently moved in with us. Having a new family member is challenging as we always have to get an extra plate, spoon, fork, pizza, school supplies, and other things she needs. Since we have to get these things, we have to work harder. My sister doesn't do things the way I'm used to. My parents are more patient and forgiving towards her, and I understand why. Sometimes, it seems like my parents are unfair. I might get in trouble even though she's older but isn't used to our way of doing things at home. I look up to my parents because they are kind to everyone. Even though the situation is different with my sister, they still remain patient, which is truly admirable.
1065	19010	7	2	I lack patience. In various situations, I find it difficult to wait calmly. Whether it's waiting in line, for someone to finish speaking, or for a task to be completed, I often get restless. This lack of patience can sometimes lead to me making hasty decisions or being irritable. I realize that patience is an important virtue, and I need to work on developing it to have better interactions and handle situations more effectively.
1066	19011	7	2	I once played soccer for a recreational team named the Cheetahs. “Rec” indicates it was the top - tier division. The rec soccer was enjoyable, but my two best friends and I were shouldering all the work while the rest of the team was idle. So, I decided to try out for a select team, which is in the second - highest division. When the try - outs arrived, I was extremely nervous. After three days of trying out, those selected would receive a phone call. It felt like an eternity to get that call. During those days, I had to keep waiting, and that waiting is what we call patience. This experience taught me the value of being patient in the face of uncertainty.
1067	19012	7	2	In my view, patience means being able to wait without complaining. I've never been a patient person, so here's a made - up story. One day, there was a girl named @CAPS1. She was eager to go to the park, but she had a long list of tasks. First, she had to do her math homework with @NUM1 problems on each side, which were just addition and subtraction and took her @NUM2 minutes. Then, she did the chores. Her sister's toys were all over the living room, but since her sister was asleep, it only took @NUM4 minutes to clean them up. Next, she tackled her messy room. She couldn't even open the door at first. After getting in, she made a checklist of tasks: vacuuming, fixing the bed, and putting food back in the kitchen. This took about an hour and a half. Finally, she had to clean up after dinner. They had spaghetti, and her sister had spilled it on the floor, so she had to mop. It took @NUM7 minutes to clean the table and @NUM4 minutes to mop. After her sister woke up, she fed her and then took her to the park. Through all these tasks, @CAPS1 showed patience, and in the end, they had a great time at the park, demonstrating that patience can lead to rewards.
1068	19013	7	2	I've had to exercise patience several times in my life, such as at the doctor's office, waiting for new game and movie releases. One particular instance was at the airport. The issue wasn't waiting for the plane or standing in the ticket line. All the planes were grounded, and we had to stay overnight. I tried to be as patient as possible, but my grandma was frustrated. It took over an hour to enter the food court and another hour to get our food. The place was extremely crowded, and it took all my self - control not to get angry. Similar to how one might feel impatient at the doctor's, on long car rides, or waiting for test scores, this airport experience was a test of patience. We should all work on being patient and staying calm in such situations.
1069	19015	7	2	I believe my coach is a patient person. She has @NUM1 girls to train and has to teach us things we don't know, like the @CAPS1 play and cross - over moves. She also trains us to run fast, and she shows patience with the slower kids. When handing out jerseys, she had to be patient as we all tried them on, which took some of her time. Her patience is essential for our development as a team, and it sets a great example for us to follow.
1070	19017	7	2	This is a tale about a time when I needed to be patient. Every year, we all anticipate birthdays, and I have to wait @NUM1 days for mine. It's a long wait, but I know patience is required. Patience is difficult but usually pays off. Another situation where I must be patient is waiting for the @CAPS1 tests to end. I always remind myself that it will eventually finish. So, I sit and do the work, exercising patience. This shows that patience is a virtue we need in different aspects of our lives.
1071	19018	7	2	Everyone dislikes waiting, yet we must learn to be patient. On @DATE1, when I traveled to @LOCATION1, I had to exercise patience in numerous situations. At the airport, I had to be patient while waiting in queues and using public transportation. Patience implies understanding and tolerance. During my journey, I spent a significant amount of time waiting in airports. It was particularly crucial to remain patient while awaiting the announcement of my flight. Another instance where patience was required was when waiting for my luggage to appear on the baggage carousel. Airport security checks also involved long waits. In summary, patience is essential when waiting at airports. When I visited @LOCATION1 on @DATE1, I had to be patient when using public transportation. During rush hour, I waited for a crowded train. When stuck in traffic in a taxi, I remained calm and patient. To conclude, patience is necessary when using public transportation. Although I still dislike waiting in line, I have learned to be patient. Waiting has taught me the value of patience, and it is a skill we all need to acquire.
1072	19020	7	2	One time, I went to @LOCATION1 with my dad for the Kencer Hauck adventures. We joined a massive line to get on a roller - coaster. There were so many people in the queue that it was quite shocking. It felt like we were waiting for hours, but in reality, it was just a few minutes. As we got closer to the front, it became increasingly difficult to be patient. Finally, we boarded the ride, and it was an insane experience. The wait, which seemed interminable at the time, was well - worth it. This event taught me that sometimes, the reward of waiting can be truly remarkable.
1073	19022	7	2	"One time, my family and I went to @ORGANIZATION1. We had already ordered our food and were waiting to receive it so we could eat. After waiting for about ten minutes, our food finally arrived. However, when we looked at it, we found that we had received all the wrong food and no drinks. So, my mom had to return it all. This time, we had to wait for about fifteen minutes. We waited and waited. Eventually, they gave us the correct food that we had ordered. After that, we left @ORGANIZATION2 and were finally able to eat. We even got ice - cream after our meal. When we got home, my mom said to us, ""@CAPS1 The good thing is you guys were so patient. Thank you guys for being good!"" This experience shows how I learned to be patient in a real - life situation."
1074	19023	7	2	"My heart was beating fast as I waited in line. @PERSON2 Hemlock said, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2. @CAPS3 is your report cards."" I, @PERSON1, was the last one in line. @PERSON2 then said, ""@CAPS3 you go @PERSON1 @CAPS11 A - @CAPS12, keep up the good work!"" I screamed happily, "" @CAPS4!!!"" and ran straight home. When I got home, my mom, Aya, said, ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @PERSON1."" I called @CAPS7 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 and said, ""@CAPS9. I @CAPS10 @CAPS11 A - @CAPS12! but can I order something from the internet for @MONEY1?"" @CAPS7 replied, ""@CAPS13 why not for a @CAPS11 A - @CAPS12 student."" I placed the order and waited for @NUM1 week. This experience was a mix of excitement and anticipation, and it made me realize the importance of waiting for good things."
1075	19024	7	2	I once demonstrated patience when I went to a skate competition in @CAPS1. The registration line was extremely long, almost reaching @CAPS2. I stood there for nearly an hour. However, when I finally reached the front and paid my fee, it was all worthwhile because I got to compete against my best friends. This experience taught me that patience can lead to rewarding opportunities, and the wait is often justified by the end result.
1076	19025	7	2	One instance when I demonstrated patience was at the @NUM1 birthday party in the area where I used to reside. I was standing in a seemingly endless line. After waiting for a long time, when I finally went to retrieve my ticket, I realized I had left it in the car. So, I had to make the long journey back to get it. When I returned, the line had grown even longer. I continued to wait, and the situation was truly unpleasant. Then, unexpectedly, it started to rain, and I didn't have an umbrella. Despite the circumstances, I still waited. I couldn't imagine how the situation could worsen, but it did. The concert was canceled. Eventually, I went home, with my hands and feet completely soaked. I then simply went to bed to rest. It was undoubtedly the worst day of my life.
1077	19026	7	2	I have extremely limited patience, almost none at all. When I have to wait, I experience a strange sensation, similar to a toothache. It's quite odd, isn't it? Let me share a story about a time when I lost my patience. On @DATE1, I was attending my @CAPS1 safety course organized by the @ORGANIZATION1. We had just completed the test that determined our success or failure in the course. They announced the names of the first group of people who passed and distributed their certificates. Everyone was waiting outside. The first group's process took @NUM1 minutes. It took approximately @NUM2 minutes to grade the tests and five minutes to distribute the awards. Unfortunately, my group was the last to be called. We sat on a bench for three hours! I completely lost my patience and started rocking back and forth. Finally, my group was called, and we received our awards. Thankfully, my patience has improved significantly since then. I passed the course and am becoming a proficient @CAPS1. I've shot a partridge and a @NUM3 - point buck. That's my story. Have a good night!
1078	19027	7	2	I have to be patient when taking the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I need to wait for my classmates to finish the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and sometimes the wait seems interminable. But it's okay; I can take a nap. However, I sometimes really hate being patient because it's so frustrating. Waiting for about @NUM1 minutes for others to finish a test is just annoying. It's good not to rush on the @CAPS1, but it's so frustrating that people take so long. This isn't just a problem at school; it also happens at home, at the doctor's, the dentist's, at a friend's house, and at the library. It's incredibly difficult to be patient. But being impatient isn't good either. I wish people were as fast as me during a test. Then I wouldn't have to be so patient. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to deal with it. It really stinks having to be so patient.
1079	19028	7	2	"Patience is a valuable trait. Good things often result from patience, while impatience can lead to unfavorable outcomes. But what exactly is patience? Patience means being able to handle problems without whining or complaining. It also involves the ability to wait calmly when others cannot. Some individuals, like my dad at times, are very impatient. For about a month, he saved his extra money to buy a new @CAPS1. Once he had enough, he purchased a ""@NUM1"" flat - screen @CAPS1. However, if he had waited just another week, he could have gotten one about a foot larger for the same price. Another example is when your little sister is bothering you. If you politely ask her to stop but she doesn't listen, instead of losing your temper and getting into trouble, it's better to wait for a parent to come home so that she can be disciplined while you stay out of it. In conclusion, patience is an important quality that can help us avoid unnecessary problems and make better decisions."
1080	19029	7	2	"Once upon a time, there was a girl named @PERSON2. She had always dreamt of becoming a princess. Every present she received was either a dress or jewelry, and she loved trying on dresses. She had two sisters, both @NUM1 years old (one year older than @PERSON2), named @CAPS1 and @PERSON1. Their house was an old one situated in the woods. One day, when @PERSON2 went out to get the mail, a man in a tuxedo gave her a very fancy - looking letter. @PERSON2 opened the letter and read it aloud. It said, ""@CAPS2 @PERSON2, you are invited to a ball at the castle on @DATE1 at @NUM2 pm."" @PERSON2 was extremely excited and decided to go to the mall to find a ball gown. She found a beautiful gown, but it was too expensive. She asked the lady at the front desk if they could lower the price if she helped around the store for a couple of days. The lady accepted the offer. @PERSON2 worked hard for hours over two days, and finally, her patience paid off. She was able to take the dress home. She drove back, put on the dress. With only an hour left, she quickly did her makeup and put on her jewelry. Looking at herself in the mirror, she said, ""I did it."" She then got in the car and drove to the castle. The castle was incredibly beautiful, with the moonlight shining on its gold - painted exterior. @PERSON2 got out of the car and entered the castle. As she walked down the stairs, everyone stared at her. It was the best day of her life, as everyone thought she was beautiful. She went to the dance floor and danced with some guys. Then, the prince came up to introduce himself. When she turned around, the prince fell in love with her. @PERSON2 couldn't believe that the prince was talking to her. He asked her to dance, and they danced all night. When the prince went on stage, he called her name, and she joined him. He proposed to her, and she said yes. She had finally become a princess! This shows that sometimes, our dreams really do come true."
1081	19030	7	2	One instance when I had to exercise patience was while babysitting. A family friend has a one - year - old, and I have a six - year - old brother. My mom and her boyfriend were going on a double date with our family friends, so I had to take care of both kids. Everything was fine until they left. At that time, my brother was in preschool, and they had given him paper books and worksheets. I thought it would be easy since my mom said he knew the words and I wouldn't have to sound out each one. However, he refused to do the work, the baby wouldn't stop crying, and the dog wouldn't stop barking (he hates when babies cry), and the house became chaotic. I started to panic. I didn't want to ruin my mom's plans and I definitely wanted to prove her wrong. Then I calmed down and remembered what a friend had said about being patient. I let the dog outside, picked up the baby, and went back to the table where my brother was. First, I read the book aloud, which caught both their attentions. Then I turned the work into a game, and things improved. Later, when it was time for food, I made something we all liked. I put the baby in his high - chair with his food and gave my brother his plate. But he threw his plate at me, and food was everywhere! I got mad but told myself to be patient. I cleaned up the mess, fed the kids, and put on a movie. They all fell asleep. I quietly cleaned the house, and when my mom and friends came in, they were surprised I'd managed it. Patience is a crucial part of life; losing your temper only makes things worse.
1082	19031	7	2	One day, my mom came home from work. She asked me if I wanted to go shopping for clothes right then or later. I chose right then. So, she changed her clothes, and we headed to the store. It was around [rush - hour time], so traffic was bad. It seemed to take forever, and I got angry. My mom told me to be patient and said it would be over soon. This was a time when I had to be patient. After ten minutes, the traffic started to clear up. It still took a while, but the situation was improving. In less than twenty minutes, we pulled into the [store's name] parking lot. There were a few cars in the lot, but it didn't seem too crowded. When we entered the store, I got really mad. The lines to purchase items stretched all the way to the back of the store. My mom asked me, “Look. The lines are long. Are you sure you can handle this and be patient?” I said, “I'll try.” After we got in the store, we looked for my clothes and also checked the lines to see if they were getting shorter. We found my clothes and got in line. We spent about an hour in the line, which made me angry. Not only that, I was hungry because I'd skipped lunch. When we finally got out of the store, we were both happy and hungry. We left the store and went to McDonald's. When we were down the street from McDonald's, we saw a traffic - like line. As we got closer, we realized it was the line for McDonald's. We entered the lot, and I knew I'd have to be patient again. The line moved quickly. When we got to the speaker, my mom ordered a fish sandwich for herself and a chicken sandwich for me. At the next window, we got our food. The lady said, “Thank you for your patience.” Then she asked if we'd like a free fry of any size for waiting. We said yes and asked for a large fry. My mom turned to me and said, “Do you see what happens if you're patient?” I said yes and agreed that patience is a good thing. That was a time when I was patient.
1083	19032	7	2	There was a time when I faced difficulties with football. I needed help with every aspect of the game. Fortunately, my dad stepped in to assist me. He taught me how to throw, kick, run, and other football skills. I was patient as I watched him and then tried to replicate what he did. I saw my dad playing, and we went out to join them. The things he taught me were challenging, but they were also very helpful. This experience showed me that patience is key when learning new skills in football. In the end, I realized that with patience, I could gradually improve my abilities in the sport.
1084	19033	7	2	Patience is likely one of the most important qualities in life. When a person is patient, they are generally more likable. For example, at school, if you are patient while waiting in line, you might receive a “thank you” from a teacher. Patience is required in various situations, whether it's at school or in a long line at an amusement park. Losing patience in such scenarios can lead to embarrassing consequences. For instance, if you lose your temper and cut in line at an amusement park, you could be thrown out in front of many people. This is why I firmly believe that patience is of great importance. It helps us maintain good relationships and handle difficult situations gracefully.
1085	19034	7	2	Fishing is an excellent sport, but it demands a great deal of patience. My first fishing trip was to a lake about [X] miles from my home. Since then, I've loved fishing, but that initial trip was far from easy. I find fishing enjoyable because it requires me to be patient. Every bit of patience I possess was put to use during that experience. When my uncle visits from [location], he always brings his fishing rods and has a different way of fishing. I never went with him until about a year ago. He suggested that I bring a friend so that I'd have someone to talk to if I got bored. Our patience was tested right away when we were about halfway there and [car - problem description]! We hit a fence, and the car broke down. We called for a tow truck. The wait was about [X] hours and [X] minutes. My friend and I were getting frustrated. Finally, we fixed the car and continued our journey. Once we arrived at the lake, we faced two more problems: we had no bait. We found a nice spot on the other side of the lake and spent about [X] hours gathering enough bait. We were finally ready to fish. We got our rods, set up our chairs, cast our lines, and waited. There was no way to speed up the fishing process, so we just sat there, hoping for a bite. In the end, my uncle, my friend, and I caught [X] fish! We ate three for lunch and went home with [X] fish left. I love fishing because it relaxes me. It shows that with patience, we can overcome various obstacles and enjoy a rewarding experience. This is why I cherish fishing; it truly requires patience.
1086	19035	7	2	On my birthday when I turned @NUM1, I was extremely excited as I knew I'd get a cell - phone, which was all I desired. All my friends had cell - phones, and I wanted one too, especially in case my mom needed to pick me up and didn't know my location. Since they're very useful, it felt like a necessity. My birthday was on a @DATE1. The night before, I was at the football game, and everyone asked if I'd get the phone. I kept telling them I'd get it the next day. The next morning, I woke up and rushed downstairs. The first gift I opened was the cell - phone, and I was overjoyed. I immediately started getting my friends' numbers. This experience taught me that when you're patient and don't keep asking, you'll get what you want.
1087	19036	7	2	One day, my brother and I asked our dad to take us to Game Stop so we could get a new game controller. He said he'd take us in a little while. So, we passed the time by riding around the neighborhood for a bit, then we went swimming in the pool for a while. But he still wasn't ready. We played with my dog, Macy. Finally, he was ready to go. We went to Game Stop, but they didn't have the controller. Then we went to @CAPS1 Boster. They had it, so we got the controller and went home to play the game. That's how I was patient all day. The best way to be patient is to keep yourself occupied for a long period.
1088	19037	7	2	My grandma showed great patience for @NUM1 months. She had a large check that kept having mistakes. They misspelled her last name, so it had to be recalled and re - typed. Every time they re - typed it, they made mistakes, and this happened five times in a row. It took a long time to process. We needed the money from the check to pay our bills so we wouldn't get evicted. We also needed a new car and clothes as our car was on the verge of breaking down and we'd outgrown our clothes. When my grandma finally got the check, we went straight out and bought a brand - new car and clothes. I think my grandma was incredibly patient, especially after they had to redo the check over five times. I know I wouldn't have been able to be that patient without losing my temper. Patience truly pays off in difficult situations.
1089	19038	7	2	This story is about a time I had to be patient. Right now, I'm being patient while waiting for @CAPS1. I'm not naturally a patient person. When I want something, I want it right away. Christmas is my favorite holiday because there are cookies, family gatherings, and presents. But there's a problem for me. I always try to figure out what my presents are. That's the downside of being patient; you're constantly waiting for something good to happen. My family knows not to put my presents in a bag because I'll easily look inside. If the wrapping isn't done well, I'll find a little slit in the paper. The worst time to be patient is the night before you can open your presents. I really hate having to go to bed when my presents seem to be calling out to me to be unpacked. It seems like all holidays are like this. Well, I guess we all have to be patient about something. Currently, I'm being patient about @LOCATION1 football winning the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION1, and the Florida Gators. First, @ORGANIZATION1 has to get out of the @CAPS5 bold game thing. In the end, patience is a virtue we all need at some point.
1090	19039	7	2	Have you ever seen someone with great patience? Well, I have. My neighbor was really eager for the soccer try - outs. He practiced all day, juggling the ball, passing, and working on different moves. The day of the try - outs arrived. He went, juggled in front of the coach, had a chat with the coach, showed off some moves, and then went home. The coach said, “It will be a couple of weeks to see if you're on the team or not.” My neighbor replied, “I can't wait that long.” After he got back, he told me all about it and said he didn't want to wait a couple of weeks. So, I told him about patience, saying that the more he complained, the worse he'd feel if he was disappointed. He went home and practiced a move he couldn't do before. A few days later, I was walking outside when suddenly, my neighbor came screaming, “I made it!” I just smiled and said, “Patience works.” This shows that patience can lead to success.
1091	19041	7	2	When I was @NUM1 years old, I had to exercise patience while fishing with my dad on my uncle's boat. My dad stopped the boat at the fishing spot, helped me put on a life jacket, baited my fishing pole, and cast it out. He caught about @NUM5 fish in the @NUM2 @NUM4, urging me to be patient as it was my first time. As he reeled in his catches, I sat waiting. Suddenly, my bobber went down. I yelled to my dad, and he told me to reel it in. I struggled and almost fell off the boat, but my dad came to my aid. Once we got the fish on the boat, I asked what kind it was, and he said it was a bluegill, a good catch for a beginner. We released the fish and continued fishing. This was a memorable instance where I learned the value of patience.
1092	19042	7	2	I'll share a time when I was patient at my old school. During some @NUM2 jump, some people cut in line. I told them to leave, but they wanted to fight. I held my patience while the teachers talked to them. I saw them outside later, and they didn't do anything to me. I'm not sure if they were trying to fight to make the school happy, but I'm glad I stayed patient. In such situations, patience can prevent unnecessary conflicts. This experience taught me the importance of remaining calm even when provoked.
1093	19044	7	2	Everyone understands what patience is and how it helps us stay focused. For example, when waiting in an unemployment line, patience keeps us from getting angry. However, a long wait increases the likelihood of frustration. Waiting also shows that we respect others in front of us. By being patient, we can observe our surroundings and discover new things. Patience demonstrates gratitude, respect, and trustworthiness, which are essential for being polite. When we are patient, we don't need to rush and should not complain. The time we wait is ours, and impatience shortens it. Patience is crucial as it often gets us what we want or need. I firmly believe that patience is important because we never know who is being patient with us, so we should extend the same courtesy to others.
1094	19046	7	2	The first time I was truly patient was when I had to wait @DATE1 years to get the film out of my camera. My mom promised to get it developed, but due to financial constraints, she asked me to wait. Each time I asked, she had a valid reason for not being able to get the film, such as using the money for school supplies or paying back those who had helped her. I waited through multiple @DATE1 periods. Finally, after @NUM1 @DATE1 passed, she initially forgot but then agreed to get the film developed after paying my dad back. She said she'd do it after school. During this long wait, my camera was dropped multiple times, and I had to get a new digital one. This experience taught me the virtue of patience in the face of repeated delays.
1095	19047	7	2	Every day at lunchtime, I have to be patient while waiting to be called to get my lunch, especially when standing in line. Sometimes, I'm lucky and can go to another line to pay. After finishing lunch, I must patiently finish my food, throw it away, and then I can go out to ride and play. This daily routine of waiting in various stages of the lunch - time process is a regular instance where I practice patience. It may seem like a small thing, but it helps me develop self - control and respect for the order of things. This is a simple yet significant time when I've learned to be patient.
1096	19048	7	2	I was a passenger on a plane journey to @LOCATION1. All I did was gaze at the towers and buildings as I prepared to leave them behind. I also showed patience when my little brother, Much, got a fly shot, and I had to wait in the lobby. The greatest test of my patience was with my brother. He rummaged through my things, broke my belongings, bit me with his toys, and constantly whined or cried over what he wanted. Despite these challenges, I managed to remain patient, which I believe is an important quality to possess.
1097	19049	7	2	During @DATE1, my family and I traveled to @LOCATION3 for a couple of weeks. In the second week, I embarked on an activity I'd never done before. My two older sisters (@LOCATION1 and @PERSON1), my dad, my cousin (@PERSON2), @PERSON2's uncle (@CAPS1), and I were on our way to the boat. I was thrilled as this was my first ocean - fishing experience. A few hours passed, and we hadn't caught anything. We continued waiting, sipping coffee, sharing jokes, and playing small pranks like tugging on each other's fishing lines to make them think we'd caught something. We left at @NUM1 am, and by @NUM2 pm, we still hadn't caught anything. However, my dad and @CAPS1, who fish regularly, advised us to be patient. About @NUM3 minutes later, @CAPS3's line started pulling, and @CAPS1 helped her reel it in. It was a clam the size of my thumb. Everyone remained patient, but no one else caught anything. At @NUM4 pm, we decided to head home. @PERSON2 was content. Everyone on the boat was patiently waiting to catch fish, and @PERSON2 was especially patient as she needed to use the bathroom for most of the time on the boat. I suspect most of us on the boat secretly needed to use the bathroom after spending so many hours there. When we got home, we told everyone about our catch. Everyone except @PERSON3 caught nothing. I'm proud of how patient everyone was and hope to repeat this experience when I next visit @LOCATION2 with my family.
1098	19050	7	2	"Maintaining patience is not an easy feat; it requires self - control. Patience is crucial because, for example, if you're applying for a job and you're impatient, the employer won't hire you as they're not looking for an impatient person. First, my family and I were planning a trip to @LOCATION1. We had to leave at @DATE1 am, so I couldn't sleep properly. I woke up at @TIME1 am and was extremely tired. I couldn't take a nap as it would likely turn into a deep sleep. Next, I had to finish packing. I was so exhausted that with only an hour left, I was quite frazzled. After packing, I watched TV to stay awake since I couldn't fall asleep under the circumstances. Then, my cousin needed a diaper change, and I was about to do it when @CAPS1 called and said, ""Let's go."" I was relieved as I could now sleep in the rental van. In conclusion, it was very difficult to maintain patience when I was so sleepy. I tried various methods to stay awake, and they worked. Having to change a diaper was about to make me angry, but somehow I managed to keep my patience."
1099	19051	7	2	"One lovely day, my sister and I were outside when my mom said she was going to the store and would be back soon. A couple of hours later, she returned with a gift. She said it was for my sister but that she couldn't open it until her birthday, which was a couple of weeks away. My sister was disappointed and stormed off. After a few days, she decided to be patient, thinking the days would pass quickly. However, time seemed to drag for her. My mom told her to just focus on something else. It was tough for her to wait. I was there to support her. Finally, the day of her birthday arrived. She opened all her gifts except one. The gift was sitting right in front of her. She rushed over and tore it open. When she saw what was inside, she just stared. In the silence, she said, ""@CAPS2's just clothes."" I could tell she wasn't happy. She exclaimed, ""I was patient for so long, just for clothes!"" I burst out laughing. I thought her reaction was a bit over the top. After I stopped laughing, she told me not to get used to being patient as it might not come easily again. In the end, it was a lesson in both patience and expectations."
1100	19052	7	2	"Have you ever been in a situation where you know something wonderful is about to happen, and you can't contain your excitement? You ask your parents when, and they tell you to be patient. This has happened to me numerous times, like when we were going to @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2, but this time, it was about getting our new dog. I decided to act like a mature teenager and be patient. It was @DATE1 @TIME1, the day my family was getting a dog, and I was ecstatic. I had butterflies in my stomach, ready to burst with happiness. Everyone in my family felt the same way, but then I remembered my goal of being patient. So, I went about my normal daily routine: ate breakfast, combed my hair, got dressed, brushed my teeth, and went to school. When I came home, my mom said my dad would arrive with the puppy in @NUM1 minutes. I sat in my room, watching the clock tick for about @NUM2 minutes. Then I walked into the living room where my family was waiting. Suddenly, the door of my dad's truck slammed. My mom, brother, and sister rushed to the door, while I calmly walked over to see the puppy. Everyone exclaimed, ""Aww!"" There were also cries of ""Can I hold her?"", ""She's my dog!"", and ""Let's name her."" My dad noticed me standing quietly and handed me the puppy, saying, ""You've been so patient; you should hold her first!"" I was extremely proud of myself. My patience had paid off, and it's clear that being patient can bring its own rewards."
1101	19054	7	2	One winter day, I went to my friend's house. We decided to shovel a sledding slot and pour water on it to make ice. Shoveling was difficult as we had to dig through a thick layer of snow to reach a suitable base for the water. I'm not usually a patient person, especially when a task takes hours. As it started getting dark and I had to leave soon, my patience began to wear thin. However, I kept telling myself to be patient. Fortunately, we managed to finish the icy trail before I lost my temper. Waiting for the water to turn into ice didn't bother me. Although we couldn't use the trail that night because it was too late, I'm glad I was patient that day to complete this fun project. That's my story about patience.
1102	19055	7	2	I learned the importance of patience during the hunting season on @DATE1. Most of the time on @DATE1, we sat and saw everything except deer. We reached a point where we didn't want to go hunting anymore, but we persevered. As the days passed and it got colder, we started to spot some does. My step - dad, @PERSON1, said that if we didn't see bucks, we'd shoot a doe on the @DATE2. When @DATE2 arrived, we didn't see much for most of the day. With about @NUM1 minutes of daylight left on @DATE2, a perfect buck walked into the field. This experience clearly shows that patience can be rewarded in the end.
1103	19056	7	2	One day, I, my mom, and my brother were in the car driving to a beach. Suddenly, the car wouldn't move because the battery had run down. My mom called a tow truck, and the driver said he wouldn't arrive for two hours. Me and my brother complained non - stop, but my mom sat quietly. When the tow truck finally came, I was truly amazed by my mom's patience. It made me realize that staying calm in difficult situations is a valuable trait.
1104	19057	7	2	One time, I was on my way to the bus stop. I arrived @NUM1 minutes before the bus was supposed to come. I sat and checked my watch. It was @NUM2 minutes past the pick - up time, so I waited. When I checked again, it was @NUM3 minutes past the time I should have been on the bus. I started to get impatient, but then I thought that buses can be unreliable. I sat back down and continued waiting. After @NUM4 more minutes, the bus finally came. They let me on for free as I was the only one at the stop. When I got home, my mom asked how it went. I told her the bus was late @NUM5 minutes and that I just waited. She said that's the reward for being patient. This experience taught me that patience can pay off.
1105	19058	7	2	I was waiting in line at @LOCATION1 Adventure for a ride. I quickly became impatient just standing there. But suddenly, I saw the line start to move. That made me calm down and continue waiting. When it was finally our turn to ride, I realized we had been waiting for an hour. Understanding patience means knowing that you have to stand and wait because you can't push or shove your way to the front of the line. Tolerance means you can't get what you want immediately; you have to endure the wait. You can't hit, cut, push, or shove to get ahead; you simply have to be patient. This experience at the ride taught me the importance of patience and tolerance in queuing.
1106	19059	7	2	"Patience demands a high level of tolerance. For the majority of people, it is challenging to be patient, yet it is sometimes of great significance. A few weeks ago, my neighbor desperately needed a break from her @NUM1 - year - old daughter, @CAPS1. I readily offered to babysit as I enjoy her company. Little did I know what awaited me. She arrived around noon, and we played for several hours. However, she then became irritable. I provided her with a snack, but it was of no help. She began to cry loudly, and I was at a loss as to what to do. My mother rushed into the room in a state of panic. ""What's going on? Is everything all right in here?"" she inquired. I informed her that everything was fine, but @CAPS1 was just extremely cranky. My mother suggested, ""Let's take her to the park. She'll have a good time there!"" I concurred, and off we went. I noticed that @CAPS1 prefers to do things independently. She insisted on buckling herself into the car seat, getting on the swings, and putting together puzzles. This requires an enormous amount of patience as she takes a long time. I love watching @CAPS1, but without patience, it would be extremely difficult."
1107	19060	7	2	Hunting demands patience. After approximately @NUM1 deer seasons, my patience paid off. I was using a bow when a @NUM2 - point buck emerged. It was about @NUM3 yards from my stand, and I lured it closer. Then, it was @NUM4 yards away. I took the shot, and it stumbled. The @NUM5 minutes I waited to find it felt like an eternity. When I descended from my stand, it had run about @NUM6 yards and then dropped. When I reached it, I was overjoyed because it wasn't a @NUM2 - point buck; it was an @NUM8 - point buck. Remember to use the region blood head and be patient; you might just shoot the deer of a lifetime.
1108	19061	7	2	This narrative focuses on the importance of patience in life. Patience is a vital virtue. In moments of extreme frustration, patience becomes essential. One situation where patience is required is when someone or something makes you angry. Without patience, you may end up in trouble. For instance, if you get into a fight due to anger, you'll face serious consequences. Also, when attempting a task and failing, patience is necessary to avoid breaking something and getting into trouble. Another scenario is when working with or teaching someone. Patience is crucial to prevent hurting their feelings if they can't perform a task correctly. Otherwise, they may become angry and distance themselves from you. A third case is dealing with someone who repeatedly makes you angry or humiliates you. In such a situation, patience allows you to ignore the person and avoid mutual trouble. Without patience, situations can end disastrously. Therefore, having patience is essential as it helps you avoid trouble, maintain friendships, and prevent various negative outcomes.
1109	19062	7	2	I possess a great deal of patience. For example, when I was eager to know if I made the volleyball team, I patiently waited without complaining. I firmly believe that having patience is a sign of respect towards oneself and others. Once, when I had a test and was anxious to know when we'd get the results, I exercised patience. In contrast, others lacked patience. They constantly asked when we'd receive the results and complained non - stop. Another instance is when we were planning to go to @LOCATION1 on @DATE1. I didn't have a ruler at that time, which made the waiting more difficult. The more I thought about it, the harder it was to be patient. Men @CAPS1 sometimes show more patience, and other times, less. In conclusion, patience is an important quality that can help us handle various situations better.
1110	19063	7	2	I woke up around @NUM1 am not feeling well. I was at my friend @CAPS1's house. I attempted to wait until she woke up, but I couldn't bear it any longer and woke her up. I told her I wanted to go home, so I called my mom. In about @NUM2 minutes, my mom came to pick me up. I told her that I thought I might be sick. It took about two hours to get home. Eventually, I threw up, and it was a horrible experience. This shows that being sick away from home can be a trying time, and waiting to get home for relief can be extremely uncomfortable.
1111	19064	7	2	My mom shows patience with my brother and me, especially considering the ongoing fighting and people getting killed in the area. She doesn't like us going places when such things are happening, and she's concerned when we come home late.
1112	19065	7	2	There was a time when I didn't want to be patient but had no choice. Our family was on a holiday trip to @PERSON2 common. While on the highway, about @NUM1 yards ahead of us, two vehicles had a mishap and both pulled over. The drivers were standing beside their vehicles, visibly angry. Soon after, the police arrived. We were waiting behind all this. The police investigated the situation and made a call. @NUM2 minutes later, a truck arrived at the traffic jam and began working on the road. I couldn't understand what needed fixing as there seemed to be nothing wrong. Finally, after about an hour, we were allowed to pass and continued our journey to @PERSON1.
1113	19068	7	2	Many people are good at being patient, but I'm not. However, when traveling long distances, one has to learn patience. Several times a year, my mom, sister, sometimes my dad, and I drive to my @LOCATION2's house. She lives about @NUM1 hours away, near @LOCATION1. My @LOCATION2 loves having family visits, so we don't mind taking a weekend every few months to go see her. I've been there at least @NUM2 times in my life. My mom works the night shift at a well - known hardware store, usually from @NUM3 @CAPS1 to @NUM4 @CAPS2. When she gets off work, we pack up and leave. I always bring my @CAPS3 to keep myself entertained, though I mostly sleep. One time, I drank a lot of pop and got very hyper. I annoyed my mom a great deal. So, I put in my @CAPS3 and started acting foolishly, singing along to the songs. Then, my @CAPS3 died, and I felt a bit heartbroken. I was still hyper and couldn't fall asleep. I tried listening to the radio, but all we could get was country music as we were traveling @CAPS7, away from the control towers of the cool radio stations. Finally, we reached “The up @CAPS7 store” where we always stop for gas and food on our way to @LOCATION2's. I got @CAPS8 and more pop. I gave a little evil laugh as I handed the items to my mom. In the car, after finishing my food, I got bored again. There was nothing to do, and I got angry. I looked out the window and sighed. Soon, I fell asleep. I woke up when we pulled into the driveway and saw my @LOCATION2 running to greet us. We were finally there. I survived another trip to @LOCATION2's house, but then I remembered we had to drive home. Even though I make this trip several times a year, I'm almost certain I'll always get bored during the ride. Being patient is not something I enjoy.
1114	19069	7	2	I wanted to go see a movie, but there were no movies at home that interested me. I asked my dad, “@CAPS1, can I go to the movies with someone?” He replied, “@CAPS2!” I checked what movies were playing and found a decent selection. I picked the one I wanted to see. Then I realized I needed someone to go with me. I called my friend @CAPS4 and asked if she wanted to see the same movie. It turned out she did, so she said yes. After that, I had something to eat and relaxed. Suddenly, it was time to leave. I was running late. I got ready quickly and went to pick up @CAPS4. Unlike me, she was calm and patient. If I were in her place, I wouldn't have been. That's one of the reasons I like @CAPS4 as a friend.
1115	19070	7	2	Do you have patience? I have very little patience. I can't wait for anything for long. When you need to be patient, you have to wait for what you want or need. In essence, patience is an important quality that I clearly lack, but perhaps it's something I should work on.
1116	19071	7	2	I went to the glasses store and needed approval to get glasses. The next day, my grandma called to inquire if I had been approved, and they responded with “@CAPS1”. She then asked how long the wait would be, and they said four weeks. However, after one week, they called to say my glasses were ready. So, the following day, we went and picked them up. This was an instance when I demonstrated patience.
1117	19072	7	2	While practicing cheerleading, I attempted a front - full, which is a complex twisting move in the air. I kept falling on my butt. My gymnastics coach, @LOCATION1, who has been like a brother to me since third grade, has been very patient. He's been working with me on this single trick for about a month. I really wanted to make him proud. He always greets me with “my baby!” and a hug and kiss on the forehead. @PERSON1 is extremely talented and has competed many times. He taught me my first trick, the back handspring. His patience generally helps, but sometimes I wish he'd push me harder. When I think he's disappointed in me, I feel awful and try even harder. One day, after falling again, his “try again” lacked enthusiasm. I was pumped with adrenaline and determined. I ran, jumped, and almost landed the trick, but my feet slipped. @PERSON1 ran to me, smiling, showing he was proud even though I didn't stick the landing. We kept at it, and eventually, I got it. I was thrilled to tell my cheer coach, but even happier that I did it for @PERSON1.
1118	19073	7	2	Last @CAPS3, my mom ordered @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I had to be patient for a long time, specifically one @CAPS3, which turned out to be a few months, and more precisely, five months. The game was released this @CAPS3 on @DATE1. To pass the time, I tried not to think or talk about the game and only noted its release date on my daily calendar. Even though I've beaten the game thirty - two times on every difficulty level without any help, I still have to wait about another month for Call of Duty: @CAPS4. It's really frustrating because now I can't stop thinking about it.
1119	19076	7	2	Everyone should cultivate patience as there will be times in life when it's necessary. I've always struggled with being patient. Sometimes I can be patient, and other times I can't. However, there was one time in my life when I managed to be patient. I was on my way to a @CAPS1 appointment with only @NUM1 minutes to spare when a group of elderly people started coming through the door. I decided to hold the door for them. It wasn't easy as there were many of them, and it took almost @NUM2 minutes for all of them to pass through. As a result, I was late for my @CAPS2 appointment. But I don't regret it because holding the door for those people was the right thing to do.
1120	19077	7	2	Last year, I was at an amusement park in @LOCATION2 called Cedar Point. I was standing in line to get on an amazing roller coaster called the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Force. It was an intense and thrilling ride, but the line was ten hours long. Standing in that hot, unbearable line was really painful, especially considering it was in @LOCATION1. Despite the discomfort, I waited patiently, and it was all worth it when I finally got to experience the ride.
1121	19078	7	2	When I went to get my new phone, I had to be patient because my grandma preferred to deal with a specific person. The man named @CAPS1, for whom my grandma and I were waiting, finally approached us. We then moved to the phone I wanted, and he talked at length. My grandma warned me that if I wasn't patient, I wouldn't get my new phone that day. We reached the counter, and he started showing features of the phone. I was eager to leave and examine it on my own. Eventually, my grandma and I left, and I got my new phone, which I really liked. Now, think of a time when you were patient and what you were waiting for!
1122	19079	7	2	One instance when I demonstrated patience was during a visit to the doctor. It was @DATE1 at @TIME1, and my mom and I went to the doctor's as I had an appointment. Upon arrival, the doctor called me and led me to a room. After about @NUM1 minutes, he returned. During the wait, my mom and I engaged in conversation. I wondered why it was taking so long, and my mom said she didn't know but advised me to wait. When the doctor returned, he started asking me questions about my diet, exercise routine, etc., and I often replied that I didn't know. After finishing the questions, he apologized for making us wait and gave my mom some papers. Then we went downstairs, and I had to go to a lab for a blood test. There were many people, but I remained patient. Finally, they called me in and took my blood. This was a time when I was patient with my mom at the doctor's.
1123	19080	7	2	"Patience is all about waiting, even when sitting with someone you don't like. When I was young, I wasn't very patient. My mom would say ""wait a couple of seconds,"" and I'd respond with @NUM1. As I grew older, I became more patient, being patient with teachers, peers, and parents. However, I still have an impatient side. I try not to lose my patience, but it sometimes happens. I enjoy having someone to talk to, but impatience can prevent me from doing so. My friends are generally understanding, though sometimes they don't get it. My mom is very patient, while my dad isn't, and I might have inherited my impatience from him. I don't talk to my dad much. Despite my impatience, I'm outgoing and funny, which is why I have many friends. Sometimes, my outgoing nature gets me in trouble. I love talking and having fun, and I think being more patient would make it even more enjoyable. I'm working on improving my patience. I believe I can do better than I have been, and being more patient might also help me perform better in school. I'll try my hardest to develop more patience. In conclusion, I clearly need to work on being more patient, and I'm determined to make progress."
1124	19081	7	2	"You asked for criticism about patience? Well, here it is. Patience is something that my cousins, uncles, aunties, and even you and I need, especially in these times. We need it on a daily basis. So, what does the word ""patience"" mean? It means being understanding and tolerant, being able to endure difficulties without complaining. In my own words, it's about long - suffering and waiting until what you want is achieved. I'm not always patient, but I know I should be. My daddy always tells me that I won't always get what I want, so I need to learn patience. This is a word I don't like when I really desire something. That's my take on patience, explained in my way."
1125	19082	7	2	There are times when I have to exercise patience in class, although I don't have a great deal of it. In @NUM1 block, which is math, we students have @PERSON1. @PERSON2 talks non - stop until lunch, which is about half an hour. So, I have to wait for him to give us work. This is how I practice patience in class. In conclusion, even though I generally lack patience, I manage to be patient during class.
1126	19083	7	2	My baby cousin @PERSON1 yelled from across the room, “@CAPS1 We're going to be late!” She was wearing a large blue snow - coat and adorable red boots. As she started jumping around, it easily made me laugh. This was because we were going on a skiing trip. I was going with my parents, my cousin @PERSON1, and her parents. I was extremely excited. But my parents were spending a long time talking to @PERSON1's parents before we left. So, @PERSON1 was a bit whiny about not leaving right away. I tried to calm her down. I gently tapped her shoulder and asked, “@PERSON1, do you want to play @CAPS3?” When I said that, her eyes seemed to double in size. She shouted, “@CAPS4! @CAPS4! @CAPS4! Madison, yeah! I wanna play, I wanna play!” Even though her words were a bit jumbled, I smiled and we started to play. I let her win when she guessed. Playing the game made her more patient about waiting to leave. Finally, my parents walked outside and we began our skiing trip. It proved that patience pays off.
1127	19084	7	2	One time, my little brother was taking a shower while I urgently needed to use the bathroom. I waited patiently. Of course, he locked the door. I attempted to pick the lock with a toothpick, but it was unsuccessful. I then told my dad about the situation, and he told me to “be a man and hold it in”. That advice didn't help either. I was on the verge of taking the door off its hinges when my little brother walked out and smiled at me. When I entered the bathroom, it was soaked with water. I couldn't help but yell at him. This experience demonstrated my patience in a difficult situation.
1128	19085	7	2	I often find myself having to be patient due to my family members. My older brother doesn't follow instructions well. For example, when my dad tells him to clean the bathroom, it takes him ten minutes just to get up. And when he's in there cleaning, he won't let me use it. That's one reason for my need to be patient. Another reason is my older sister. She's always on the phone, so I rarely get a chance to use it. I usually have to wait until my parents come home and scold her to get off. All these situations have made me a very patient person.
1129	19086	7	2	On @DATE1, as I sipped hot chocolate, I watched the snow pouring down outside. I could see our @DATE1 tree, which was laden with presents. I'd been longing to open them. I'd wanted a Wii since @DATE1 but had never received one. However, that didn't stop me from hoping. I really wished to get one this year. After some time, my parents said we could open our gifts. I screamed “@CAPS1” and quickly tore the paper off the presents. I got a makeup set, a digital camera, and many other things, but no Wii. I was very frustrated. I asked my mom if we could buy the Wii the next day, but she said we couldn't afford it and would buy it when we had enough money. Since I'm a patient person, I decided to wait. We all enjoyed our @DATE1 and watched TV. After about a week, my parents got their paycheck. My mom said we could go out and buy the Wii. I screamed “@CAPS3, thank you, mom!” When we arrived at the store, I got the Wii, which cost @MONEY1. I couldn't believe it; my patience had finally paid off. Now, I'm enjoying every moment with my new Wii.
1130	19087	7	2	I firmly believe that my @CAPS1 is the most patient person in the world. She was born in a difficult situation where she had to be patient for basic necessities like food, money, and water. She couldn't simply go to the grocery store to buy food. Instead, she had to patiently make her own. For instance, if she wanted popcorn, she would first get some corn shells, put them in a pan, start a fire, and then wait for the shells to pop. This is far more time - consuming than just putting a bag in the microwave and pressing a button. Her patience is also evident in how she deals with various situations and even with me. All these aspects prove that she is the most patient person I know.
1131	19089	7	2	Patience is a crucial aspect of life. Those who lack patience are often perceived as hasty and are advised to calm down. A patient individual is regarded as polite, refraining from complaints and demonstrating understanding and the ability to wait regardless of the circumstances. For instance, when someone is in a queue to obtain food, they must patiently await their turn while others are being served. This behavior not only showcases politeness and understanding but can also make one a role - model, especially for younger children. By setting such an example and being considerate, one shows that patience requires both understanding and thoughtfulness. In conclusion, patience is a virtue that encompasses these important qualities and is essential in daily life.
1132	19090	7	2	My brother Colin and I had been asking our parents for a dog for quite some time. Every month, Mom and Dad would say we were going to get one, but instead, we got a fish. Mom would search online for dogs, and Dad would look through the paper. Colin and I promised daily that we'd feed, walk, and give water to the dog. Around @NUM1 days before my birthday on the @NUM2, they finally announced that we were getting a dog the next day! It was @NUM1:00 at night, and we were so excited that we couldn't fall asleep. The next morning around @NUM4, we got in the car. Mom said the place was in Howell, so we thought it wouldn't be far. Colin and I were overjoyed. When we reached the house, there were @NUM5 small, fluffy dogs - one white and @NUM6 black. I told Mom I wanted the @CAPS3 dog, and she said it was up to Dad. Since Dad loved her, we got to take her home. We named her Vary Patient. Although our patience was tested, it was definitely worth it in the end.
1133	19091	7	2	A warrior named @PERSON1 patiently waited for his sword for an hour. While everyone around him was yelling, he sat quietly, filled with happiness. All he could think about was his @CAPS1, as he had a deep love for swords and already owned @NUM1 of them. Once he got his sword, he went after the ninjas because they had taken a boy named @PERSON2. Using his magic - made sword, he defeated the ninjas, turning them to dust. After that, the warrior and @PERSON2 went to school, where the warrior became the teacher and @PERSON2 the student. This shows that patience in getting the sword led to heroic deeds and a new chapter in their lives.
1134	19092	7	2	One of the most exciting events in my life was when my family and I went to the Monster Jam. However, the journey there was quite a test of patience. The trip almost took @NUM1. It took half an hour to find a parking spot, at least @NUM2 minutes for my mom's friends to arrive, an hour waiting in line, and finally @NUM3 minutes to locate our seats. Despite all these delays, the anticipation and excitement of the Monster Jam made it all worthwhile. Thank you for listening to my account of this patience - testing experience.
1135	19093	7	2	"There was a time when I really wanted to go somewhere, but my mom said, ""@CAPS1 not tonight"" because it was a school night. I responded with ""okay, I know it's a school night,"" and I'm proud to say I did so with manners and loyalty. Another instance where I showed loyalty was when my best - friend was in a physical fight with another girl. I walked right up to my friend's ""enemy"" and told her to go home and leave my friend alone. She back - talked me, but eventually, we ignored her, and she left. These are examples of how I've been loyal to others and stood up for my friends, which are important values in relationships."
1136	19094	7	2	I had to visit the doctor. I initially thought I'd be seen promptly. When we arrived, there were over @NUM1 people in the queue, and more were still arriving. Since I needed to get my shots, we had to wait patiently. However, my mother couldn't wait due to the large number of people ahead of us. I fell asleep while she kept pacing around. When I woke up, five people had already been seen. She still couldn't remain patient and continued pacing, which made me nervous. Then another @NUM2 people went in, and the progress was extremely slow. Eventually, she calmed down. She became so patient because the staff said they would ask her to leave if she didn't. I had never seen her so patient; it was unbelievable.
1137	19095	7	2	When I was in the sub - line in @NUM1 grade, I waited patiently. I didn't mind if someone cut in front of me. After waiting for @NUM2 minutes, the line was still long. My patience started to wear thin, and after @NUM3 minutes, I finally reached the counter to get a sub. Waiting @NUM4 minutes for a sub was like waiting for pizza. Once I reached the check - out, I discovered I had no money in my account. I was extremely angry, as angry as if I hadn't been paid for a year. This whole experience was a huge letdown after waiting so long.
1138	19096	7	2	One sunny day during lunch recess, I was playing on the playground. My brother Eric was on the monkey bars. His hands got sweaty, and he slipped, falling on his arm and screaming. The recess supervisors took him to the office and called my parents. My parents then called my school to inform them they were picking me up. They picked me up, and we went to get my brother. We drove to the hospital, where they took X - rays. It took an incredibly long time. I sat quietly for @NUM1 hours. My parents told me they appreciated how patient I was. This was a memorable time when I demonstrated patience.
1139	19097	7	2	My view on patience is that when there are about @NUM1 people in front of you in a line, you must be patient. Others were in the line before you, so you have to wait your turn. Cutting in line is unacceptable and can get you kicked out of places. For instance, if you're waiting to buy something to eat, waiting your turn is crucial to avoid being removed. Similarly, when waiting for rides, patience is required to avoid attracting the attention of security. In conclusion, patience in lines is essential to ensure a fair and orderly environment.
1140	19098	7	2	One time, I showed great patience while fishing with my grandpa up north. We spent the whole day trolling up and down the channel at least @NUM1 times. Each time we got bites, but we never managed to catch any fish. Our usual routine wasn't working, so I suggested turning the boat around and heading towards Shigle Bay. My grandpa agreed, but there was a risk as there were many rocks in that area, and we didn't want the propeller to break. We took a chance and steered the boat to where I directed. As soon as we entered the bay, the fishing pole bent down so far that it was hard to believe there was a fish on it. I grabbed the net, and my grandpa held the pole and started reeling. Eventually, we brought the fish to the surface, and it was a @NUM2 - inch walleye. We smiled and said we'd have fish for dinner. This was a time when my patience was tested, and in the end, I caught the biggest fish in the lake.
1141	19099	7	2	One day at the start of fall, @PERSON1 was watching TV. While she was watching, a commercial came on, announcing that the final movie of a very popular series would be in theaters the next night. At school the following day, everyone was excited and couldn't wait to see the movie that evening. When it was time to buy tickets, @PERSON1 arrived to find a huge line already formed. As she waited, she noticed her best friend, @PERSON2, in front of her. Then, the rich and popular girl, @CAPS2, showed up. She walked up to the ticket booth and tried to cut in line. She even attempted to pay extra for a better seat. However, the ticket seller told her to get in line like everyone else. This made @CAPS2 angry. Since she didn't get in line right away, more people joined the queue. Meanwhile, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 chatted. Because they were patient, time passed quickly, and before they knew it, they were buying tickets. In contrast, @CAPS2 thought it took forever to get her tickets because she lacked patience. This shows that patience is a virtue that can make waiting much more bearable.
1142	19100	7	2	I went to Cedar Point and was very patient. I had to wait in a long line for a ride. There were a lot of people there. I waited for almost an hour for a ride that lasted only a short time. But despite the long wait, I remained patient. This experience taught me that patience is important in situations where we have to wait. Even though the wait was long, it was still worth it in the end.
1143	19101	7	2	One day, my family and I went to @CAPS1 Point. I was extremely excited. As soon as we arrived, I rushed out of the car. We got our tickets and a map and then decided to go on the @CAPS2 Dragon. The line was incredibly long, and it seemed like it wasn't moving at all. But I was as patient as I could be because I was so eager to try the ride. Finally, after what felt like forever, our family inched forward little by little. And then, at last, we were next. We all got into our seats and made sure our seat - belts were fastened tightly. The roller - coaster ride lasted only a couple of minutes, but it was definitely worth the long wait. This was a time when I showed great patience, and it taught me that patience can lead to rewarding experiences.
1144	19102	7	2	"One @DATE1 at @TIME1, I was at the crowded ice - cream store, Frasty's. The line was huge, with over @NUM1 people there, and I was in the middle of the line, sitting and waiting, thinking about what I would order. One by one, the staff took the orders. Then, there was a short old lady who hadn't decided what to get. She kept asking about prices, whether it was sugar - free, and what toppings it had. Finally, she placed her order. When I reached the front of the line, a group of people came up, claiming they were ""holding their place in line"". There were @NUM2 of them, yelling at the person behind the glass. After what seemed like an eternity, the order was done and it was my turn. Just then, a sweet old lady asked, ""Can I cut in front of you, dear?"" I had to say yes because it wouldn't have been nice to refuse. This is my story of being patient, and it shows that being patient in difficult situations can make things more pleasant for everyone."
1145	19103	7	2	I said, “@CAPS1 on!” We were in my dad's doctor's waiting room. My dad goes to a special doctor. It was extremely boring. There was also a mini - sale going on, so my sister and I went to check it out while my dad read a book. We were at the doctor's almost all morning for @CAPS2. It was the most tedious day of my life. The doctors were very slow, and I thought they were rather incompetent. I asked my dad if he was being patient. There was also a sale at the doctor's area. They had dishes, food, jewelry, and diaries. I got a ??? Krispey treat, and my sister got a hat. Her hat was really cool. I also got something and it was blue, purple, pink, and sparkly. Finally, they called my dad. He went into a patient room. When he came out, he said he was healthy. He had to wait until they got his prescription ready to take and get filled. They gave him the prescription, and we left. In conclusion, we should be patient with others. Patience is a form of kindness, and I always try to be patient with people. I hope others will also practice patience.
1146	19104	7	2	My brother Matt has always been impatient, getting frustrated when things or people take too long. We've always had to be patient with him, but one day, that changed. My mom, my nephew, Matt, his girlfriend, and I decided to go out for a meal. While waiting in line at the restaurant, I made a bet with Matt's girlfriend. The bet was that for each impatient comment Matt made, she'd pay me two dollars. If he didn't make any, I'd owe her two dollars. After the waitress took our orders and left, we started chatting. The adults talked about work and other topics, while my nephew and I discussed school. This took a few minutes. We also watched a bit of a football game. Throughout this time, I was amazed that Matt didn't make a single impatient comment. I was disappointed to have to pay his girlfriend two dollars, but I was really impressed by his new - found patience.
1147	19105	7	2	One time, I went hunting with my mom. Hunting requires a great deal of patience. We sat in the deer blind, and my mom prepared her crossbow for when a deer appeared. We waited for about @NUM1 hours. I was on the verge of losing my patience, but then a mother deer and her fawn came into view. My mom didn't want to shoot either of them because the fawn would be left alone. So, we waited for more deer, but none showed up. I managed to keep my patience. As it got cold and dark, we decided that no more deer would come, and my mom was starting to lose a bit of her patience too. So, we went home. That was a time when I was able to be patient for a while.
1148	19106	7	2	"When I think of patience, my mom immediately comes to mind. She is incredibly tolerant and understanding. Even when she has explained something to me about @NUM1 times and I still don't understand, she helps me without a single complaint. A prime example is when she and my dad taught me to ride a bike. It was the @DATE1, and I was around five years old. My dad was at work, and mom and I were bored, so she went to the garage and got out my new bike. My dad had told me to turn the handlebars to avoid crashing, but I kept forgetting and falling. Frustrated that it wasn't easy, I almost gave up. However, my mom gently encouraged me to try again. Holding the bike, she told me to pedal. She let go and shouted, ""Turn! Turn!"" But it was no use. I turned the wrong way and fell on the grass. ""It's okay. You almost got it!"" mom said as she rushed over. I put on a brave face and tried again and again. Mom never got angry with me and always helped me up. On my last try before it was time to go inside, mom let go, and I rode all by myself, around the corner and back! When I returned, we danced a little, mom congratulated me, and we called my dad to tell him about my achievement. That day, mom showed incredible patience. She didn't let me give up and never complained. To me, my mom is the perfect example of patience, and thanks to her, I learned to ride a bike."
1149	19107	7	2	You should try to be patient when doing homework. One time, while I was doing my homework, I started to get impatient because I was having trouble. My dad said he'd help me and told me to be patient. So, I sat there and waited as long as I could. Finally, he came to help me. Usually, I get impatient with homework or similar tasks. You really need to try your best to be patient. Patience can make difficult tasks much easier to handle.
1150	19108	7	2	Everyone has had moments of patience, and I'm no exception. A year ago, my brother and I had a project to complete, and we both needed a computer. Since there was only one computer at home, I let my brother use it first. After waiting for hours, I checked to see if he was close to finishing. He wasn't, but then I remembered that he was a slow typer. He finally finished the next day. I didn't mind waiting because I had enough time to type my part of the paper. This was a time when I was able to be patient and understanding, showing that patience can lead to a smooth - running situation.
1151	19109	7	2	One time I demonstrated patience was during a camp trip. I had to endure a @NUM1 - hour journey to reach the camp. During the trip, I mostly slept and ate, and we also watched movies on @PERSON1's @CAPS1 player. When we finally arrived, I still had to wait for registration. Moreover, I had to wait until the rain stopped so that I could carry my stuff into our cabin. After that, we waited for the chapel to start. There were other activities available, such as playing tennis or volleyball, chatting with friends near the lunch - room, or reading in the cabin. When the bell rang, we all entered the program center and waited for the chapel session to end. By the end of the week, we had all shown a great deal of patience. At lunch, we had to wait for second servings because the food was delicious. Finally, I had to spend another @NUM1 hours on the way back home. This experience truly tested my patience, and I'm glad I was able to remain patient throughout.
1152	19110	7	2	One day on Earth, an alien race known as the ì@CAPS1î arrived. They were in search of the @ORGANIZATION2 balls, which could summon a @ORGANIZATION2 that would grant a wish. @NUM1 powerful fighters, including @CAPS2 and @ORGANIZATION1, attempted to stop them. However, the aliens were too strong, and @ORGANIZATION1 was initially defeated. @ORGANIZATION1 then trained with King @CAPS3, while the others waited for @ORGANIZATION1 to return. Eventually, @ORGANIZATION1 came back and defeated the aliens, thus saving the Earth. This event shows the importance of perseverance and the ability to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds.
1153	19111	7	2	One day after school, I was informed that I had a doctor's appointment. I asked my mom when it was, and she said @NUM1. I told her that I had a dance starting at @NUM2. I was frustrated and said, ì@CAPS1, it's my first dance!î My mom started talking, but I was so annoyed that it seemed like just a bunch of meaningless words to me. She then asked me to get in the car. We spent an hour in the waiting room, and by then, I had already missed half of the dance. I was quiet during that time. Finally, we were seen in the office and then went home to get ready for the dance. Despite missing part of it, I still had a great time at the dance. This experience taught me that sometimes unexpected things happen, but we can still make the best of the situation.
1154	19112	7	2	Patience is essential in all aspects of life. A lack of patience can lead to serious consequences. For instance, my sister's friend once wanted to cross the road without waiting. She didn't look both ways and ran in front of an on - coming car. She was hit and suffered cuts and road burns all over her body. She was rushed to the hospital, and my sister, mom, and I went to see her on the day of the accident. She was so badly cut that she couldn't walk properly and needed assistance. About a month later, she started having severe headaches and went to the doctor. They diagnosed her with something called coma atices, which was like a mild coma. This shows that even a small act like crossing the road requires patience. On the other hand, patience can bring positive outcomes. One time, my mom told me to wait in the car with the windows up and the air - conditioning on. I got very bored and was about to get out, but then I saw two guys trying to open a car window. I grabbed my cell phone, went to the back, sat on the ground, and called @NUM1. The authorities were on their way and were in the driveway. They got out of their cars and apprehended the guys. It turned out that these @NUM2 guys were the ones the police had been looking for. I received a @NUM3 - dollar monetary award for helping to catch them. My patience not only saved my life (because they would have killed me if they saw me) but also helped in finding bad guys. Patience can save lives and lead to unexpected rewards, so we should always practice it.
1155	19113	7	2	I once witnessed my brother being extremely patient. He was waiting for a call or an e - mail from the coach of a dominant state basketball team. The coach had seen my brother play in a tournament in @LOCATION1. He was there to recruit players for his @CAPS1 team. After watching one of my brother's games, the coach approached him and said that he would be a great asset to the team. My brother expressed his desire to play for the team and gave the coach our phone number and his e - mail address. The coach promised to contact him within @NUM1 days. On our @NUM1 - day drive home, my brother kept checking his e - mail. The @CAPS2 day passed, and there was no call or e - mail. The second day also went by with no news. My brother remained patient and didn't stress about it. On the third day of our trip back home, when my mother told him that it might not happen, he was very understanding. We got home at @NUM3 o'clock, and I was starting to doubt that my brother had made the team. Then, the phone rang. My brother talked for a while and then hung up, saying that he had made the team. This was a perfect example of how patience can pay off.
1156	19114	7	2	"A wise man once said that patience is a virtue. Let's determine whether this wise man was correct. I'm going back [DATE1] years. I had just spoken with my parents, and I asked, ""[CAPS1], can I have you order this Lego for [CAPS2]?"" [CAPS5] replied, ""[CAPS3]"" and then asked me to move. I politely stepped aside, and [CAPS5] placed the order. On [DATE1], I inquired, ""[CAPS1], do you know when my Lego is arriving?"" [CAPS5] responded, ""It should be here either before or after [CAPS2]."" I replied with an [CAPS7]. K. The week before [CAPS2], I checked the mail. ""No package,"" I thought to myself. I then checked the porch, but there was nothing. A week after [CAPS2], the mailman arrived, and I saw a package on top. It turns out that the wise man was right; patience is indeed a virtue. This was a time when I exercised patience, and I also learned that it is better to wait for certain things."
1157	19116	7	2	One day, my parents were searching for vacations on the internet. They came across a vacation to [LOCATION1], a place just outside Traverse City. We decided to go for [NUM1] days, and the trip was set to begin the following month. I was excited about the upcoming vacation, but I had the patience to wait until we received confirmation of our reservation from the travel provider. When the day finally arrived, I was extremely excited. We packed everything and were ready to go, and even the dogs seemed eager for the trip. Since we had nowhere else to leave the dogs, we dropped them off at my grandma's place before starting our four - hour drive to [LOCATION1]. About an hour into the drive, my sister became impatient and kept asking if we were there yet, while I simply sat and looked out of the window. We stopped at a pit - stop to get water and drinks. My parents wanted coffee, but they had some trouble getting it and had to wait for about [NUM2] minutes before finally getting their coffee. Miranda and I sat patiently the whole time. We remained patient throughout the entire journey to [LOCATION1]. In the end, our patience was rewarded with a much - anticipated vacation.
1158	19117	7	2	"Can you recall a time in your life when you had to wait for something for a very long time? I had such an experience. Do you think you can guess what it was? It was [CAPS2] Eve. I was only five years old at the time. I woke up on [CAPS2] Eve and couldn't wait for the next day. I kept telling myself that all day. I went outside to kill some time, but it was freezing, so I had to come back inside right away. I had nothing to do, so I just kept waiting. Then, ""[CAPS4]"", my brother woke up, and I played with him the whole day until it was time to go to sleep. When it was bedtime, I ran straight to my bedroom and got into bed. The next morning, I woke up extremely happy because I no longer had to wait. I felt like I had waited forever. That day, I was overjoyed. Now, I'm [CAPS5] thirteen, and I don't really care as much anymore. However, I'd still love to hear about your similar experiences."
1159	19118	7	2	I was at [ORGANIZATION1], waiting in line for a ride that I was really eager to take. The line was incredibly long! It resembled a long row of dominoes. I don't enjoy waiting in long lines. Like most kids, I don't whine or make a fuss about waiting. In my mind, I was constantly thinking about when I would finally get to go on the ride. I didn't scream or shout; I just tried to stand still and wait. Time ticked by. I kept waiting for the line to shorten. Minutes later, it was finally my turn to go on the rollercoaster. I was extremely excited! I took the ride, and it was fantastic! The only drawback was that the ride lasted only a minute, while I had waited in line for about an hour. Nevertheless, it was all worth it.
1160	19119	7	2	On [DATE1], my two friends and I were laughing outside. Then, I remembered that I had to have dinner in [NUM1] minutes. I went inside, and my friends were very patient. They didn't leave me, so I ate as quickly as possible to avoid keeping them waiting. After I finished, we went back to the park and swung on the swings. Then, we walked back to my home because they had to go back to their own homes. That was my [DATE1]. It was a really fun day.
1161	19120	7	2	@CAPS1 resides in Ohio and attends @CAPS2 Middle School. After school one day, as he was walking home, his friend @CAPS3 asked him to wait in the parking lot so that @CAPS3 could call his mother and inquire if @CAPS4 could stay at his house for the weekend. @CAPS4 waited for a full half - hour while @CAPS3 conversed and argued with his mother. Once @CAPS3 finished, he thanked @CAPS4 for his patience, and they all spent the weekend at @CAPS8 house.
1162	19122	7	2	There was a time when I was patient. I really wanted an iPod Touch, and my grandma was bidding on one. It took a long time to win the bid, but we finally did. The shipping process also took a while, yet we eventually received it. In the end, all the waiting was worthwhile.
1163	19123	7	2	If you were a stranger sitting next to me on a bus en route to @LOCATION2, you'd think me patient. However, if you were my best friend @PERSON1 on the day before taking me to @LOCATION1's @CAPS1, it's a different matter. @PERSON1 and I had been talking on the phone for at least an hour daily for about two weeks. Finally, @PERSON1 invited me over and asked if I wanted to go to @LOCATION1's @CAPS1 the next @DATE1. Naturally, I said yes, and we planned for me to spend @TIME2 on @DATE2 and leave on @DATE1 for @CAPS3 with her. The next few days were dull as I stayed home babysitting my brothers. When @DATE3 @TIME1 arrived, @PERSON1 called to say I probably couldn't spend @TIME2, but we were still set to leave for @CAPS3 at @NUM1:00 am on @DATE1. I said it was okay, though I was extremely disappointed. @DATE2 was pure torture. Babysitting my brothers was uneventful. We ran around the house, which took only ten minutes, then watched @CAPS5 to kill a couple of hours. After lunch, time passed quickly. I talked to @PERSON1 for two hours, then my parents came home and things were normal. At bedtime, I couldn't sleep. @PERSON1 called at @NUM2 to tell me she was having pizza, which didn't help. Eventually, I got the rest I needed. The next morning, I got dressed, packed, and was ready. @PERSON1, her mom, and her brothers arrived, and we headed off for a great day at @LOCATION1's @CAPS1. The journey seemed short, which was a good thing. We went on many rides and had @CAPS7 @CAPS8 for dessert. I was both patient and impatient at times. This shows that I can be very impatient about big things but can wait for smaller ones.
1164	19124	7	2	When I was in school, the teacher left the room, and the kids went wild. They stood on tables, threw paper @ORGANIZATION1 planes and paper around the @ORGANIZATION1, and were screaming. I just sat there, amazed at how stupidly they were acting. When the teacher returned and saw what was happening, the kids got in trouble and were called home. I was glad I wasn't involved because I could have been kicked off the cross - country team. The kids were suspended from lunch. I hope such an incident never happens again as I was a witness, and my presence could get the kids in even more trouble.
1165	19125	7	2	Last year, my dad took me hunting. We woke up at @NUM1 in the morning, got dressed, and went to our deer blind. As soon as we arrived, we heard numerous gunshots from shotguns, rifles, and even black powder. We waited the whole day until it got dark again, then packed up and left. Throughout the day, my dad and I didn't see anything. This is an example of how I can be patient.
1166	19126	7	2	"One day, I intended to go hunting. I patiently awaited my father as he dressed. Once he was ready, we made our way to the woods. Subsequently, we entered a hunting blind and patiently waited for fifty minutes. Just then, a deer appeared. It was an ideal doe. Eventually, the deer approached the blind, about @NUM1 or @CAPS1 away. My father whispered, ""Wait for it to turn broadside."" @CAPS1, I waited until it turned and shot the doe. After that, we exited the blind to search for my arrow, but we couldn't find the deer. I knew I had to be patient and wait for the next year's hunt."
1167	19127	7	2	One time, I really wanted an awesome @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. It looked amazing, so I asked my mom. She said we'd get it tomorrow. I waited and waited. I was quite patient at first, but as time passed, I started to get a bit irritated because it was taking so long. I was becoming impatient, but I didn't complain. Even to this day, I still want that @CAPS3. I just have to keep being patient.
1168	19129	7	2	@CAPS1's brother was patient. He showed patience through understanding and tolerance. He demonstrated this by sitting down and waiting. For instance, he was waiting at the doctor's to get stitches. I was also patient as I waited with him. We always try to be patient when we have to wait for something. Another time I was patient was when I went to get @CAPS1's hair cut. I had to stand in a long line to get it done. These are some of the times when I had to exercise patience.
1169	19130	7	2	One day, I had a doctor's appointment. I checked - in at the desk. After that, I sat patiently until the doctor called me back for my check - up. Then, I waited for the actual doctor to come and assess how I was feeling and whether I was eating well. After the check - up, I went to the checkout desk to find out when my next appointment was. I also got my pills refilled before finally going home.
1170	19131	7	2	One time, I had to be patient when my mom said she would buy me an @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1. I waited and waited for her. I knew I had to be patient because she was going through difficult times. Even though the waiting was tough, I understood that patience was required in such situations.
1171	19132	7	2	"These stories are about times when I was patient. One story took place on @DATE1 when my guardian was putting away my winter clothes. I told her that these were my good clothes and they weren't really winter clothes. She said she knew but was just putting them away because I had too many shirts of the same color. Initially, I wanted to talk back, but then I said, ""Oh, I see what you're saying"" as I couldn't fit everything in my dresser. So, I was patient and helped her put the clothes away. Patience means being able to do what someone asks of you, doing the right thing by others, or helping someone when you think they need it."
1172	19134	7	2	Once upon a time, I went to the doctor with my mom. The place was very crowded. While my mom went to provide the doctor with information about me, I sat beside a lady whose daughter was crying. When my mom returned and the doctor started calling names, I tried to be patient. I got up and went to the kids' play area to play. We arrived at @NUM1, and the doctor finally called my name at @NUM2 pm. After that, I received a shot, sat in the room for @NUM3 minutes, was given some medications, and told to go to the pharmacy @CAPS1 to get a prescription. This was a time when I demonstrated patience.
1173	19135	7	2	I showed patience while waiting to get my own phone so that I could text and call my friends. I was also waiting to obtain my snowmobile license to ride my snowmobile on the trails. No matter what the situation, one should always be patient.
1174	19136	7	2	"Playing hockey is important to me. As a goaltender playing for Farmington Hills, being a goalie requires skill, the ability to be tough - skinned, and most importantly, patience. On every game day, my dad tells me to ""be cool, calm, and collected,"" which I call the three Cs. I step onto the ice and patiently wait for the puck to come my way. Once it does, I spring into action. At the end of the first period, I patiently wait again. When the second period starts, I stand waiting for the puck drop, hoping our team scores. The score is @NUM1 to @NUM2! My patience has helped; it's @NUM1 to @NUM2. In the third period, there's a big save by me! A goal is scored! The score becomes @NUM5 to @NUM2. The game is over! I patiently waited to secure that win against the team from @LOCATION1. After the game, we all went to @CAPS5 @CAPS6's house to celebrate this great win, and we had a really wonderful time."
1175	19137	7	2	This is a story about a time when I had to be patient while waiting for a plane at an airport. We were on our way to @LOCATION1 and had to take two flights. When we got off the first plane at the second airport, we checked the arrival time of our second flight. We were shocked to find out that we had to wait six hours. My mom told me to be patient, but I'm not naturally good at it. To distract myself, we decided to eat. After I finished eating, I almost screamed because I was eager to go, but I reminded myself to be patient. Then I went to the gift shop. Only three hours had passed, and I was getting annoyed, so I started playing my DS. Before I knew it, there was only one hour left. Playing the DS had distracted me. But then I quickly got impatient again, and my sister and I started fooling around. Suddenly, our plane arrived. I was so happy, and my mom was very proud of me for being patient. She bought me something from the gift shop. Through this experience, I finally learned to be patient.
1176	19138	7	2	Patience is a virtue that I've had to exercise on numerous occasions. One such instance was when I went to the dentist. I really dislike going to the dentist, but we went there and sat down. We ended up waiting for about an hour or two. However, there was one silver lining: I got to miss school. I think there was a test that day. In my opinion, the dentist and the doctor are the worst places to go. The good thing about the doctor is that you usually don't have to wait as long, so you can get in and out quickly. But sometimes, patience is necessary. For example, when you're applying for a job or going for an interview. Patience can lead you to good places. It's a polite way to conduct yourself. If you're smart, you'll choose the patient route. Being impatient is disrespectful; it's like treating things as if they're worthless. Patience is similar to having good table manners—nice and professional. If I were you, I'd be patient because it will lead you to a good future.
1177	19139	7	2	Patience is of utmost importance. Without it, people would be perpetually irritated. In the absence of patience, getting through the day would be a struggle, as individuals would constantly be checking the clock, wondering when they could leave. Some people lack patience, while others possess an abundance of it. This disparity can impact how people interact with one another. A lack of patience can affect even the smallest aspects of daily life, such as getting into arguments because of waiting in line at a store or having to count money. It has the potential to change the lifestyle of everyone on the planet. Patience is one of the most crucial qualities. It aids in making the right choices. Instead of immediately answering a question, one can take the time to think and make a better decision. Many of us may underestimate the significance of patience. In reality, it is more than just waiting; it involves being accepting of things we don't like. It also means going through life without constantly questioning why we can't do something. The world as we know it would not exist without patience.
1178	19140	7	2	"Patience is essential when it comes to making friends. This story is about a young girl and boy who wanted to be friends, but one of them lacked patience. One day, I walked into the room where a speech competition was taking place. I sat next to my friends, and they all thought I would win first place. When I went up with a friend, he said he had put on a bit too much cologne because he was extremely nervous and didn't know what he was doing. At that time, no one knew that we were friends. After I went to check my speaking number, I found out that I was the first one to speak. My friend said I'd do well, and he was up right after me. I started my speech, and people loved it. After my friend and I finished our speeches, we sat next to each other and talked a lot. Then, our friends asked if we were friends. I said, ""No way! Why would I be friends with him?"" Everyone laughed. We looked at each other in a bad way. For a few days, we stopped talking because my friend was so suspicious. I was patient and waited to talk to him. But my friend wasn't patient at all. He was eager to tell others that we were friends, but we couldn't because people thought we were different. In truth, we were very similar as we both liked soccer, basketball, music, and chatting. Eventually, people found out. My friend had told them that we were friends. At first, some people laughed, but they were actually happy that he finally had the patience to tell them. Now, my friend and I are best friends and will be so forever. In conclusion, having patience is a good thing, but sometimes people struggle to be patient when they want to make friends."
1179	19141	7	2	One time, I showed patience when my cousin's family and I went to [LOCATION1]. My sister got sick. My other sister and I sat in the car for about two and a half hours. My sister got really mad, but I just sat there patiently. My mom and sick sister were in the doctor's office for a long time. My sick sister even went to the doctor's office three times. Because she wasn't feeling well, all she wanted to do was lie down, so we hardly got to do any fun things. But by the end of the trip, she was feeling better, and my mom took us to do something enjoyable. This was a time when I demonstrated patience.
1180	19143	7	2	Being patient means waiting your turn in line. Cutting in line is rude and disrespectful, and you'll end up having no friends. When you're patient, you show respect to others, and they're more likely to be your friends. It's disrespectful when you don't wait your turn. For example, when your parents are talking to another adult and you try to rush things, it's rude. Or when you nag to leave someone's house, like your aunt's or uncle's, it shows a lack of patience. You should be respectful and wait; it's a better way to make friends. If someone is being impatient and disrespectful to you, tell them to be patient and then walk away. In conclusion, patience is key to building good relationships, and we should always strive to be patient.
1181	19144	7	2	A thrill coursed through my body. We were @NUM1 seconds away from the opening of @ORGANIZATION1. I had to wait @NUM2 minutes to go on Space Mountain. I wished I could bypass the queue, but I knew I had to wait. When I got off the ride, I knew it was well worth the wait. At the end of the day, I pleaded to go on one more ride. Again, I had to wait @NUM3 minutes. The ride presented the unexciting history of @CAPS1. Then, at the end, it provided a screen where we selected the future and watched a funny cartoon with our faces on it.
1182	19145	7	2	Have you ever babysat young children? If so, you're aware of how much patience it demands. It was my little cousin's third - birthday party. As the eldest, it was my duty to watch the younger kids. Initially, all was well. The kids were quietly playing with the plastic kitchen, offering me pretend food. Then one child started playing with the ball popper. Naturally, when one child has a new toy, the others stop what they're doing and join in. So all the kids gathered around the ball popper, laughing as it shot plastic balls into the air. Suddenly, a little girl grabbed a ball, triggering a fight among the kids. I shouted at them to stop, but when they ignored me, I realized this would take a great deal of patience. I calmly took the ball popper away and waited for them to calm down. Fortunately, the kids stopped fighting and played quietly with the ball popper. I learned an important lesson from my cousin's birthday party: babysitting requires a lot of patience.
1183	19146	7	2	"Math again!"" I groaned as I remembered another math homework assignment due the next day. I was already fed up with math. Every day, my fourth - grade teacher assigned long and difficult math homework. Some days, I'd come home and cry because it was so hard. My parents always told me to be patient and stay calm. I never wanted to be patient as it never seemed to work for me. Every day, I'd sit at the table and take my time doing the work. @NUM1 problems a day were tough for a fourth - grader. Whenever math class started, I'd take out my homework and wait to have it checked. I never did poorly. In fact, I was always proud of my work. But when it came to getting a new homework assignment, I was never happy. A new lesson every day was also a challenge. I had to be patient and take my time. One day, my teacher gave us an easy lesson, and I was confident I could finish it at school. Occasionally, I'd encounter a hard problem and get stressed. But I remembered what my mom said, ""Be patient and stay calm,"" and I did. I was patient and worked through the problem. To this day, I remember to be patient. I also realize that we have to be patient throughout our lives. Math helped me become a more patient person."
1184	19147	7	2	One time, my brother and I were returning from @LOCATION1. Everything was going smoothly until the car broke down on the freeway. We called our parents to come pick us up. When they arrived, they realized they'd forgotten the cables and left. After @NUM1 hours, they came back. I asked if they'd remembered everything. They nodded, hooked up the car, and we were on our way.
1185	19148	7	2	"One day, @CAPS2 @CAPS1 was sitting, watching TV and having a good time when his (step) brother, @PERSON1, entered the room and said, ""@CAPS2, we have to go to my interview, or you'll be grounded."" ""@CAPS3 long is it?"" @CAPS2 asked. ""@About an hour,"" @PERSON1 replied. ""But 'Itchy and Scratchy' is coming on, and it's a one - time - only episode,"" @CAPS2 said. ""@CAPS6, that pointless kids' show. It was on the @CAPS7 and then became a real show."" ""Where is it?"" @CAPS2 asked. ""It's at @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS6, and the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 man, @CAPS2, you have to be there. We leave in an hour. Make a science experiment or something,"" @PERSON1 said. @CAPS2 never liked the @CAPS9 - @CAPS13 man. After a commercial, something happened on @DATE1 (which I won't disclose). @CAPS2 did what he was good at: making a science experiment to get revenge on the @CAPS9 - @CAPS13 man or whoever he disliked. He waited @NUM1 minutes for the experiment to finish. Then they left. It was a three - hour drive, and his favorite show was on, so he taped it. He was being patient. When they arrived, he searched for the @CAPS9 - @CAPS10 man for @NUM2 minutes. Was @PERSON1 lying to him? He was so patient that he got tired and fell asleep. When he woke up, guess who it was? The @CAPS9 - @CAPS10 man. ""@CAPS2 said to the @CAPS9 - @CAPS10 dude. @PERSON1 watched and laughed. @CAPS2 threw a bouncy ball at the @CAPS9 - @CAPS10 man. @DATE2, no more @CAPS9 - @CAPS10 man. @CAPS2 was patient for over @NUM3 hours, missing his show and almost @DATE2 @DATE1 to get back at the @CAPS9 - @CAPS10 man. The end."
1186	19149	7	2	I'm usually not a very patient person (I'm well - aware that patience is a virtue). However, on my birthday a few years ago, I had to stay in a hospital room with my dad to be with my mom. It was extremely boring, but somehow I managed to endure the whole day until my dad finally allowed me to watch TV in the room without getting bored to tears.
1187	19150	7	2	One time, I showed great patience while going school shopping. It was me, @CAPS1's mom, and @CAPS1's dad. The store was incredibly crowded, with over a hundred people. It was like a cluster of pebbles in the sand; it was difficult to move through the aisles. Some people left due to the crowd, but even more came in. We started our shopping and got in line behind about @NUM1 people. @CAPS1's mom was on the verge of losing her temper. After @TIME1, only @TIME1 people had moved forward. @CAPS1's mom almost fell asleep, and @CAPS1 was in pain, both arms and back aching. She was eager to leave. @CAPS1's dad was reading an ESPN news magazine while waiting. When there were only a few people left in front of us, we were looking forward to getting @CAPS1's clothes. But when we reached the cash - register to buy them, it broke. The lady said it would take one or two hours to fix, and @CAPS1's mom started complaining. We had already waited an hour and a half in line. @CAPS1's dad was fine as he was engrossed in the magazine. Disappointed, we got @CAPS1's dad and left. We didn't get the clothes that day but went the next week.
1188	19151	7	2	I was patient on the bus when we arrived at school. The kids were loud and noisy that day. There were about @NUM1 - @DATE1 kids trying to get off the bus. It was so crowded that it was hard to move. Someone jumped in front, and I fell back into my seat. I waited for all the kids to pass and then got up and walked down the aisle to the door. The bus driver thanked me for waiting, and then I left the bus.
1189	19152	7	2	"On @DATE1, my friends and I were chatting about how awesome the Xbox was. They said that with Xbox Live, you could play with people worldwide. They also talked about the upcoming game, @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @NUM1. I looked it up online, and it had a @NUM2 - star rating, which is really good. I asked my mom and dad if I could get it, and they both said ""we'll see"". A month later, I asked my mom again, and she suggested waiting until @CAPS6. When I went to my dad's house, he said @CAPS6 was near. I pleaded, saying everyone else had it, but he still said no. I waited @NUM1 months, hoping he'd change his mind, but he didn't. Then I asked my mom, and she told me to be patient and threatened to deny me if I asked again. Finally, when @CAPS6 arrived, I got an Xbox with my favorite game as my last present from my parents. I'm really happy, and I've learned that patience pays off."
1190	19153	7	2	I'm generally a patient person, but I'm especially patient when getting my hair cut. Every time I go to the @CAPS1 hair - cutting shop, it's packed. People often say they have to go to a party or church and need a quick haircut. I let them go first and patiently wait. It actually makes me a bit happy to be patient because I'm helping others. I believe that if I need someone to be patient with me in the future, I'd want them to do the same.
1191	19154	7	2	One time, I demonstrated patience while babysitting my cousins, @PERSON1 and @CAPS1. The adults were rearranging furniture upstairs, so we stayed downstairs. @PERSON1 and I watched a movie, but the kids couldn't sit still. It took great effort not to scold them. I also wanted to play with @CAPS1, who was in her crib. Finally, when the adults upstairs almost finished moving the couch and the chair, creating more space, my test of patience came to an end.
1192	19155	7	2	I showed patience during a trip to Cedar Point with @CAPS1. While packing, I put my PSP in my bag. During the journey, I got bored and started using my PSP, losing track of time. When we arrived near the park and pulled into the hostel, I faced a long wait. In the queue, I played on my PSP, which helped me exercise patience. Without it, it would have been very difficult, as waiting tested my mental endurance. The PSP proved to be a valuable aid in maintaining my patience throughout the experience.
1193	19156	7	2	"Patience can have both positive and negative aspects. It can be challenging and stressful, especially when waiting for a shot or life - threatening test results. To combat normal boredom - related patience, one can engage in taking notes, doing schoolwork, or using an iPod. Patience is ubiquitous, manifesting in car rides, birthday parties, vacations, commercials, the end of school, restaurants, holidays, or any situation where one says ""I cannot wait"". In summary, patience is a part of our daily lives, presenting various challenges and offering different ways to manage it."
1194	19158	7	2	I once showed patience while waiting at the dentist's office for my 16 - year - old brother, @CAPS1. One day, we went to the dentist as my brother needed to have his wisdom teeth pulled. My grandma and I waited for hours. After some time, she went to the backroom with my brother, leaving me alone in the waiting room. Fortunately, I had my @CAPS3, so I watched cartoons and listened to music. I then went to the bathroom. When I returned, a nurse led me to the backroom. To my surprise, the doctor hadn't even started yet. At least I could talk to my brother. After what seemed like an eternity, the doctor arrived. The operation took about an hour, and then we waited for the anesthesia to wear off. My brother was acting funny. Eventually, we left, and I managed to keep my patience throughout the long wait.
1195	19159	7	2	I was extremely patient when I wanted my @CAPS1 to cook me lasagna. I hadn't had it since my mother passed away on @DATE1. My mom had @CAPS1 cook @CAPS2 for my first birthday, and it was all gone quickly. My @CAPS3 mother cooked @NUM1 pans of it, and it was so delicious that it disappeared right after it was served. When I turned @NUM2, my mom made my birthday party special. Unfortunately, she died from open - heart surgery at the age of @NUM3. Her funeral was well - attended and very nice. In @DATE2, I asked @CAPS1 to cook lasagna for me. She said it was too expensive to make. I offered to give her money, but she refused, telling me to save it. I put my money away. Later, she said she'd cook it when she had more money and paid her bills. On @CAPS6 @NUM4, @DATE3, she finally cooked it. My aunts, brother, sister, @CAPS1, and @CAPS8 all had some. I watched silently as they took their share, not saying anything because I lived in their house. The lasagna only lasted @NUM5 days. I was very happy when she cooked it and even brought it to school for lunch.
1196	19160	7	2	One instance when I demonstrated patience was during the end - of - year period in fourth grade. I had just signed up for football and had to wait from @DATE1. Once I received my football pads, I was so thrilled that I put them on about four times before the football season started. @DATE1 passed, and then came @DATE2. In @DATE2, I was involved in showing cows, which made that time pass quickly. Finally, it reached a point where I only had eleven days left until my first football practice. When that day arrived, it went by extremely fast, and 6 p.m. came around in a flash. Then it was time to go. I really enjoyed football that year, and I've been playing it ever since. It truly took patience to wait for football. Two months might not seem like a long time, but for a ten - year - old, it's quite difficult to wait that long.
1197	19161	7	2	"One time I had to be patient was when my brother was planning to get me a present even though it wasn't my birthday. It all started on a sweltering @DATE1 day. I was doing my chores, which included raking, mowing, and a lot of other yard work. Mom, Dad, and my brother Travis were having a lot of conversations. Whenever I sat downstairs, they'd tell me to go do my chores and then I'd see them talking. It really annoyed me that I couldn't hear what they were saying. Eventually, I just carried on with my chores. Mowing the lawn took two hours. After that, I went inside and started watching TV. All of a sudden, I heard ""click click tap bam"", and then I heard my brother Travis yell, ""Hey, get back here!"" I went to our fourteen - step curly staircase and was suddenly greeted by the licking and nuzzling of a six - month - old puppy. I grabbed his collar, laughing, and saw that his name was Max. Now, he's a happy three - year - old mutt. That was my brother's present to me for getting all A's and doing a lot of work around the house. I love my dog, and that was the time I had to exercise patience."
1198	19162	7	2	One time, I was waiting for a game but couldn't get it yet. So, I asked my mom if she could buy me a new game and inquired about the price. She said it cost @NUM1 dollars and that I'd have to wait for a few days. @NUM2 days went by, and I finally asked my mom again if she could buy it for me. She said not yet, and I thanked her. The next morning, we went to the game store. As soon as I saw the game I wanted, I told my mom. We then went to the counter and bought the game. Patience was key in getting the game I desired.
1199	19163	7	2	On Oct @NUM1 @DATE1, my mom and I were getting ready to go to the doctor's appointment. When we arrived, the place was extremely crowded. It felt like we'd been there for weeks or even days. There were a lot of kids crying and playing. I was so exhausted as I waited for my turn to see the doctor. After @NUM2 minutes, it still wasn't my turn. I tried my best to be patient, but the noise of the kids running around didn't help at all. I walked up to the register and found out that my appointment was scheduled for @NUM3 o'clock, and it was only @NUM4 then. Waiting at the doctor's that day was a real test of my patience.
1200	19164	7	2	One day, my dad and I had a doctor's appointment at @NUM1 pm, and we arrived on time. We sat there for a while, thinking it would only take a few more minutes. So, we waited for @NUM2 minutes. Then my dad went to ask other doctors how long it would take. They said about @NUM2 more minutes, so we waited for another @NUM2 minutes. But the doctor still didn't come out. We waited for @NUM5 minutes, and my dad went to the doctor again. They said it would be a few more minutes, and after waiting for @NUM2 more minutes, the doctor finally called us. In total, the doctor was @NUM7 minutes late. When we went into the room, the doctor apologized for being late. That's how my dad and I showed patience during that doctor's appointment.
1201	19165	7	2	Patience is often a challenging virtue to demonstrate. One day, I accompanied my mother to @LOCATION1 in search of a pawn shop. Along the way, we encountered a red - light at almost every intersection, yet no one uttered a single complaint. As we reached a particular red - light, just before it turned green, an elderly woman using a walker stepped in front of our vehicle. We patiently waited for @NUM1 minutes until the old lady had safely passed. Remarkably, not a single person in the traffic showed signs of irritation. This experience truly exemplified the power of patience in everyday situations.
1202	19166	7	2	When the word “patience” is mentioned, I often think of standing in a store line with @NUM1 people ahead. In @NUM2 grade, my sister and I engaged in a “patient game”. The rules were simple: the one who could go the longest without food, with water as the only drink, would win a whole box of Dunkin' Donuts. On Day @NUM3, I had consumed about @NUM4 bottles of water, but my sister was still holding on. By Day @NUM5, I had drunk around @NUM6 bottles, and both my sister and I endured the constant groaning of our empty stomachs. On Day @NUM7, despite the intense hunger pangs, my sister remained steadfast. However, on Day @NUM8, I broke down and ate a large amount of food. My sister, @CAPS1, cheered me up and generously offered me one of her @NUM9 chocolate doughnuts, keeping her promise. In my view, this game was a perfect example of patience.
1203	19167	7	2	One of the most frustrating situations is when a flight gets canceled, and this misfortune befell my cousins' family. They had been planning to come to @LOCATION1 for Christmas since @DATE1. My cousin Cara and I had been in constant communication via texts and emails, discussing our plans for their visit. But unfortunately, their flight was canceled. We were extremely angry. My cousins' family had to be incredibly patient as they were uncertain if they could come to see us. My grandma kept calling my uncle in @LOCATION2 and came up with a solution: to catch the next flight. The only issue was that the next flight was at @NUM1 and it would take them two hours to reach @LOCATION1. When they finally arrived, I was waiting at the airport. My cousin said, “Everyone was so patient but me!” I had assumed my cousin Cara would be the patient one, but I was wrong. Still, it was reassuring that someone in the family showed patience during this difficult time.
1204	19168	7	2	I once demonstrated patience when my dad and I went hunting in Leslie. We woke up at @TIME1 @TIME3 and arrived at the hunting location at @TIME1 @TIME4. We stayed there until @TIME1. During our stay, at @TIME1 @NUM1 in the morning, my dad shot a doe. Later, at about @NUM2 in the @TIME2, he shot another doe. We then left with two large does in the back of my dad's truck. This hunting trip was a clear instance where I had to be patient, waiting for the right moments and conditions for a successful hunt.
1205	19169	7	2	I remember a time when I had to be patient at the dentist. When we arrived at the dentist's office, we checked in and found that there were many people waiting. As a result, we had to wait for a long time. While waiting, I sat on the floor, feeling extremely bored. I repeatedly asked my mom if it was almost my turn, but she always replied that she didn't know. Finally, the doctor called my name. I went inside, and the nurse prepared me for the dentist. After that, I had to wait even more because the dentist was attending to another patient. But eventually, he came, and my dental appointment was over. This was definitely a time when I had to exercise a great deal of patience.
1206	19170	7	2	"During a math class in school, when I didn't understand how to deal with positive and negative integers, my teacher showed great patience. I asked the teacher, ""How do you order them from least to greatest?"" The teacher replied, ""Would you like me to show you?"" I said, ""Please."" For about a few minutes, the teacher helped me. Meanwhile, the other students in the class quietly did their work. This was a time when people were patient with me, and I really appreciated it."
1207	19171	7	2	I've never been a patient person. I'm always rushing others to do things and getting angry when they don't act fast enough for me. I'd easily get an attitude. That's why I struggle with patience, and now you know the reason. It's clear that my impatience has been a long - standing issue, and I should work on changing it.
1208	19172	7	2	I had a meltdown when I was in the [NUM1] grade at Cross Creeds Christian School on [DATE1]. We lived just around the corner. After [NUM2] minutes, my patience was wearing thin as my mother hadn't arrived. Another [NUM3] minutes later, I had a temper tantrum and cried. My patience was like a balloon that popped and deflated as I grew angrier at my mom not being there. I realize this was a mistake and that I shouldn't have gotten mad over something so silly. I've learned that I should keep trying instead of giving up so easily.
1209	19173	7	2	I'll tell you about a time I showed patience. My family and my mom's boyfriend went on vacation to [ORGANIZATION1]. When we got there, it was crowded. We lined up for the first ride. The attendant said it was a [NUM1] - minute wait. At first, the line moved quickly, but then it slowed down to a crawl. It was hot and humid, which was awful. After [NUM2] minutes, it felt like [NUM3] hours, and I was running out of patience. Then we got into the shade, which was cool and nice. Finally, we were next in line. [PERSON1] and I were so happy. My mom's boyfriend timed the ride; it was only [NUM4] seconds long. We waited [NUM5] hours for a [NUM4] - second ride, but I still showed patience that day.
1210	19174	7	2	Patience is essential for daily life. It means being understanding and tolerant. Most people have varying levels of it. My brother has some patience but not a great deal. There are five kids in my family, [NUM1] girls and [NUM2] boys. I admit I can be annoying at times, and my little sisters and brother are obnoxious, but my older brother is the most obnoxious of all. He usually freaks out over small things. One time, though, he was surprisingly patient. We were at home, and usually, when we annoyed him, he'd get angry. But this time, we kept fighting and teasing him, telling him to shut up and even hitting him, yet he just sat there calmly. I started to worry because it wasn't like him. Then I smacked him across the face, and he finally got angry and hit me. I ran to tell my dad. As daddy's little girl, my brother got in trouble. He showed a lot of patience by tolerating our actions for a long time, but in the end, he snapped. Still, I'm glad I didn't get in trouble myself.
1211	19175	7	2	When I'm hunting, I'm mostly in the woods. Patience is crucial as I wait for deer. Sometimes, only a fawn appears; other times, it's does. But when a buck comes into view, I first have to wait for it to get close enough for a shot. Once it's within range, I must wait to raise my gun and then wait for the right moment to shoot. If I make the shot, I need to be patient and wait for the deer to die. And if I can't find it immediately, I don't give up. That's when I demonstrate patience in hunting.
1212	19176	7	2	One time, my volleyball team went to @ORGANIZATION1. I was among the last to get off the bus, which meant I was one of the last to place an order. While everyone else was ordering, I patiently waited there and chatted with my friends who were also waiting. I decided on what to eat: a @CAPS1 cheese burger, @CAPS2 fries, and a large drink. As I watched the clock, I started to get sleepy. Then the lady said, “@CAPS7, @NUM1.” She then asked, “@CAPS8 @MONTH1, may I take your order?” I told her what I wanted, and she entered it into the register. After a few minutes, I finally received my order. By being patient, I was able to get my food at @ORGANIZATION1.
1213	19177	7	2	People with patience make great teachers, and my mom is one such exemplary leader. She has a high level of patience despite having a family and numerous responsibilities. When my siblings and I repeatedly ask for things, she doesn't get angry. Instead, she calmly says yes or no with a smile. After a long day at work, she never complains. She just keeps a smile on her face and continues with the rest of the day's tasks. In the morning, when she wakes up to take us to school, she has a bright smile and never grumbles. My mom is a very patient woman, a great teacher, and an outstanding leader. I truly appreciate everything she does for me, my brother, and my dad.
1214	19178	7	2	There was a time when I desperately wanted a PSP. I asked my parents for it, and they told me I had to wait until @CAPS1. Although I really wanted it right away, I decided to be patient and wait. After a long period of waiting, I finally got my hands on a PSP. This experience taught me the value of patience in getting what I desire.
1215	19179	7	2	I remember having to use @CAPS10 sister's old @CAPS1 Pearl phone. It was extremely slow, often dropped calls, and it was just terrible. As @CAPS10's birthday approached, I really needed a new one. I asked @CAPS10's mom if I could get one for @CAPS10's birthday. She told me to be patient. I was so eager to know that I kept asking her, and she said it was probably not going to happen. But I didn't give up and remained patient until @CAPS10's birthday. When I woke up, I saw presents on the kitchen table. @CAPS10's family watched as I opened them. When there was one present left, I opened it. It was a huge box, and inside were more boxes, one after another. Finally, I reached the smallest box. When I opened it, the side of the box said “iPhone”! I got an iPhone @NUM1! I was overjoyed. @CAPS10's mom smiled and said, “@CAPS9, this is what you get for being patient.” This shows that patience can lead to wonderful rewards.
1216	19180	7	2	I once was very patient. I was invited to a sleep - over. When I got there, we went to the storage to get pop, but it was not accessible. This experience showed my patience as I didn't get frustrated in that situation.
1217	19181	7	2	Patience is the act of waiting for something that may take a long time, understanding the circumstances, and waiting without being impolite. For instance, consider a newly released toy that everyone in town has and it's extremely popular. If your parents can't afford to buy it for you at the moment, and you understand their financial situation instead of constantly begging them for the toy, you are being patient. Conversely, if you keep pestering your parents, you're not being patient. Before being rude and incessantly begging for what you want, it's important to think about others, understand why it may take longer than you'd like, and practice patience.
1218	19183	7	2	I'm writing a story about patience. Patience can be described as waiting for someone to finish what they're doing. For example, a teacher is waiting for the kids to be quiet. Even though the kids won't settle down and she's getting angry, she still shows patience. Instead of kicking the kids out of class, she gives them chance after chance because she wants them to behave well and stay in class. This shows that patience involves self - restraint and a positive intention towards others.
1219	19184	7	2	I know someone who is far more patient than I am, and that person is my sister. She is the most patient person I've ever met, while I have very little patience. When we're about to go somewhere, my sister just sits calmly. In contrast, I'm always asking if we can leave. My sister's consistent patience is the reason I believe she is so patient. It makes me realize how much I need to learn from her.
1220	19185	7	2	On a rainy afternoon of @DATE1, my little brother's friend's mom called and asked me to babysit. She and my mom were going out and wouldn't be back until 9 p.m., so I was needed at their place. My mom drove me there and dropped me off at 7 p.m. After a quick briefing on what to do in case of an emergency, they left. I then played with the kids. We wrestled, watched TV, ran around, and talked. They often tackled me, and I lifted them upside down. At 8:30 p.m., I put them to bed, covered them up twice, and they brushed their teeth. After they were in bed, I went downstairs twice to read my book. I really needed a lot of patience as I was a bit worried because I thought my mom might forget to pick me up. In the end, it was a test of my patience, but I managed to take care of the kids well.
1221	19186	7	2	Everyone experiences moments in life when they must be patient. For me, that moment came when I was helping my brother learn to tie his shoes. Although it may seem like a simple task, it was quite challenging. My brother attempted to tie his shoes repeatedly but couldn't succeed. I then asked him to bring one of his shoes, and I began to teach him. At first, I thought it would only take about five minutes, but he struggled to make the bunny ears. We kept trying. He would almost tie the knot, get excited, and pull the laces so hard that they would fall to the floor. I really wanted to give up and let him wear shoes with straps, but he was determined to learn. After about an hour of practice, he finally managed to tie his shoes. They weren't perfect, but they stayed tied. I praised him and started walking towards the kitchen. Then he asked about the double knot. I walked back and explained how to cross the two bunny ears and loop around, but he didn't understand. I demonstrated it countless times, yet he still couldn't get it. After spending about half an hour on the double knot, I went to the kitchen to get a juice box. When I returned, my brother had a big smile on his face and proudly held up his shoe. This experience taught me the importance of patience when helping others learn new skills.
1222	19187	7	2	There was a time when I had to be extremely patient while working on a project about birds. The project required creating a life - size scale model. Every day, I had to glue parts onto the model, but the glue took @NUM1 hours to dry. I ended up redoing the work three times, which turned what was supposed to be a seven - day project into a @NUM2 - day one. I worked harder than @ORGANIZATION1, but I kept breaking my well - crafted creation. The wings would often break, and I patiently glued them back on. Eventually, I completed the project, although it took much longer than I had anticipated. Through this project, I learned that patience, carefulness, and a steady hand are essential for achieving success.
1223	19188	7	2	"One time, I showed patience when my mom and I decided to make cookies. We prepared all the cookie dough, and even though they weren't cooked yet, they looked delicious. Mom told me to put them in the oven for @NUM1 minutes. I really didn't want to wait that long. As the cookies started to take shape, becoming big, dark brown, round, and soft, my mouth watered. I wanted to eat them right away. When the timer buzzed, I rushed over, grabbed a hot pad, and was about to take them out of the oven. But just then, Mom said, ""They need to cool down."" She set the timer for another @NUM2 minutes. I thought I couldn't possibly wait that long. The smell of the cookies made my mouth water even more. I was so eager to eat them that every minute felt like an hour. Finally, when the timer buzzed again, I sprinted over, grabbed a plate, and put @NUM3 of the biggest cookies on it. I burned my hand in the process, but I didn't care. I took a bite, and it was worth all the waiting. This experience proved that patience pays off, especially when it comes to delicious treats."
1224	19189	7	2	At school, one has to be patient. By the end of the day, it can be really hard to keep one's patience. Throughout the day, you have to tolerate various situations. Most of the day can be fun, and if you just go with the flow, you can stay calm and patient. For me, I have to be patient when it comes to lunch and using the bathroom. Every day, I have to wait when others go to the bathroom while I'm in need. Also, when I start to get hungry, I have to wait for lunch. After lunch, I have to be patient for gym class. I have to be patient every day of the week and tolerate all these things on a weekly basis. In conclusion, patience is an important virtue that helps us get through the daily routine at school.
1225	19190	7	2	"One time I showed patience was on @DATE1 in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. When we pulled up to the ticket booth, the man in the booth asked for our tickets. Then we drove to get a parking spot. After getting out of the car, we ran towards the gates. But then, @CAPS8's sister forgot her towel. So I ran back to the truck to get it. After that, we changed into our bathing suits and headed for the water. The first ride I chose was the "" @CAPS6 of @CAPS7!"" Let me tell you, it was very scary. I asked if anyone wanted to go with me, and @CAPS8's dad and @CAPS8's mom's friend from work agreed. We got in the line, which had about @NUM2 to @NUM3 people. The wait was around @NUM4 hours, but I didn't complain at all. Then we heard a terrifying scream from the ride. A man, a woman, and @NUM4 young kids were ejected into the pool. We took their tube and went up the stairs. At the top, there was a huge opening where we could see the @NUM6 - foot dropoff and the bright pink and yellow funnel. About @NUM7 minutes later, we reached the port to get on the tube. We started going down. @CAPS8's mom's friend (@PERSON1) went down backwards. I thought it was cool. As we went down, we free - fell at about @NUM8 mph. It was really scary. When we got out, I fell into the pool and then got out. I saw @CAPS8's mom and her two sisters. They laughed at @PERSON1 because she was crying and said she didn't feel well. So she went to the truck to take a nap. I spent the rest of the @TIME1 riding other rides. This was a time when I showed great patience, and it made the whole experience more enjoyable."
1226	19191	7	2	I went to the mall with my mother to buy some clothes. The mall was extremely crowded. It was difficult for anyone to move around, but I remained patient. As I was waiting, a white family passed by and bumped into me. Despite this, I held my temper. I was on the verge of losing my patience, but finally, it was our turn. I was really proud of myself for staying calm throughout the ordeal. This was a time when I demonstrated patience.
1227	19192	7	2	A mother bird laid several beautiful, blue, and perfect eggs. As days passed, the eggs did not hatch, and the mother bird grew upset. She discussed the situation with the father bird, who advised her to be patient. Weeks went by, and the mother bird became increasingly frustrated. Once again, the father bird encouraged her to remain patient. To distract herself, the mother bird engaged in various activities such as twiddling her wings, shopping, cooking, and cleaning. However, she couldn't stop thinking about the eggs. Months turned into years, decades, centuries, and even millennia, but the mother bird stayed patient. Finally, one day, the eggs cracked, and she was overjoyed. Almost immediately, the two oldest birds took flight. The third bird asked if it could fly too, and the mother bird told it to be patient. This shows that patience can lead to rewarding outcomes.
1228	19193	7	2	I was extremely excited to get my first iPad. However, there was a very long line at the store. My mom kept telling me to be patient, and I stood there quietly. As we got closer to the front of the line, I could hardly contain my excitement. When we finally reached the front, my dad asked me what kind of iPad I wanted. I told him I wanted the big one. We got the iPad and loaded it with a lot of cool songs. After that, we went home, and I listened to the music on it all day. My mom told me to stop listening to the music, so I put the iPad down for about three hours. Then it was time for dinner. After dinner, we went for a car ride in my dad's new car. When we got back home, I put away the things I had bought from the store, watched TV, and ate some popcorn. Then it was time for bed. This was a time when I had to be patient, and it was all worth it in the end.
1229	19194	7	2	"I was on my way to a destination with a friend, her mom, dad, and brother. We were driving to the place, and it took us three hours to get there. My friend and I were very excited and patiently waited during the journey. When we arrived, we queued up to ride a number of roller - coasters. We waited in line for about two hours for each ride as it was extremely busy that day. My friend and I were eager to ride the tallest roller - coaster called the ""Thunderbolt"". It was the tallest one I had ever seen, standing at 300 feet. To get on this ride, we had to wait for an hour. It was exciting but required a great deal of patience. However, when we finally reached the front of the line, the experience was truly worth the long wait. This was a memorable time when I demonstrated patience."
1230	19195	7	2	"I said, ""Ok, cool, grandma, thanks."" Grandma replied, ""You're welcome."" I asked, ""When will they be here?"" She said, ""I don't know."" I was talking about the shoes I ordered online called ""Air Blasters"". I was going crazy waiting for them. I waited for five days and asked my mom every day if they had arrived, but they hadn't. I started getting angry. To take my mind off it, I rode my bike. I saw a FedEx truck and thought it was coming to my house with my shoes, so I raced home and waited, but there were no shoes. The next day, I checked online and found out the shoes were in Grand Rapids, MI. I was so excited as it meant they were on the way. I kept waiting, and then my mom decided we should go somewhere. As I got in the car, I thought I heard the truck, but it wasn't. When we got back home, I looked to the left, and there they were, in a rough brown box on my front porch. I ran over, picked up the box, dashed inside, and tore it open. The shoes were amazing. I tried them on, and they fit perfectly. I thanked my grandma, and all my impatience disappeared. I felt incredibly happy. This experience taught me the value of patience."
1231	19196	7	2	I once had to exercise patience during a visit to Cedar Point in @LOCATION1. My @CAPS1, sister, and a friend spent the night there. My @CAPS1's stayed at the motorhome, while my @CAPS1, sister, and I spent the evening riding roller - coasters. After around six hours, my sister and I had been on all but @NUM1 or @NUM2 of the roller - coasters. My @CAPS1, being older, isn't fond of roller - coasters, so it was mainly my sister and me. After all the fun, my sister and @CAPS1 were going back to the motorhome, but I wanted to go on one more ride before leaving. I asked and got a yes. I told my @CAPS1 I'd be back in about half an hour. The roller - coaster was the second - biggest in the park. As I queued, it felt like the wait would never end. I have @CAPS2, so it was extremely hard for me to stand still. However, I managed to control myself and finally got on the ride. The ride was truly amazing, and all the waiting was worth it.
1232	19197	7	2	I was head - over - heels in love with @PERSON1! Middle school is definitely the time when you have to be the most patient. Seconds seem like hours, and classes feel like they last for centuries. Social studies is an exception; it's the only class I share with @PERSON1, and I sit behind him, admiring his perfect head. On @DATE2, there's the girls' choice dance, and I was determined to go with @PERSON1. In social studies, I wrote him a note that said, “@PERSON1, I really like you and was wondering if you wanted to go to the girls' choice dance with me? From @ORGANIZATION1.” I was too scared to give it to him directly, so I came up with a plan. I told @LOCATION1, who told @PERSON2 to tell @PERSON3 (a friend of @PERSON1) to tell @CAPS2 (a closer friend of @PERSON1) to tell @PERSON1 that I liked him. Rumors spread quickly in middle school, and @PERSON1 found out before @PERSON2 could relay the message. On @DATE1, during social studies, I reminded myself to be patient. The bell rang before I could give him the note. I waited patiently until the right moment and then leaned over to hand him the note. I waited and waited for a reply. Today is @DATE2, and the dance is tonight. There's a note taped to my locker, which is four doorways down from @PERSON1's. It says, “Give me your phone number and I'll call you for the @NUM1.” Boys are so confusing! I gave him my number and waited by the phone. It felt like hours as I willed the phone to ring. I almost gave up, but then a surge of determination kept me going. When the phone finally rang, I thought I was imagining it. When I answered, all my patience paid off! He simply said, “Yes!”
1233	19198	7	2	Have you ever wanted something done, only to be told by your parents to “be patient”? Recently, I've had to be patient. My family got a new microwave that was too big for our counter, so we had to place it above the stove. But there wasn't enough space, so my parents decided to remodel the whole kitchen. My step - mom emptied the kitchen and spread everything in the dining room. Now, it's so cluttered that we can barely walk in there. Lately, we've been eating in the living room. I really don't like it; it just seems so unhygienic. However, we also have the option to eat outside on the porch, which is a plus. I don't know how much longer I can endure this. But I've got to be patient. Finally, my dad made a new shelf, installed the new microwave, finished painting, and put the stove back. After that, my step - mom put all our seasonings and other items away, and now we're back to normal. Being patient really pays off. So, always remember to be patient.
1234	19199	7	2	It was a lovely, warm, and sunny @DATE1. We decided to pick everyone up from my dad's house and go to the Genesee County Farm. We reached my dad's place and picked up my step - brother, step - sister, real brother, step - mom, and dad. Then we headed to the farm. Once there, we started walking around, worried that it might rain. A downpour would mean our money would be wasted. We went to the ticket booth to ask if we could come back the next day with the same wristbands if it rained. They said no, so we decided to wait a bit longer. Then, it started pouring. We had to take shelter in a metal barn. Meanwhile, the barn started flooding. We also received phone calls saying that tornados had hit a few miles away. Eventually, the rain stopped, and we went outside. We waited for the rides to resume. Just as they started, the rain came back. So, we all ran to the car, completely soaked. We decided to abandon the fair and do something else. Instead, we all went out and had food at Taco Bell and Burger Tong. In the end, although our fair plan didn't work out, we still found an alternative way to enjoy the day.
1235	19200	7	2	One day, my grandfather and I went fishing. My grandfather always emphasizes the importance of waiting. When we reached our fishing spot, I told him I wanted to catch a turtle. He said it would take forever and advised me to catch some fish instead. I was firm in my decision to catch a turtle. When something pulled at my fishing rod, I tried to reel it in, and it turned out to be a small white bass. The next pull was from a big white bass. I got frustrated because no turtles were biting my line. The next tug was from a @NUM1 - inch white bass, the biggest fish I'd ever caught, but still not a turtle. After catching it, I decided to take a break. I was eating a sandwich while my grandpa was having fun catching fish. Just as I finished my sandwich, my fishing rod started pulling. I quickly grabbed it and reeled in my catch. To my delight, it wasn't a fish but a baby turtle. This experience taught me that patience truly pays off when you have a specific goal in mind.
1236	19201	7	2	"In @CAPS1 middle school, within @PERSON2's unkempt and muddy science classroom, two boys, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, were tidying up the mess created by @CAPS7 during their earlier mud - ball fight. For several years, @PERSON2 had been attempting to be patient with the twins, constantly trying to find a way to calm them down. Although @CAPS7 did possess @CAPS4, it often tested @PERSON2's patience. Frequently, @PERSON2 wondered what went through their minds when they got angry. When teaching them science, @CAPS7 seemed to have difficulty understanding. Moreover, when they did something wrong, they were unaware of it. In @PERSON2's class, @CAPS7 made only minimal progress, understanding very little. However, as the principal, @PERSON1, had said, ""Be patient; @CAPS7 will learn eventually."" As the months went by, @PERSON1 increasingly believed her husband's advice. By remaining patient and not getting angry at @CAPS7 when they erred, their grades began to improve. By the end of the year, @CAPS3 and @CAPS2 had become @CAPS11 - plus students and had passed @PERSON1's class. On the last day of school, @PERSON1 visited her husband's office and told him that his advice had worked and that he was an excellent principal. @PERSON3 simply replied, ""Thank you so!"
1237	19202	7	2	I'm generally patient, though I really dislike it. When I was @NUM1 years old, there was no school due to heavy snow. My mom had to attend an out - of - town meeting, so she took me to my dad's place. She forgot that he had to work on @DATE1 from @NUM2 am to @NUM3 pm. It was too late to turn back, so I went to work with him. My dad was and still is the manager of Autozone. I stayed in a small office that hadn't changed even after @NUM4 years. I knew I had to be extremely patient. My mom brought a doodle thing for me to draw, but it only kept me busy for an hour. After that, I just wandered around aimlessly. Then I found @NUM5 employees doing inventory. They had carts with a top and a bottom surface. I clung to the bottom surface, and they pushed me around the store without realizing it. I did this for about @NUM5 hours, but I still had nearly @NUM1 hours to kill. I found an old coloring book in the girls' bathroom. Nowadays, I wouldn't have touched it, but I was only @NUM1 then. I don't clearly remember what I did after that, but I know it was incredibly boring. This experience makes me wonder if patience can ever be fun.
1238	19203	7	2	"Being patient is extremely difficult. I was at the store with my mom, and she took forever to shop. I said, ""Come on, mom, let's go. Do we really need this stuff?"" But she just continued shopping. I was so angry that I almost threw a tantrum. Finally, we got in line. When we got in the car, my mom said, ""Give me your phone."" I asked, ""Why?"" She replied that my behavior in the store was horrible. From that experience, I realized that I should always be patient with my mom."
1239	19204	7	2	"Every year, I visit my dad who lives in @LOCATION1. We always stop at the border, which takes an incredibly long time, @CAPS1! So my family has to be patient. One time on our way to @LOCATION1, the border was extremely crowded. With four kids in the family, there was a high chance of arguments if we weren't patient. After an hour, everyone's patience was wearing thin. My dad kept repeating, ""Keep patient, keep patient."" Finally, we passed the border, and everyone cheered. Clearly, being patient is not easy, and we all need to learn more about how to maintain it."
1240	19205	7	2	Are you a patient person? I'm not, though I can be patient if I have to, but I won't enjoy it. A few years ago, my family got a Gordon Setter puppy. Since they're rare in @LOCATION1, we had to travel outside @LOCATION2 to get her. A couple of years later, we bred her, and she had seven incredibly cute puppies. Within weeks, the puppies were crawling and barking. My dog had a hard time dealing with their annoyance, but she endured. Two of the puppies were particularly troublesome. It took a great deal of patience to handle them. One would jump into the pond and swim across the deep end, and the other would climb chain - link fences. We watched them closely, @NUM1! They would bark if we got them out of the water or off the fence. The fence - climbing puppy left our home first, and I was very sad. When only two puppies, the water - loving one and his sister, were left, they ran around the house like crazy. My brother and I had to be patient with them. Then, suddenly, they turned into sweet little puppies. I didn't want to part with them, but we had to. This experience with our puppies taught me that patience always pays off, no matter how challenging the task.
1241	19206	7	2	The bell finally rang, signaling the start of lunch. It seemed as if the math class would never end. I rushed straight to the lunch area without stopping at my locker. When I arrived, there was a long line for lunch that appeared to stretch for a considerable distance. I knew I had to be patient, so I joined the lengthy line and waited. Each minute felt like an eternity, but I understood it was a busy lunchtime, so I continued to wait. After several minutes, I was close to the front of the line. Suddenly, seven girls cut in front of the line because their friend let them. Although this made me angry, I didn't complain and remained patient. Soon, I got my lunch. In conclusion, that was a time when I demonstrated patience by being understanding and not complaining.
1242	19207	7	2	"During the break between fourth and fifth grade, my family and I went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. Most of the rides had lines, but none were as long as the line for the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The line was extremely long. As my brothers, their best friend, and I approached the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I thought I would never get on. My dad told me to just wait, but I didn't see the point. When I got about halfway through the line, one of the employees shouted, ""@NUM1 more minutes!"" and I became more excited. Eventually, I reached the front of the line. All I had to do was wait for the current ride to end. But then, the speaker announced, ""All rides must stop until told to continue. A thunderstorm has rolled in, and we must stop for safety reasons."" I briefly considered leaving, but I had a feeling I shouldn't. I talked with some other kids I met in line and played games like rock - paper - scissors while waiting under the pavilion above the line. Once the storm passed, they allowed us on the ride. It was an exhilarating experience! I felt the wind in my hair, a small mist from the rain, and received a thank - you from my dad for keeping us in line. In the end, it was worth the wait."
1243	19208	7	2	The time I showed patience was when I was getting my dog. I went to a jazz festival with my mom, my sister, and her friend. As we were walking past a last - chance rescue, we decided to go and see the puppies. My mom initially didn't want another dog, but when she saw our future dog, Boxter, she changed her mind. Boxter has grey fur with some black spots and a black line running down his forehead. He is a grown short - hair blue healer mix. We asked the lady if we could get him, and she said they were going to a sports event and we could buy him there. We got in the car and went there. We signed the forms and played with him in the store. Then we walked downtown with him on the leash, got some ice cream, and went home. In conclusion, despite the initial hesitation from my mom and the process of getting the dog, my patience paid off as I now have a wonderful pet.
1244	19209	7	2	A time when I demonstrated patience was when I had pink eye. My family was on vacation in @CAPS1. The first night we arrived, my eye started to itch and turned red. The next morning, we decided to take me to a doctor's office, but since there wasn't one nearby, we found an urgent care. We went there and waited in the waiting room. Finally, the nurse called our name, @ORGANIZATION1, and we went into the room. We told her we needed eye drops for me. She said she'd be right back. My mom and I waited and waited. An hour passed, and we were still waiting. I was getting very impatient. Finally, she returned and said she was dealing with another patient and that the doctor would be in soon. We waited again, and two more hours went by. Eventually, the doctor came and said he'd bring my prescription, and he did come back quickly. Then my family and I left to go back to the hotel to gather our stuff and head to the campground. In total, it was a waste of @NUM1 hours of my vacation. However, I remained patient throughout this frustrating experience.
1245	19210	7	2	"I recall a time when I was patient. It was at my cousin's house, and it was incredibly boring. I was also sad and lonely at that time. Not long ago, I was at my cousin's place. There weren't enough four - wheelers for everyone, so I was the only one left out. I felt so lonely and couldn't believe how bored I was. All I could do was watch with envy as everyone else had a great time. They were screaming with joy and laughing until they cried. Then my dad found a four - wheeler for me. I forced a smile to seem like I was having fun. When he asked if I wanted to go, I said yes! I hopped on the four - wheeler without hesitation. I thanked my dad and took off. I couldn't imagine how much fun it would be. I felt the breeze on my face and my shirt flapping on my back. It was amazing. I shouted, ""I wish this day would never end!"" I had a lot of fun that day, more than I'd ever had in my life. Even though I was bored at the start, it was definitely worth it in the end. This was a clear example of how patience can lead to great experiences."
1246	19211	7	2	"Nana! Nana! Nana! Nana! @PERSON3 is injured!"" I shouted. ""@CAPS1? How?"" Nana inquired. ""@CAPS2 is bleeding near the highway at the corner, and @PERSON1 is with him,"" @CAPS3 responded. ""Papa! Call @PERSON4 @CAPS4!"" Nana urged. ""@CAPS5, get @PERSON1 and come inside!"" Nana commanded. ""@LOCATION1, @CAPS6, we @CAPS7 leo!"" @LOCATION1, @CAPS6, Nana, and Popous carried @PERSON3 (a horse) to the carport and examined him. After hours of trying to keep him warm, @PERSON4 arrived. They placed @PERSON3 on a table and began to bandage his wounds. They attempted to make him stand up, but he wouldn't. @PERSON1 and I waited in the house, hoping that @PERSON3 would survive. @PERSON1 decided to assist with her horse. They carried the table with @PERSON3 on it to @CAPS8's mom. @PERSON1 was behind @CAPS8 when she set the table down, and @CAPS8 kicked @PERSON1 towards a tree. The next day, @PERSON2 and I were setting up a tent in the backyard so the horses could cool off. Nana called the vet to see what could be done. They received a response @NUM1 minutes later, stating that they would stitch him up and see what else they could do. They stitched him for three hours and advised us to monitor him for any wounds reopening. They also said they would check on him on @DATE2. When @DATE2 arrived, they took him to the stables and cared for him. Eventually, @PERSON3 got better. This is how I demonstrated patience on @DATE1."
1247	19212	7	2	"There have been numerous instances in my life when I've shown patience, but I believe this particular one will intrigue you the most. Finally, we were able to visit @CAPS1, a large indoor water park in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. I had been longing to go there for years. When we arrived, my first thought was that it was paradise. Little did I know that there were the longest queues I'd ever seen. The lines weren't just for the rides; they were for everything. After two days of fun, it was already our last day at @CAPS1. I wanted to ride all the attractions one more time. My mom told me to put on my swimsuit so we could go to the park, and I did. When we reached the park, the shortest line I saw was probably about an hour long. I was extremely disappointed as I only managed to go on about @NUM1 rides. However, I knew it was time to leave ""paradise."" We left around @NUM2, thinking we'd be home by about @NUM3. On our way back, I was so bored that it felt like @NUM4 had passed, but in reality, only an hour had gone by. It took us a long time to get home because it was snowing heavily. I asked my mom when we'd arrive, and she told me to be patient. So, I endured it. ""We're home!"" I exclaimed as I ran inside. In my mind, I thought it was the longest journey ever. I looked at the clock, and it was @NUM5, @NUM6 later than we'd anticipated. But I had to go to bed right away (no video games). This was a time when I showed patience."
1248	19213	7	2	I firmly believe that patience is a valuable trait in an individual. Being patient is essential as it allows one to wait without becoming angry or frustrated. For example, in a situation where many people are waiting in line, a patient person would wait calmly, while an impatient person might leave the line. Patient individuals are often well - regarded. Impatient people, on the other hand, get angry quickly and struggle to wait. They may act rudely while waiting, which is not a pleasant behavior. In conclusion, patience is a crucial quality in life.
1249	19214	7	2	I've been patient on many occasions, but currently, my friends and I are saving up to meet @PERSON1! It requires a great deal of patience because a single ticket costs @MONEY1. Just imagine how long one has to wait to save that much money! It's incredibly difficult to be patient, especially when you're going to meet a celebrity you have a huge crush on. I've shown a lot of patience during this money - saving process. No matter how tough it gets, I can persevere with patience. My friends and I have been and still are being patient. Could you stay patient if you were going to meet your favorite celebrity? It's not easy. First, it takes patience to do chores, take care of animals, and keep track of your savings. And when people borrow your money, it really sets you back. But as I said, no matter what, we're going to save up @MONEY1 to meet him, and we'll be patient throughout the saving process. It's a lot of fun as you learn valuable lessons and discover how to become more patient. Overall, patience is ubiquitous, and we use it in many aspects of life.
1250	19215	7	2	"I had a friend who is @CAPS4's best friend. We met in @NUM1 grade, and in @NUM2 grade, she said she had to move to @LOCATION1. After she moved, she would call me about twice a week. I would always answer and talk to her for around three hours. I'll always remember her. One day, she called, and I was a bit busy because there were people at our house. One of @CAPS4's mom's friends called me, and I told @CAPS1 (her best friend) to hold on. I left the phone on @CAPS4's bed while she was still on the line. I went to the living room, and @CAPS4's mom's friend asked me to get her a glass of water. @CAPS4's mom's five other friends made the same request. I went to get them water. Then, @CAPS4's mom told me to take out the trash. I had her waiting for about @NUM4 minutes. After taking out the trash, @CAPS4's best friend asked me to stay outside and play with her for a while, and I completely forgot about the friend on the phone. I stayed outside for about @NUM5 minutes and then said I had to go inside. I came in and sat on the sofa. @CAPS4's mom's friends were talking, and I joined them, talking, laughing, playing, and watching TV. After two and a half hours, while watching TV, I asked myself what I was forgetting. I knew I'd forgotten something but couldn't figure out what. I got up and walked around the house, asking myself what I'd forgotten. When I reached the room where I'd been talking to @CAPS1, I saw the phone on the bed. I picked it up and said, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS1, I forgot about her."" I said hello, not really expecting her to still be there, but she was. She told me I'd kept her waiting for a very long time. I told her she was so patient, and I'd never wait that long. She said, ""Come on, you're @CAPS4's best friend. I'd wait forever for you."" Then we continued our conversation."
1251	19216	7	2	Have you ever struggled to be patient? I find it incredibly difficult. I'm usually impatient because I prefer to have things done immediately and dislike waiting. However, I can be patient when waiting for short periods. I tend to rush, not in my work but in social situations. Patience means waiting without complaining. For instance, if a party is at @TIME1 and it's only @NUM1, you have to wait a long time, and the time seems to pass slowly. Patience is an important quality, which is why I'm working hard to be more patient, and you should too.
1252	19217	7	2	Last year, on @DATE1, which was my birthday, I told my @CAPS1 what I wanted for my @DATE3. Out of all the things I mentioned, I specifically said, “@CAPS1, I want a @CAPS2” (a @CAPS3 station @CAPS4). On @DATE2, we left at three in the morning to go to Best Buy to get my @ORGANIZATION1. When we arrived at the store and opened the door, there were over @DATE4 people inside. We walked over to the game section. There were two copies of the game, and five people were in the section, so we grabbed one of the two. But when we got in line, half of the people in the store were already waiting. We waited in that long line for what felt like hours to reach the front. We finally got home at @TIME1. This story isn't about what I wanted; it's about patience. I was patient for two and a half hours while waiting to buy my @CAPS2. No matter where you go, using patience will make you more considerate and likely to be treated better than you expect.
1253	19219	7	2	One day, my dad and I decided to go fishing. He kept saying, “Five more minutes,” so I sat in the car. Eventually, I got out and found him asleep with a note saying @NUM1 more minutes. This experience shows how patience can be tested even in simple situations. Sometimes, we have to wait for others, and it's important to remain patient during those times.
1254	19220	7	2	A time when I demonstrated patience was when I was at home babysitting my baby brother for my mom so she could go grocery shopping. My brother was crying because he was sleepy and hungry. I put him to bed and had to be patient because he was a baby and my mom was gone for a long time. She also had to do other things like shop for clothes, @CAPS1, and shoes. When my brother woke up, he was crying, and I couldn't stop him. But when my mom came back, he stopped crying and started laughing. This was a time when I had to be patient, and it shows that patience can lead to positive outcomes.
1255	19221	7	2	When I went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I was in @CAPS4. The @CAPS4 was very @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7. The situation tested my patience as it was not @CAPS8 @CAPS9 for me. I stood in line behind everyone and managed to get a front - row seat on the @CAPS13. This experience taught me the value of patience in getting what I wanted.
1256	19222	7	2	I once knew someone who displayed extraordinary patience. He was tasked with a single challenge: teaching me to swim. When I was quite young, I nearly drowned at a hotel pool. That harrowing experience instilled in me a deep - seated fear of swimming.  My patient friend decided to help me overcome this fear at the pool in his trailer park. The main hurdle he faced was getting me into the deep end of the pool. He wanted me to venture there, but I was terrified of drowning. First, he simply told me to jump in, but he soon realized that I wouldn't take such a leap out of fear.  Eventually, he managed to get me into the deep - end water. However, all I could do was cling to the edge, too scared to let go and swim. Frustrated, I got out of the pool. Despite his growing annoyance, my friend remained patient and continued to work with me.  After what felt like an eternity, he pretended to give up. I then promised that if he stayed, I'd go into the deep end. True to my word, I jumped in and discovered that it wasn't as bad as I'd imagined. Now, I've developed a love for swimming, especially in the deep ends. My friend's perseverance and patience paid off for both of us.
1257	19223	7	2	"On the @DATE1, I, @PERSON1, applied for @ORGANIZATION1. I submitted my application in @DATE2 and eagerly awaited a letter from @ORGANIZATION2 addressed to @CAPS1 @PERSON1. From the start of the @DATE1, I made it a daily ritual to check the mailbox.  Each day, as I rushed down the driveway, I hoped that this would be the day the long - awaited letter would arrive. As @NUM1 of the @DATE1 passed without any sign of the letter, anxiety began to set in. It was akin to waiting for the pivotal moment in a movie when the main character is about to take action.  @CAPS4, the first @DATE3 in @DATE4, found me having lunch. I thought to myself that ""@CAPS2 must be the day."" When I heard the mail truck approaching our mailbox, I dashed for the door. The mail lady, who saw me every day and witnessed my smile fade when the letter wasn't there, looked at me and said, ""@CAPS4 is that day.""  Patience is a virtue that is difficult to cultivate, but during the @DATE1, I had my fair share of it. In the end, the wait was part of the experience that tested and strengthened my patience."
1258	19224	7	2	There was a time when I really wanted a game called X - Men @CAPS3 Wolverine. My mom told me I had to wait until @CAPS1. I understood her reasoning; we were a bit short on cash at that time, and we needed to make our money last.  After a few weeks, I completely forgot about the game. Then, on @CAPS1 day, my sister and I rushed downstairs. As we were unwrapping gifts, I noticed one with my name on it. I grabbed it and opened it. To my delight, it was the X - Men @CAPS3 @CAPS4 game, along with two other games I'd been wanting.  I went up to my room, grabbed my @CAPS5 and headphones, popped in the X - Men @CAPS3 game, and played it all day long. This experience taught me that patience can be rewarded. Sometimes, waiting for something we desire can make the moment of receiving it even more special.
1259	19225	7	2	One day, I asked my mother if I could go skate. She told me to be patient, and I waited until she gave me the okay. However, after waiting, I got mad because she then had to go get money for my sister.  Another time, my sister Haven and I wanted to go to the movies with our friends. We had to be patient for a whole hour because we had to wait for mom to get off work so she could give Haven @MONEY1 and me @CAPS1 @MONEY1.  These experiences show that patience is essential. If you're not patient, you may not get what you want. In life, there are often situations where waiting is necessary, and learning to be patient can lead to more positive outcomes.
1260	19226	7	2	My friend and I went to @ORGANIZATION1, which was extremely busy. While we didn't have to wait long initially, when it came to @CAPS1 ride, we had to wait a long time to get on. My friend showed remarkable patience, but I did not. I constantly complained about the long wait.  Finally, we got on the ride and had a great time. Although the waiting was dreadful, it was worth it because the ride was the @ORGANIZATION2. In my opinion, it's the best ride in the world. This experience taught me that sometimes, enduring a long wait can lead to a rewarding and enjoyable experience, and it's important to try and be patient even when things seem to take forever.
1261	19227	7	2	Writing about a time when I was patient is challenging for me as I am generally an impatient person, but I will give it a try. Three days before the trip to Cedar Point, I was extremely eager for it to arrive. I attempted to make time pass more quickly, yet my efforts were in vain. I had been out of school for @NUM1 weeks and had already done everything I wanted. Whenever I go to Cedar Point with my mom, sister, and friends, we always have a great deal of fun. Since I learned about the trip, every night I would sit and think. While many kids would complain to their moms about the slow - approaching time, I never did. I knew that no one could make time go faster. So, I waited patiently, did my chores, packed my things, and watched TV. It was an excruciatingly long and boring period, and I really wanted to complain, but I refrained. Every time I felt impatient, I took a deep breath and told myself that it was just a short wait compared to other things. I also reminded myself how lucky I was to be going to Cedar Point. I am aware that I am an impatient person and am trying to change that. This is what I did while waiting for the Cedar Point trip, and this is what patience means to me in my life. It was a time in my life when I managed to be patient.
1262	19228	7	2	I'm trying to be patient as I await the arrival of my baby cousin. She was adopted from California, so I've never seen her in person; I've only seen her in helpers and photos. I've heard her voice on the phone, and she sounds incredibly cute. I also miss my aunt and uncle, whom I haven't seen in @NUM1 years. Whether they arrive today or tomorrow is a surprise, but I'm still patiently waiting. This experience of waiting is teaching me the value of patience, and I hope that when they finally arrive, we'll have a wonderful time together.
1263	19229	7	2	It was a cool @DATE2 at @TIME3. As I entered my box blind, the sun was just rising. It had snowed the @TIME1, though it was only @DATE1. I was in the upper peninsula of @LOCATION1. I was on a hunt for a monster ten - point deer with my brand - new @NUM1 and @TIME2 gun, which could kill a deer at @NUM2 yards. I sat in the blind for an hour, but it felt like an eternity. All I saw was a squirrel, and while it was entertaining to watch, it didn't give me the thrill of seeing a deer. Suddenly, I heard the shouts of “@CAPS1, @CAPS1!” I turned in the direction of the sound. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1!” I raised my gun, and my adrenaline started to rush. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1!” I saw movement, put my scope on it, and to my surprise, it was a grouse. I lowered the gun, calmed myself, and watched it peck at some corn. It was @NUM3, time for lunch. All I had was a turkey sandwich, an apple, and a bottle of water. As I slowly ate my apple and looked around, I saw a brown figure move. With the apple in my mouth, I grabbed my gun. Picture me, with an apple in my mouth, looking through the scope. When I focused, I realized it was the big @NUM4. It had massive horns, a large body, and was probably five or six years old. I placed my crosshairs just behind its shoulder, switched off the safety, and slowly pulled the trigger. My mind was a blur, and then “@CAPS4!” It was a perfect shot. Later @TIME2, I found the deer, and it was big @NUM5. I had it mounted, and it remains there to this day as a reminder of that exciting hunting experience.
1264	19230	7	2	I showed patience when I waited in line for @NUM1 hours just to ride a certain attraction. Once I got on, it took off at @NUM2 miles per hour. I was firmly strapped in for five minutes, and then it descended at the same @NUM2 miles per hour. After getting off, I rode it again. When I tried the power - hour aspect, it was quite an experience. My overall impression was that it was fun. I came home at @TIME1. The next morning, I woke up and had breakfast. Throughout this whole day, I waited patiently, and it was all worth it because I had a great time at the amusement park.
1265	19231	7	2	The time when I demonstrated patience was when I was about @NUM1 years old, as I was in @NUM2 grade. I'm @NUM3 now, but let me get back to the story. In @NUM2 grade, I was standing in the lunch line. Some kids kept cutting in front of me just to get their lunch, but I simply stood there and remained patient. I didn't let their actions get to me. When we finally got to the food, everything was okay because I still got to eat. This experience taught me that patience can help us handle difficult situations gracefully, and even though I was being pushed around in the line, I was able to maintain my composure and still achieve my goal of having lunch.
1266	19232	7	2	One day, I waited for @CAPS1 @NUM1 to come out of GameStop. While waiting, I looked at the game signs and thought that @CAPS2 must be a good game. Instead of waiting there, I went home and played @ORGANIZATION1 football @NUM3 on my Xbox @NUM4. I got increasingly tired and eventually fell asleep on my pep - game chair until morning. My older brother woke up and suggested going to GameStop to get @CAPS1. We went and waited in a long line for about an hour and a half. When it was our turn, the game cost about @MONEY2. I had @MONEY3 and my brother had @MONEY1, but he didn't want to contribute. I offered to pay @MONEY3 and have him pay @MONEY1. We bought the game and played it until we beat it.
1267	19233	7	2	On my birthday, a time when patience was required, I wasn't focused on the party, cake, or ice cream. Instead, I was eager to get money from my presents. The first present had no money, but the second one did. I continued opening presents, hoping each would contain money, especially the last one which was a card. I couldn't wait to use the money to buy something. However, I had to wait nearly five whole months. It was extremely difficult, but it paid off. When I finally got the money, I was overjoyed as it was the best thing in the world. This shows that while being patient for a long time is hard, it is always worthwhile.
1268	19234	7	2	The ticking of the clock in my head seemed to urge every muscle in my body to run and search for my dad. But I stayed still, my eyes scanning the crowd. Finally, I saw him. I ran forward and gave him a big hug, and the ticking in my head stopped. I'm @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and I'll tell you about a time I was patient. After a two - week trip to @LOCATION1 with my friend, I was waiting at the airport for my dad to pick me up. I was so excited and homesick that it took all my self - control not to go looking for him. I knew I had to be patient. In the end, it was worth it because it would have been harder to find him if I had gone searching. I believe I was very patient when waiting for my dad at the airport. Thank you for listening.
1269	19236	7	2	"This is a story about a time I was patient. On the @NUM1 @DATE1, we were on a plane heading for a cruise. When we reached the ship, I was extremely excited, imagining the fun I'd have, what my room would look like, and all the new places I'd visit. Once on the dock, there was a line to get on the ship, and I patiently waited. Then, there was a line to check passports, and I waited again. Next, there was a line to get our room keys, and I patiently stood there until it was done. But there was yet another line. I stood there, listening to music on my iPod. Then my dad said, ""Ready?"" I thought it was for another line, but he meant to go to our room and relax. I was thrilled. Finally, we were done with the lines. I used the special key we'd waited in line for to open the door to my room. It was amazing, though the bathroom was a bit small. I was so happy to be free of the lines. This was a time when I showed patience."
1270	19237	7	2	One time, I decided to visit my friend who lived at the end of the street. As I walked there, I enjoyed the sight of the setting sun and young kids playing and laughing carelessly. A @CAPS1 boarder waved at me, but I didn't wave back as he seemed a bit strange. When I arrived, I knocked on the door. My friend answered about @NUM1 seconds later, greeting me with a kind smile. She said she had to finish her homework and eat. I nodded and went to wait in the park. I sat on a swing and swayed back and forth. An hour passed, and I still patiently sat there. As it was getting dark and I wasn't sure if she'd come out, I decided to go home. Just as I got up, she was outside. I told her it was late and I had to go home but could come back tomorrow. This was a time when I was patient.
1271	19238	7	2	One particular day, I demonstrated great patience when our flight got delayed. That day, we were headed to [LOCATION1]. Suddenly, the delay sign appeared on the screen. I was a bit sad but knew I had to be patient. Our flight was significantly delayed. While waiting, we engaged in various activities. First, we went to the food court to eat and decided on Chili's. We also had to wait for our food, but the nachos we got were delicious. Then, we went to the [CAPS6] [CAPS7]. At the [CAPS6] [CAPS7], I bought [NUM1] key - chains for my friends, [NUM2] magazines, a reading [CAPS10], and some [CAPS11] [CAPS12], which were all very good. Next, we took a short walk around the [CAPS13]. After that, we sat down and relaxed for a while. Then I fell asleep. When I woke up, we were about to board. I was extremely excited to finally reach [LOCATION1] and enjoy the [CAPS17] weather. I learned that patience truly matters. That was the time I was really patient.
1272	19239	7	2	Patience is an important skill to learn. There are three steps to being patient: being quiet, refraining from complaining, and waiting when necessary. One day, my mom, my step - dad [PERSON1], and I went hunting. We had to be quiet to attract a deer. We sat there in complete silence; it was the quietest I'd ever been. Everyone was getting tired of being quiet, but we knew a buck might come. It was very cold. Although I was dressed warmly, I still felt cold. There was a small heater in the shed where we were. We couldn't complain about the cold, tiredness, or the waiting. So we all sat there without a word. Just as I was about to ask if we could go, a ten - pointer emerged from the woods to look for food. We patiently waited for the deer to come closer. [PERSON1] loaded the gun and pulled the trigger. The buck jumped and ran off. It was a poor shot. We left the shed and searched for a blood trail. We had to wait a while, but it was worth it when we finally found the deer. The correct way to be patient is to keep quiet, not whine, and wait. Being patient is indeed a valuable skill to acquire.
1273	19240	7	2	Being patient is quite challenging for me, but one day I learned my lesson. On [DATE1], my mom woke me up at [NUM1] and said we had a lot to do. When we got in the car, I had no idea I'd have to be patient all day. First, on our way to the [ORGANIZATION1] market, we were stuck in a traffic jam for about [NUM2] minutes to an hour. When we finally reached the market, we had to stand in line for about [NUM3] minutes. I told my mom I wanted to leave, but she said I had to be patient and that being impatient was a bad thing. After leaving the market, we took my grandma to the doctor. It took almost two hours for them to call her name, and then another [NUM4] to get checked out. After that, we went shopping at a crowded and busy mall. We were there for about four hours, mostly standing in lines. Finally, we went home because it was time for my mom to start cooking. I realized that I need to work on being patient as it is an inevitable part of life.
1274	19241	7	2	"There are times in life when one has to be patient. Patience means being understanding and tolerant, and a patient person can face difficulties without complaining. One such time was when my mom took my friends and me to [CAPS1] [CAPS2]. I called many friends to invite them. Meanwhile, we packed some water bottles and got into the car. We were all looking out of the window, and one of my friends shouted, ""OMG! Look at those big roller - coasters."" When we arrived at [CAPS1] [CAPS2], the first ride I saw was the [CAPS3], the highest and fastest roller - coaster there, which only lasted [NUM1] seconds. We talked about it and decided to go on it. When we saw the huge line, we all exclaimed. I shouted, ""It's okay. I heard it's an awesome ride. Let's be patient."" We waited and waited until we were finally next in line. The ride started suddenly and ended in [NUM1] seconds. We waited about two hours, but it was worth it. In conclusion, I firmly believe that being patient is a good quality in life, even if it takes hours. I learned a lot from this experience at [LOCATION1]. We should all be patient because patience is always needed, no matter where we are."
1275	19242	7	2	"I recall a time when I was impatient at first. My mom called and said she'd send me [NUM1]$ on [DATE3]. It was [DATE4], which meant I had to wait [NUM2] days. The next day, when the mail truck came, I thought I had the money, but it wasn't [DATE3] yet. I said, ""[CAPS2]"". As [DATE1] passed, I was still waiting. I tried to pass the time. On [DATE2], my favorite game, ""The Bully"", was on sale. The case had a yellow sticker that said [NUM3] and no tax. I was mad and [CAPS4] went home. My dad woke me up and said it was [DATE3]. I got up, ate breakfast, and checked the mail. There were bills, bills, and then my money. At last, I had the money. I bought some ice - cream and my favorite game, ""Bully"". That was the time when I learned to be patient."
1276	19243	7	2	Patience is characterized by understanding and tolerance. To be part of a sports team, one must possess patience. This is because you may not always receive the pass or score a point, yet you remain an important team member, and your opportunity will arrive. An instance when I demonstrated patience was during a game on the court. Our Carmen - [PERSON1] girls' [CAPS1] team was competing against Flushing. A girl from Flushing was shooting free - throws. It seemed like she took an eternity. I was astounded that the shot clock didn't expire. I wondered what she was waiting for. I kept silent and stood patiently. Eventually, she took the shots but missed both. I was extremely proud of myself. I've just realized that throughout that time, I didn't show any reaction, utter a word, or have negative thoughts in my mind. I simply stood upright, minded my own business, and watched to see if the shot would go in. On the second shot, I assumed the box - out position: sitting down, hands out, and facing the basket. I was genuinely happy with myself and even complimented the girl on her shot. Being patient paid off. Firstly, I got the rebound, my teammate scored, and I received an assist. Secondly, I showed the opposing team the proper way to behave. No one is perfect, and one has to wait to see who will score the next point.
1277	19244	7	2	"It was my first game, and I was extremely excited and eager to enter the game. When the coach called ""big guy"", I quickly stood by his side. He then informed me that I'd be going in for the next play. However, the assistant coach said I wasn't allowed to. Throughout this, I didn't complain at all. I refrained from saying a single word to anyone and instead focused on helping others. Even though I was on the sidelines the whole time and never got to play, I still found the experience enjoyable. I didn't want to ruin the mood for everyone else by complaining. I'll admit, I was angry, but at least I got some exercise just by standing there. I supported my teammates whole - heartedly. I encouraged them and offered help in any way I could. I listened to their complaints and provided support. I was so frustrated that I was ready to burst, but I held back. The coach's single word ""no"" stopped me from having my moment to shine. Nevertheless, I learned an important lesson from this experience, that patience in difficult situations can be rewarding in its own way."
1278	19245	7	2	When turkey hunting, one must be extremely still and quiet and possess a great deal of patience. Even the slightest muscle movement can cause all the turkeys to flee. Sometimes, hunters have to sit for hours waiting for the perfect shot. I recall a time when I was hunting with my dad. We sat under a tree for approximately three hours. Finally, a turkey appeared. Unfortunately, just as I was about to take a shot, my dad scared the turkeys away. However, I had the patience to stay there for another [NUM1] hours. This experience is a prime example of patience in hunting, showing that patience is a crucial virtue in the sport of turkey hunting.
1279	19246	7	2	Two years ago, one day I went to visit the [ORGANIZATION1] train. There was a [NUM1] - hour wait. When we reached the front of the line, we had to go back to the end because my mom forgot the tickets. So, we then had to wait 21/[NUM1] hours to reach the front again. Once we got there, the attendant told us that we could have just told him our names and he could have found our tickets online. My mom got really angry. But in the end, we got to go on the [ORGANIZATION1] train, and it was a lot of fun. That was the time I had to be patient for over [NUM3] hours in extreme heat. This experience taught me that patience can lead to enjoyable experiences despite initial setbacks.
1280	19247	7	2	In my view, patience means waiting for one's turn, while impatience is the failure to do so. Throughout our lives, we need to be patient because there are times when waiting is inevitable. I have patience, and I know many others who do too. I was taught that when doing something, one shouldn't rush, as it can lead to mistakes. But one also shouldn't be overly slow, or others may think you don't know what you're doing. It's best to work at your own pace to ensure the task is completed correctly and as you desire. People lacking patience often aren't consistently happy. Therefore, cultivating patience is essential for a more fulfilling life.
1281	19248	7	2	"Have you ever had to exercise patience? I have, and I'll share that experience with you. Last year, on my birthday, my uncle @CAPS1 promised me a phone, but I had to wait for him to get the money. So, I exercised patience and waited. @DATE2 arrived, and months passed, yet I hadn't heard from my uncle. I grew frustrated because he had made that promise. I told my mom, and she said he'd always been like that and that I should remain patient, suggesting it didn't matter if he was a bit late. I thought to myself, ""A bit late? It's almost been a year!"" Then, on @DATE1, my uncle came to our family reunion. He told me he knew I thought he'd forgotten about the phone. I knew he was right, but then it occurred to me that he couldn't have forgotten. Soon, it was time to eat, and that's when he presented the @CAPS2 touch phone to me. I was so excited that I jumped up and gave him a hug. He said that whenever he made a promise, he'd test my patience to see if the wait was worthwhile, and in this case, it was. So, when your patience is tested, stay calm; things will come to you in due time. In conclusion, patience is crucial because without it, you won't be able to wait for anything in life. The @CAPS3."
1282	19249	7	2	You'll find yourself getting bored quickly when hunting. Most people do because once you're in the woods, there's not much you can do other than watch and wait. If you make a single noise, you'll see nothing for the entire hunt. Hunting requires a great deal of patience, but the reward is well worth it when a doe, buck, or whatever you're targeting comes into your sight. I've had times when I was impatient and times when I was patient. When I was younger, I was quite impatient and would get up and walk around. But as I got older, I became more patient. For example, I got my first deer, an eight - point one. Hunting in @MONTH1 demands patience, but I enjoy it; it's a lot of fun. In summary, despite the challenge of patience, hunting remains an activity that offers great rewards and enjoyment.
1283	19250	7	2	One time, I had to be patient when I needed to do some @CAPS1 and my mom was using the computer. I told her I needed it for my @CAPS1, and she said she'd only be a few minutes. So, I decided to wait and watched an episode of SpongeBob. When the episode ended, I went back to the computer, but she still wasn't done. Then, I made some bagel bites, which are like pizza on a mini - bagel. I started eating them. I ate @NUM1... and so on until I reached @NUM2. I was getting full, but I was really hungry, so I kept eating until I was stuffed and decided to stop. I went to check if mom was done, but she wasn't. I went outside to play sports with my friends. We were out for about @NUM3 @CAPS2, got tired, and then we all went home. When I walked in, the computer was still in use. I took a bath because it's soothing. I spent a while in the bath as it was warm and relaxing. After getting out, I went upstairs to change. When I came downstairs, surprisingly, my mom was off the computer. But then she came in and said it was time for bed. So, I woke up early to do my @CAPS1. This whole experience required a great deal of patience as it was tough to wait for so long. In conclusion, patience is essential in such situations to achieve our goals.
1284	19251	7	2	One time, I had to be patient on a trip. Our family, including some relatives, was on our way to see a particular place. We were traveling in @NUM1 cars and vans. I was in the van @NUM2 and there were also @NUM3 people in another car. It was about a @NUM3 - hour drive. I was in the car with my mom and @NUM1 sister. We'd been on the road for about an hour. At first, I was fanning myself, and then I had a family conversation. But after about an hour, I became very impatient. All I could hear was my mom telling me to be patient and that we'd get there. I kept saying I wanted to be there @CAPS1. She said we had all day. Then we stopped to get something to eat, and finally, we reached our destination. This trip taught me that patience is necessary during long - distance travels.
1285	19253	7	2	One time, I had to exercise patience when we were driving to @CAPS1. We were in a minivan, and the passengers were my mom, dad, my @NUM1 - month - old baby sister, and my aunt. The journey in the van lasted about @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours. By the time we reached the hotel, it was @NUM4 o'clock @CAPS2 time, and in @LOCATION1, it was @NUM5 or @NUM6 am. I'm not a very patient person, so I was extremely tired of waiting. However, my mom was very proud of how well I handled the baby's crying and being stuck in one place for hours. It was a very difficult experience, but the end result was great. In conclusion, although patience was a struggle for me, it allowed me to have a successful trip and made my mom proud, showing that patience can lead to positive outcomes even in challenging situations.
1286	19254	7	2	"Patience is a virtue that I struggle to possess. I find waiting for anything, whether it's future events, mail, packages, or people, to be extremely difficult. I simply lack the effort required for patience and have never been a patient person. I also don't know many people who are truly patient. My mom claims to be patient, but in my opinion, she isn't. One of my least - favorite phrases is ""be patient."" It makes me tense up and frustrated when I'm impatient. When waiting to call someone, I'm tempted to call them countless times. I'm only patient when I force myself to be, which is rarely. Sometimes, I don't even realize I'll become impatient in just a few seconds, like when I'm done with a writing page but the time isn't up yet. In conclusion, patience remains an elusive quality for me."
1287	19255	7	2	When I was @NUM1 years old, my mom started making my @DATE1 present. She planned to make a blanket. Unfortunately, she couldn't find the materials for it. I had to be patient as the present wasn't finished. My @DATE1 was almost @NUM2 months ago. My mom struggled to find the time and the materials, which she hoped to locate by @NUM3. Every year on my @DATE1 and on @CAPS1, I ask if the blanket is finished, but I'm starting to lose my patience. I wonder if I can keep being patient for a little while longer. In the end, I'm still waiting and hoping that one day the blanket will be completed.
1288	19256	7	2	"One night, when I was fishing with my dad, I demonstrated great patience. It was a cold night, and no fish were biting. I sat there calmly, eating sunflower seeds and listening to the Celtics games. My dad was getting angry, but I remained patient. We only caught small fish that weren't worth eating or keeping. We left around one in the morning. It was pitch - black and cold when we went to put the boat on the trailer. I even had to get in the water to secure the boat. On the way home, about five miles from home, a trailer tire popped. I stayed patient, but my dad was not. We stopped to look at the tire, and since we didn't have a spare, we drove home on the rim. This was the most patient I've ever been. Regarding the writing sample, the author could have explained what a millennium is to make things clearer. Also, she should avoid starting most sentences with ""I"" to make it more engaging. In the third sentence, she used ""were"" instead of ""was."" Specifying if @TIME1 was a.m. or p.m. in the second paragraph would have made the story more understandable. If these issues were corrected, it would be a good sample."
1289	19257	7	2	One time I showed patience was when I was at a restaurant. I ordered my drink, and Mike was the first to get served. When our food was supposed to arrive, they said it would take about five more minutes. Fifteen minutes later, the server came back with the wrong food, and I started to lose my patience. But then I relaxed. Finally, she brought the right meal, and I was really happy because I was extremely hungry. I ate it very quickly. Due to the mix - up with my meal, they gave me a free discount. My mom also bought me something from a store because of my great patience. This experience showed me that being patient can have its rewards.
1290	19258	7	2	"Me and my cousins were extremely excited to go to @CAPS1. After eating, we headed for the skyline ride. The skyline offered a great view of Cedar Point. My sisters were also excited, saying things like ""I'm so excited"" and ""Yeah, me too!"" As we walked towards the ride, it took a long time. When we saw the long line, my sister complained that it would take ages. I was surprised when my @NUM1 - year - old cousin made some comments. She said, ""Wow, it looks really high."" My younger sister reassured us, saying, ""@CAPS2ít, worry. We have @CAPS3 with us. She'll take care of us."" Finally, it was our turn. There were @NUM1 small kids behind us who really wanted to go on the ride. My cousin surprised me by saying, ""Why @CAPS2ít you go ahead."" Usually, she always wants to go first. I was so proud of her patience. We had a great time at @CAPS1, and I hope we can go back again."
1291	19259	7	2	Patience is a challenging virtue to possess, yet it brings rewards. I had a band teacher who repeatedly forgot to distribute our report cards. After a few weeks, I made a bet with him: if he didn't bring the report cards the next day, he would owe me a bag of raffles. Weeks turned into months, and by the end of the school year, he still hadn't produced them. When the new school year started and we were halfway through, the band teacher walked in and gave me two packs of Swizzles. I then recalled our bet, and he said the second pack was for my patience. This experience shows that patience can lead to unexpected rewards.
1292	19260	7	2	Patience is truly a valuable trait. Every day, I go to basketball practice to watch my friends play. I can't participate because I broke my ankle playing soccer a few weeks ago. It requires great patience to sit in the gym for an hour and a half, watching others have fun. On specific game days, I choose to sit on the bench and watch the team play. I could skip these games, but I exercise patience and attend. It's incredibly boring just sitting there, but I do it so I can watch and play again next year. Patience is indeed a virtue, and it takes a lot of it to do anything meaningful. So, the question is, do you have patience? True patience isn't getting upset after sitting somewhere for a while; it's being calm and waiting.
1293	19261	7	2	One instance where I demonstrated patience was during an exam at the end of last year. One way I showed patience was by keeping quiet and to myself. The exam itself isn't overly difficult, but maintaining patience can be a challenge. Patience is crucial as it's a skill we'll need to use for a long time. During the exam, after finishing, we have to wait for our classmates to complete it. In this spare time, we can read a book or review our work. Patience is also important because we can't rush through the exam. We need to take our time, even though we're timed. This is where patience comes into play. Sometimes, after finishing the exam, we can sit quietly and reflect on our day. If everyone in the classroom lacks patience, it's likely that many will fail the exam. A silent and quiet room is essential. When everyone is silent, we're more likely to do well. I remain patient after finishing the exam because I respect others' work habits. I understand that even after the exam is over, being patient is still important. When I receive my test results this year in seventh grade, I hope I did well because my classmates and I all exercised patience. Remember, patience is the key to success.
1294	19262	7	2	One day at school, PERSON2 was waiting in line to get his lunch when suddenly, NUM1 kids cut right in front of him. PERSON1 told the kids that they needed to go to the back of the line, but the kids replied that they didn't have to. A few minutes later, a girl named PERSON4, whom PERSON2 likes, was going to the back of the line. PERSON2 offered to let her cut in front of him, and she did. When PERSON1 and ORGANIZATION1 reached the food area and were waiting to pay, a kid NUM2 spots away from PERSON4 couldn't remember his student ID number. It turned out he was a new student, so they had to create a student ID number for him before he could pay for his food. Finally, they got through the line. PERSON4 sat down with her friends, but PERSON3 didn't know where to sit because his friends were outside. PERSON4 saw him and invited him to sit with her, and he accepted. After finishing, PERSON4 asked PERSON1 if he wanted to hang out at recess, and he agreed. However, one of PERSON4's friends wasn't done eating, so they had to wait for her. When she finished, they went outside. Just as PERSON1 was enjoying the time with PERSON4, the bell rang to go inside. He was a bit mad, but overall, he was glad he got to hang out with PERSON4 the whole time.
1295	19263	7	2	Last DATE1, I was at my family's place with my step - dad. He taught my brothers, their friends, and me how to water - ski. I was the first to try. Following all the steps my step - dad had told me and being patient with myself, I got into the water. Suddenly, on the lake, I managed to get up on my skis just like a pro! I had a great time skiing. When the water level changed and it was time to bring the boat back to the cabin, there was a girl who was considering whether to try water - skiing. We sat on the boat for what seemed like an hour, waiting for her decision. In the end, she decided not to try. I was very proud of myself that day because I didn't try to persuade her to give it a go. I was patient with her. Even though I think her decision was wrong, I'm still proud of how I handled the situation on that boat.
1296	19264	7	2	"When I was around seven years old, my mom was pregnant with my younger sister. It was the night before she was due to give birth. We were all asleep when my mom started screaming. We rushed into her room. My dad asked what was happening, and she said, ""She's coming!"" My dad raced to the car, started it, and left without us and my mom, who was about to have a baby. When he realized he'd forgotten us and came back to pick us up, it was already morning. They took us to a room and prepared my mom. My little sister and I waited in the seats next to her. When they took her for an ultrasound, we had to wait. Finally, it was time for the delivery. My sister, grandma, and I waited outside the delivery room. We were very patient as it took over an hour to get the baby out. While they were stitching my mom up, they took my little sister to be cleaned. When we saw her through the window, I watched her get her first bath, shots, and patches. I thought she was an angel. When they brought her to our room, my mom looked exhausted, but my new baby sister was so beautiful. My mom said she was proud of us for being patient. She said she'd name her [PERSON1], and we all liked the name. That day was so special, and I'll always remember it."
1297	19265	7	2	Patience is a virtue that not many people possess. I'm somewhat in the middle; sometimes I can be patient, and other times I'm not. To be patient means being understanding and tolerant, and it also means enduring tough times without complaining. Every year on Labor Day, we go to [LOCATION1] to walk the bridge. The rule is that if you don't complain, you get fudge. One year, I thought I wouldn't get fudge because I'd pulled muscles in both legs and embers had burnt my legs the night before. But I knew that if I wanted fudge, I had to be patient. So, I got dressed, walked to the bridge, gathered my confidence and patience, and started the walk. Every year, we try to beat our bridge - walking time, and I was worried my legs would slow us down. I kept telling myself to be patient. I managed to cover the first three miles in [NUM1] minutes, even though my legs were worn out. I knew to beat our record, we had to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I expected, and my legs felt like they were about to burst. I wanted to stop and complain, but my determination and the thought of getting fudge kept me going. I tolerated the pain and cranked up the speed. I sped to the finish line, not only to get fudge but also to beat our record. Thanks to patience, I got delicious fudge, and we beat our record. It's a moment I'll never forget because I showed patience and kept going until I crossed the finish line.
1298	19266	7	2	"There was a time when I learned the importance of patience. Patience involves being tolerant and understanding. Sometimes, when I'm in a bad mood, it's hard to be patient when someone asks a dumb question or irritates me. Last year, on [DATE1] vacation, I was feeling sick and upset. My little sister, [ORGANIZATION1], wanted ice - cream. She didn't want the ice - cream from the tank that passed by every twenty minutes; she wanted it from the ice - cream shop about seven to ten blocks away. I was bundled in my blanket when she jumped on my bed, shouting, ""I want to go get ice - cream!"" I snapped at her in a mean voice, calling her names. I didn't realize at that moment that she was only four years old and didn't understand that I wasn't feeling well. Tears welled up in her eyes. I quickly apologized and explained that I was sick. Immediately after, she ran out of the room. Ten minutes later, she came back with a hot cup of tea and said, ""I made mama make you some tea."" It was heart - warming. After I drank the tea, she asked if I felt better. I said a little, and then she got on my bed and started bouncing. I was patient with her because I knew she didn't fully understand. So, I got up and took her to the ice - cream shop. She was happy, and that made me happy. I'm extremely proud that I was patient with her, even when she got on my nerves. I wasn't patient at first, but in the end, I managed to be."
1299	19267	7	2	"It was a [DATE1] at [TIME1], and we were at [ORGANIZATION1]. We all wanted to go on the boat and go tubing. We carried our stuff out to the boat and got ready to go. But when we tried to start the boat, nothing happened. My [CAPS1] and cousin took the back of the seats off and looked inside. There was a lot of water, and the bilge pump had stopped working. My step - dad examined it and said it needed to be re - wired. He re - wired the boat, but it still didn't work. All the kids were getting antsy. Every adult told us to have patience. Everyone calmed down and walked away. Soon, we heard a boat start up, and it sounded like my [CAPS1]'s. We ran down there excitedly, and sure enough, the boat had started. We hopped in and went tubing down the river. Later that day, my mom said to me, ""Patience is a virtue."" This experience taught me the value of being patient."
1300	19268	7	2	"When I was [NUM1] years old, my mom was usually impatient and easily annoyed. One day, she was going to take a shower, but people kept using the bathroom. To my surprise, she remained patient for a while. I saw her standing there, almost falling asleep, showing remarkable patience. Another person stepped into the bathroom, and I quickly went over and said, ""[CAPS1], excuse me, but my mom is coming. She's been waiting."" Then I woke my mom up, saying, ""Mom, wake up. Go take a shower!"" She woke up and took a shower. After she came out, she said, ""Ahh, it kind of feels good. That was better."" It was a memorable moment that showed a different side of my mom."
1301	19270	7	2	"I'm consistently patient mainly because of my younger sister. At times, it's easier to be patient with her than at other times, but most of the time, I can manage. I believe this is a great example. On a chilly @DATE1 at @TIME1, I was in my mother's room and saw her doing her makeup. I asked, ""@CAPS1, how did you get so good at applying makeup?"" @CAPS2 replied, ""With patience and years of practice."" The next day, when I received my allowance, I asked my mom, ""@CAPS3 Mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1 later?"" @CAPS2 responded, ""@CAPS4, why?"" I answered, ""So I can get some makeup to practice with."" ""@CAPS6,"" @CAPS2 said. When we arrived, there were so many choices! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones. After we checked out, it was time to go home and practice. Unfortunately, my first makeup lesson didn't go very well, but I asked my mom for help, and @CAPS2 said, ""@CAPS8, I know you'll pick it up soon!"" I wondered aloud, ""@CAPS9?"" @CAPS2 almost whispered, ""Because anyone can pay someone else to do their makeup and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patience to learn it themselves."" This experience taught me the value of patience in learning new skills."
1302	19271	7	2	"When my @CAPS2 and I joined the checkout line at @CAPS1, we heard impatient groans and sighs around us. Nearly every line was extremely long, and the entire store was crowded. I groaned along with everyone else, irritated by the long wait. My @CAPS2 continued to whistle cheerfully and seemed oblivious. ""This is going to take forever!"" I complained. ""@CAPS3, don't be so negative. It's not that long,"" @CAPS4 replied. @CAPS4 saw my annoyed look and laughed. ""@CAPS5, how about we play a game?"" @CAPS6 then played a game of eye - spy for about @NUM1 minutes as the line inched forward. After we finished the game, @CAPS4 made small talk and checked her list to ensure we had everything while I played a game on her phone. Soon, we were next in line, and I sighed in relief. I thought to myself that it was a good thing @CAPS2 kept us occupied. As we walked out of the store, my @CAPS2 said, ""@CAPS7, when you're patient, you get food!"" We both laughed and drove home, realizing that patience had made the long wait more bearable."
1303	19272	7	2	Every year, my entire family takes a trip to the @LOCATION1 beach in @LOCATION2. The family members who go include my mom, dad, little sister, three cousins, aunt, uncle, and grandparents. We all stay together in a large hotel that usually has @NUM1 bedrooms. We only stay for two weeks out of the whole year, so I have to be very patient for the other 351 days. While there, we fish for sharks and stingrays, relax on the beach, and swim in the ocean or the pool. The experience is definitely worth the wait. I always have a wonderful time, and now I patiently await next year's trip, knowing that the memories made during these two weeks are truly special.
1304	19273	7	2	I remember the trip clearly. It was two summers ago when my mom, two brothers, and I went to @PERSON1 point. The car ride lasted about an hour and a half, maybe two hours. I was extremely excited about riding the new @CAPS5 at @CAPS1 point. With nothing to do but listen to music and look out the window, the car ride seemed to drag on forever. Once we arrived, we had to go on several other rides first. We usually start at the front and work our way back, doing things in order. I didn't mind this as we mostly rode big roller coasters, with a few exceptions like @PERSON2 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and @ORGANIZATION1. I had so much fun that I was distracted from my eagerness to ride the @CAPS5. However, it became increasingly difficult to be patient when we reached the @CAPS5 because the line was nearly an hour and a half long. Considering it was a new ride, the long line was to be expected. After a long wait, we finally got to ride it. The @CAPS5 was incredibly thrilling. All my patience had paid off, and I had an amazing day, learning that patience can lead to great experiences.
1305	19274	7	2	"I'm going to write about a time when my sister showed patience while waiting to go to the dentist. One day, my mom said she was going to take my little sister to the dentist. My sister was overjoyed. My mom also had to go to other places. First, we went to Costland Mall to buy me a homecoming dress. After that, we went to Shoe Depot to get me some shoes. Then, I went to get my hair done. Finally, on our way home, I reminded my mom that my little sister had to go to the dentist. When we arrived at the dentist's, we had to wait @NUM1 minutes. I told my little sister, ""@CAPS1.M.G, you've been so patient all day. I couldn't have done that."" My sister's patience was truly remarkable, and it made me realize the importance of being patient in difficult situations."
1306	19275	7	2	I was waiting at my uncle's house, eager to go hunting. I wondered why he wasn't there yet. I felt a sense of unease as I was alone, and the only thing I had to call for help was my cell phone. Unable to wait any longer, I quietly opened the door and stepped out with my gun. I ran to our tree - stand. This stand had been there for as long as I could remember, but it was in bad shape. The ladder was rickety, with the top bowed and broken in several places. We always said we'd rebuild it but never got around to it.  After climbing up the ladder, I placed the gun to my side and waited. Hunting usually requires patience, but I didn't need to wait long. There, on the horizon among the trees, stood the biggest buck I'd ever seen. It was so beautiful that I almost exclaimed. I loaded a stud into the barrel, took aim, and fired. Unfortunately, I missed. The stud tilted to the side. I reached for the gun, but it landed in an awkward position. As I turned, I saw the stud coming down. I tried to get up but sprained my leg. Then, with a great crash, the stud fell on me. I was trapped beneath it. My back hurt terribly, and my wounds were starting to bleed. I was lucky not to have broken my neck.  At first, I wasn't patient. But I learned my lesson and waited patiently until my uncle was within yelling distance. I got in trouble, but I learned the hard way that patience is essential.
1307	19276	7	2	In fifth grade, one day during recess, I was playing tag on the playground. Suddenly, I was pushed off the slide and fell, hurting my arm badly. In pain, I went to the doctor's office. I had to wait for two hours, sitting patiently and not moving my arm at all, watching other people come and go. Finally, they called my name. The doctor told me my arm was broken, but they couldn't put a cast on right away. So we went to another doctor across the road, waited for @NUM1 minutes, and I got a blue cast.  About a month later, I went back to the X - ray room. The doctor said I had to be casted again. Eventually, I got the cast taken off. This experience taught me the importance of patience as I had to endure waiting and the discomfort of the cast multiple times.
1308	19277	7	2	The time I had to be patient was when I went to the @CAPS1.B.I @CAPS2. My dad was there for about @NUM1 months doing a lot of training. At the end of the training, those who made it through would receive an award. There were quite a number of people at the event. We had to dress nicely and sit through the award - giving ceremony for people we didn't even know. The worst part was the long speeches.  After what seemed like hours, my dad finally got up to receive his award. I was extremely happy for him. Then we were able to leave. This event was a test of my patience as I had to sit through a long and somewhat boring ceremony, but it was all worth it to see my dad get his well - deserved award.
1309	19278	7	2	"The @CAPS5 coach shouted, ""Go!"" The @CAPS5 soccer team and I were running sprints to warm up for our game. That day was carefully planned: first, the soccer game and then a friend's birthday party. I was really looking forward to it. But then, a raindrop hit my head. Soon, it started pouring. The team and I rushed under a nearby awning. The thunder was so loud that it nearly shook the ground.  The refs came over and announced that the game was delayed. I sighed and slumped down on a picnic table. I knew I had to be patient if I wanted to get through the day. As we sat under the awning, the rain pounded on the roof and the thunder cracked. I wondered if I'd make it to the party.  The game could only resume after @NUM1 minutes without thunder. We were already on minute @NUM2, but even the slightest thunder would make us start over at @NUM3. We were at minute @NUM4 when we heard a distant thunder. Frustrated, I exclaimed, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 mon!"" The team started counting the minutes again.  Finally, after what felt like the longest @NUM1 minutes of my life, there was no more thunder or rain. The game was back on! We sprinted onto the field and played our hardest, but unfortunately, we lost @NUM6. We walked off the field, our white socks and jerseys splattered with mud and soaked through. My mom gave me the ""@CAPS6 up"" look, and I quickly ran to the car.  I told myself that I'd still make it to the party, just a few minutes late, and I'd have to change in the car. As I ran through the wet grass, I heard my coach yell, ""@CAPS7 fun at your party @PERSON1, and @CAPS8 for being so patient!"" I smiled and replied, ""@CAPS8 coach!"" That day, I realized that patience is a valuable quality that people appreciate during difficult times."
1310	19280	7	2	On the way back home from the doctor's, I started to get annoyed about the long journey. However, I didn't want to make my mom more annoyed, so I tried very hard to be patient. Every now and then, I'd play with the seat to distract myself. After @NUM1 minutes, my patience was wearing thin, but I still managed to hold it together.  Once I got home, I went to my bed and relaxed. This experience made me understand that controlling my annoyance and being patient can prevent unnecessary stress for both myself and those around me.
1311	19281	7	2	One time, I had to exercise patience when my dad was trying to get money for our Chihuahua on @DATE1. He sold his guitar to his uncle, but of course, he didn't receive the money right away. A day passed, and there was still no sign of it. When my mom came to pick something up, I went to swim practice, attempting to be patient and await my dad getting the money. Around @NUM1 o'clock, my dad called to say he wouldn't get the money until @DATE2 @TIME1. I was annoyed but still tried to remain patient. A few days later, @DATE1 rolled around again. I was extremely excited. We finally got @CAPS2. I had been patiently waiting for a week and was fed up. However, in the end, my patience paid off. That was the instance when I had to be patient for something good, and it truly was worth it.
1312	19282	7	2	Patience is essential for achieving anything in the world. In school, for example, patience is demonstrated by being understanding towards your teachers. They are there to help and teach you valuable life skills. Without patience and understanding, you won't progress in life. Similarly, with your parents, you need to be tolerant as they were with you. If you lack patience and don't listen to them, you won't learn the life lessons they offer. Without these skills, you'll find it difficult to succeed in life. In conclusion, patience in these relationships is crucial for personal growth and development.
1313	19283	7	2	There was a time when I knew a girl named @ORGANIZATION1 who met another girl named @PERSON1. They were inseparable until high school. @ORGANIZATION1 made many more friends and became very popular. @PERSON1 would call @ORGANIZATION1 daily to check on her and invite her to hang out. However, @ORGANIZATION1 kept lying to @PERSON1, saying she was busy and blowing her off. One day, @ORGANIZATION1 had a terrible day. When she tried to confide in her new friends and apologize for her behavior, she realized that @PERSON1 was a true friend who had been patient with her through difficult times. This shows that patience can lead to the discovery of true friendship and that good things can come from being patient.
1314	19285	7	2	One time, I got in trouble for getting a @CAPS1 on my report card, and my mom grounded me. I asked her how long the grounding would last and then went upstairs to read a book. An hour later, I came down and asked again. She was annoyed and said she didn't know how many times she had to tell me. I kept bugging her all day. She said she was running out of patience. I pleaded with her to just tell me, and she finally agreed. She pulled out a sheet of paper. When I asked what it was, she said she had counted how many times I'd asked her - twelve times! She declared that I'd be grounded for twelve days, and that was final. I agreed. I think I learned a lesson that day: don't bug your mom all day and strive to do better in school.
1315	19286	7	2	On a beautiful sunny day, I was out driving around. Suddenly, my mom shouted that she was going to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 to get my new @CAPS8 and that I couldn't go. I sat there waiting and waiting. Eventually, I decided to play PlayStation @NUM1 (@CAPS3 @CAPS4). I played for two straight hours. Then I switched to watching @CAPS6 Assassin (@CAPS7). After that ended, I went back to playing PlayStation @NUM1 for another hour. Suddenly, I heard beeping. I looked out the window and saw my mom. We talked about the new @CAPS8, and then I heard more beeping, and there it was! I ran out, took it out, and rode it for about @NUM3 hours straight. I had been patient for about @NUM4 to @NUM5 hours, and I was really proud of myself after riding my new @CAPS8.
1316	19287	7	2	I demonstrated patience during my @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 appointments while waiting in the waiting room. A teacher asked me to wait a moment as they were speaking with someone else. Whenever a @CAPS3 teacher told me not to open something, I remained patient. I also exercise patience when waiting for buses, airplanes, or trains. There are times when I get bored while waiting, yet I still manage to be patient. In this way, I've shown my ability to be patient.
1317	19289	7	2	I'll share a time when I had to be patient. My Xbox @NUM1 broke, and I waited for my friend to fix it. My friend took an extremely long time, about seven or eight hours. All I could do was sit in a chair and watch. Finally, the Xbox was fixed, but when we started playing, it broke again. We then took it to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I had to be patient; otherwise, I would've been extremely bored. After @CAPS1 @CAPS4 examined the system, they said they needed to take it for further inspection. It took them nearly four days to fix it and return it to me. I had to wait patiently for its delivery. Patience is truly essential in life. Now you know about a time in my life when I had to exercise patience.
1318	19290	7	2	“@CAPS1 on,” my little brother said. The @CAPS2 line was taking forever. He also remarked, “@CAPS2 is the last time we're coming on this @CAPS2 ride.” We were at Space Mountain in @ORGANIZATION1 land, @LOCATION1. When we got in line, there was a sign indicating a @NUM1 - minute wait from the @CAPS2 point. It was swelteringly hot, and it felt like I was walking in slow - motion. The line barely moved. For some reason, my older brother was happy. No one could understand why we were standing in line in such @NUM2 weather. I tried to be as patient as possible, just standing in line, hoping we could finally get on the ride. After the first hour, another sign showed a @NUM3 - hour wait from the @CAPS2 point. We all got angry. The walkway was eerily silent; you could've heard a pin drop. Everyone was being patient. Finally, we waited @NUM4 hours to go on just @NUM3 rides. That was the first time I was that patient.
1319	19291	7	2	One time I showed patience was during a car journey north to @LOCATION1. I was in the car for eight hours. My cousin @PERSON1 was driving, and my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was sitting next to her. I was in the backseat with their dog @CAPS3. My cousin @PERSON1 talked the whole way. I asked to stop for a bathroom break and to get food, but they said “botton” (presumably meaning “wait”). I waited for an hour and asked again, getting the same response. That's when I really had to draw on my patience.
1320	19292	7	2	One sunny afternoon, I was extremely excited because I was going to see my favorite band. When I was in third grade, my mom picked me up from school. I was so eager that I couldn't sit still. My dad dropped my brother off at my grandma's house since he was too young to go. I was bouncing in my seat and kept asking, “Mom, are we there yet?” Mom replied, “@CAPS1, we have two more hours to go, and then another hour to reach the place.” I then asked, “@CAPS2, can I have my DVD, please?” After two hours in the car, we went to all the places my mom and dad wanted to go, not where I wanted. Finally, it was time to see the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5. When we arrived, I was a bit sleepy, but that didn't dampen my spirits. However, when the band only played two songs, I felt like sleeping on my seat. I'd waited all day to see them, yet this was what I got. That was a time when I was patient to see my favorite band.
1321	19293	7	2	I vividly recall a period when patience was an absolute necessity, and it wasn't the least bit amusing. I was eagerly awaiting my new cell phone. My mother informed me that I'd receive one at the start of the school year. I waited and waited until the school year finally began, but then she told me I'd have to wait another week because she'd spent all the money on school supplies. So, I waited another week. I was excited when I remembered that my parents had planned a trip to @LOCATION1 that weekend, which meant I had to wait yet another week. Finally, on @DATE1, when I was at my cousin's house, my mother walked in and surprised me with my new phone. I was overjoyed to finally have it. It just goes to show that patience can be rewarded with great things.
1322	19294	7	2	"About one or two years ago, during Christmas, my family and I drove to my grandparents' house in Cold Water. The journey took around @NUM1 hours. All my relatives on my dad's side were there. The presents were neatly arranged under the tree, and I was itching to open them. The parents were engaged in idle chatter, so I couldn't hold back and asked, ""Can we open presents now?"" We started the present - opening process, but the adults had to go first. They were incredibly slow at opening gifts. I was so tempted to grab the presents from their hands and open them myself, but I managed to be patient. After the adults finished, I let out a ""yes."" Then, my little cousins had to open their presents, and they were no faster. Finally, it was my turn. In the end, it was all worth it as I received an Xbox @NUM2 and over @MONEY1. That was a time when I learned the value of patience."
1323	19295	7	2	Patience is a challenging virtue to practice in life. It's often extremely difficult for people, including children, to be patient. One can tell that someone is being patient when they are polite and wait for their turn without complaining. I must admit, like many others, I don't always like being patient, especially @CAPS1. Impatient people often struggle to wait for others. On the other hand, patient people can sometimes seem annoying or overly quiet. They don't talk much, and when they do, they don't get angry even when interrupted. They definitely never shout at others. Having patience is a valuable asset as it can lead to a good family, good friends, and a fulfilling life. In conclusion, patience is a quality well - worth cultivating.
1324	19296	7	2	"There was a time when I demonstrated patience. I was at a bookstore and wanted a book titled ""Taylor Swift Back at the @LOCATION1 as a School Girl."" My mom said I could have it if I was patient. I was thrilled because she knew how much I loved Taylor Swift's books and her life. As soon as I got the book, I started reading it. My mom thanked me for being patient, and I thanked her for buying it. I had been pestering my mom to take me to the bookstore, and she initially said no. I kept asking, and she finally said maybe. Then, while in the car listening to the radio, we went to the mall. There was a bookstore there, and I asked if I could look around. My mom said yes and told me to find the book I wanted. I found it, and she bought it for me. This experience taught me that if you want something, you should be patient and not keep asking."
1325	19297	7	2	I am a patient person when I go hunting. I know that at any moment, the opportunity of a lifetime could present itself, with a deer stepping into shooting range. I was particularly patient the first time I shot a deer with my bow. I sat there, doing my best to stay patient, waiting for a deer to come within range. Then, I heard the sound of leaves crunching. There it was, the deer. I drew back my bow and shot. I could feel the arrow glide through my bow. It hit the deer with a thud, and the deer took off. I stayed in my tree - stand, ready to track it. My dad and I tracked it for a while, and there it was. I was so excited that I shouted. It was wonderful to know that all my patience and hard work had paid off. Thank you for reading my story. I hope you enjoyed it.
1326	19298	7	2	Having patience requires a great deal. One time, my sister attempted to provoke me, but I refused to let her succeed. I truly possess patience. I was watching TV when she stood right in front of it. I politely asked her to move, and she did. Then she sat beside me and kept touching me, yet it didn't bother me at all. She repeatedly asked, “I'm [unclear word] you.” I replied, “[unclear word] I'm going to wait until I get really mad.” I told her that she couldn't bother me and that she should get out of my face. Eventually, she tried her hardest by attempting to rip up my homework. I simply said I didn't care, and she made a smart - aleck comment. I continued watching TV. She said she was going to make me mad, but I ignored her. She got angry and kept asking if I could hear her. I walked outside and told myself that I couldn't let her get to me, as we might end up fighting. I went back into the house, sat down, and told her that she couldn't make me mad and that she should stop. She replied with a dismissive “girl, whatever.” I was on the verge of saying something, but I didn't give her the satisfaction. By remaining patient, I managed to avoid an unnecessary conflict.
1327	19300	7	2	I'm writing about an instance when someone showed patience. My mom was patient when she didn't receive her money on the day she expected it. She was eager for it to arrive, and when it didn't, she was briefly angry. However, the next day, the money finally came. I told her, “Mommy, I said it would come today.” She did get the money as I predicted. She showed patience by not calling the people responsible and asking about the money. When the money arrived, there was no one at home. Later, we went to [unclear place] and got the money. Then we went to the mall. I was extremely happy, and so were my brothers and sisters. This experience shows that patience often pays off in the end.
1328	19301	7	2	I recall a time when I went to [LOCATION1] during [CAPS1] to visit my step - grandmother and went fishing. I wasn't very enthusiastic about fishing because I'm an impatient person. The creek where we fished was right behind her house. I picked up a fishing rod and went to the “backyard.” I cast my fishing line into the water and waited. After about [NUM1] minutes, I hadn't caught anything, while my sister caught most of the fish. Finally, something started to happen. Excitedly, I jumped out of my seat, knocking it over, and grabbed the reel. I twisted the handle for what seemed like an eternity and pulled up a small fish. My step - grandmother threw it back. After another [NUM1] minutes, I got frustrated and went swimming. After an hour of swimming, I returned to my rod and decided to be more patient. I waited until my line started moving, then I got up and twisted the reel faster. I caught the biggest fish of the day. I sat down and waited for an entire hour until the line moved again, and I caught another fish. I was overjoyed and told my step - grandmother. This experience taught me that patience can lead to great rewards and new learning.
1329	19302	7	2	Patience is the ability to wait for an extended period without complaining or giving up. For example, if you're standing in line for [NUM1] hours to get tickets to see your favorite band perform, waiting in that line without complaining shows patience. Being patient is a sign of respect for oneself and others. In my opinion, everyone could use a bit more patience. People should think about the importance of patience more often. If the world lacked patience, it would be in chaos. For instance, no one would be willing to wait; everyone would want to be first. It would be utter madness. I'm truly glad that patience exists in the world and that many people possess it. Patience helps maintain order and harmony in our daily lives.
1330	19303	7	2	I demonstrated patience during a doctor's appointment. My mom and I waited nearly an hour for them to call me. Twenty minutes later, the nurse finally called my name. She apologized for the wait and thanked me for being patient. After the appointment, my mom took me to get something to eat. We waited [NUM1] minutes at the drive - through, and then they gave us our food. The staff also apologized and thanked us for being patient. This experience shows that patience is often recognized and appreciated, and it helps make difficult waiting situations more bearable.
1331	19304	7	2	This is a story that conveys what patience means to me. Patience is the ability to face a problem without complaining. For instance, I was supposed to give my mom @NUM1, but I didn't have it at that moment. My mom didn't complain; instead, she waited patiently. Patience does not involve incessant begging. It implies being understanding and tolerant. If your dad says he'll get you some pizza, be patient and wait for it. When you are patient, others will also be patient with you. For example, if you're watching TV and don't want to get up yet, people will wait for you. Patience doesn't mean constantly asking. I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2, begging my mom for candy. Had I been patient and waited for her answer, I might have gotten the candy, but I didn't. This is my story and my understanding of patience.
1332	19305	7	2	An old teacher of mine, @PERSON1, was an extremely patient person. Despite the fact that we often got on his nerves, he remained patient. When we didn't understand a question he had explained numerous times, he didn't lose his temper. Even when we showed bad attitudes towards him, he maintained his composure. I believe @PERSON1 was determined to be patient with us, perhaps he prayed for the strength to do so. He was always patient with us through all difficulties. In my opinion, @PERSON1 was the most patient teacher and person I've ever met. His patience left a deep impression on me and taught me the importance of being patient with others.
1333	19306	7	2	When you hear the word “patience”, what's the first thing that comes to mind? For me, it's “waiting”. Let me share a story about a time when I was very patient. It was @DATE1, and it was meap testing day. Every kid dreads these tests, and we had to stay completely silent. It's already difficult to be quiet, but it's even harder when you're sitting next to your friends, especially if you're a girl. We had to do meap writing, which is the most challenging part for me. However, when I finished my writing, I felt good and remained quiet for the sake of others. This is the story of when I had to exercise patience during the test. It shows that with patience, we can overcome difficult situations.
1334	19307	7	2	I often find it difficult to be patient. For example, when I go to restaurants and wait for our food, I get bored very easily. Once, I injured my ankle while playing soccer. A couple of months later, the same spot still hurt. So, my mom made an appointment with my doctor. When I went to see the doctor, she examined my ankle for a lump or fracture and said, “I don't think there's anything wrong, but we can't be sure.” Then, she sent my mom and me to the urgent care center at @NUM1 with a note saying I needed an x - ray. After a 25 - minute car ride, we arrived. When a kind lady checked us in, we waited in the x - ray waiting room. My mom texted my sister to let her know we'd be there for a while. I had to be patient because we waited there for a whole hour! Clearly, this was a situation where I had to exercise patience, especially since I was already nervous about a possible broken ankle.
1335	19308	7	2	Being patient is truly a wonderful quality. I'll share an example of when I was patient in anticipation of my birthday. As my birthday approached, I was extremely excited. I even kept a personal calendar to count down the days. I also made numerous birthday lists and visited stores to see what they had. For instance, I saw a beautiful pair of shorts with a matching belt. @NUM1 days before my birthday, I was so eager that I even lost my appetite. I also went to @LOCATION1 to look at all the wonderful cakes. Finally, the big day arrived, and we went shopping for all the things I wanted. In conclusion, this was a time when I demonstrated patience, and it made the birthday celebration even more enjoyable.
1336	19310	7	2	One instance when I had to be patient was when I faced a difficult task without any help. It was incredibly hard, and I had only one hour to finish it, but I actually needed three hours. It was so challenging that even a college student might have struggled. @ORGANIZATION1 was the toughest math test I've ever taken. In the end, I managed to persevere through the task, learning the value of patience in the process.
1337	19311	7	2	"Mom, how much longer?"" I complained at the airport. ""We've been waiting for about two hours now."" ""It'll only be a couple more minutes, sweety,"" replied my mom in a stern voice. ""It better take only a few minutes because I really want to go to Disney World,"" I complained again. As you can tell, we were in a crowded airport. We had to wait for six hours before our flight took off for @LOCATION1. It took a great deal of patience, which I thought I didn't have. In the first hour of waiting, I was extremely bored. The only thing I had to play with was my Game Boy @CAPS6, a boxy, fold - open device with a screen on top and controls on the bottom. It kept me occupied and awake. Thankfully, I found a TV at the airport. We went to the lounge to watch, but the only channel available was the news, which I didn't like, so I played my Game Boy for about an hour. I didn't say anything to my mom for two or three hours as I didn't want to bother her. Finally, after waiting a total of @NUM1 hours and @NUM2 minutes, we boarded the plane. It was a painful but memorable experience. When we found our seats, my mom said she was very proud of our patience. To this day, I understand why my mom and dad don't like flying anymore."
1338	19312	7	2	"It was @DATE1, and it was almost @PERSON1's sixth birthday. He was helping his mom make his birthday cake. After making the cake mix, his mom put it into a cake pan and placed it in the oven for @NUM1 hours. ""I can't wait for my yummy chocolate birthday cake to be done!"" said @PERSON1. A few minutes later, he asked if the cake was ready. ""Not yet, @PERSON1,"" said his mom. ""You've still got about @NUM2 hours and @NUM3 minutes until your cake is done."" ""That'll take forever,"" whined @PERSON1. ""You've got to use your patience, @PERSON1,"" she said. ""@Mom, what's patience?"" @PERSON1 asked. ""Patience is waiting for something without complaining,"" explained his mom. ""You can do something to make the time pass faster, like play a game, ride your bike, play with your friends, or play in the sandbox."" ""Okay,"" said @PERSON1, ""I'll go do something else."" So, @PERSON1 went downstairs to play video games. When he finished, he checked the oven, and there were two hours and thirty minutes left. Then, he decided to go out and ride his bike. He put on his helmet and rode his two - wheeler on the neighborhood trails. He met his friends and joined them on their bike ride. After that, they went to the backyard to play in the sandbox and made a huge sand kingdom with big castles and a trench around it. @PERSON1 went inside to ask how much time was left on the oven. ""Only five more minutes,"" said his mom. ""You should take that time to brush off all that sand. And when you're done, you can invite your friends in for a piece of cake."" When @PERSON1 and his friends cleaned the sand off, they went inside and had a piece of cake. After everyone finished, they all said, ""It's the best cake ever!"" Through this experience, @PERSON1 learned the importance of patience."
1339	19313	7	2	"Come on, Mom!"" I yelled. We had just gotten our tickets for my favorite amusement park in the world, @CAPS3 @CAPS4. ""Calm down, @PERSON1,"" my mom told me. ""I'm coming,"" she said. I'm not usually overly hyper, but I love roller coasters. It's also great to take a @DATE1 off and head to @CAPS3 @CAPS4. I live in @LOCATION1, so the drive is not short. My mom had just given the man our tickets. ""Enjoy your day at @CAPS3 @CAPS4,"" he told us. ""So, @PERSON1, what do you want to ride first?"" my mom asked me. ""How about the @CAPS11?"" I asked. ""Why not?"" she replied. By the way, my name is @PERSON1, but that's not important right now. What matters is getting on the @CAPS11. My mom and I waited in line for about an hour. It seemed to take forever, but soon we were buckling up. I know the @CAPS11 isn't the biggest ride, but it's still pretty large. As we went uphill, I got a bit nervous. Everyone gets nervous on their first ride, and as the world got smaller below us, my nervousness grew. But the @CAPS11 ended up being a lot of fun! After that, we rode the Mantis, the @ORGANIZATION1, the Wicked @CAPS16, @ORGANIZATION2, the @CAPS17, the Mean @CAPS18, the @CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21, and the @CAPS22. ""Okay, @PERSON1, pick the last ride,"" my mom said. That was easy. We hadn't gone on my favorite ride yet. ""Let's go on the @CAPS26 Force,"" I said. We got in line, and the sign said the wait was two and a half hours. But I've been on the ride before, and it's definitely worth it. The wait ended up being four hours, and I wanted to leave after three, but I waited. It was totally worth it. The waiting was tough, but it was all worth it for the amazing rides. I really enjoyed my day at @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and was glad I waited for the best ride."
1340	19314	7	2	"Around the middle of @DATE1, my family and I were going to @LOCATION1. I was so excited that I prepared all my things and accessories in advance. In the morning, my dad and I were all set, and we packed everything into our old car and headed off. After an hour, I asked my dad, ""When are we going to be there?"" He said it would still take some time, and then I fell asleep. My brother was being annoying and bothered me while I was sleeping. We stopped at a gas station because my mom needed to go inside. I was still excited, even though it was about @NUM2.@NUM3 and I had to wait to reach a hotel. We were in the middle of @LOCATION1, but I was looking forward to reaching our destination and having a great time together. This was my story about the time I had to be patient during our trip, and I learned that patience can lead to wonderful experiences."
1341	19315	7	2	I plan to write a story about patience. Patience refers to the act of waiting for someone to complete a task. For instance, if someone is fixing something for you, and you eagerly await its completion to resume your normal life, but the task is time - consuming, perhaps very much so. If you desire a proper outcome, you must be patient. Sometimes, you're not waiting for a person but an inanimate object, like a television show that can't be rushed, even when you're impatient. When dealing with humans, rushing them to complete a task might lead to a sub - standard result; the item might even break shortly after they finish. However, the task will be completed more quickly. You may also wait for natural phenomena, such as a sunny day after more than a week of rain, or for the power to come back on during a storm. I've personally been extremely eager for the power to return during a storm as there's nothing to do. Patience also involves waiting for things when you're bored. In essence, patience is an important virtue that we need in various aspects of our lives.
1342	19316	7	2	One time, I demonstrated patience when I broke my thumb. I didn't complain or cry about it because I didn't even think it was broken. It didn't really bother me. Then I went to the doctor to get it checked. The doctor initially didn't think it was broken because I almost beat him in a thumb - wrestling match. But he decided to take an X - ray just to be safe. When he came back with the X - ray results, he said it was broken. He was very surprised, and so was I, as was everyone else. This experience shows that sometimes our initial perception can be wrong, and patience in getting a proper diagnosis is crucial.
1343	19317	7	2	This past @DATE1, my family and I traveled to @CAPS1. While in Flagstaff, we went to a large ski slope. When we took the lift to the top, I was scared that I might fall. Once at the top, I could see Flagstaff and a bit of the surrounding area. The height made me dizzy, and since I'm not fond of heights, I started to feel nauseous. I was relieved to get in line to go down. After reaching the bottom, I felt better, but then I felt like I was going to throw up again. That day was truly the worst of my life. However, I was happy the next day when we went to the @ORGANIZATION1. This trip was a mix of unpleasant and more positive experiences, highlighting how quickly our feelings can change.
1344	19318	7	2	"Sometimes, it's really tough to be patient, especially when you have to be tolerant of little kids. I often face this situation when I visit my eight - year - old little cousin, @ORGANIZATION1. She gets on my nerves by asking silly questions and doing foolish things. I really don't like her. My mom says, ""When you grow up, you two will be best friends."" Yeah, right! I highly doubt that. Every time I visit her, I have to tolerate her and be patient. For now, I have to put up with her. Maybe we'll become friends as we grow older, but then again, maybe not. This shows that patience is a test, especially in relationships with difficult people."
1345	19319	7	2	"Once, when we went to Green Bay, it took @NUM1 to get into our @CAPS1. When we finally got in, it was @NUM2 their time, which is @NUM3 our time, and I was a bit upset. The next day, we went to Toys ""R"" Us. My sister was angry, and my mother wanted to buy a van. We first tried a white van. My brother, dad, and I liked it, but my mom and sister didn't. Then we tried a silver van. My mom and sister loved it, while my brother, dad, and I hated it. In the end, we bought the silver van. It took @NUM4 to get the van, and the journey home was just awful. This trip was full of frustrating experiences, but I had to be patient throughout it all, even though the decisions and the overall process were far from ideal."
1346	19320	7	2	The first instance of learning patience was when I was young. My mom said she would buy me a Play - Station. I desperately wanted it, but I had to wait. I waited for a whole month, and nothing happened. I was extremely angry, yet I refrained from doing anything. Eventually, we went to Walmart, and she bought me the Play - Station. I was overjoyed. Later, I asked for an Xbox (Series S). My mom told me to wait. I waited for several months - three months passed with no result, then four months, and five months still with nothing. I was seething with anger. But after a whole year, I got what I wanted. I got my own room and the Xbox. As I got older, I realized that patience truly pays off, and it's an amazing thing to experience.
1347	19321	7	2	"I have a wonderful story about patience. One day, I was at my grandparents' house. My two brothers, my little sister, my grandparents, and I were all there. My grandmother was about to serve ice - cream. Suddenly, my brothers and sisters started shouting, ""I'm going first!"" My grandmother asked, ""Lathan, what do you think?"" I replied, ""I'm not getting involved in this chaos!"" I was getting a bit freaked out and said, ""Everyone, get in line!"" They agreed. Patiently, everyone got in line and took their turn choosing from a variety of ice - cream flavors like vanilla, strawberry, mint, and cookie dough. Eventually, everyone calmed down and enjoyed their ice - cream cones, which shows that patience can turn a chaotic situation into a pleasant one."
1348	19322	7	2	I showed patience when I went to the doctor. I didn't complain even though I had to wait for three hours. When I finally went in, they took a few measurements, which took about an hour. Then they conducted some tests. At the end of it all, I finally went home. This was a clear demonstration of my patience in a real - life situation.
1349	19323	7	2	One time, I went hunting. We reached the woods at 6 am or even earlier. Once there, we found a spot on the ground to sit. Our plan was to stay in the woods until dark or until we reached our limit of deer. When it was about an hour and a half until dark, we saw a doe. But as we moved the gun to shoot, it ran away. We stayed still, neither moving nor talking, just waiting. More deer appeared, but they were very small, so we let them go. With about 15 minutes left until dark, a good - sized doe came. It was too far away, so we waited for it to get closer. Then, the rifle went off. The doe dropped but was still alive. We waited for about 10 or more minutes until it died. This was one of those times when I had to exercise patience during a hunting trip.
1350	19324	7	2	Patience is the path to achieving certain goals. Patience means waiting for something for a period of time. If you can wait for a long time without getting angry or frustrated, you are considered a patient person. By maintaining this habit, you can lead a fulfilling life as patience often helps in dealing with various situations and achieving long - term goals.
1351	19326	7	2	There are numerous ways to practice patience, such as when waiting in the lunch line or lining up to leave the room. Here is an instance when I demonstrated patience. It was time for a skating trip. I was chatting with someone and eager to go immediately, yet I refrained from expressing my impatience as I understood the need to be patient. When we arrived at the skating rink, I was eager to enter and skate, but they had to explain the rules first, so I kept quiet. Then, when we went in to skate, there was a long queue for skates. Instead of pushing or shoving, I patiently waited my turn. Eventually, I skated, had a meal, and then left. This is how we can be patient.
1352	19327	7	2	Can you be patient? Some people can, while others can't. Sometimes, I struggle with it too. Here's a story about patience. One day at school, the lunch line was extremely long and barely moving. I was so hungry that I found it difficult to be patient. However, for some reason, my friend remained patient. I asked her why she was so calm, and she replied that everyone would get something to eat eventually. I realized she was right and tried to be patient. Before I knew it, I was sitting with my friends, chatting, and enjoying my meal. This experience taught me the value of patience.
1353	19328	7	2	I was incredibly bored during the flight, but I knew it would be worth it in the end. I was on a flight to an unknown destination, and it seemed to take forever. During the long journey, I went to the bathroom, had lunch, played with my mobile phone, took a nap, and then did some other things. Finally, we reached our destination. Despite the boredom, I'm glad I endured it.
1354	19329	7	2	Today in gym class, I had to be patient for my skill test. I performed excellently and scored a perfect score. There were many students in my class, so the wait was quite long. When it was my turn, it took about half a minute to complete the test. We ended up spending a lot of time on the skill test, and I was looking forward to playing dodge - ball the whole time. Unfortunately, we didn't get to play dodge - ball because of the test. So, I felt like I had wasted my time on the skill test. This was my experience with patience in gym class.
1355	19330	7	2	I really wanted a [CAPS1] bike crank, but I had to be patient and earn the money for it. So, I went to [CAPS2] houses. First, I picked up leaves, and later I shoveled driveways. After some time, I had saved enough money to buy my [CAPS1] bike. It was challenging to be patient throughout the process, but in the end, it was all worth it as I finally got what I wanted.
1356	19331	7	2	One day, I found myself in a situation that tested my patience to the limit. I was with @CAPS1 at @LOCATION1, waiting for some rather sluggish individuals to load his truck. I was extremely bored and impatient, constantly complaining, asking, “Can we leave now?” But @CAPS1 seemed to choose to ignore me. Eventually, he decided to go and inquire about the hold - up, instructing me to stay put and not touch anything. I sat there, cold, bored, and hungry, feeling like hours had passed. When @CAPS1 returned, he informed me that it might take another @NUM1. Our impatience grew, and we decided to take a walk and grab some food. Upon our return, we witnessed a rather absurd scene: a forklift driver had managed to get his forklift stuck in the trailer. That was the last straw for @CAPS1. He got out of the truck, and all I could hear were his shouts and screams. Finally, after his outburst, we were able to get back on the road. That day taught me that patience is definitely not one of my virtues.
1357	19332	7	2	One significant instance when I had to be patient was during my first football game. It was @DATE1, and I was eager to enter the stadium. However, I had to wait for an entire hour to get in. Once inside, the game was intense. The score was tied at @NUM2 to @NUM2, and our team was still in a good position. During the game, the coach had an injured player, so he decided to put me in. I ran as fast as I could. When I saw the guy with the ball, I tackled him, and he fell. Then, I sprinted towards the end - zone for a touchdown. If I hadn't been patient and waited for my chance, the coach wouldn't have put me in, and we might not have won the game. It was a clear reminder of how patience can lead to success.
1358	19333	7	2	One time I showed patience was when I went to get my hair cut. The stylist told me to come at @TIME1. When I arrived at that time, there were about @NUM1 people ahead of me. But I wasn't bothered because I had nothing else to do afterward. I was accompanied by my best friend, so we sat there chatting and texting our boyfriends to pass the time. Then, the lady who was supposed to cut my hair came to me and apologized, saying she'd given me the wrong time. I told her it was okay and that I could wait. As she finished with the other customers, she came to me again to apologize. There was still @NUM2 person left, and it seemed like it would take until around @NUM3 - @NUM4 for her to finish. Throughout this entire experience, I remained patient, and it was a valuable lesson in waiting for what I wanted.
1359	19334	7	2	In my opinion, patience is one of the most crucial traits a person can possess. Being patient with others can lead to making friends, finding a romantic partner, and attaining some of life's greatest rewards. About a month ago, I experienced firsthand how patience could pay off. During an away hockey game, I broke my old hockey stick. After the game, I knew I needed a new one, so I went to the pro - shop at the ice arena where I was playing. I asked the salesperson, “Do you have the @CAPS1 @PERSON1 vapor @NUM1?” The salesperson, @CAPS3, gave me a little shrug and replied, “@CAPS2 buddy, we just ran out.” I realized that if I wanted that particular stick, I'd have to search more thoroughly. When I got home, I checked online to see if any nearby stores had it in stock, but I had no luck. So, I decided to order it online. The delivery was not quick; it took about @NUM2 weeks for the stick to arrive. But it was all worth the time and effort.
1360	19335	7	2	I am patiently waiting for the @DATE1 vacation. Until then, I'm doing my best in school. For example, last year, I made the honor roll @NUM1 times. During the @DATE1 period, if I have to do some reviews or show patience, I'll do it without leaving it until the last minute. After the vacation, I'll wait for the new school year to start, which will be a fresh beginning. I'll also look forward to the next @DATE1. In between, there are breaks and days off. Considering we go to school @NUM2 days a week, I think we already have enough assignments over the years. School can be really enjoyable at times, like when there are field trips and school activities. However, we need to be careful not to have our privileges taken away by the principal. For instance, if we misbehave or get too many detentions, she'll take them away. It would be unfair if that happened because often, it's my classmates who cause the trouble. If that were to occur, all my patience would be in vain.
1361	19336	7	2	I often find myself being patient, especially when it comes to my mother. One such instance is when she goes shopping. She takes all the females in our family - my cousins, aunt, and grandmother. I have three options: going to the mall with them, staying in the car, or staying at home. I'll focus on the times I go to the mall. They shop for at least eight hours, sometimes up to ten. They don't limit themselves to one mall; they visit at least two, sometimes three. They also frequent strip malls like Simply Fashion and Rainbow. After spending hours walking around, my feet start to ache, and I get hungry and tired. However, I don't complain because I'm being patient. In the mall, I carry bags and accompany them to numerous women's clothing stores like Victoria's Secret. They also shop for jewelry, makeup, perfume, and every other women's item imaginable. I even get lost because they leave me behind. In conclusion, I'm extremely patient with my mother, no matter the circumstances.
1362	19337	7	2	I'm writing about a time when I tried to be patient but failed. I was supposed to go to a party, but I had to wait for someone. I was waiting for my aunt to pick me up, but she didn't show up. I got angry and couldn't be patient anymore. I also know someone who isn't very patient. They just can't wait. In my case, I waited and waited, but eventually, I lost my temper. I called my mom, and she said she'd take me to the party. But she didn't come either. As a result, I didn't go to the party and was really mad. Finally, I called my grandma, and she came to pick me up. This experience was a lesson in patience for me.
1363	19338	7	2	Patience is essential when going on a trip. I learned this during my trip to [destination] on [date]. I had to be patient for [number] hours before my family and I arrived. The next day, we went to an amusement park. There, I had to wait in very long lines. It's really difficult to be patient in such situations. I wonder if it's hard for others to be patient too. This was the story of when I had to exercise patience.
1364	19339	7	2	"The clock shows it's about three o'clock, but I can't go to sleep because my [relative] and I are going fishing. By eight o'clock, my [relative] was supposed to be here, but my grandma kept saying he'd come. I believed her, though I was a bit worried. By ten o'clock, I was furious and about to cry. But my grandma still said he'd come. I said, ""[exclamation] He won't,"" and went to my room. Then I realized he would come. Finally, I heard the door open, and it was him. I ran and said, ""You finally came."" We ate, and then I saw the boat outside. This was a time when I needed to be patient."
1365	19340	7	2	I remember a time during Christmas when I was [emotion]. I was at home and was the first one up. I was eager to open all my presents and gifts, but I had to wait until everyone came downstairs and my mom got the camera. When it was time to open presents, my brother and sister wanted to go first. My brother made up a rule that the oldest goes first. Finally, it was my turn. I randomly grabbed a present and ripped the paper off without even looking at it because I'd been [emotion] for so long. That was the time when I was [emotion].
1366	19341	7	2	For me, patience means making every effort to wait for someone or something. I recall an instance when I demonstrated patience. I went to the water park with my friends. We wanted to ride a water slide, but there was a long line of kids and adults. We waited for about an hour, and finally, we were second in line. The kids in front of us offered to let us cut in, but we declined. As we waited, the lifeguard was instructing a young boy, who was going down the water slide for the first time, to hold on tightly. Unfortunately, the boy fell off the tube, hit his head, and almost drowned because he didn't know how to swim. It was a scary situation, but we still managed to have a great time at the water park. This experience taught me the value of patience and how it can lead to enjoyable moments even in unexpected circumstances.
1367	19342	7	2	With a loud “clunk,” I jolted in my seat as the rental car hit another pothole. “Look whose awake,” my mom said in the most annoying way possible. “You slept for so long. I thought you might sleep until we got back from school,” she added. “Where are we?” I asked in a tired voice. “Ohio,” replied my mom's friend, [PERSON1]. During spring break, my mom, [PERSON1], and I, [CAPS3] [PERSON2], were on our way to [LOCATION1]. We would be staying in Florida. While there, we planned to visit my dad, who was working there. I knew this would be a memorable trip, but the car ride would really test my patience. It would take us either [NUM1] or [NUM2] days to reach our destination. The [NUM3]rd day would be the toughest as we'd be driving through the mountains. Usually, I can pass the time in the car, but when we reached the peak of the [NUM3]rd mountain, chaos ensued. First, [CAPS3], who was sitting next to me, started screaming because there were no guardrails and we were in the lane near the edge. Then, [CAPS3] grabbed my arm tightly as if her life depended on it. Worst of all, I started to feel the urge to use the restroom. All these things combined made our mountain drive feel like a never - ending rollercoaster ride. I kept thinking, “I'm going to go crazy! Just make it stop.” Thankfully, the screaming stopped, [CAPS3] let go of my arm, and we pulled into a rest stop with bathrooms. If I hadn't been patient during that mountain drive, I really would have lost my mind. I'll always remember that challenging yet ultimately bearable car ride through the mountains.
1368	19343	7	2	Today was the first time I was truly patient, and I couldn't believe it. I was extremely proud of myself. Here's what happened. I was standing in line waiting for ice cream when a teenage girl walked up to the counter and said, “Look, I have to be somewhere in ten minutes. If you don't get this line moving, I'll have to talk to the manager.” The guy at the counter calmly replied, “I'm very sorry, but you'll have to wait until everyone in front of you has placed their order.” “Are you kidding me?” she yelled and then stopped waiting. At that moment, I realized how ridiculous I looked when I'm impatient. So, I patiently waited in line until I reached the counter. I said to the guy, “You have to deal with a lot of people like that, but you handled the situation very calmly.” He replied, “Yeah, there are a lot of impatient people around here. It's really sad. So, would you like to place your order?” I told him what I wanted and then walked home. As I walked, I felt so proud of myself that I decided I'd never be impatient again. This experience was a valuable lesson in the power of patience.
1369	19344	7	2	A time when I showed patience was during a gymnastics meet. My team and I had to wait for two hours before the meet started. We warmed up, stretched, and chatted about who we thought would win the team trophy. We asked our coach if it was almost time to start, and he said we had to wait another hour. So, we continued talking and practiced some floor skills. We even had a head - stand contest to pass the time. Half an hour later, we asked the coach again, and he told us it would be another half hour because they needed to get another judge. Finally, an hour after that, the judge arrived, the coaches had their meeting, and the meet began. This waiting period tested my patience, but I managed to stay calm. It was a great reminder that patience is an important virtue, especially in situations where we have no control over the timing.
1370	19345	7	2	I'm going to share a time when I was patient. One day, I asked my mom if I could get a phone. She said that if I was patient, I'd be able to get one. So, I decided to be patient. Time passed quickly, and eventually, my mom said yes. I got a cell phone because I was patient. Have you ever been patient with your family? Did it work out well for you, or did it turn out badly? If you are patient, it's likely to have a positive outcome. This experience taught me that patience can lead to getting what you want. When you're patient with your family, good things can happen, and that's the power of patience.
1371	19346	7	2	"Did it come yet?"" I shouted as I sprinted home from the bus stop. My mother was standing by the mailbox, holding a thick stack of envelopes. I hoped one of them was the letter. ""Not yet, honey,"" she said. ""But there are plenty of bills."" I wanted to scream in frustration, but I remembered what my teacher said: ""Just wait long enough and you'll get what you want."" I trudged inside and slumped onto the couch. This letter was incredibly important to me. It would tell me which advanced classes I'd be in. It might not seem that significant, but only the top students could get in, and it meant the world to me. I'd be challenged, my parents would be proud, and I'd get $50 from grandma. You see, you take a test at the end of the school year and wait the whole summer for the results. Not a great system, right? Soon, other things distracted me - swim meets, tennis, and books. I learned that being patient helps, and time passes more quickly. I guess my teacher was right. One sunny afternoon in August, I was on the porch reading. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the mailman. He rummaged through his bag, pulled out the mail, put it in our mailbox, and drove away. I jumped out of my chair and ran to the mailbox. I quickly scanned the mail until one envelope caught my eye. I tore it open, and sure enough, it read: ""You have been selected for the following advanced classes: Math studies, Science, and English!"" My patience had finally paid off."
1372	19348	7	2	When I was 10 years old on December 15th, it was a snowy night. My mom and dad were buying a new car. It took ages, and I was starving. Mom and dad were talking with the car dealer, and my brother and sister were playing video games. When they finished talking, they looked at the car they wanted. One of the workers brought me, my brother, and my sister a box of cookies and milk. After looking at the cookies, we got hungry again, but I showed patience. My mom and dad found the car they wanted - a van with a DVD player inside. They paid for it, and we left. Then, my father took us to McDonald's. This experience taught me that patience can lead to rewards, even when waiting seems endless.
1373	19349	7	2	I'm usually a patient person, but when I have to sit for hours, it becomes difficult. My mom is also patient, especially at the place where she works. Many people are very rude to her, yet she remains calm. Patience is a virtue that both my mom and I strive to uphold, even in challenging situations.
1374	19350	7	2	A few months ago, my brother, my mom, and I were standing in line to drop off school supplies. We were number 25, and they had just called number 20. It was about 90 degrees out, and we had to stand there. The new battery I'd just put in my phone died because of how long we waited. It took around 3 hours just to get inside. And then there were more lines! We barely managed to get our things that day, but thanks to our patience, we did. This experience shows that patience can help us overcome long - waiting situations and achieve our goals.
1375	19351	7	2	I didn't know where we were. Then my dad told me we were at a place called Buddies. I'd never been there before. The waitress seated us at a circular table and asked if we'd like something to drink. I asked for a Diet Pepsi. My sister got a fruit punch, as usual. My mom and dad got Mountain Dew, and my brother got a Cherry Pepsi. I don't know why we all ordered different drinks. It took 15 minutes to get our drinks. My dad wasn't very patient. He knew the food would take a long time. Finally, the waitress brought our drinks and apologized for the wait. Then she took our order. We waited 20 minutes for that. My dad was extremely impatient. I was the only patient one at the table. The restaurant wasn't even that busy. I told my dad to be patient and that the food would come soon. We waited and waited. Eventually, the food arrived. We ate everything, paid the bill, and left. That was the time I showed patience in a challenging situation.
1376	19352	7	2	I vividly recall a time when I had to exercise patience. One day, my family and I were setting up decorations for my tenth - birthday party. I was extremely excited and restless as turning ten was a significant milestone for me. We already had a beautifully decorated cake with yellow and white frosting. It also featured a picture of running horses and the words “Happy Tenth Birthday” on it. The party was scheduled to start at [NUM2] am. I was wearing a pretty pink flowered dress and helping put up streamers. I kept asking my mom what the time was, but she just told me to be patient. I was quite an impatient girl at that moment, so eager that I could hardly contain myself. However, I then reminded myself that I should be patient, and I managed to do so. While waiting for the guests, I played games and read books. Before I knew it, the doorbell rang, and all my family members rushed in with presents and cards. It turned out that all the waiting was worth it, and I also received some really cool presents. This experience taught me the value of patience.
1377	19353	7	2	Every day at school, I have to be patient when getting my food, such as pizza, salad, and a sandwich with milk. The milk is always bad, but I still check it. I also have to be patient when getting my lunch. This shows that patience is a necessary virtue in my daily school routine, as it helps me get through these small but sometimes frustrating situations.
1378	19354	7	2	On [DATE1] at Elkhorn Jr. High School, [PERSON1] Colbonthorne was having a rather dull day. He detested school and just wanted to go home. When his teacher told him to sit down, be quiet, and do his work, he tried to kill time by flicking eraser tops at the chalkboard. After about sixty eraser tops, he looked at the clock, which read [TIME1]. He complained to his teacher, and she warned, “[PERSON1], if you don't be patient, I'm going to send you home!” [PERSON1] exclaimed, and the teacher said, “[PERSON1], to detention after school.” Fearing detention, [PERSON1] sat down and did his work all day without complaining. Finally, when the school day ended, it was clear that [PERSON1] had learned to control his impatience, even if it was under the threat of punishment.
1379	19355	7	2	I was waiting on the stage, looking forward at the silent audience. The stage lights were so blinding that I could hardly see. I stood next to my best friend [CAPS1]. On the other side of the stage were our competitors, [PERSON2] and [CAPS2]. As I stared forward, I reflected on how I got there. I was gazing out of the small classroom window while [PERSON1] was talking. She announced a writing contest for the whole seventh - grade. We had to form pairs and write a story on any topic. [CAPS1] and I immediately nodded in agreement. Later that day, I rode my bike to [CAPS1]'s house, excited about the idea of writing. I was thrilled because I love writing and competitions. [PERSON1] also said that the winners would get to participate in more writing competitions. I jumped off my bike and ran to [CAPS1], shouting out ideas. Eventually, we decided to write an adventure story about a plane crashing in the jungle. By the end of the week, we had written ten pages. I typed the paper on my Acer, checked it for spelling and grammar, printed it, and turned it in. At the end of the day, the results showed a tie between [CAPS2] and [PERSON2] and [CAPS1] and me. Our stories were then sent to the state for another competition, and both our pairs won again! I hoped we wouldn't tie in the country competition. On the stage, I was tired of waiting. [CAPS1] told me to be patient, and I did. After twenty minutes of judging, the president announced that [PERSON3] and [CAPS1] had won first place. We jumped up and down with joy and received our trophy. This experience taught us that hard work and patience can lead to great rewards.
1380	19356	7	2	One [CAPS1], I was patiently waiting for a game to arrive. I had waited for [NUM1] years. The [CAPS1] started like any other. As the day went on, I kept hoping for the game to come. By the time I got back from [CAPS6], I sat on the front porch for the rest of the [CAPS1], but it never arrived, so I went to bed. The next [CAPS1], when I came back from [CAPS7], I checked the mail, but it was empty. Disappointed, I slumped onto the couch and watched TV. Then, when I looked out the front [CAPS12], I saw a package. It was my game! This was a prime example of how patience can pay off, as after all that waiting, I finally got what I had been longing for.
1381	19357	7	2	One instance when I demonstrated patience was while sitting at home for hours, awaiting my grandma to pick me up so we could go get my friend. I firmly believe that having a great deal of patience is essential as it allows you to progress further and obtain what you desire. In this situation, patiently waiting for my grandma was a test of my self - control, and it reaffirmed my belief in the value of patience.
1382	19358	7	2	I've had numerous moments where I needed to be patient. For example, waiting for a doctor's appointment, waiting for a teacher to finish instructing so I could complete my homework, or waiting for days for teachers to return my tests. However, today I'll focus on the time I had to be patient to get my first dog. It was last year when we went to look for a dog to adopt. We searched for a long time but couldn't find the right one. It took [NUM1] weeks until we saw the cutest Chihuahua. He was only one year old. We were in a hurry to fill out the papers, worried that someone else might adopt him. When we submitted the papers, the lady informed us that there was a back - side to fill out too. After the paperwork, we had to wait another week because they had to neuter him. My mom went shopping at the pet store. They told us we could pick him up on [DATE2]. We were extremely excited. We initially thought we could pick him up on [DATE1], but on [DATE1], we finally got to pick him up. It took [NUM2] years of patience for my sister and [NUM3] years for me. A year later, we went back to adopt or just look for another dog. We didn't find one, but by waiting, we understand that being patient often pays off. We're still being patient in the hope that our parents will allow us to get another dog.
1383	19359	7	2	I'm often patient at school. When I don't understand something and my teacher or someone else is busy, I'll wait as long as necessary until they're available to help. In most of my classes, I display patience. In art class, we were making a clay box. I was a bit behind because I had to finish a project that was due the previous week. When I started working on the box, I did my best to recall the art teacher's demonstration. When I needed help, I asked a friend who had finished if they could assist me in catching up. They agreed. Then, when someone else asked for help from my friend, I waited patiently. It took almost the whole hour, but I waited and was patient. At the end of the hour, they still weren't done, and my friend said she'd help me in the next few days. I agreed and said I'd see her the next day. The next day in art, [PERSON1] helped me. When she took a break or worked on her own thing, I tried my best and waited for her to resume helping me. [PERSON1] was almost done with her project, but I was still waiting, so I asked someone else for help until she finished. Finally, when she was done, she helped me complete my box. At the end of the hour, I finished it. The next day, we started a simpler project. This was the longest time I've been patient with someone at school.
1384	19360	7	2	I can't really share a time when I've been patient because it's something I struggle with. No matter how hard I try, being patient seems nearly impossible, though perhaps I just don't try hard enough. An example of my impatience is when I'm at a store. If I have five dollars and an item I want costs ten dollars, I won't save up for it. Instead, I'll likely buy candies. My parents try to take my money and hide it so I can't spend it, but I always find it and spend it. I often get grounded because of this, but I think it's worth it for the candy. Another example is when I want to do something and my mom says no, I always sneak and do it anyway, which gets me in trouble. In conclusion, my lack of patience causes me some problems, but I hope to work on it in the future.
1385	19361	7	2	I once went to a [CAPS1] wings game to get tickets. The queue was extremely long, and the wait was incredibly boring. There were a large number of people in line that day. Although I was tempted to cut to the front and get the tickets, I refrained from doing so as it would have been rude. I believe this experience helped me develop a bit more patience. Moreover, I wouldn't want others to cut in front of me in line. Through this experience, I learned that good things come to those who wait.
1386	19362	7	2	Patience refers to the ability to wait for something. While some individuals find it challenging to be patient, others find it relatively easy. Personally, I possess a moderate level of patience. For instance, I am patiently awaiting the release of a game I pre - ordered, which is set to come out on @DATE1. However, my patience wanes when I am eager to use the computer. I also demonstrated patience when waiting to achieve my second - class rank. In conclusion, patience is a trait that varies among people, and I have my moments of both patience and impatience.
1387	19363	7	2	One instance when I showed great patience was when I went to get my shots. It was @DATE1, and it was still cold outside. I was sick, so I needed to get my shots. It was just my dad and me. We decided to go to the @ORGANIZATION1 for children. Before leaving home, I put on an orange turtleneck sweater, jeans, and sneakers. I really didn't want to go because it was after @CAPS1, and I had a bunch of new games to play. It took us @NUM1 minutes to reach the place. My dad filled out the necessary information, and then we sat down. While waiting, we watched TV, but there were only infomercials, which made me extremely bored. We ended up waiting for over an hour. I got hungry and very upset. Finally, they called our name. When it was time to get my shot, a nice lady gave me a juice and then told me I'd be getting @NUM2 shots. Getting the shots took a long time, and I was frustrated. Before we left, they informed me that I'd have to come back for more shots. Since I was still hungry, we stopped at @CAPS2.Donalds. In conclusion, despite the long wait, the boredom, and the frustration of getting the shots, I was very patient during this whole experience.
1388	19364	7	2	I experienced patience during a trip to @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. It was a @NUM1 - hour journey in a small car. We were a bit tired because we hadn't slept well the previous night. Even though I brought a book and my @ORGANIZATION1 game, we were still quite bored. After my @ORGANIZATION1's battery died, all I could do was watch the trees pass by. Dad was focused on the road, and mom started looking at license plates to spot other travelers. Once we reached @LOCATION2, I started to doze off, but @CAPS1 kept me awake as she had just finished something and was explaining it to me. So, I started reading my book. We could hear mom, @CAPS1, and my stomach growling, but we didn't stop. We had to reach @LOCATION1 before @NUM2 pm because that was when the hotel's front desk closed. At @NUM3, we were speeding through the state of @LOCATION1 and finally arrived at the hotel at @TIME1. We were so exhausted that we fell asleep within @NUM4 minutes of hitting the bed. In the end, it was a long and boring journey, but I managed to be patient to reach our destination.
1389	19366	7	2	What does it mean to be patient? It means being understanding and tolerant. A patient person endures difficulties without complaining. However, I believe that being patient is quite difficult. One particular time when it was hard for me to be patient was when I was looking forward to going to a water park on my birthday. I was so excited to have a party and go swimming, but it was almost @NUM1 weeks away. I really didn't want to wait but knew that being patient would enhance my experience. As the week dragged on, I felt like complaining and pulling my hair out because it seemed like time was moving @NUM2, @NUM3 times slower. I realized that if I stopped thinking about it, time would pass more quickly. I also knew I shouldn't annoy anyone with my complaints. Finally, the day arrived, and I had a great time at the water park. This experience taught me that being patient always pays off.
1390	19368	7	2	"Being patient has its pros and cons, and I've had some good things happen to me just by being patient. One such instance was when I tried out for the dance team at my dance studio. I was extremely nervous as I had never tried out for anything before. I had to wait and wait for the studio to call my mom. One day, when I was at a friend's house, my mom called and told me, ""@CAPS2, you have made the dance team."" I was overjoyed and couldn't wait to learn new dances and show them at the competitions. Another time I was patient was when I broke my arm. I had to be extremely careful with it as it was in a cast. I patiently waited until it was time to get the cast off. The doctor was impressed with my patience and said that my arm was healing well, and I no longer needed the cast. In conclusion, these experiences have taught me that if you are patient, better things will surely come your way."
1391	19369	7	2	One time, I visited @CAPS1 world. We had to wait for approximately @NUM1 hours to board a rather unpleasant ride. Since I had my @ORGANIZATION1 with me, I played with it. However, after an hour, I grew bored. I started teasing my sisters and found it amusing to watch them get angry. But soon, I got tired of that too and simply sat down on the road.
1392	19371	7	2	In my view, patience is the state of remaining calm and quiet, rather than being overly hyperactive and irritating. It involves self - control and refraining from being rude and disrespectful to others. Patience is an important quality that helps maintain harmonious relationships and a peaceful environment.
1393	19372	7	2	One day, I was at my sister's football game. My mom dropped my sister and me off at the game as she had to go to work. When I got out of the car, she asked if I had my money. I said no, and she warned that I'd be hungry. I replied with @CAPS1. Once the game started, I got extremely hungry. I checked all my pockets and, surprisingly, found @NUM1 bucks. I went to check the length of the food line, and it was so long that it almost reached the street. I sat back down, hoping the line would shorten, but it got even longer. Then I joined the line and stood there for about @NUM2 minutes. When I finally got out of the line, I stood by the gate and watched my sister cheer. She came up to me and asked me to buy her some @CAPS3 fries. I refused because the line was too long. She pleaded, so I went back in the line, which moved much slower this time. When I returned, she asked why it took so long. I pointed to the long line. This was one of the times when I showed patience.
1394	19373	7	2	I believe patience can be exemplified by a situation where someone is waiting for another person to finish using the bathroom so they can go. For me, I'm not very patient. I want to go to a store right away, but others tell me to be patient. In my opinion, my whole family lacks patience, while my friends are more patient. This difference in patience levels can have an impact on how we handle various situations in our daily lives.
1395	19374	7	2	A time when I demonstrated patience was during a car ride to @LOCATION1. It was a @DATE1 - hour car ride, yet I remained patient and didn't complain. Unlike most kids who would constantly ask if we were there yet, I kept quiet. Even when I was extremely hungry, I sat patiently without uttering a single complaint. Finally, after @DATE1 hours, we arrived at our destination. This experience clearly shows that I was able to exercise patience during that car ride.
1396	19375	7	2	One day, I learned that we were going to @LOCATION1. We were to reach there by a large, fast boat named the Jet Express. As a result, we had to wait in a long queue. The boat was delayed, and we were informed that it would arrive late. I should have dressed more warmly as it was extremely cold. We were the first in line, which was advantageous. Throughout the wait, I remained patient and did not complain. When the boat finally arrived, I was greatly relieved, and my mother thanked me for my patience. Overall, that day turned out to be very pleasant and enjoyable.
1397	19376	7	2	When my friend went to get his medication, I sat patiently waiting for him. While waiting, I was playing @PERSON2 ping pong and uplift on my phone at a high volume. Simultaneously, I was looking for @PERSON1 and waiting for him to finish. Eventually, after some time, they both completed their tasks, and we were able to move on.
1398	19377	7	2	On @DATE1, my uncle took me to @CAPS1 Point to experience a roller - coaster, the @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The line was extremely long, and we waited for at least @NUM1 hours. The time passed slowly, but we finally got on the roller - coaster. After that, we visited the @CAPS5 thrill @CAPS6, which took approximately an hour and a half. It was a day filled with waiting and exciting rides.
1399	19378	7	2	"Patience was truly tested on this occasion. As ""@CAPS1"" @CAPS4's stomach rumbled, ""@CAPS2 I'm hungry"" I cried. So, @CAPS12 stopped at @ORGANIZATION2 since we were on our way home. Moments later, we pulled up to @ORGANIZATION2's drive - through. The cashier greeted us with ""hi @MONTH1, I'll take your @CAPS3."" @CAPS4 @CAPS2 loudly ordered ""@CAPS5 I want a famous bowl and a @NUM1 - piece honey @CAPS6 wings."" The lady at the window said ""@MONEY2 @NUM2 at the first window."" We drove around to the first window. @CAPS4 @CAPS2 gave the lady a @MONEY1 bill. @CAPS12 gave her @MONEY3 and informed her that ""@MONEY3 is your change, go to the second window."" However, before we could drive to the second window, we had to wait for the car ahead of us. We sat there for @MONEY1 minutes until it finally left. Then we drove to the second window and waited. After @CAPS13 minutes, we were still waiting. After another @MONEY1 minutes, I suggested ""@CAPS2 @CAPS5 @CAPS8 go get some @ORGANIZATION1."" @CAPS12 calmly replied ""@CAPS10, @CAPS8 are going to sit here patiently."" I murmured ""but I'm starving."" We sat there waiting patiently for over an hour. I asked one more time ""@CAPS5 @CAPS8 leave please."" @CAPS12 said ""@CAPS10, I paid for the food and I'm going to get it."" After @CAPS13 more minutes, we finally got the food after two hours. Although we got some free food, I was still mad about sitting there for so long."
1400	19379	7	2	"It was a sweltering @DATE1 day, and I decided to ride my dirt bike @CAPS1. I put on my helmet, boots, goggles, and gloves, then headed out the door to my dirt bike. I started it up and took off. Like a speeding bullet, I zoomed up one of the ramps. But when I was going too fast around a corner, I fell off, and the foot peg went into my leg. My dad came running, picked me up, and put me in the truck to go to the @CAPS2. When we arrived, my dad had to check - in, and then we sat down. There were many people there, including men, women, kids, and babies. An hour passed, and we were still sitting. Then two more hours went by, and finally, they called my name. The nurse took my dad and me to a room and said ""the doctor will be in shortly."" ""All right,"" my dad replied. An hour passed with no doctor. We started to get bored, so my dad turned on the TV. Finally, three hours after we entered the room, the doctor came in. By then, it was @NUM1 pm, and we were exhausted. The doctor took me to get an x - ray. When we got back, the doctor said I had bruised my bone, gave me crutches, and told me to stay off my leg for a week. When we got home, I relaxed on the couch and fell asleep right away. That was the time when I had to be patient for six hours in the @CAPS2."
1401	19380	7	2	I once demonstrated patience while waiting to play in basketball games for the Destroyers. In every game, I had to wait until a specific time (@DATE2). During the @DATE1 game of the season, I got into the game four times. In the first @DATE2 period, I played for about one minute, and then in the @DATE1 games, I played for @NUM1 minutes. I was glad, but I still wasn't a starter. When the playoffs came, I only played for two minutes throughout the entire game. At one point, I considered quitting, but my teammates encouraged me, saying that everyone would have their chance to start. Over the next few months, I waited patiently. Then, in the tournaments, the team was split into an older group and a younger group. Finally, I made it into the starting lineup. I was extremely excited as we entered the playoffs, but unfortunately, we lost in the championship game. This was a time when I showed patience.
1402	19381	7	2	"Patience is crucial for navigating through life. Without it, one may feel lost about their future direction. @CAPS4's uncle had to be patient for a month. He was restless, constantly waiting for a phone call. Finally, someone told him to be patient and that they would call. He admitted that being patient was the most difficult thing he had to do. He wondered why they couldn't call the next day and sometimes even forgot about it. He said he tried his best to be patient. @CAPS4's uncle was waiting to be part of America's next @CAPS1 @CAPS2. They told him they would call if he was selected. Eventually, the phone rang. A woman politely asked, ""@MONTH1, may I speak with @CAPS3 Sanders?"" @CAPS4's uncle replied, ""Yes, this is him! I've been waiting for a month! My family kept telling me to be patient! So now I won't give up anymore!"" The woman said, ""You are in! Keep practicing! Someone else will call you with the details!"" @CAPS4's uncle thanked her and hung up, exclaiming, ""I'm in!"" It was one of the happiest days for our family. @CAPS4's uncle endured a lot, and what kept him going was his patience. He told us that being patient was difficult, but it paid off in the end. As future advice, always be patient. Without patience, you won't achieve much in life. Patience is an important part of your life."
1403	19382	7	2	"One time I showed patience was when I counted a large number of coins, including pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, and more. It took me two hours to finish counting my money, and it felt like an incredibly long time. Although counting coins won't change the world, it requires a great deal of patience. I still vividly remember the moment when I completed the task. I was extremely proud of myself because I'm usually an impatient person and didn't think I could do it. Patience is essential because without it, nothing would ever get finished. I doubt I'll count coins again, but as the saying goes, ""Patience is a virtue."
1404	19383	7	2	"I was sitting in the car, waiting for @CAPS2's mom to get out of the house and into the car. Once she got in, we started our journey to the @CAPS1 party. After a couple of minutes, I got really bored. When we left Midland, I thought the journey would pass quickly, but I was wrong; it seemed to go slower than ever. I was extremely bored, and things got even worse because @CAPS2's little sisters were screaming in the backseat. Then we stopped at a gas station, and it felt like an eternity. I hardly spoke during the whole trip as I tried to be patient, but I couldn't stand it. After about an hour of the girls' screaming, I managed to calm myself down. They finally fell asleep. I just sat there, looking out of the window. When we were about forty - five minutes away, it felt like we had been driving for days. When we were probably about @NUM1 minutes away, the girls woke up and started asking, ""Are we there yet?"" @CAPS2's mom and dad just kept saying ""@CAPS3"". When we pulled into the driveway, it was probably the happiest moment of that day. I thought I was quite patient on the way there, but on the way back, I might just sleep. At the party, I was patient until it was time to open the presents, and then I got really excited. I hope next time, none of these annoying things will happen."
1405	19384	7	2	Being patient is a challenging virtue to possess. It's similar to waiting in a long line that seems to have no end. Waiting patiently in such a line can be a long - drawn - out process, but it can pass more quickly if you have something to occupy yourself. For instance, you could bring a book to read as you move up in the line. Patience is essential in such situations, and by finding a way to distract yourself, you can make the waiting process more bearable. In conclusion, although being patient is difficult, with the right strategies, it can be achieved even in the most trying circumstances.
1406	19385	7	2	Once, while exercising patience, I reached a place I've always loved, known as @CAPS1 point. I've always anticipated visiting this place, and upon arrival, I was filled with excitement. A minor drawback of this place is the need to wait, which is essentially about being patient. Patience involves waiting for someone or something. At @CAPS1 point, one has to be patient in various situations, such as during the journey there, when getting a campsite, and while standing in lines. However, in the end, it's all worthwhile as there's plenty of fun after being patient.
1407	19386	7	2	I vividly recall the time I visited the @ORGANIZATION1. It was my first - time there, and I was extremely excited. The place was colorful and noisy. I went on a few rides and then got hungry, so I went with my family to get some cotton - candy. As I was eating, I noticed a cute little girl standing in line like an angel. Suddenly, a group of teenagers cut in front of her. Despite this, she remained patient and just stood behind them. The line grew longer in a matter of minutes. I left to go on some rides and when I returned, the poor girl was still there. More people had cut in front of her, but she only mumbled to herself. I couldn't stand it! I wondered how she could tolerate such behavior. If I were her, I would have lost my patience long ago. I was truly amazed by her patience. Eventually, when she reached the front of the line, the closed sign came out. I couldn't believe she didn't get mad. She then walked over to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS4 stand and did the same thing. I couldn't watch anymore. I left with my family and kept thinking about that girl. In the end, I hoped to have as much patience as her, and just the thought of her continues to amaze me.
1408	19387	7	2	I remember a time when I showed patience. After our team scored a great @NUM1 at the football field, my friend @PERSON1 was coming back, and we planned to hang out. It took two and a half hours for him to arrive. Once he was there, we both patiently waited to play the game or do what others wanted. As the day went on, the sun was like a tanning booth, and the grass was as dry as a cactus. Eventually, when we went our separate ways, we realized that we had demonstrated patience during that day.
1409	19388	7	2	One time, when I was being patient, my friend @PERSON1 and I went to the mall around @NUM1 am to shop for new school clothes. When we arrived, the sun was shining brightly in the sky, the birds were chirping, and it was as hot as a @DATE1 day. When we entered, there were hardly any people around. But when we went to a store called???, it was so crowded that I felt like I was at a concert. We had to wait in an extremely long line; people were almost at the doors. So we waited and waited. Finally, when we reached the front of the line, the cashier said, “@CAPS1, you've waited in this long line for about @NUM2 hour. I'll give you guys a @PERCENT1 discount.” We then went shopping and were rewarded for our patience.
1410	19389	7	2	Last @DATE1, I demonstrated patience when I went to @CAPS1 point. I was about to get in line to ride the @CAPS2. At the start of the line, I saw a sign indicating a two - hour wait from that point. Since I wasn't very close to the sign, my family and I, along with others in the same position, would likely have to wait at least two and a half hours. It was a hot day, and wearing black probably wasn't the wisest choice. After waiting for about an hour, I couldn't stand the heat any longer. But I really wanted to ride, so I forced myself to wait for another hour. When I was about @NUM1 minutes away from the ride, many people left the line, which was great for me. Eventually, I reached the front, and I was glad I had been patient enough to wait that long. That was a time when I showed patience.
1411	19390	7	2	One day in the @CAPS1, I had to wait for two hours to have my stitches removed. There were a lot of people there, and we had to wait for a long time because there were only @NUM1 doctors, and one lady took an unusually long time. When it was finally my turn, I was scared that it would hurt, but it didn't hurt at all. After that, I went home.
1412	19391	7	2	"A while ago, my best friend @PERSON1's grandpa passed away. Although they were not blood - related, they were very close. At the funeral, I saw @PERSON1 and her sister @CAPS1 forcing smiles at us. @CAPS1 left to talk to my parents. Then, @PERSON1 started crying, saying that she wouldn't be able to visit her grandpa's gravestone because they were moving to @LOCATION1. She then changed the subject and talked about the good times she had with her grandpa. I laughed and smiled with her. Later, my parents said we had to go to church. I hugged her and told her everything would be okay. She smiled and said something that was hard to understand. @PERSON1's eyes filled with tears as she said, ""I don't want to move to @LOCATION1."" A few weeks later, she and her family moved to @LOCATION1."
1413	19392	7	2	Patience is shown when one waits in line. Waiting for your turn is an act of patience. Once, I showed patience by waiting on a bench to play. I didn't get to play until the fourth quarter with @NUM1 left in the game, but I remained patient. Many people have patience, but some lack manners. They don't care and start yelling and screaming. Some pop - stars, singers, and other famous people think they can cut in front of others because they are rich. However, if they weren't rich, they wouldn't be able to do so. Not all pop - stars and movie stars lack patience; when they were young, they didn't act like this. In conclusion, everyone should learn to have patience.
1414	19393	7	2	I showed patience when my mom went to the store. She would enter the store, get a basket, and spend a long time inside. She would come out with a basket filled to the brim. I would patiently wait for her. Then, she would go to a new store and do the same thing. Throughout this process, I maintained my patience.
1415	19394	7	2	Once, when my family went to @LOCATION1, we all had to be patient. There was a water ride where you got into a log, sat, and it took you up a hill. You waited until you reached the top and then splashed down the hill. This was a favorite ride for everyone, so there was a long line. We had to wait for half an hour to take the ride once. In general, to do something, it takes time, and one must be patient. If you aren't patient, you probably won't get to do what you want. So, patience is essential in such situations.
1416	19395	7	2	"Patience is the capacity to be tolerant, understanding, and confront difficulties without complaint. In my school, patience is not something that is taught. There is no assigned book titled ""Patience"" and no movie named ""Patience is the Key."" Such things do not exist, even in a world where a necklace can transform into a camera or a cell phone can serve as a gun. I have just been given my first undercover mission, and it is nothing like what I anticipated. So far, all I have done is sit on a cold bench beside the strength meter at a county fair. What people truly fail to comprehend is the patience required to be a spy. Certainly, there are occasional instances of cars being blown up, but not today, not for me. I hear the clock in my hand going ""tick, tock, tick, tock."" Suddenly, there is some action. The subject (the person I am assigned to monitor) is on the move. Oh, never mind. All the subject has done is buy a three - dollar bag of popcorn. I start to doodle a design in the dirt with my foot. I am on the verge of aborting the mission, seeing that nothing is happening. Then, all of a sudden, I find a clue. There, in the dirt right in front of me, I see a tiny computer chip. I pick it up and spray it with fingerprint - revealing mist. A purple, fluffy cloud of vapor surrounds the chip. Sure enough, when the purple cloud dissipates, I see that the subject's fingerprints are on the chip. I pull out my laptop and insert the computer chip. The words ""@CAPS1 @CAPS1"" remain on the computer screen as if they refuse to leave. I sit there, waiting, bored. I recall the importance of patience. I think to myself that if I could defeat twelve armed robbers with only a tablecloth, I can surely sit here and be patient. At least twenty minutes have passed, but it feels like twenty hours. The computer still shows ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 was successful"" on the screen. "" @CAPS2!"" I say aloud, and people start to stare, but I don't care. I click the square on the screen that says ""open."" A small message appears, saying ""@CAPS4 me at the ice cream parlor."" I close my laptop and begin to walk slowly towards the ice cream van, observing everyone and everything around me. A man wearing a yellow shirt and a lady with a purple scarf draped over her head are the only two people standing by the ice - cream stand. I walk a bit closer and realize that the man has a gun. I draw my own, and with a few loud shots, they are both in handcuffs. Of course, they were both working with the main suspect. I would never have been able to successfully complete my mission without being patient."
1417	19396	7	2	I recall a time when I showed great patience. I was so patient that the doctor rewarded me with a sucker. I was being patient because the doctor was searching for a needle to inject into my arm. He told me to wait a moment, but in reality, I was waiting for hours. My mom could no longer wait; she was on the verge of taking me home. I advised her to be patient, saying that time would seem to pass more quickly. She said she would try, but if it didn't work, we would leave. She waited patiently, and soon enough, the doctor returned to the room and thanked us for our patience. He was still looking for the needle, and then he came back again and said he had found it. It was in the other doctor's room, on the dresser above the sink. After I received my shot, the doctor thanked both me and my mom for being patient and not leaving. After the thanks, he gave me a sucker and shook my hand. My mom and I then left the doctor's office and went to the store to get something to eat. This experience shows that patience can lead to positive outcomes and make difficult situations more bearable.
1418	19397	7	2	So, you want a story about patience? Well, you're in luck. The story begins with me at the doctor's office, waiting. I knew I'd be sitting there for a few hours, so I thought I'd read something. As I was reading, all I could hear was kids whining and screaming. I managed to calm the crying kid and the panicked mom, which made me feel good. Then, my sister Cheris came up and screamed in my ear. I was really annoyed but not angry, so I just got another thing (it's not clear what in the original). Then my mom said it would be another hour. I got so mad that I screamed. This is a true story, and even though I got angry at one point, I was generally patient. In conclusion, patience can be difficult to maintain, especially in a noisy and frustrating environment like a doctor's office, but it's still important to try.
1419	19398	7	2	I showed patience when we were going to have lunch. I stood there patiently, and we eventually got our lunch. I also remember a time when my friend was patient. We were at the water fountain to get some water, and some other people came up to the water fountain to get water too. My friend waited patiently. These instances show that patience is a valuable trait in daily life, whether it's waiting for food or waiting for a turn at a water fountain. It helps to keep things running smoothly and avoid unnecessary conflicts.
1420	19400	7	2	Without patience, a person can easily be broken. A lack of patience can quickly trigger a person to do something terrible. I, for example, usually have patience, but there are certain times when I struggle to be patient. If everyone lacked patience, the whole world would be out of control. This is why most business plans aim to achieve their goals as quickly as possible. Patience is essential for maintaining order and achieving success. In conclusion, patience is a fundamental quality that is necessary for both individuals and the world at large. It helps us to stay calm, make rational decisions, and work towards our goals without being derailed by impatience.
1421	19401	7	2	When I was a patient little one, I recall writing an article at Sea World. I didn't complain because I knew rewards would come. Meanwhile, my sister, in a bad mood, was complaining. We queued for @NUM1 minutes for a ride called @CAPS1 Drop, though I can't quite remember precisely. Then there was another line at an unspecified place for an unknown reason. We waited @NUM2 minutes, including the time for everyone to exit. In the end, despite the waits, it was an experience I still remember.
1422	19402	7	2	A few years ago, during the @DATE1 break, my family and I traveled to @LOCATION1. When it was time to return home, we had to wait for a plane. We woke up very early to pack and reach the airport. Once there, we patiently returned the rental car and went through security. After passing through security, we had to wait for the plane to arrive. We sat for over an hour before the plane finally came in. Then, we waited for the plane to be cleaned, passes to be checked, and for everyone to board. It was a long - awaited journey, but I managed to be patient throughout the entire process.
1423	19403	7	2	"A while back, I went on a trip to Cedar Point in @LOCATION1. It was an hour and thirty - minute drive to get there. The reason for our visit was related to my dad's work at @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I got out of the car with @NUM1 and waited for the rest of my family. Finally, at @DATE1, we all rushed into the park. My dad pointed out the height limits. Being only @NUM2 and 4.@NUM2 feet tall, I wasn't tall enough for most of the @CAPS4 rides. However, my dad noticed that I was tall enough for the @CAPS5 @CAPS6. We walked around looking for the ride and, more importantly, the line. When we finally found the ride, I was shocked by the long line. I thought, ""No @CAPS7 luck getting to that ride."" My father asked about mom and Will, and I pointed to the Ferris wheel where they were hiding. We got in the line and sighed. It was at least @NUM4 degrees. After waiting for almost two hours, we reached the front. We got into the chair, and a bar came over us. I remembered someone saying to put a quarter on your leg and let gravity take hold. A minute later, we were going down like a meteor, and the quarter didn't float! The ride was over in a flash, and in the end, it wasn't really worth the long wait, but I'm not a coward."
1424	19404	7	2	Over the @DATE1, my sister, cousin Grace, uncle Rege, and I planned to go to the Gnate Wolf Lodge. However, uncle Rege had to reschedule because his plane was going to be late. Then, his car broke down. So, we rented a car. We picked up my uncle @PERSON1 and headed on our way. Unfortunately, we were stopped by a cop and got a ticket for speeding. Finally, we arrived at the lodge, and those two days turned out to be the best of my life.
1425	19405	7	2	"The story I'm about to tell is about patience. One day, a boy and his father went fishing. When they arrived at the fishing spot, they put the bait in the water and started their fishing trip. The boy was impatient and kept fidgeting. Unfortunately, he caught nothing. When they got home, his dad came over and said, ""Son, if you caught something every time you fished, it would be killing, not fishing."" The next day, they went out again. Since the boy was patient this time, he caught a fish. The boy learned that patience pays off. As the saying goes, ""All good things come to those who are patient."
1426	19406	7	2	My mother was hospitalized for a life - threatening surgery. This is a story about a time when I had to be patient. For two years, my mother had not been feeling well. When she went for a check - up, it was discovered that she had heart disease with @NUM1 main artery blockages.  I had to wait while she was being prepared for the surgery. Those two hours seemed interminable. After that, I was able to see her for just five minutes before she was taken to the operating room. The surgery lasted five hours. I sat in the waiting room after school, doing my homework and reading magazines. I was extremely worried about my mother.  After the surgery, the doctor informed us that no one could see her for an entire day. I had to exercise patience and wait until the next day. In the end, my patience paid off.
1427	19408	7	2	There was a boy who wanted to go to the gym. When he arrived, there was a particular basketball he desired. As he was getting dressed, other boys went out first and took the ball. When he finally got out, he saw that they had it. He got angry and took the ball from them.  After the incident, he went back and gave the ball to them, saying, “I can wait.” When the other boys were done, he got the ball. He was overjoyed and proud that he finally had the basketball.  When he got home, he told his mom about it. His mom said she was happy because he had finally learned to be patient. The boy asked, “What is that?” His mom explained that patience is the ability to understand and tolerate. The boy was very happy because he used to always take things without waiting, but now he could wait and be content. That boy now lives happily with his mom in high school, patiently moving forward.
1428	19409	7	2	Yesterday, I demonstrated patience. I finished the @CAPS1 before many others and then spent the next @NUM1 minutes drawing. I remained patient throughout this period because if I hadn't, I might have made a lot of noise and disrupted my classmates.  I started to draw, or color as some might call it. Instead of drawing a smiley face, I colored in boxes on math graphing paper to create a lime - green and purple checkerboard. It took the entire time, and I still haven't finished it. This is a time I clearly remember when I was quite patient.
1429	19410	7	2	One time, I showed patience at the doctor's office. When I was little, I used to run around at the doctor's without a care. This time, my mom didn't trust me, so she followed me everywhere. There were some girls around, and I felt embarrassed. I asked my mom why she was following me, and she said she didn't want me running all over the place.  I told her that I was older now, not a little kid, and that I was mature. She then said I could go ahead. I went and sat next to some girls and started talking to them. We got up and walked around while chatting. I had a strange feeling in my head, like my mom was still following me. When I turned around, she wasn't there.  We went to the snack room, sat down, and ate. I happened to look over and saw my mom sitting at the third table away from us. We then took the elevator back to our original place. To my surprise, she was already there. I told the girl I'd be back and sat next to my mom. I asked if she had been following me, and she first said yes, then quickly corrected herself to no. We had a talk and came to an understanding. Soon after, it was my turn to see the doctor. This concludes my story.
1430	19411	7	2	One time, I was patient when my brother was riding something very quickly. I had to wait and wait for him to finish. He said I couldn't ride it, but I told him I would wait. He had been riding it for hours. Finally, the thing ran out of gear, and he said, “Now you can ride it.” I replied coolly. In the end, my patience allowed me to get my turn to ride, and it was worth the wait.
1431	19412	7	2	Patience is demonstrated through understanding and tolerance, as well as the ability to endure difficulties without complaint. One instance when I showed patience was when my baby sister was due to be born. She was expected on the twenty - second of @DATE1. On that day, I was eager for my mom to grab her pre - packed bags and head to the hospital, but she seemed calm. It wasn't until one week and two days later that she went into labor. I waited patiently in the waiting room with my dad and big brother. When the nurse finally allowed us in, seeing my baby sister's face almost made me cry. I knew I would love her, and I hoped she'd be as patient as I was. My patience during those nine days of waiting was truly tested, but it held strong.
1432	19413	7	2	I'm part of the @LOCATION3 @CAPS1 sea cadet corps. After packing my things into the truck, I faced a @NUM1 - hour car ride to my training at port @LOCATION2. The truck, which was meant for five people, had @NUM2 of us squeezed in. I was stuck in the back with all the gear. A sea bag with a boat in it was pressing into my back. I tried hard not to complain, but halfway through the journey, I had to move the bag. Just when I thought things would get better, @CAPS2 and @LOCATION1 started singing an annoying song. I wasn't sure my patience could handle it. Finally, we reached port @LOCATION2, and they stopped singing. But then, there was a long check - in line with @NUM3 people in @CAPS3 waiting to be checked. The old officer at the desk talked very slowly, making it hard to understand him. Despite all these challenges, my patience survived. Then I found out my friend Logon was there, and he can be quite annoying. It was yet another test for my patience. Throughout the ride, the check - in line, and the training, my patience was put to the test, but it remained strong.
1433	19414	7	2	It was about a @NUM1 - hour drive to Freedom Hill from our house. Dad, Mum, @CAPS1, and I were going to see Buddy Guy, and the concert was expected to last @NUM1 and a half hours. When we pulled into the parking lot, a policeman directed us to an open spot for the jeep. We got out, had some pop and sandwiches as we had about an hour before the concert started. After @NUM3 or maybe @NUM4 minutes, we bought tickets and found a spot on the hill. Once seated, time seemed to stand still. I waited, thinking @NUM5 minutes had passed, expecting Buddy to come on stage any second, but he didn't. After what felt like @NUM6 minutes, I asked my dad how long it had been since we sat down. He said about five minutes, which I thought was a lie. I asked again, and he said six minutes. I was on the verge of losing it. I tried to sleep to pass the time, but the noise was too much. Then someone announced that the performance would start in @NUM7 minutes. It was so disappointing as the wait was only half over. Finally, after @NUM7 minutes of waiting, Buddy walked on stage. It was the best sight, and the long wait was definitely worth it. We enjoyed the rest of the night at the concert.
1434	19415	7	2	In gymnastics, patience is crucial in multiple aspects. Your mind and body both need to exercise patience, and you also have to be patient with your coach. Your mind has to be patient when you want to perform certain skills but aren't physically or technically ready. Your body has to be patient when it feels capable, yet your mind tells you to hold back. Coaches are always helping, so you may have to wait @NUM1 minutes for their assistance. Patience is an essential life skill that everyone should possess as it helps in learning and progressing in activities like gymnastics.
1435	19416	7	2	When I was at Universal Studios, I showed great patience while waiting in long lines for the rides. My dad and I were in line for a dragon rollercoaster. We were almost next when it started raining and lightning. Many people left, and we ended up at the front of the line. However, the bad weather didn't stop, and we waited for another hour or two. In our eagerness, we even forgot about my mom and brothers and left the line. Then we got in line for a new ride. Since it was new, the line was long. We waited for quite a while, but when we finally got on the ride, we realized the wait was worth it, so we went again. My patience during those long waits at the park was well - rewarded.
1436	19417	7	2	"When I was @NUM1 years old, I had my first visit to the doctor. It was extremely nerve - wracking. I sat in a chair beside my mother, shaking and constantly wondering for @NUM2. I was running around, and when I finally sat down, I exclaimed, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!! I can't be patient any longer."" So, when the nurse called for the next patient, I walked out the door. I thought, ""Well, that wasn't long, only about @NUM3 and a Ω."" My mother said, ""@CAPS4 it's only @NUM4, and we arrived at @TIME1. That wasn't long."" Next time I go to the doctor, I'll be more patient."
1437	19419	7	2	"Patience implies understanding and tolerance. A patient individual endures difficulties without complaining. I am writing about an incident where my friend @PERSON1's partner showed patience. As @PERSON1 was leaving to spend the entire @DATE1 in the upper peninsula of @ORGANIZATION1, he said, ""@CAPS1"". @PERSON1 and his partner had been dating since the start of the year. She was sad. After @CAPS2 weeks had passed, it was the beginning of a new school year. She had patiently waited throughout @DATE1 to see him again. Finally, on the first day of school, she skipped up to him, but he was called away. After a few confusing weeks, she asked him, ""Are you dumping me or...?"" He thought about it for a long time. She patiently awaited an answer, but it never came. Eventually, she decided to break up with him, but she didn't. So, Gabby and I did it for her. On the outside, she seemed angry, but inside, she was probably screaming. Today, she has ""moved on"" and is now dating a boy named @PERSON2."
1438	19420	7	2	There was a day when I was extremely sluggish. I did everything slowly. I got ready for school at a snail's pace, walked slowly, and talked slowly. My mother was very patient with me. All she did was encourage me to move faster. She tried to motivate me and help me get ready for school. She brought me my breakfast and put all my books into my backpack. At the end of the day, I thanked her for being so patient with me. That was the day someone showed patience towards me.
1439	19421	7	2	"For @CAPS4, being patient means not complaining when you order something and it takes a long time to arrive, which is what kids often do. I've been patient many times in my life, but one instance comes to mind when I think of patience. One @TIME1, I woke up at @TIME1 to go take passport pictures. I thought it wouldn't be busy there, but I was wrong. I started getting dressed. By the time I was done, the clock struck @NUM1. I got in the car and we were on our way. @CAPS4 and my little brother turned up the music and started singing, ""I @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4."" Our parents got so annoyed that they turned off the music to make us stop singing. ""Mom, that's our favorite song,"" we said. ""You have reached your destination. Finally, things were getting a bit chaotic here,"" I thought. When we got into the waiting room, we almost fainted because of the large number of people. ""Let's calm down. How long can it take?"" a deep voice in my head said. ""Two hours later,"" it seemed. My brother made a bet with me. ""If you don't lose your temper before it's our turn to take the pictures, I'll do anything you want for a week."" ""You have yourself a deal."" It took another @NUM3 hours, and I was about to scream. I started falling asleep, and then the man with a long white beard and glasses said, ""The @PERSON1 family, your turn."" We finally went in and finished taking the pictures. ""Yes, I win! I won the bet,"" I said with a big smile. ""You have to do anything I want."" I was so happy that I did my victory dance, while the man stared at me like I was crazy. We took our pictures and left. Patience means waiting without whining. Everyone has to be patient in life, just like I was."
1440	19422	7	2	"During the @DATE1, my father, my brother, and I went to @CAPS1 point. It was very hot, but we didn't care because we really wanted to ride the Millennium Force. We found the ride, but when we saw the line, it was incredibly long. It snaked around the ride almost twice. So, we went to the end of the line and sat in the scorching sun for half an hour until we found shelter under a tent, which made it a bit cooler. As time passed, my brother lost his temper. He started yelling and screaming at the top of his lungs, ""I can't wait here any longer!"" Then he went under something and ran off. My father told me to wait in line while he ran after my brother. I waited for an hour. Finally, it was my turn to get on the ride, but my father and brother weren't there. So, I decided to wait in the line near the front of the ride. When I got on, they still weren't there. The ride took off, and it wasn't as great without them."
1441	19423	7	2	My father serves in @ORGANIZATION1, often away for extended periods. The only time he visits us is around @DATE1, close to my birthday. However, one year, he couldn't come home as planned. He sent a letter stating that all the troops were being retained for an additional six months. I was extremely depressed for a long time. But then I realized that even though his return was delayed, there was still hope that he would come back. So, I decided to be patient instead of disappointed. Our family sent him care packages. Eventually, he did return. It was a difficult time, but through patience, we got through it.
1442	19424	7	2	When it comes to patience, one must remain relaxed. For instance, when going to the doctor, one has to exercise patience throughout the process. Even after getting home, there may be situations where patience is required while waiting for someone. Therefore, it is important to be patient in every aspect of life. By cultivating patience, we can better handle various situations and maintain a calm and composed mindset.
1443	19425	7	2	I decided to write about a time when I was patient. One time, my family and I went to @ORGANIZATION2. We were eager to go on the @ORGANIZATION3, but the line was extremely long. I was the only one who got to go on the @ORGANIZATION3 because I stayed in line. Meanwhile, my family kept going on different rides like the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ride, the @CAPS3, or even the @ORGANIZATION1. While I was in line at the @ORGANIZATION3, at the Ferris wheel and the fun - house later that same day, I also had to wait in a long line at the cash register at @ORGANIZATION2. By the time I reached the cash register, my family was getting massages. Overall, I was patient throughout our time at @ORGANIZATION2.
1444	19427	7	2	"RREEE!"" The bus stopped, and we finally arrived. It took a great deal of patience for me to stay quiet and not shout with excitement. I had to learn a lot about patience during the entire trip. On @DATE1, I was with a group of fellow fifth - graders. We were divided into groups, unpacked, and ready for our three - day stay at @ORGANIZATION1. I was so excited that my friends told me to calm down and be patient. I felt a bit embarrassed, but I didn't care. Eventually, I composed myself and kept calm. In @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, I was stuck on how to create something for @ORGANIZATION1. A friend in my group, @PERSON1, gave me some ideas. Although I had my own thoughts, I stayed calm and listened to her. Her ideas were actually quite good, and I used some of them in my painting. Now, at the nearly @NUM1 - feet - high ladder, I had already gone up and zipped down the exciting yet scary @CAPS3. I was helping others up the ladder, and it was really testing my patience as they took so long. I was about to yell at one guy, but I told myself to be patient. There was a kid named @CAPS5 who sometimes just sat on one of the big wooden planks. When I asked why, their response was hilarious. They said he was trying to be like @CAPS6 and fly to the top. At the end of the three - day field trip, my patience had significantly grown. I learned that even when others are being slow or acting foolishly, I should stay calm and not let my impatience get the better of me."
1445	19428	7	2	"One day, I was watching @CAPS1, but I was bored because there was nothing interesting on. My mom was using the computer, and I asked her if I could use it. She said I could in @NUM1 minutes. I patiently waited for her to finish. Finally, she said, ""Ok, now you can go on."" I thanked her, and she replied, ""You're welcome."" It was a simple situation, but it showed that I was able to be patient. This was one of those times when I had to wait patiently to use the computer, and I learned that patience can help us get what we want in a civilized way."
1446	19429	7	2	One time, during an adventure that included @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4, we spent most of @CAPS3 near the water park. It was an enjoyable experience. I spent a significant amount of time in the pool at @CAPS5 and on the @CAPS6 @CAPS7, which was my favorite. As we started to get tired of the water park, we decided to go on the rides. We were trying to decide whether to go on??? or the @CAPS8. I chose to go on???. When we arrived, the wait was about an hour. Despite the long wait, we remained in line. Subsequently, the ride was experiencing some issues, and after an announcement, we decided to go for @CAPS5 thunder @CAPS15 @CAPS16. Unfortunately, the park was closing, and we regretted staying at the water park for so long on @DATE1. I resolved to come back next year. This experience shows that I have had a memorable time at the park.
1447	19430	7	2	One time I had to exercise patience was on my birthday. That year, my grandparents were late for my birthday celebration. I had to wait for a few hours, sitting patiently until they arrived. When they finally got there, we had the opportunity to eat cake. After that, I opened my presents. It took them approximately @NUM1 hour to reach our place. This experience taught me the value of patience in waiting for something enjoyable.
1448	19431	7	2	"We are at Cedar Point, and I was extremely excited, almost feeling like I was going crazy. I asked, ""Can we go on the Dragster first?"" The response was, ""Why not? It'll be fun."" When we got in line, it was estimated that we would have to wait about an hour. I was asked, ""Do you still want to ride the ride?"" I replied affirmatively, knowing that I had to be patient before I could take the ride. While waiting, it was hot, and every minute felt like an hour. However, I was confident that patience would pay off. After @NUM2 minutes, the Dragster came into sight. As we were second in line, a blue, long Dragster car zoomed by and then stopped. It was as if it was meant for me. I got in, and after what seemed like @NUM3 minutes, the ride started. At @NUM5, we went up the hill, and it felt like a meteorite crashing down to Earth. When the ride ended, I realized that my patience had truly paid off. From that day on, I have always been patient because of the Cedar Point Dragster experience."
1449	19432	7	2	I am writing a story about a time when I demonstrated patience. When I was in @NUM1 grade, I went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1 with my mom and dad. We placed an order and waited. The waiter informed us that it would take about @NUM2 minutes for our food to arrive. However, the food did not come after @NUM2 minutes, nor after @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6, or even @NUM7 minutes. It finally arrived after an hour and @NUM8 minutes. Throughout the wait, I became increasingly hungry, but I did not complain or yell. Instead, I sat patiently in my seat, which shows that I was able to be patient in that situation.
1450	19433	7	2	On the same day as a meaping event, I hurt my hand and had to be patient. I fell in the hall and went to the office, where I patiently waited for them to call my mom to pick me up. When my mom arrived, she said she would take me to the @CAPS1 room. It took some time to find a parking spot when we got there. Even though my hand was hurting, I remained patient. Eventually, we found a spot and went inside. My mom went to the front desk to inform them of our arrival. We waited for a short while, and then a nurse came out and led us to a room to talk. She told me that I would have to wait for a bed to become available for x - rays. Through the window, I saw a lady who I knew was for me. She opened the doors and asked for @PERSON1. She guided us to a room where we waited for about forty - five minutes for a doctor to come and take us to the x - ray room. After the x - rays were done, we went back to the room and waited some more. Finally, the doctor came in and said that I had not broken anything. He gave me a brace, and I went home. Throughout all of these events, I remained patient, which shows my ability to endure difficult situations calmly.
1451	19434	7	2	When my birthday arrived, I remained patient. I'm looking forward to my party at my dad's house on @DATE1. My birthday was on @NUM1 of @DATE2. My dad is getting me a @CAPS1Æ for my birthday. Despite the anticipation, I'm keeping my patience in check as I await these exciting events.
1452	19435	7	2	ì@CAPS1 In another @NUM1 days, I'll be on my way to Cedar Point. I'm curious about what we'll do upon arrival and which ride will become my favorite. Perhaps I can convince my mom to start the trip @NUM1 days earlier.î ì@CAPS2, mom,î @PERSON1 said. ì@CAPS3,î her mother replied. ì@CAPS4 Can we go to Cedar Point now?î ì@CAPS5, sweetie, our tickets are for @DATE1. You'll have to be patient.î ìOkay, I'll do my best.î ìThat's my girl!î As @PERSON1 headed to her room, she thought that distracting herself might help her forget the anticipation. So, she called her friend @CAPS6 to see if she'd like to come over. @CAPS6 agreed. The doorbell rang. ì@CAPS2, @CAPS6, do you want to play in my room?î That night, @CAPS6 went home, and @PERSON1 went to bed. @NUM3 days passed. Only one more day to go! That night, @PERSON1 went to bed around @NUM4 to rest up for the trip. To her surprise, she woke up a couple of hours later. She was so excited that she couldn't sleep. Eventually, she fell asleep, and they left early the next morning.
1453	19436	7	2	Patience has its uses in certain situations, such as waiting for a blood test. However, in other contexts, like in the army, patience can be ineffective as soldiers may sometimes wait in a life - threatening situation, at the mercy of the enemy. Generally, patience is beneficial because hasty actions can lead to harming someone, missing useful opportunities, or overlooking enjoyable experiences.
1454	19437	7	2	One time I had to be extremely patient was when I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2, waiting to get on the dragster. The line was incredibly long, and we waited for @NUM1 hours but were still in line, exercising patience. Finally, when we reached the front, they announced that the ride would be closed for a while as they needed to check something, and it took them a full hour to fix it. So, we went to the other side of the park and waited for the train. It took @NUM2 minutes for the train to arrive. When we got to the other side, the line for the 'Shoot the Rapids' ride I wanted to go on was also very long. We waited and waited until it was our turn. It was a fun ride. After that, we took the train back to the other side. The line for the dragster was long again, but we waited, and eventually, it was our turn. That day was the worst as I had to wait and wait for so long. It was the first time I had to hold my patience for such an extended period; I was almost losing my mind. But we made it through, and we're going back this @CAPS3.
1455	19438	7	2	There was a time when I had to be patient. I went to a park and had to wait in line for about two hours. I was so bored just standing there, but I really wanted to go on the rides, so I endured the wait. I tried to be patient the whole time in the line so that I could get my turn to go on the rides. Standing there for so long made my feet hurt badly. Finally, I reached the front of the line to get my ticket. I was overjoyed. That was definitely a time when I managed to be patient.
1456	19439	7	2	I exhibit patience when my family, friends, or teachers are speaking. I refrain from interrupting them and wait until they have finished before I start talking. Additionally, I am polite both in class and at home. I do not speak out of turn. Moreover, I am kind to others, never being mean, and I listen to what they have to say. At school, there are times when one must wait for their turn, such as when getting a drink, getting lunch, or lining up single - file for a fire drill. One can also show kindness and patience by helping someone who is not yet done. These are the actions I take to be patient.
1457	19440	7	2	"Hello, I'm @PERSON1. I'd like to share a time when I was patient. My mom and step - dad were taking me and my step - sister to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. However, there was a condition: we couldn't ask ""Are we there yet"". So, we had to endure a long journey. But when we finally arrived, it was truly worth the wait. This experience taught me that patience can lead to rewarding outcomes."
1458	19441	7	2	"Patience can be difficult to attain at times, but it is not a reason to give up. Persistence is key to success, while impatience often leads to failure. To illustrate the importance of patience, let's look at a well - known fable. Every year in the fall, a significant race occurs, attracting all the animals in the forest. It is a tradition that each year, a slow animal and a fast one compete to determine the champion. At that time, the @CAPS5 was the fastest animal in the forest. @CAPS11 had participated before and won once. This year, the @CAPS15 signed up to compete. @CAPS11 was overconfident and thought the @CAPS15, being slow, could never be a champion.  The announcer shouted, ""Runners get ready!"" The @CAPS5 and @CAPS15 lined up. With the start signal of ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4!!"", the @CAPS5 rushed ahead, while the @CAPS15 waited patiently behind. The @CAPS5 ran as if victory was already theirs, never looking back. Meanwhile, the @CAPS15 continued at a slow but steady pace towards the finish line.  Suddenly, the @CAPS5 stopped, hearing a strange noise. It was the rumbling of its empty stomach. The @CAPS5, so absorbed in the race, hadn't realized how hungry it was. It decided to have ""just one little handful of berries"". One handful turned into many, and then the @CAPS5 felt full and a bit sleepy. Thinking the @CAPS15 would never catch up, it lay down for a nap.  Unbeknownst to the @CAPS5, while it was eating and sleeping, the @CAPS15 was steadily catching up. The @CAPS15 saw the sleeping @CAPS5 and, out of concern that it might be sick, continued its slow journey up the hill to the finish line. The @CAPS5 woke up to the sound of cheering. It stood up, only to find that the @CAPS15 had already won. If the @CAPS5 had been patient, it might have claimed the victory. This story clearly shows that patience can overcome speed and overconfidence."
1459	19442	7	2	"In my thirteen years of experience, I've been on many roller - coasters. Usually, there's a two - hour wait when it comes to roller - coaster rides. On @DATE1 @NUM1, I took my best friend @PERSON1 to ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2."" We got in line for a ride called ""The @CAPS3."" When we reached the entrance, the staff said there was a forty - five - minute wait. But then the ride broke down for over three hours. Eventually, the ride was operational again, but it took another half - hour for testing. After that, there was a two - hour wait for those at the back of the line. Since we were at the front, it didn't affect us much. Finally, we got to ride it, and it was completely worth the wait. Most of the lines later that day were short, but still about an hour. I sincerely hope that next time the ride doesn't break down."
1460	19443	7	2	I recall a time long ago when I was patient for approximately four months. I was eagerly awaiting the release of the video - game system @CAPS1. There was a new, high - tech, and amazing game system called @CAPS1 produced by @ORGANIZATION1. Everyone, including me, was excited to get it. However, it was sold out everywhere. For Christmas, my dad promised to get me one. I was overjoyed, but we both knew it would take a while.  I waited and waited. Then, one night around @TIME1, my dad woke me up and said that many @CAPS3 were being sold. We quickly got in the car, drove to the store, and waited in line for a long time. Finally, it was our turn. We bought the @CAPS1, went home, and set it up. The next day, I finally got to play on my @CAPS1. This is the story of a time when my patience paid off.
1461	19444	7	2	A couple of weeks ago, before school started, my mom went to the doctor. We arrived at around @NUM1 and didn't leave until @NUM2. To pass the time, my little sister and I entertained ourselves. We watched TV, played on our iPods, and told stories because we were extremely bored. Once those activities lost their appeal, we were left with no choice but to sit and wait. I kept thinking about how long it would be until we could leave. Eventually, we both dozed off. Suddenly, I felt someone shaking me and heard my mom calling my name, “Lexi Taylor,” over and over until we woke up. After that, we were ready to go to the mall. We spent the rest of that day at the mall. That's the story of the time I had to be patient while sitting in a doctor's office.
1462	19445	7	2	“@CAPS1, can I get a puppy?” “@CAPS2” “@CAPS3 @CAPS1” “@CAPS4 in the @DATE1, just be patient.” “@CAPS5.” @CAPS6 @CAPS7 walked downstairs to sulk. She came up with a brilliant plan to make the @NUM1 days until @DATE1 pass more quickly. She decided to make a paper chain with @NUM1 links. Each day, she ripped one link off. She continued this way, ripping off links day after day. Before she knew it, it was @DATE1. @CAPS7 sprang out of bed, ripped off the last link, and said, “@CAPS1, can I have a puppy yet? I was patient.” “@CAPS13 you see,” said her @CAPS1. “Your dad and I have been thinking, and it's a big responsibility, so @CAPS4 next @DATE1.” “@CAPS14, I'll be patient.” In the end, she understood that waiting was necessary and was willing to be patient once again.
1463	19446	7	2	This is a story about a vampire named @CAPS1 who attends a regular middle school. On the first day of school, @CAPS1 was waiting in a long line to get his schedule and locker combination. He was late, so he had to get in the back of the line. The person in front of him kept complaining, which annoyed @CAPS1. “This will take forever!” the person in front complained. “@CAPS3, shut up, man. I don't like this any more than you do, but do you see me complaining?” @CAPS1 exclaimed. Everyone in the gymnasium stopped talking and looked in his direction. After @NUM1 long minutes of listening to music on his iPod @CAPS5, he was @NUM2 people away from the front of the line. Then, a blonde girl said, “@CAPS3, this isn't my schedule!” The person distributing the schedules had to call everyone back to check who had her schedule. Another @NUM1 minutes passed before @CAPS1 finally got his schedule. If @CAPS1 hadn't been patient, he wouldn't have been able to endure the @NUM4 minutes in line. Fortunately, he brought his iPod @CAPS5. His patience paid off in the end.
1464	19447	7	2	I was patient when I waited for @NUM1 to @NUM2 whole months for my baby brother, @PERSON1, who is @NUM3 now. It felt like an eternity, as if @NUM2,000 years had passed. The wait was so long that I could hardly stand it, but I had to be patient. He was due on @DATE2, but he was born on @DATE1 instead. Finally, at @NUM5 am on @DATE1, my brother @PERSON1 was born after those @NUM2 long months. This was a time when I truly had to exercise patience, and the arrival of my brother made the wait worthwhile.
1465	19448	7	2	I remember when my family - my brother, dad, mom, and I - went to Cedar Point. I was eager to go on many rides, but they all had long lines. We waited for an hour to get on the Raptor. When we finally got on, the ride seemed even longer than the wait in line; it felt like @NUM1 hours because of its intensity. Then, we saw the [ride name with the missing description]. The line for it was much longer than the Raptor's, about 3 - @NUM1 hours. When we reached the top of the stairs, the ride was a lot of fun. My brother stopped complaining because he was excited. After the ride, we had to leave. We only spent our time waiting in lines, but it was still a fun experience. That was a time when I showed patience, and the enjoyment of the rides made the waiting worth it.
1466	19449	7	2	In a play titled @CAPS1 childrenís @CAPS2, my friend and others demonstrated loyalty. They gather once a year. Everyone prepares, learns their roles, and within a week, we stage a performance. We showed loyalty by having faith in one another. When on stage in front of an audience, mutual support is essential. If someone forgets to enter on time, you remind them next time. If someone forgets their line, you help by saying it for them. We showed loyalty to each other throughout @NUM1 days. Thanks to this support, the play turns out excellently every year.
1467	19450	7	2	Approximately a week ago, I broke my finger while at the @CAPS1.R. Despite the pain and inconvenience, I remained patient. This incident tested my patience, but I managed to stay calm and endure the situation. In the end, my ability to be patient during this difficult time helped me cope better.
1468	19451	7	2	I'm not typically a patient person, but there was a memorable occasion in my @NUM1th - grade when I showed extreme patience. I was involved in an activity with Mrs. Bowos' @NUM2nd - grade class. We would visit their class regularly. As expected, @NUM2nd - graders are often poor readers, and there was one girl who really struggled. @PERSON1 would send us to assist her. She had a hard time and would sometimes shut the book as if it were on fire. But I remained patient. Every time she stopped reading, I encouraged her to continue. When she threw the book on the floor, I picked it up. Eventually, she realized that such actions were unproductive and started to read. I patiently helped her sound out unknown words. As time passed, her reading skills improved significantly, and she no longer needed my help. I was truly proud of myself for being patient in this situation.
1469	19454	7	2	In my view, patience means waiting for someone to finish what they're doing. If you rush them, they're likely to make mistakes or do things incorrectly. Being patient is not only an important quality but also a sign of respect towards others. It shows that you're not being rude. By being patient, we create a more harmonious and understanding environment, which is beneficial for everyone involved.
1470	19455	7	2	There have been numerous instances where I've shown patience, and one such time was just yesterday during the meap test. After finishing my part, I sat there, reading and drawing. It was excruciatingly boring; each second seemed like an hour. It was a truly terrible experience, but I didn't complain. I simply sat quietly, even though I really wanted to talk. This was probably one of the toughest times to remain silent, but my patience prevailed.
1471	19456	7	2	One time, while I was in school during a math class, I was eager to go to my friend's place at @ORGANIZATION1. I kept waiting and watching the clock, but it seemed to move so slowly. Frustrated, I started doing my class - work. When the bell at @ORGANIZATION2 rang, I was disappointed again. There was only one @CAPS5, and it wasn't a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 because of the meap. So, there was only a @CAPS9 @CAPS10 in all classes. We had only @NUM1 minutes left until the time was up. I waited some more, and @NUM2 minutes passed. Then, me and my friend... That was good, as @NUM2 minutes were also gone. As more time passed, with @NUM4, @NUM5 minutes and so on ticking away, only @NUM1 seconds remained. Then the bell at @ORGANIZATION2 rang, and that's what happened when the time ended.
1472	19457	7	2	One day at a pizza place, many people lined up for the hot - and - ready pizzas. The line was long, and everyone was getting angry and screaming because they expected the pizzas to be ready right away. People were throwing tantrums. Meanwhile, the kids sat quietly on the little benches, observing the adults' outbursts. The employees at the pizza place were trying their best to handle the large crowd. No one showed any patience; they only cared about getting their pizza. Strangely, the hungry little kids were more patient than the angry adults. The adults were whining, and others told them to be quiet. One person patiently waited in line without saying a word. Eventually, everyone calmed down, and smiles returned to their faces. Everyone got their pizzas quickly. This shows that patience is always a virtue.
1473	19458	7	2	I asked my mom if I could have something to eat. She didn't say yes, so I waited and waited. Then I went upstairs and continued waiting. I was hungry, but I remained patient throughout. I'm usually used to being patient in situations like this. Another time, on Thanksgiving, I was patient again. They were cooking the food, but it wasn't ready yet. Our stomachs were growling, but I waited until the food was finally cooked. I truly was a person of patience, waiting until the food was ready.
1474	19459	7	2	Patience is a trait that varies among individuals. It reveals one's character to others. Being patient can be challenging at times, but we all manage to persevere. For instance, I once went to a restaurant where it took ages for our food to arrive. After placing our order, I sat at the table and got bored. So, I decided to color with the crayons I had. Once I finished coloring, I needed to find another way to pass the time. Since my mom was talking, I joined in and talked for a long while. Then the bread arrived, and I ate it for some time before getting bored again. The waiter informed us that our food would be out soon. I continued chatting and even went to the bathroom. When I returned, our food was on the table. I sat down and enjoyed the delicious meal. This experience shows that patience is rewarded. Good things come to those who are patient. If you're not a patient person, you can work on becoming one. It's not difficult; just keep yourself occupied.
1475	19460	7	2	"There was a time when I had to be patient after finishing my books. At school, we had something called teacher talks, where we told the teacher about the books we'd finished. I completed @NUM1 books, specifically the last two books of ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Saints"". I wrote my name on the board for a teacher talk. However, the teacher kept choosing other students. I had to wait to be called. Every day during @NUM2 and @NUM3 hour, I hoped my turn would come, but it never did. I finished another book and wrote my name on the board again, yet I still wasn't called. I marked @PERSON1 @NUM4, indicating that I'd finished @NUM5 books. Finally, on @DATE1, my name was called. I went to the teacher with all @NUM5 books. I got to tell her about the books, and I was extremely happy when my name was finally called."
1476	19462	7	2	I visited the dentist to get braces. As I sat in the chair, the staff informed me they needed to retrieve the brackets and wire. During this time, I was able to choose the colors for my braces. I patiently waited for approximately @NUM1 minutes. Once they returned, they began applying the brackets with glue. The moment the first bracket was placed, I experienced a strange sensation and could taste something akin to heated metal. After all the brackets were on, they added the colored accents. My mouth ached intensely. When the procedure concluded, I realized I had spent @NUM2 hours at the dentist's office. I was taken aback by the length of time, yet I was proud of my patience throughout the entire process. That was my experience of being patient at the dentist's office.
1477	19463	7	2	"I went to @CAPS1 at Cedar Point with @NUM1 aunties and @NUM1 cousins. Only the older girls went because we knew taking the younger ones would prevent us from entering the haunted houses, though we did go into one. The fun ended when we faced the lines, which were incredibly long. It took about an hour and a half to get on the roller - coaster. My cousins and I talked for a long time while in the back section called ""The dead zone"", which was both terrifying and fun. As we made our way through the place, climbing stairs and passing bars, it was tough, but I remained patient while my cousins fidgeted. When we reached the top floor, we still had to wait. My cousins played music to pass the time. Then we noticed how high up we were and started discussing the fear of falling. Suddenly, the staff announced they needed to check the @CAPS2 coaster for mechanical issues, and my cousins got upset. We tried to calm them down and just sat and waited. Finally, the line moved forward. When we reached the top of the roller - coaster @CAPS3, time seemed to fly by, perhaps due to our excitement. We got on the ride ""The mauerie"", one of the most fun in the park. The wait was worth it as the ride, which went about @NUM3 per hour, was jerky with drops and a lot of fun. However, I don't think we'd have the patience to wait again."
1478	19464	7	2	One day, I ordered a dirt bike helmet online with a promised three - day shipping. I didn't think the wait would be long. On the third day, as I waited on the porch for my helmet, my mom informed me that it was stuck in @LOCATION1 and wouldn't arrive until next week. I decided I had to be patient. For the next week, I went to work with my dad. When the week was over, I sat on the porch again and almost fell asleep. Then, a @ORGANIZATION1 truck arrived and delivered my brand - new helmet. In the end, the wait was over, and I was glad to finally have my helmet.
1479	19465	7	2	"One time, I was in the bathroom for a whole hour, taking my time. My friend waited patiently for me. When I got out, I thanked her, and she said ""anytime"". I was really surprised by her patience. It's not always easy for people to wait for such a long time, but she did it without a single complaint. This experience made me appreciate her as a friend even more."
1480	19466	7	2	On @DATE1 @CAPS1, I was extremely eager and couldn't wait to open my gifts. My parents gave my sisters and me money so we could buy things we liked. I remember I had my eye on a pair of cute combat boots. I was so excited that I was jumping @CAPS2 up and down, asking if we could open a gift since it was @DATE1 @CAPS1, but my parents said no, and I got mad. The next day, on @DATE1, it was above @NUM1 in the morning. I looked in the living room, and no one was awake. I had to wait for my parents to wake up. The time seemed to drag on forever. This was a time when I really struggled to be patient.
1481	19467	7	2	I firmly believe that patience entails waiting rather than rushing. When one is patient, things often materialize more rapidly than expected. For instance, if you desire something and must wait in line, patiently waiting instead of abandoning the line to seek an alternative will prove beneficial. No matter what you are doing, it is crucial to remain patient. Even when waiting for a game to start on Steam, exercising patience can prevent you from getting into trouble. Therefore, refrain from rushing and always be extremely patient.
1482	19468	7	2	“@CAPS1 on @CAPS2, where are you?” @PERSON1 said in a frustrated undertone. @CAPS2 was supposed to pick @CAPS1 up and take him to his house. @PERSON1 had just gotten a new trampoline, and they had planned to bounce on it all day after school. @PERSON1 started to get worried but waited patiently. Finally, his mom informed him that @CAPS2 wasn't coming. Just then, the phone rang. @PERSON1 answered it and heard @CAPS2 on the other end. “@CAPS5, @PERSON1,” @CAPS2 croaked. He didn't sound well. “@CAPS2,” @PERSON1 shouted into the phone, “@CAPS2, @CAPS2, where are you?” “I'm at my house. Get over here.” @PERSON1's mom drove to @CAPS2's house and let him out. @PERSON1 didn't care about manners at that moment, so he opened the door and marched straight to @CAPS2's room. @CAPS2 was lying in bed, looking up at the ceiling, with a very swollen face. He turned to look at @PERSON1, held his gaze, and then looked back at the ceiling. @CAPS2 hadn't been at school that day either. He had gone skiing at his family cottage. He said, “I wasn't patient when I was in the air. I got crushed, and none of it would have happened if I had waited.” In the end, this incident shows the importance of patience.
1483	19469	7	2	One time, I was at my dad's house when the power went out. We thought it would come back on in about two minutes, just like it usually did. But after a couple of days, there was still no power, and I started to lose my patience. On the third day, we called the power company and found out that there was an issue with the power lines ahead. They fixed it, and we finally got our power back. This experience taught me that sometimes, we need to be patient when facing unexpected situations.
1484	19470	7	2	I believe there are two significant reasons why patience is important. Firstly, impatience can distract those around you. For example, if you finish a @CAPS1 test early and keep urging others to hurry, it disrupts their concentration. They may lose their train of thought and have to start over. A few weeks ago, my sister and I were walking our dog. The dog pulled so hard that my sister fell, and it ran away. We had to be patient and wait for it to return. My sister wanted to call our mom, but I told her it would be rude as it would distract her from work. Secondly, impatience can lead to harm. Suppose you're going downstairs, and your sibling is walking slowly in front of you. If you push them in a hurry, they could get seriously injured. In conclusion, patience is an essential virtue that should be practiced at all times.
1485	19471	7	2	“@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1,” the clock was counting down. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1,” so close. “Come on,” I whispered as the clock kept ticking. My heart was pounding like a race - car engine. I could hear it booming in my ears. My mind raced with all the things I could do: jump in the pool, play video games. There were so many options, and I didn't know what to choose. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1,” I could almost hear the pool calling to me, “Swim, swim, swim.” I looked at Mrs. Sprowl, then back at the clock, then at Mrs. Sprowl again, and back at the clock. My heart was about to jump out of my body with anticipation. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1,” “Almost there,” I said as I stared at the second hand. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1,” “So close,” I repeated. “Just @NUM1 second left, and then I can swim in my pool.” “@NUM2,” I almost jumped out of my seat and yelled. “@NUM3,” “@CAPS2, @CAPS2, @CAPS2,” “We have some announcements,” said Mrs. White. I was so happy that I ran outside to wait for my dad so I could have my freedom. Finally, I was about to enjoy the long - awaited free time.
1486	19472	7	2	Throughout that time, I remained patient. Externally, I appeared happy, yet internally, I yearned for a better score. In the end, despite the disappointment, I understood that scores don't define everything, and I should focus on continuous improvement.
1487	19473	7	2	When I was a child, my mom always emphasized the importance of being patient, but I often struggled with it. My mom is incredibly kind, cool, well - off, and above all, patient. One day, a long time ago, not long before school started, I accidentally spilled grape pop on her brand - new carpet. I was so terrified that I thought I wet my pants. Instead of hiding it, when she got home, I tearfully told her, “I wasted pop on your carpet, don't get mad.” She responded in her gentle, motherly voice and encouraged me to clean it up. I gave her a dry towel and told her I couldn't reach the sink as a kid. Without getting angry, she went upstairs to wet the towel herself. I stayed downstairs looking at the purple mess, trying to help. She held my hand and told me to sit down. By the time she finished cleaning the stain, I had fallen asleep on the couch. She kissed me on the cheek, and when she picked me up, I woke up. I asked about breakfast in a high - pitched voice, and she said she'd get on it. I truly love my mom because of her endless patience.
1488	19474	7	2	One year, not long before school started, I went to ORGANIZATION1. Since the place had just opened, there were no lines to wait in. It was the perfect day. When I got to the ride, I didn't want to go on it, but my mom said, “Nothing will go wrong.” I reluctantly agreed. As the ride was about to take off and reached the top of the hill, it stopped. I panicked at first but then calmed down. We were stuck there for about NUM1 or NUM2 minutes and had to be patient. My mom and dad were inside with me. We were sitting on uncomfortable bicycle seats. Another NUM3 minutes passed, and we had been stuck at the top for NUM4 minutes. I had to be completely quiet and patient. Finally, the ride started again, and we reached the bottom. They gave us a pass to cut the line on the CAPS8 force. That was all we got. We had a great time the rest of the day, and I learned that in life, patience is essential.
1489	19475	7	2	Once upon a time, there was a princess named ORGANIZATION1. She was invited to a royal ball, where she hoped to meet her handsome prince. When her carriage arrived, she surveyed the people before stepping out. She then walked down the red carpet. As she entered, the noise level increased, and she approached the open doors. The beautiful princess sat on her throne and watched the villagers dance. She sat there for two hours, wondering, “Will he show up?” and “Will he like me?” She began to doubt her luck. Then, she grabbed the microphone and asked, “Does anyone know where my prince is?” There was complete silence in the crowd. Finally, at the last minute, an anonymous voice called out, “I am the prince!” A sigh of relief washed over her. The prince said, “I'm so late. I fought a dragon and a thousand knights to get here to meet my love.” The crowd let out an “awww.” And they lived happily ever after, the perfect ending to a fairytale.
1490	19476	7	2	The one time I really had to be patient was when my mom took me to get my birth certificate so I could play football. When we arrived, the parking lot was packed. Cars were so close together that it was nearly impossible to get in and out without scratching someone else's car. My mom parked across the street. When we went inside, there were at least NUM1 to NUM2 people. They were standing so close that you could feel their body heat. The benches were full, and people were packed like sardines. It was hot and smelled musty. We got a ticket with the number NUM3, and they were currently on NUM4. We waited for two hours. My mom wanted to leave. When they finally called our number, I was asleep. By the time we left, I felt like I had lost ten pounds from the stress and the heat. In the end, all that patience paid off as I got my birth certificate and was able to play football.
1491	19477	7	2	I'm not a particularly patient individual. I often whine and grumble. If being patient means staying in one place for an extended period without complaining, then I suppose there have been instances when I've shown patience, but only when there's a friend around to keep me occupied. Once, my mother was at the hospital for approximately @NUM1 hours. My friend @PERSON1 was there, and we spent time together. It was actually quite enjoyable. We ate in the cafeteria. For no particular reason, we took some milk and completely forgot that my mother was there. I didn't complain even once. Then we were scolded and had to return to the waiting room, yet it still wasn't too unpleasant. That was one of the rare times I've been patient, and I'm not sure if it truly counts since I was with someone.
1492	19478	7	2	"That's @CAPS1!"" I shouted as the ball came over the net straight towards me. ""@CAPS1!"" @CAPS2 exclaimed. ""I was already there,"" I retorted. ""@CAPS4. It's @CAPS1,"" @CAPS13 argued. ""I said @CAPS1. You moved and let me go for it, then just watched the ball drop. Wimp!"" I exclaimed. ""I guess so,"" @CAPS2 apologized. This was during volleyball try - outs, where I had to be patient and work as a team. ""Is @CAPS10 @CAPS11?"" the A - team coach demanded. ""Partner up in groups of three!"" @CAPS13 said. My two best friends, Sam and @PERSON1, were already paired up with a new girl who was quite good. ""Do you want to be partners with me?"" @CAPS14 asked. ""Sure,"" I replied. When it was our turn on the @CAPS11, we were up against @CAPS16 and @PERSON1, who spiked the ball at us. Katie completely missed it. The new girl, @PERSON1, and @CAPS16 all cheered. ""Great job, ladies!"" one of the coaches said. It was the end of the second @DATE1 try - out. There was only one more @DATE1 left. It was difficult for me, but I managed to stay calm and patient. On the final @DATE1 of try - outs, we found out our teams. We all received envelopes and opened them simultaneously. Me, @CAPS16, @PERSON1, and some other good girls made the A - team! So, that was a time when I had to be extremely patient and stay united, and I still achieved success."
1493	19479	7	2	Once upon a time, there was a boy named @PERSON1. Well, he was at the secretary of state's office. He was trying to be patient. He walked in, took a number, and got his papers from the woman at the front desk. He started filling them out. The number - calling process was slow, and he began to get angry. As time passed, there were still people in front of him. They went to get their secretary cards. Finally, the lady behind the desk called @PERSON1. He greeted her, she took his picture, and he got his license. And that was the end of his experience at the office.
1494	19480	7	2	I showed patience when my dog had to go to the @CAPS1. He was really sick because he had heartworms. My mom and I waited for about two hours. I wasn't as patient as my mom; I kept asking her what was going on. After the operation, we had to wait even longer, almost @NUM1 hours, until we could take my dog home. When the @CAPS1 called us, we went and got him. The doctor said he needed to rest until he could stand up and move around. Finally, it was okay, and we played in the snow all @CAPS3 long. This experience taught me the value of patience in difficult situations.
1495	19481	7	2	Oh, hi! My name is @CAPS1. I'm going to tell you how I waited @NUM1 @NUM2 @CAPS2 to do something exciting. I heard about this amazing yet scary place called the @CAPS3 @CAPS4. My friends @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I plan to go there in @DATE2. So far, we've just been going about our normal routine: waking up, taking a shower, getting dressed, and going to school. Today, @DATE1, we went to my parents' house and went online to check when it opens. We found out that a new location will open in two days. It's near the parlor and down the road from @ORGANIZATION1. We checked it out, and since it's nearby, we're really excited. Today, we hit the road, but we didn't realize how many people would be there. When we arrived, there were at least @NUM3 people waiting! We got in line, and about every @NUM4 minutes, the line decreased by @NUM5 people. After about @NUM6 and a half @CAPS2 of waiting, we were in the top @NUM7. It was lucky because @NUM1 people weren't patient enough to wait, but we were respectful. Then @PERSON2 had to go to the restroom, so we walked across the street. When we came back, we ended up in the top @NUM9. We waited another @NUM10 minutes and finally got in. By the time we were done, @PERSON2 was crying (he's @NUM11!), @PERSON1 wet his pants (he's @NUM12!), and @NUM13 and I just watched. We had an unforgettable night, and it wouldn't have happened if we weren't so patient.
1496	19482	7	2	Patience is a virtue that allows one to earn self - respect and the respect of others. Impatience often exacerbates situations. My cousin, an avid @PERSON1 fan, desired tickets to his concert. When the online tickets sold out, she was at a loss. However, she learned from the news that tickets were being given away on the morning of the concert. Eager to be first in line, she arrived at @NUM1 am, only to find at least two hundred people ahead of her. She patiently waited for several hours until she reached the ticket booth. Finally, she got her tickets. That night, she secured fifth - row seats, close enough to see the sweat on @PERSON1's face. This experience shows that patience can yield positive results. My cousin's patience has inspired me to be more patient, and perhaps one day, I'll also obtain concert tickets.
1497	19484	7	2	I went to a game with @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, and his mom and dad. @PERSON1 has Down syndrome. He loves watching games, cheering the players on during the game, and giving them high - fives after. I thought he was a really cool guy and never laughed at him. He likes to talk a lot about sports or cartoons. I never made fun of him when he talked, walked, or made funny noises. He considers everyone his friend. When standing in line, he doesn't move much. He yells when @DATE1 port has the ball and is going for a touchdown and gets mad when @DATE1 port doesn't have the ball but the other team scores. I told him we'd get it @CAPS2, and he agreed. He wants to go onto the field to watch, but since he can't yet, I told him to be patient to calm him down. After the game, his mom took us to @LOCATION1's house. We sat in the @CAPS2 chatting, and she didn't get mad even though we were stuck in an hour - long traffic jam. Through this experience, I've come to understand what patience truly is.
1498	19485	7	2	I'm always a patient person. Let me tell you about a time when I showed patience at school. One day, I had to register for school. It was extremely busy, and I had to wait in each line for at least ten to fifteen minutes. After finally completing all my paperwork, I went to take my ID picture. When I got the ID, my eyes were closed in the picture, so I had to wait in line again to retake it. Then I went to get my other ID. I waited for about twenty minutes, and when it came out, it was messed up. The lady told me I'd get the correct one when school started. This was a moment in my life when I demonstrated patience.
1499	19488	7	2	Last @DATE1, I showed patience when my friends and I waited in line to get an autograph from the Detroit Tigers' @NUM1 baseman, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Meeting the players was going to be an exciting experience. We waited patiently in line, and although the details of what happened after are a bit unclear, this was definitely a day when I exercised patience.
1500	19489	7	2	I showed patience when I went to the doctor with my mom. We waited patiently for a long time. It felt like an eternity, but in reality, we waited for @NUM1 hour in the waiting room. After the doctor called us into the room, we waited for another half - hour. I asked my mom why it took so long, and she explained that there were other patients before us. I understood and accepted the situation. This experience taught me the importance of patience in such circumstances.
1501	19490	7	2	One day, I was at a water park as a visitor. I intended to go on a water slide, but there were approximately [@NUM1] people in front of me. Simultaneously, it was extremely hot. The ground was so hot that it was unbearable to stand on without flip - flops. Despite the heat and the long queue, I was determined to go on the water slide. So, I patiently waited in line. I thought to myself that this better be worth it; otherwise, I'd be really annoyed. However, I decided to be patient. I sincerely hoped to have a great time on the ride.
1502	19491	7	2	Last year, I tried to be patient while waiting for something that never got done. I truly loathe being patient because it is incredibly boring. It seems like waiting takes an eternity. People often start getting headaches from the long wait, and then they get in trouble with their parents or teachers for talking too much. That's precisely why I don't like being patient.
1503	19492	7	2	Patience can be defined as the ability to wait for an extended period without complaining. I believe I don't possess a great deal of patience. True patience is like waiting in a line for hours without getting bothered, as one is highly patient. In fact, patience is required in almost every aspect of life. Whether it's playing games, driving, eating, waiting for something, or even being at school, all these activities demand a significant amount of patience. In conclusion, patience is an essential yet challenging virtue that I still struggle to master.
1504	19493	7	2	Each school year, I patiently await [@DATE1] vacation. The wait feels excruciatingly long, but I firmly believe it is worth it. The anticipation builds up as the days pass, and when the vacation finally arrives, all the waiting pays off. So, despite the long and sometimes difficult wait, I will continue to patiently look forward to [@DATE1] vacation every year.
1505	19494	7	2	"Hello, I'm [@CAPS1] [@CAPS2]. I have green eyes, blonde hair, and a pleasant personality. I'm going to share a time when I was patient. It was around [@NUM1] last year, probably on [@DATE1]. My mom and I left for a doctor's appointment. We left around [@NUM2] after school started. When we arrived at the doctor's office, I was bored out of my mind after waiting for about [@NUM3] hours. With nothing to do, I watched the fish in [@CAPS3] for approximately [@NUM4]. Finally, the woman at the counter called, ""[@PERSON1]"", and I knew it was our turn. We entered the room, and I lay on the bed. I accidentally fell asleep. While I was sleeping, they gave me a very painful shot. It hurt so much that I woke up. This was the time when I demonstrated patience."
1506	19495	7	2	One time, when I was being patient, I asked for an item from @ORGANIZATION1 last @CAPS1. My @CAPS2 said it was a possibility. So, I waited the whole year. I was certain I'd get it and kept waiting. Eventually, I received a blue item from @ORGANIZATION1, along with @NUM1 new gloves. During the waiting period, I was going crazy knowing I was about to get it. But when I finally did, I was glad I'd been patient. The wait was truly worth it, especially considering how long I'd waited for my @ORGANIZATION1 item.
1507	19496	7	2	As @ORGANIZATION1 ran down the stairs, she shouted, “@CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS1!!” She then said, “I have to get this cool new book! It looks really good. Please!” Her @CAPS1 replied, “I have to do errands before I go.” The @CAPS1 then persuaded her, “If you are patient, you can get the book.” @ORGANIZATION1, who really wanted the book, agreed, and they went to do errands. They first stopped at the gas station, then the post office, the car - wash, and finally the grocery store. At the grocery store, @ORGANIZATION1 helped her @CAPS1 shop. All day, @ORGANIZATION1 was patient and didn't complain once. Her @CAPS1 said, “The last item on the list is pasta for dinner. I can't seem to find it.” Eager to get her book, @ORGANIZATION1 said, “I'll go find it.” She searched every aisle until she found the pasta. When she found her @CAPS1, she was at the checkout. After the cashier rang up all the items, they went to their car and unloaded. When they got home, @ORGANIZATION1 forgot about the book until her @CAPS1 gave it to her. @ORGANIZATION1 thanked her and realized that it isn't hard to be patient.
1508	19497	7	2	When my mom went to the doctor to have a baby, I had to wait in the waiting room for @NUM1 hour. I remained patient throughout this time, understanding that these things take time. In the end, my patience was a small price to pay for the arrival of a new family member.
1509	19498	7	2	Patience is something my family generally lacks, and here's an incident to prove it. While I was doing the dishes, my little brother (@CAPS1) started crying because my little sister (@CAPS3) hit him. Then, @CAPS3 started crying too. Meanwhile, my step - dad was playing on his iPhone. Soon enough, he started yelling at @CAPS1. Things didn't get better. I managed to stop @CAPS3 from crying, but @CAPS1 wouldn't stop. I called @PERSON2, and @CAPS1 hit her. My step - dad went crazy as @CAPS1 kept crying, and @PERSON2 started stomping up the stairs like a brat. Just when I was about to lose it, my older brother (@PERSON1) came in and took @CAPS1 downstairs to calm him down. Thank goodness for @ORGANIZATION1. Then I calmed @CAPS3 down. It was quite a day. I guess my family does have some patience, except for my step - dad.
1510	19499	7	2	We all have moments of patience and moments when we lose it. Yesterday, I was extremely patient with my sister, @PERSON2, who throws a lot of fits and is very bratty. I don't know what sets her off, but she gets mean and violent. Here's what happened: We were walking home yesterday, and everything was fine. When we got home, mom told us to clean. Our room was already clean, and I wouldn't let @PERSON2 go up to “clean” it. She screamed and cried at the top of her lungs. Remember, she's ten. She stormed up the stairs and was on the phone with her “friend” @PERSON1. I told her to hang up as we had to clean, and she screamed again. Our sister, @ORGANIZATION1, told her to knock it off, hang up, and clean. Then @PERSON2 made us listen to @PERSON1's text messages. @PERSON1 wasn't being nice, but we calmly told @PERSON2 not to answer the phone. She kept screaming, so we left her alone. When mom came home, @PERSON3 and I told her what had happened. Mom grounded @PERSON2, banning her from talking, texting, or interacting with @PERSON1 at school. Mom also thanked @PERSON3 and me for being so patient. That's my story of patience. I'm not the most patient person, but everyone has their moments, and being patient makes life better in the long run.
1511	19500	7	2	There were several instances last week and yesterday when @CAPS1 showed great patience. Yesterday, I was late for school. Traffic was extremely heavy, and it seemed like the cars in front were barely moving. But @CAPS1 patiently waited, neither cutting in front of other cars nor honking the horn impatiently. Another time was during a basketball game. @CAPS1 waited outside the building while the game went into overtime. @CAPS1 just calmly waited until I came out. The last instance was at the Subway. I ordered a cold cut, and it took about a minute to get my food. I was so hungry that I could barely feel my stomach. Despite my restlessness, @CAPS1 remained patient. In conclusion, these are the times when @CAPS1 demonstrated remarkable patience.
1512	19501	7	2	"As we entered the dental clinic, the smell of mouthwash filled our noses. We walked up to the front desk where a short, elderly lady with gray hair and glasses greeted us. ""Please take a seat in our waiting area, and your dentist will be with you shortly,"" she said. We then made our way to the waiting room. My mom and brother sat on the waiting couch, while I took the small tan chair in the corner. My brother got some papers and crayons. Fifteen minutes passed. My mom and brother were still occupied with what they were doing, but I was getting bored. I kept asking my mom when the dentist would come, but she just told me to be patient. About twenty minutes later, I was on the verge of losing my patience. I couldn't understand how my brother could just sit there coloring for so long. I wanted to ask my mom again, but I knew she'd tell me the same thing. I got up and started pacing back and forth. After five minutes of this, my mom told me to sit down and find something to do. But there was nothing to keep me entertained. Finally, just when I was about to go crazy, a little lady stood in the doorway and said, ""Your appointment is ready."" I got up and followed her to a small room, relieved that the long wait was over."
1513	19502	7	2	Patience can be defined as quietly awaiting the occurrence of an event. In daily life, one often has to be patient for numerous things, such as long lectures, birthdays, and orchestra concerts. Sometimes, despite one's patience, the awaited event may not take place, and one has to leave without achieving the desired outcome, which has happened to me on multiple occasions. During long lectures, there are times when the urge to leave is strong, but one must be patient and wait for the lecture to end. On birthdays, when one is eager to eat the cake, they have to wait for their sister to blow out the candles and make a wish. I am a member of the orchestra, and we have an orchestra event about every two months. The first event is an open event, usually held in a specific month. Last year, it was in a particular month. At the end of the event, there is a cheese - cake sampling station with cookies and other delicious treats. However, before that, I have to endure playing many pieces, watching beginners play, and having my face videotaped, with the fear of someone laughing at a mistake. Playing the pieces isn't too bad, but watching the beginners can be torture. The video recording doesn't bother me much. I just sit in the back row, and my mom or sisters may not even notice me. Then comes the cheese cake at around a specific time at night. This year, I'm not looking forward to the event on a particular date because I have a final cross - country meet after school. All five middle schools will gather at a place for a big district meet. After the meet, my parents will take me to the orchestra event at the high school. The event usually closes at a specific time, and I hope I won't have any homework. If I do, I'll just have to be patient. That day will be a long one, but I'll manage. All I can think about is getting through the school year patiently without making any major mistakes.
1514	19503	7	2	Even if you may not always be aware of it, patience is all around us. We often use patience without realizing it, like when waiting in line or for something to happen. Here's a story about a time when I exercised patience. One hot day at Wide Point, we decided to go to the water park. As soon as we arrived, I jumped into the first pool and waited for my dad. After playing for a while, we decided to go on one of the water slides. The water slide at the park was huge. You had to climb several flights of stairs to reach it. But after I went on it, I knew it was worth the wait. In conclusion, this experience taught me that patience can lead to rewarding experiences.
1515	19504	7	2	"My story is about a time when I was patient on a specific date. I was waiting for "" @CAPS1 "" to arrive because we were going to "" @LOCATION2 "". I was really excited and couldn't wait, but I reminded myself to be patient. I found that the less I thought about it, the faster time passed. Finally, it was time to head to "" @LOCATION2 "". Once we were in the car, I became even more impatient as we passed by one road after another, traveling from city to city and state to state. It was already the next day, and my eagerness was still high. During the long drive, I fell asleep. When I woke up, we had already reached our destination. I had to exercise a great deal of patience because the drive from "" @LOCATION1 "" to "" @LOCATION2 "" was very long. While being patient, I got to see many interesting things and passed through different states. In conclusion, this journey taught me that patience can turn a long and potentially tiresome trip into an opportunity for new experiences."
1516	19505	7	2	Patience is a virtue that eludes most individuals. In my personal narrative, patience became an indispensable quality. Had I lacked patience, I would have been at a loss. This is the story of that experience. A few years ago, I was picked up from school by my mother. She intended to take me home but decided to go grocery - shopping first. At the store, she invited me to accompany her. Considering all the reasons against it, I declined. I sat in the car while the outside temperature was at least @NUM1 @CAPS1. Within ten minutes of waiting in the vehicle, I was drenched in sweat. My mother remained inside the store. There were numerous moments when anger welled up within me, yet I managed to control my emotions. I even witnessed several people enter and leave the store before my mother emerged. It was at least two hours before she finally came out. Instead of being angry, I understood her reasons and accepted her apologies for the delay. Generally, I am not a patient person, especially in such situations. I am truly glad that I was able to exercise patience on that occasion.
1517	19506	7	2	There are days when my patience wears thin, and I have to rein in my impulses to avoid lashing out or saying something hurtful. Take @DATE1, for example. We went camping in @LOCATION2. As part of our camping routine, we usually embark on a one - to - two - hour hike. Our destination is Lake @LOCATION1. To get there, we take what my dad calls an “adventure hike.” This path leads us through the woods, over and sometimes through the river. There are two options: a five - minute direct hike to the lake or a one - to - two - hour hike through the woods and over logs. On days when my patience is at its lowest, and I just want to reach the lake quickly, we always end up taking the long route. By the time we arrive at the lake, everyone is irritated because I can't stop complaining. (Sometimes, I even get annoyed with myself.) However, the return journey is more enjoyable after we've taken a dip in the @CAPS5 cold water. (My dad claims it clears my head, but it really doesn't.) By the time we get back, we're hungry for dinner, but it's not ready yet. Once again, I find myself in a bad mood and have to wait some more. In the end, these experiences highlight how challenging it can be for me to maintain patience during our camping trips.
1518	19507	7	2	Two years ago, my two - year - old cousin @PERSON1 was adopted from @LOCATION3. My aunt, uncle, and cousin endured a three - year wait before they could even see a picture of her and begin the paperwork. The orphanage staff did not treat them fairly. Approximately @NUM1 people who attempted to adopt a child a year after my aunt and uncle's application were allowed to proceed first. They traveled all the way from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION3 and had to wait three days just to see @PERSON1. The orphanage then made them wait another week for the adoption to be finalized. Eventually, they adopted her and named her @PERSON1. After completing more paperwork and assuring the orphanage of their commitment to care for her, they returned home. In the first week or so after the adoption, @PERSON1 had trouble sleeping. Since @LOCATION3 is @NUM2 hours ahead of @LOCATION2, she slept during the day and stayed awake at night. However, they gradually taught her to sleep at night. The process of adopting @PERSON1 required a great deal of patience, but it was ultimately successful.
1519	19508	7	2	The time I demonstrated patience was last @DATE1 when we visited Cedar Point. When we arrived at Cedar Point, there was a long line for a ride. Just as we reached the front of the line, the machine malfunctioned. As a result, we had to switch to another ride. I couldn't wait any longer because I urgently needed to use the restroom. So, I left the line and went to the bathroom. When I returned, the line had grown longer. Instead of getting frustrated, I simply waited. In the end, this experience showed that I was capable of being patient even in an inconvenient situation.
1520	19509	7	2	My dad, @PERSON1, is a paragon of patience on a daily basis. He goes to work, longing to return home, yet he doesn't lose his composure like I would in a similar situation. Instead of succumbing to impatience, he diligently completes his work and patiently waits until @NUM1, when he can finally leave and head home. He has always been a patient person, and I look up to him because of this admirable quality. His example serves as a constant reminder of the importance of patience in daily life.
1521	19510	7	2	I was at the Great Wolf Lodge. We couldn't enter the pool because a kid had defecated in it, causing a large portion of the pool to turn brown. As a result, we had to wait for three hours before we could use the pool. It was extremely dull during that time. Eventually, we went outside and discovered that there was a pool there all along.
1522	19511	7	2	I've been patient on numerous occasions, but one instance that stands out is when I missed school and waited for a friend to return home. While waiting, I engaged in various activities. I played on my Xbox and also used the computer. While on the Xbox, I noticed a friend from Moures, @CAPS2, @CAPS1 come online. After he logged in, we played for most of the day. When I got bored, I switched to watching @CAPS3, but since there was nothing interesting on, I went back to the computer. Still feeling bored, I attempted to take a nap, but it was unsuccessful. I then tried playing the Xbox again, but after about an hour (around @TIME1), I grew tired of it. I continued playing for another half - hour before re - setting up my account while listening to music. I played some more until my friend came online again. We played together from day until night, and it was a long but enjoyable wait.
1523	19512	7	2	Last week, my friend @PERSON1 demonstrated patience in the lunch line. He waited for approximately @NUM1 minutes. I arrived at the cafeteria before most of the other students were in line. @PERSON1 was standing behind the @NUM2 and @NUM3 graders. He showed patience by not cutting in front of them and not complaining. The line was longer because there was a presentation before lunch, and the @NUM2 and @NUM3 graders hadn't had their lunch yet, which is why @PERSON1 had to wait. I thought he did a great job waiting. When many students were filling the tables, I saved a seat for @PERSON1 next to me. @PERSON1 finally got his lunch and went to the @CAPS1 and milk cooler to grab an orange @CAPS1. I waved to him across the room, and he saw me. When he came and sat next to me, I told him he had done well being patient and waiting for his lunch. When @PERSON1 sat down, I was almost done with my macaroni and cheese. He thanked me for saving a seat for him. After we both finished eating, we took care of our trays and walked to the gym. We were glad to leave the noisy and crowded cafeteria. In the gym, some kids were playing a small basketball game. @PERSON1 grabbed a basketball. I waited patiently until the @NUM2 graders were done. The teacher then told the younger students to go back to class. When I got the ball, I asked @PERSON1 if he wanted to play Around the World, one of our favorite games.
1524	19513	7	2	"I heard a series of loud knocks on the door. I knew it was my cousins because they always knock forcefully. I rushed downstairs and opened the door. It was indeed them. Then, we all got into the van. My mom asked if we were ready for some fun, and we excitedly replied, ""@CAPS1!"" The journey in the van was incredibly boring, but I had to be patient. When we reached Ohio, we stopped to get some food. After @NUM1 minutes, we got back into the van. When we neared our destination, we were all excited as we thought it would be a great day, but we also knew it would require time and patience. Once we entered the park, we headed straight for the reptor ride. The wait was about half an hour. It was a test of our patience, but we waited. After getting on and off the ride, we realized it was worth the wait. Then we went on many other rides, and the best one was the diagster. When we returned to the van, we all agreed that it had been a fun day. I also realized that I had been very patient throughout the day."
1525	19514	7	2	One day, my friend @CAPS1 and I decided to drive from @CAPS2 to Alabama. It was the most boring journey imaginable! We spent @NUM1 hours just driving, only stopping to use the bathroom. To make matters worse, I have a very small bladder, which made the trip even more of a hassle. However, we did find a bit of entertainment in counting waffle houses. The farther south we went, the more waffle houses we saw. It was true; there was at least one waffle house in every area. And our destination wasn't just Alabama; we were going to the @CAPS5 of Alabama. So, even after reaching the general area, we still had to wait for @NUM2 more hours. But when we finally arrived, we had a great time. I have to admit that one positive outcome of this long - distance drive is that long car rides don't bother us as much anymore.
1526	19515	7	2	I'd like to share a time when I had to be patient. My cousin came to my house needing help with his math homework. Since no one else was home, I took on the task. We sat on the couch, and I began assisting him. He was completely unfamiliar with the problems, so I patiently taught him how to solve them and explained how I arrived at the answers. He had three pages of homework to complete. It took nearly two hours to finish it all. This was a significant instance where I had to exercise patience.
1527	19516	7	2	@CAPS2's father recently lost his job, and it has been a challenging period. Exactly @NUM1 has passed since he last had employment. Despite facing continuous rejections, he has been persistently applying for jobs without giving up. Fortunately, he has a job interview in San @CAPS1 in a couple of weeks. We sincerely hope he will secure the position. @CAPS2's father has shown remarkable patience throughout this difficult time. His unwavering determination to find a job, even in the face of repeated setbacks, makes him @CAPS2's role - model. Regardless of the outcome of the interview, @CAPS2 will always love their father because of his extraordinary patience, which will always make him @CAPS2's hero and most beloved role - model.
1528	19517	7	2	Patience is a difficult virtue for some people, including me. One time, I attended a large party without any of my friends or cousins. I was extremely bored and asked my mom if we could go home, but she said no. So, I sat down and waited for a long time. Finally, we went home. The next day, my mom sent me to my cousin's house for a sleep - over as a reward for my patience at the party. This experience taught me that being patient can sometimes lead to positive outcomes.
1529	19518	7	2	Melay, a young girl, was waiting for her parents in the @CAPS1 bush. She didn't understand why she had to wait, as her parents seemed distressed all the time. She thought it might be something she had done. Her sister was less patient and always needed to be doing something. When her parents didn't come and some boys carrying @NUM1's came walking along the road, hiding, Melay was puzzled, but knew their parents must have a good reason. As she sat thinking, she heard a loud crack. She looked for her sister but couldn't find her. The boy soldiers were laughing, and she realized they were laughing at her sister. She then found the bodies of her parents. Frightened, she started running. After running about a mile, she hid in a bush. The boy soldiers found her, took her to a building. There, the boss raped her and then shot her, dragging her body into a dumpster. If only she had waited differently.
1530	19519	7	2	I remember that hot @DATE1 day when I left school about forty - five minutes early because it was the second - to - last day. I had an appointment at the @CAPS1 (dentist) at @CAPS3 @CAPS4 - thirty. When I got there, there were about @CAPS4 people ahead of me. After @CAPS4 - thirty passed, I went across the street and ordered @PERSON1 @CAPS14. After that, I bought some gum. It was @CAPS15 on the dot, and I was still waiting. I asked the front - desk manager how long I'd have to wait. She went to check and came back to tell me I could go in right away. I was so happy about my patience, and as a reward, I got a tooth - break.
1531	19520	7	2	A moment when I had to exercise patience was when I required assistance with my schoolwork. My father is highly intelligent, so whenever I needed help, I typically turned to him. I finish school at @TIME1, while my father arrives home at @TIME2. Thus, if I wanted his help, I had to wait, though I didn't initially understand this. I left the homework that needed help in my backpack until my father got home, wishing it were the kind that didn't need assistance. After I completed all my @CAPS1 homework, it was time for dinner. By then, I had finished waiting for my father, and we were truly ready to work on the schoolwork together. In the end, waiting for my father to help me understand the material was well - worth it.
1532	19521	7	2	There was once a solitary puppy. One day, it sent a letter to a random address and waited and waited. After a few weeks, it received a reply to its letter, and it was from another puppy! They quickly became best friends, and the puppy learned that, usually, patience pays off. This experience shows that a bit of patience can bring wonderful friendships.
1533	19522	7	2	On @DATE1, my friend @CAPS1 and I boarded the bus bound for @PERSON1 at @CAPS2 @CAPS3. We were part of a church group and stayed together until @NUM1 am. We spent the whole day riding various rides and then got in line for the @CAPS4. The sign in front indicated that the wait from that point was @NUM2 hours, but we decided to wait it out. Since I was around @NUM3 then, we expected to get on the ride around @NUM4. We later discovered that @PERSON1 also had an event starting at @NUM5 pm, and fortunately, we were standing next to a haunted house. Around @NUM6 pm, we all got quite bored and played hand games like slide and lemonade. Every five minutes, we heard loud, obnoxious screams and constant chatter. At about @NUM4 pm, we finally got on the ride, and we all loved it. After getting off, someone suggested going on the @CAPS6, and the adults liked the idea. As we walked over, I could smell sweet treats and almost taste an elephant ear. We didn't realize we'd have to pass through @CAPS7, which was filled with evil clowns and other spooky creatures. It wasn't a great idea as half of us were afraid of clowns. When we reached @LOCATION1, there was a long line, but it was estimated to take only forty - five minutes. After the ride, my head hurt from hitting the headrest multiple times. On the way to the exit, we saw many more spooky sights. We later found out that we had waited in line for five hours. Finally, we got on the bus and headed home. That day, I learned that I have more patience than I thought.
1534	19523	7	2	I had to be patient when we were about to go on vacation. It felt like I'd been waiting forever to go to @LOCATION1, but in reality, it was only about a month. I was extremely excited but had to exercise patience. It's usually hard for me to be patient because I prefer things to be done right away, so waiting a month for this vacation was a challenge. The night before we left was the toughest; I was so excited that I couldn't sleep at all. On the day we left, I was running around the house, yelling with excitement. Eventually, we loaded the car and set off for @LOCATION1. Since we drove there, it took almost @NUM1 days. But it was all worth it as @LOCATION1 was really fun and beautiful. We also went to @ORGANIZATION1 and had a great time. At @ORGANIZATION1, I had to be patient again because there were long lines for the rides. Overall, I had a really enjoyable time in @LOCATION1, and this experience taught me the value of patience.
1535	19524	7	2	Everyone needs to be patient at some point in their lives, and I have to exercise patience every day, especially in basketball. There are several reasons why one might need to be patient in this context, and I have @NUM1 specific ones. Firstly, it frustrates me when people don't pay attention. When team members goof off, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 gets angry. She either tells us to stop or makes us run a few laps around the gym. This first issue leads to the second one. When people don't pay attention, they get lost and have no idea what's going on. Many people take a long time to understand the game. The second reason then leads to the third. When a new person joins the team, it can be a challenge. Just the other day, two new people joined when the season was already half - over. The newest member can't make a shot and doesn't put in full effort. Only about @NUM2 out of @NUM3 or @NUM4 people on the team are actually good. Looking back on these situations, I realize I have to be patient. If I weren't, I'd be in trouble and show poor sportsmanship. Over the years, I've learned about patience and how to be patient. I'm glad I've acquired this skill, as otherwise, I might not be part of any teams or clubs.
1536	19525	7	2	I recall a time when I had to exercise patience. It was quite challenging just sitting there, waiting for the doctor to call my name. However, I endured it. Instead of getting angry because the receptionist hadn't called my name after waiting for about @NUM1 minutes, I simply turned on my @NUM2 player, listened to music, and read a magazine. Before I realized it, @CAPS2 called my name. “@CAPS1,” @CAPS2 said with a smile. So, I got up and went to the room @CAPS2 directed me to. As I left the doctor's office and went on my way, I thought to myself, “Maybe being patient isn't that bad after all!”
1537	19526	7	2	Almost every time you're at the doctor's or in the hospital, you need to be patient. When I'm at the doctor's, I play I Spy with my mom to pass the time. There are usually a lot of people there when I go. There are magazines, but I find them boring. So, I play I Spy to stay patient. Otherwise, I'd be extremely bored. In conclusion, playing I Spy is a great way for me to deal with the wait at the doctor's.
1538	19527	7	2	Last year, on my birthday, I had to go to the doctor. After coming home from school, I immediately left again. When we arrived, we had to wait in the lobby. There were crying babies everywhere. We also had plans to go to the movies and shopping. There were still too many people ahead of me, and I started to get angry. Finally, they called my name. I was so overjoyed that I didn't know what to do. This experience made me realize how important it is to be patient even in frustrating situations.
1539	19528	7	2	A time when someone was patient was when a man named @PERSON2 was driving. A little girl named @PERSON1 was walking on the sidewalk when the traffic light was red. She shouted, “Go, old man!” The old man started moving, and she followed him to the store. She asked what that was, and @PERSON2 said it was nothing. She accused him of trying to hit her, saying he was just rushing because she was urging him on. @PERSON1 told @PERSON2 that she was losing her patience. @PERSON2 advised her to learn how to control it. In the end, this incident shows that patience is a virtue that both parties could have used more of.
1540	19529	7	2	“@CAPS1!” @CAPS2 whined, her voice rising to a wail. “You can't do this to me. I'm ten!” “@CAPS2, calm down. I know you're ten, and you're a very responsive ten - year - old. But as I've told you before, I can't leave you at home all @DATE1. Your father and I have work, honey!” “Can't you just hire a babysitter? What about @PERSON3? @CAPS13 babysat last year!” @CAPS2's mother sighed. “I know you liked @PERSON3, but @CAPS13 just didn't meet the requirements I was looking for. Besides, you said you wanted to be a babysitter! Why not try to help at the @CAPS16?” @CAPS2 gave her mother a well - practiced glare and said, “If only!” This conversation took place two weeks ago in the Fullers' kitchen. Now, @CAPS12, @CAPS2's mother, @PERSON1, was taking her to @CAPS9 county's only daycare, @CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. The name made @CAPS2 feel sick. “@CAPS12, remember, sweetie, be nice and try to help out. I love you!” @CAPS13 called as she started to pull out of the driveway. @CAPS2 faced the small building. The sign above it read, “@CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. A friendly and loving environment.” @CAPS2 had that gagging feeling again. She turned back to see if she could spot her mother's red, battered @LOCATION1 speeding down the poorly paved road. All she saw was a trail of dust. “Great,” she thought as she entered through the double doors with a picture of a big, grinning clown. “@CAPS2, why don't you play with little @PERSON4?” @PERSON2 said, holding “little” @PERSON4 in her arms. Actually, @PERSON4 was seven, and @CAPS2 thought that was old enough not to cry when someone asks to play “one” for the billionth time. “@CAPS2, we need to talk,” said the middle - aged woman, setting @PERSON4 aside. “Honey, you've got to understand that kids need patience and love. Heck, I remember you as a kid! You were such an attention hog!” @CAPS2 looked like she regretted yelling. She smiled and went to find @PERSON4, thinking maybe he'd still want to play.
1541	19530	7	2	"I was extremely patient when it came to getting my phone. I knew I had to behave exceptionally well so that my mom would decide when I could have it. On @DATE4 at @TIME1, I had to go to school. I made sure to act very patiently, hoping my mom would think it was time for me to get a new phone. When I got home, I behaved like a pleasant little angel. However, she still didn't say it was time. The next @TIME1 on @DATE3, I acted the same way but even better. Still, I didn't get the phone. I was so frustrated that I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs.  The following day, @DATE1, I cooked breakfast for my mom. I was convinced that this was the day I'd get my phone. Unfortunately, she just hugged me, thanked me with a smirk on her face. She seemed to be waiting for me to lose my temper, but I knew what she was up to, so I simply said ""you're welcome,"" though I was seething inside.  The next @TIME1, I felt a bit better and was determined to show even more patience. I dressed in a professional - casual way, made my own breakfast, and then walked to school. When I got home, my mom was up and said, ""@CAPS1 on, I have to take you to get something."" I smiled so widely that I thought my mouth would fall off. I dropped my backpack, and we stopped at my friend's house. My mom said, ""wait @CAPS2,"" and I watched her go into the house, wondering what was going on. She came out and gave me the brown shire I'd left at my friend's place. My eagerness quickly turned into a fake smile.  We got home, and I ran straight to my room to do my homework. @DATE5 was the last day of the week. I spent the whole day moping around but still remained patient. Then, on @DATE2 and @DATE6, I stayed at my friend's house. On @DATE4, when I got up for school, my mom was also up. She said, ""@CAPS2 you can have your phone now."" I hugged her tightly and rushed out the door excitedly to try it out. In the end, my patience had finally paid off."
1542	19533	7	2	There was a time when I had to be patient on @CAPS1. Presents could be opened at nine - thirty in the morning, and I had to wait for two hours. During that time, I watched television. I thought @CAPS2 would be difficult, but I managed to get through it. I initially thought that @CAPS1 was the most fun, but later, I realized that this year might have even better moments.  On that day, I made breakfast in bed. I actually had a great deal of fun doing it. I got my mom a few bottles of perfume. Of course, she doesn't use them; I do. I also got her some candles. For my dad, we got a bright orange sweatshirt and some @PERSON1. All in all, it was a day filled with patience and gift - giving, and I learned that sometimes waiting can lead to nice surprises.
1543	19534	7	2	One time, during @DATE1, my family and I were at @CAPS1 point. My sister really wanted me to go on all the small kiddie rides with her, but I wasn't interested. I was eager to go on one of the fastest and tallest rides there, the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. It looked really cool, so my dad and I ran to the entrance. However, when we got there, the wait - time on the board showed one hour and forty - five minutes.  I really wanted to go on the ride, but I didn't think it was worth standing in that long line. As the line started moving and we were halfway through, the signs said @NUM1 minutes. I told my dad that maybe we should come back another day. But my dad said we'd be through soon and told me to just watch the people on the ride go by and not talk.  We only moved up a little, and the time was still @NUM1 minutes. Then, my dad also said that maybe we should do this another day, and we left the line to find my mom and sister. In the end, we decided that the long wait wasn't worth it, and we could always try again another time.
1544	19535	7	2	I once had to be patient when my dad said he would send me a letter every @DATE1. He lives all the way in @LOCATION1, so it's too far for me to visit him. He told me I needed to be patient because I'm not usually the patient type.  To help myself be patient, I kept myself occupied. I wrote stars, drew pictures, read books, and went to a neighbor's house to help with the animals. When the time came for me to receive the letter, I didn't get it. There was some delay, like on @DATE2, so I had to wait even longer.  I've learned that to be patient, you just have to keep your mind focused on the thing you're waiting for. In this case, waiting for my dad's letters taught me the value of patience and how to make the most of the waiting time.
1545	19536	7	2	One time, I was extremely patient. It was @CAPS1, and my mom and I went shopping for presents. We went to the mall and entered Target. I already knew exactly what I wanted to get my brother, the new game @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1. It was the perfect gift. But my mom wouldn't let me buy it. So, I bought him a Target gift card worth @MONEY1 instead. I had to hide it for almost a month.  I was really curious about what my mom had gotten for my brother and me, but she wouldn't tell me. So, I had to be patient. When @CAPS1 finally arrived, I was incredibly surprised. My mom had bought @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1 for both my brother and me. In the end, my patience had led to a wonderful surprise, and I realized that waiting can sometimes bring great rewards.
1546	19537	7	2	My friend @PERSON1 showed remarkable patience as he waited for @NUM1 months for the Xbox @NUM2 game @CAPS1 v.s @CAPS2. Day after day, he quietly anticipated the arrival of the game. Then, one day after school, it finally arrived, fulfilling his long - awaited desire.
1547	19538	7	2	When I was four and my sister was two, I was playing basketball. My sister, who always wanted what I had, came up and grabbed the ball from me. As we were in the middle of the fight, my mom told me to stand and let her have the ball, saying she'd walk away. I patiently stood there and waited. Eventually, my sister got bored, dropped the ball, and left, just as my mom had predicted. When I resumed playing basketball, she ran up and took the ball again. So, I went inside and played video - games. This experience taught me that patience can sometimes resolve conflicts.
1548	19539	7	2	I went for a check - up related to my asthma. In the waiting room, there were many things to do while waiting for the doctor to call my name. I occupied myself with crossword puzzles, watched the fascinating fish of different kinds in the tank, and mostly read my book since I'm both a reader and a writer. When the doctor finally called my name, I was still engaged in these activities. He apologized for the long wait, and I told him it was fine. He saw all the things I'd been doing and said I was a very patient and nice girl. After that, I've always aimed to be more patient while waiting for others to receive good compliments, which make me happy. Whenever I see that doctor, he always gives me a treat or stickers. To me, it doesn't matter as long as I treat others fairly, as people will admire my patience.
1549	19540	7	2	My mom, @PERSON1, and I went to @ORGANIZATION1, and it was a really fun trip. I wanted a lot of things that my family couldn't afford, but my mom was incredibly patient. I'm always amazed at how naturally patient she is. The store was quite large, being two stories tall. I kept getting mad at her, which made her a bit angry, but even when she was really annoyed, she tried hard not to show it in the store. By the time we got home, I was so exhausted that I felt like I could sleep for two to three days. We got all the things we needed that night. The next day, we had to put up our nightstands. I really wanted my dad to put up our new bunk bed, but my mom said he might not have time. I was practically nagging my dad to do it. When it was time for bed, I was fed up, and my mom was mad at me because I wanted to sleep in the new bed that night. This experience made me realize how much patience my mom has.
1550	19541	7	2	On @DATE1, we drove to @LOCATION1. It was a long journey because the navigation took the long way to Six Flags and our hotel. Sitting in the car for almost a day was tough, but I tried not to complain and be patient. We got lost in @LOCATION1 for about an hour, driving up and down looking for our cousins who were also coming. I was so restless that I wanted to go outside and run and jump, but I had to be patient. It was @NUM1 in the morning, and I was tired. Finding our hotel seemed to take forever. When I was unpacking at the hotel, I realized I had been patient for almost a whole day, something I thought I'd never be able to do in a car. This was a significant experience that showed me my capacity for patience.
1551	19542	7	2	"Not long ago, I went to the pumpkin patch with my mother, sister, grandmother, aunt, uncle, my @NUM1 - year - old niece, and baby cousin. After our visit to the pumpkin patch, we went to a restaurant. We waited @NUM2 minutes for the waitress. When she finally approached us, she merely informed us that she would ""be with us."" We ended up waiting half an hour just to place our drink orders. Once we were finally able to order our food, it took an hour for it to arrive."
1552	19543	7	2	On Father's Day morning in @DATE1, I was patiently yet excitedly waiting for my little sister to arrive. I'm not a naturally patient person, so it was incredibly difficult for me to sit still. Waiting for my turn to hold her was a challenge, but when she was in my arms, it was the most amazing feeling I've ever experienced in my life. It's always tough having to leave her when she calls my name; it makes me want to cry. I don't always get to come home to a little girl saying my name, but I cherish every moment when I do. I patiently await the next time I can see her, though it's truly hard, as I'm sure you can understand.
1553	19544	7	2	"I had an @CAPS2 appointment at the @CAPS1's office. At the @CAPS2 office, I waited in the room for her to return. The @CAPS1 then asked me and my foster - mom some questions. After that, she left to find another @CAPS1 and had a conversation with him. They then came back and said, ""@CAPS4 you. Here are the papers you need."" The foster mom responded with, ""Ok, @CAPS4 you."" The @CAPS1 then told me, ""@CAPS4 you for being patient, @PERSON1. I appreciate that so much."" She also said, ""@CAPS5. I'll see you guys next time, ok."" We replied with a ""bye."
1554	19545	7	2	"Patient people are those who can tolerate the challenges of life. If one lacks patience, they won't fare well. I learned this valuable lesson when I was young. There was something I really wanted, and I was about to go out to get it. Just as I was about to leave the house, the phone rang. My @CAPS2 answered it and started saying things like, ""@CAPS1 oh hi @PERSON1 no not busy @CAPS6 did not! no!"" The conversation seemed to go on forever. With each passing minute, my patience wore thinner and thinner. Eventually, I burst out, ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3'@CAPS4 @CAPS5!"" My @CAPS6 told me to hold on, saying, ""I'm on the phone, I'm not gonna take you now!"" and then walked away. This incident clearly shows why patience is so important."
1555	19546	7	2	In the @DATE1 period, my mom planned a two - week trip for us to @LOCATION1. As we were on our way to the airport, we encountered heavy traffic and couldn't make much progress. My mom started yelling, but I told her to calm down and assured her that we would make it. Finally, we reached the airport. There were a large number of people there, so we had to rush. In the end, we managed to make it to the airport. Through this experience, I taught my mom that if you're patient, you'll reach your destination. And indeed, we finally made it to @LOCATION1.
1556	19547	7	2	One time, I demonstrated patience when I visited the dentist's office to have six teeth extracted. While waiting, I repeatedly asked my mom when we would proceed. When the staff called my name, I entered the room. I inquired if it would hurt, and they assured me I wouldn't feel a thing. The doctor placed a tube on my mouth, instructing me to close my eyes and breathe. Unknowingly, I fell asleep due to the gas and remained unconscious for two hours. When I attempted to leave the chair, they stopped me. I had to sit there until, after about @NUM1 minutes, they finally let me out. I was disoriented and had to be placed in a wheelchair. At the front desk, I was allowed to take two toys, and my mom gave me a wrestler figurine. As we were about to leave, my mom spoke with the doctor, and it took a long time. Once in the car, my mom returned the wheelchair, and we left. During the journey, my mom told me I couldn't go to school that day because of my teeth. She advised me not to look in the mirror, but I did, and my mouth looked a mess. I had to wait three hours before having food and drinks, so I was extremely thirsty. When she said I could eat, I was relieved. I'm still being patient because the doctor said my adult teeth would come in a few months, but it's been two years, and nothing has happened. I'm disappointed, but now I have to wait for my mom to take me to get braces, which I know will be very painful.
1557	19548	7	2	On a fine @DATE1 day, I was on my way to the @CAPS1 office. I wasn't happy about it and didn't want to arrive. However, we eventually reached the destination. Once inside, my mom went to the check - in counter, while I sat down. After she finished, she sat next to me, and we waited. We waited for approximately @NUM1 minutes until the @CAPS1 called us in. As soon as we entered the office, a nurse came in to check my temperature, heartbeat, etc. After she left, we continued to wait. We sat there for @NUM2 minutes before the @CAPS1 entered. Once the appointment was over, we checked out and left. Fortunately, @CAPS2 won't have to go there again.
1558	19549	7	2	When I was in the @NUM1 grade, I attempted to set up a mobile. Unfortunately, it broke. After that, we went to the park, where I had to wait for something (presumably a shuttle). Then, we went to an ice - making place. I had to stand in a line of people. When we arrived, we paid for our admission. After that, we started ice - skating. That was all we did that day. Then, we went back home to build our mobile model. We spent time both outside and inside the house. Overall, it was a day filled with various activities, some successful and some not.
1559	19550	7	2	"My friend and I were waiting to go on a new ride at the front of @CAPS1. It was a water ride called ""Cold Shooting the Cat"" (assuming that's what was meant). We waited for over @NUM1 hours. The wait was really boring. After the long wait, we finally got on the ride. Then, we went on the ""Cowrcscrowe"" (presumably a misspelling of a ride name), and it was a lot of fun. Despite the long and dull wait for the first ride, the overall experience was still enjoyable because of the second ride."
1560	19553	7	2	One early @TIME1 in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, I participated in a @ORGANIZATION1 skating competition. I was anxiously waiting to find out if I had qualified for the @DATE1 part of the event. It was seven in the @TIME1 when we left the rink. We went to grab a bite to eat and then returned to the rink. My best friend @PERSON1 was also competing in the same event. I was certain she would make it to the @DATE1, but I was unsure about myself. After an interminable wait, they were about to announce the names of those who had made it. I kept repeating my assigned number in my head. They called @PERSON1's number, but my number was never called. I didn't make it to the @DATE1 part of the competition. I was deeply disappointed, but there was nothing I could do about the outcome. I'll just have to work harder for the next competition.
1561	19554	7	2	@CAPS1 plays a significant role in life. Facing problems and obstacles can shape one into a better person. Having @CAPS1 means persevering through a long - process task. For instance, I always need @CAPS1 when engaging in activities like football and hockey. Generally, adults tend to possess more @CAPS1 than teenagers such as myself. For example, my father can sit in a blind all day, which is something I rarely do. As I grow into an adult, I hope to have a greater amount of @CAPS1 and be able to sit with my father in the blind all day. I must admit that I'm improving in terms of @CAPS1 because my dad constantly preaches about it. I hope that when I'm fully grown, I'll have good @CAPS1 like my dad.
1562	19555	7	2	"Honestly, I'm not a very patient person, but there was once when I was, though I'm not sure how. I was in line to pay for a pair of earphones. I adored those blue earphones as blue is my favorite color. I waited for @NUM1 minutes, then @NUM2, and eventually lost track of time, but I knew it was a long wait. The cashiers were having issues with the registers, so I had to wait longer. People came to fix the registers, and I had to wait even more. I estimate I stayed in that line for over an hour. Despite loving the earphones, I just couldn't wait any longer. I said "" @CAPS1 "", put the earphones aside, and left the store. I was extremely angry that day. Two weeks later, when we returned, luckily, the earphones were right where I'd left them. It was such a relief! This experience shows that my lack of patience almost made me miss out on something I really wanted, but fortune smiled on me in the end."
1563	19556	7	2	"One day, my mom demonstrated remarkable patience. We were outside chatting when my grandparents called and invited us to their house. My mom readily agreed. I went to pack some things as their house didn't have what we needed. We got in the car, turned on the radio, and everything seemed fine at first. However, after five minutes, there was a traffic jam in our suburb. I was okay until I received a text saying my cousins were at my grandparents' and they were going to play football in @NUM1 minutes. The cousin asked when I'd arrive, and I replied that I didn't know. My brother was already there as he'd spent @TIME1 there. It was a frustrating @TIME1. I kept screaming at my mom to go faster, but she ignored me, as if my words went in one ear and out the other. When I realized I might miss the football game, I decided to ignore her, but that didn't work as she didn't talk. I fell asleep at @NUM2. I thought I'd be asleep for ages, but I woke up at @NUM3 in the same spot and was devastated. I yelled out the window in frustration. Then I went back to sleep. While sleeping, I felt the car speed up as the traffic had cleared, but when we turned a corner, we got stuck in traffic again. I asked my mom how much longer, and when she didn't reply, I screamed the question again. She finally yelled back ""here"". I looked out the window and we'd arrived. I got to play football, and later I heard my mom laughing in the house. I'm still not sure why she didn't talk; maybe she was just focused on seeing her parents. This incident was a clear display of my mom's patience in contrast to my impatience."
1564	19557	7	2	"A while back, my friends and I created a @CAPS2 game called ""@CAPS1 n go @CAPS2"". I took up a great sniping position with a good angle in all but one direction. The advantage of this spot was that most players walked past it, so I thought it wouldn't require much patience. I was wrong. I ended up waiting over twenty minutes before I saw a player. I aimed my weapon and fired. According to the rules, the player was now on my team and under my command. After waiting for some time, another player approached. My partner stood up to fire at the player but got shot. He didn't notice me as I crawled away, so I was safe. The problem was that I needed a new place to @CAPS1, and I quickly found one. Once again, I waited for over twenty minutes. When I finally saw another player and reached for my weapon, the person was gone. I was extremely angry because I'd waited so long and still had no one on my team. I got up to look for teammates. I was losing my patience and getting frustrated. I whispered, ""@CAPS7 anyone even out here?"" Suddenly, someone shouted from above, ""@CAPS8! I got you @CAPS9!"". Then @PERSON1 jumped down from a tree. He said he'd been watching me the whole time, waiting patiently to shoot each person one by one. This experience taught me that patience is a crucial element in this game."
1565	19558	7	2	One time, I was eager to get a cool @CAPS1 game. It seemed so awesome. My mom said we'd get it on Friday. It was @DATE1, and I was really looking forward to her getting off work. When she got home, she said we'd go on Saturday. I was a bit annoyed at first, but then I thought it didn't really matter. Eventually, we got the game on the next Saturday. I couldn't believe that I'd been patient throughout the wait. This shows that sometimes, even though we're eager for something, we can exercise patience and still get what we want.
1566	19559	7	2	One of the most patient people in my life is my mother. My mother demonstrates patience through her consistent actions. She regularly drives me to soccer events, practice sessions, to meet friends, and to other necessary places. Financially, she invests in our soccer activities, hobbies, and provides for our needs and occasional wants. When we are sad or angry, she is always kind and spends a great deal of time taking care of us. In terms of academics, whenever we face trouble in school, she helps us study. For instance, she spends @MONEY1 on our sports annually, not including additional expenses like gear, uniforms, and team - related items. She also dedicates about an hour to driving my brother and me to cross - country, soccer, and basketball events. When I needed help with a test, she stayed with me for exactly @NUM1 hours. Even when I perform poorly in school, she encourages me to do better, though she is a bit disappointed as she wants me to succeed. Moreover, she supports my choice of being a vegetarian, which means she has to prepare two different meals. In conclusion, my mother is truly one of the most patient people I know.
1567	19561	7	2	A notable time when my mother showed patience was during her job - hunting period. My mother is extremely busy. She served as the president of a club named @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 for approximately one or two years. Although she is no longer the president, she still holds an important position that demands a significant amount of work. However, the income from this position was not sufficient. So, she decided to look for an additional job. She began her search online and in newspapers. Despite facing difficulties in finding a suitable job, she never complained. She persevered in her search for about another year. Finally, she landed a job at @CAPS3.C.C., where she now teaches a computer class for college students or older individuals. Had she given up easily, she might have ended up with a job she didn't enjoy. This experience clearly showcases my mother's patience.
1568	19562	7	2	"I have a strong dislike for weddings. While I'm happy when people get married, I find the ceremonies incredibly boring, especially the @CAPS18 long ones where people just stand around for about two hours doing nothing. I'm not a very patient person, which is probably why I can't stand long weddings. One day, when @CAPS4 mother told me we had to go to @PERSON1's wedding, I moaned, ""Do we have to go?"" She replied, ""@CAPS1, it's @PERSON1's wedding and it's important."" Reluctantly, I put on @CAPS4 new dress and got in the car. The wedding was in @LOCATION1. Usually, it takes only an hour to get there, but this time, our family was only about a quarter of the way there when we got stuck in a major traffic jam. @CAPS4 sister yelled, ""Come on!"" I kept quiet. After the traffic jam cleared, we faced another problem: the road we needed to take was closed. So much for taking the short route. We had just entered the town next to @LOCATION1 when @CAPS4 grandma called. @CAPS4 mom answered, ""Hello?"" @CAPS4 grandma said, ""Where are you? The ceremony just ended."" @CAPS4 mom replied, ""Oh no. That's bad. We're in @LOCATION2. Why? Has the reception started yet?"" @CAPS4 grandma said, ""No, but I'm sure you'll make it in time."" @CAPS4 mom said, ""That's good. Thanks."" Finally, we reached the reception. I was so glad to be there, even though I hate weddings. When we got home, @CAPS4 mom asked, ""Did you have patience?"" I asked, ""Patience?"" Then I said, ""Yes, I guess I did. Even the car ride was kind of okay."" @CAPS4 mom said, ""Really? You're not usually the patient type."" I replied, ""Yes,"" and I felt proud of myself."
1569	19563	7	2	A few weeks ago, we held a garage sale and a mom - to - mom sale. I had to exercise patience because of the customers driving by during the mom - to - mom sale and while waiting for people to visit our table. At the garage sale, I also had a lemonade stand. Overall, we made a good amount of money from both sales. However, we still had some items left over that we had to take home and donate. The sales were enjoyable, but we had to put in a lot of work. We had to price all the items and then wait for customers. Sometimes, I was happy when people bought our stuff. We really had a great time organizing the mom - to - mom sale and the garage sale. I believe we did a pretty good job. Although we sold a lot, there were still some items that we needed to pack up and donate. Despite the hard work, I really liked being part of these sales. In conclusion, the experience was both challenging and rewarding.
